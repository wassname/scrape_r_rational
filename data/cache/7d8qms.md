  Am I lost, or did we just skip the second half of that Endbringer fight?

    Yes.

  I like this chapter in a vacuum but it feels out of place after the last cliffhanger.

  So why didn't Taylor immediately portal away when she was released and stayed to talk to her torturer? 

  Also, please explain Alexandria's reasoning here. Is she confident that she has successfully broken/intimidated Taylor beyond any thought of resistance? Does she believe Taylor is going to just accept needs-of-many/needs-of-few spiel when she is the one sacrificed and in such a disproportional way too? 

  I presume Alexandria's goal is to have reliable long term access to Taylor's powers, and not just blindly enforcing her authority, and I can't see any way for all this to make sense. Taylor is powerful enough that you either have to convince her to cooperate nicely, or mind control her permanently, because otherwise she can escape beyond your reach the moment you look away.

  Unless Contessa, of course. Please let it not be Contessa.

    There's no need for elaborate explanations. Most people who matter would agree that she did the right thing. Taylor included if they had anybody good at profiling vet the plan. People forget endbringers are a bigger deal than WW2 was, she's basically Patton on D-day level untouchable unless and until she's shown breeding new endbringers.

      Agree with what? That risking herself attacking the Simurgh was a bad idea? If she agreed, she would not have done so in the first place.

        I assume whatever she believes now "everyone will take me seriously once I defeat this endbringer on my own" isn't on top of the list.   

        > Taylor is going to just accept needs-of-many/needs-of-few spiel when she is the one sacrificed and in such a disproportional way too? 

        They had her run rescue missions. Admittedly, plus points for irony if Taylor Hebert turns out to be the character who complains of forcing people to cooperate under duress when innocent lives are at stake but if they can't play mind games well enough to make a lonely teenagers think "She only hurts me because she loves me" I'd consider that implausible as well. 

        >Taylor is powerful enough that you either have to convince her to cooperate nicely, or mind control her permanently, because otherwise she can escape beyond your reach the moment you look away.

        She's slightly more powerful than Vista was. Slightly less than Labyrinth was  after they figured out the portal trick. So she's going to swear eternal vengeance on Alexandria and the Protectorate? Accord still works for Cauldron.

      Honestly, this is not a positive argument for the cause of saving Wormverse.

      This is the sort of shit that would make me plan the destruction of the universe, if I was in a position to do so.

      Alexandria, when it really really matters is exactly the time when you _don't_ defect. ^You ^imbecile. ^^You ^^fucking ^^moron.

      There are two things you can be: somebody who cooperates out of incentive, or somebody who cooperates out of principle. One of those gets cooperation in a bounded-horizon pd, and one doesn't. But eh, you'll discover that on your own.

        Last I checked Alexandria's goal wasn't to save the Wormverse. It was keeping enough capes alive on earth Bet so that on the day Scion turns he exhausts himself fighting a single world and only destroys 95% of the rest.

        Besides it's not like PRT directors would agree to anything other than "administering harsh discipline to a teen cape that broke rank and put herself at unacceptable risk of Simurgh influence." And on the flip side no supervillain is going to start skipping endbringer fights because a dumb teen got scolded without visible injury or having her identity revealed. 

        It's like beating a kid with a phonebook so as not to leave visible bruises. They aren't there to see her collapse in the aftermath and so nobody is going to challenge Alexandria on this given she's gotten away with similar before.

  You know what Taylor needs?  A pair of clones.  Each Endbringer fight, they could just rock-paper-scissors to see which of them gets to fight the Endbringer, which focuses on civilian evacuations, and which stays out of the fight altogether (just in case).

  With corporate backing, Taylor could probably leverage an impressive amount of money to throw at such a project.  Maybe Blasto + Cranial could do it?  Then, to make sure no hidden commands have been implemented, Taylor could pay for a Thinker consultation or something.  The Taylors would have to deal with personality drift if multiple instances survive long-term, but it's not like that's an insurmountable problem.

  It really is too bad Blasto is a villain.
