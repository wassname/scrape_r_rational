  >Sure, odds were good that every single member of my Peerage – even Ivah – would turn on me in a heartbeat if their oaths allowed for it, but for all that there was a simplicity to the proceedings that I enjoyed. 

  This just reinforces how vulnerable this whole Drow system is. Take out the oaths and the Drow turn on Cat, which she probably will not survive. And she doesn't think that this critical point is going to fail at the worst possible moment? If not here, then the moment she faces heroic opposition.

  >I was dealing with other warlords, and even before I’d stolen Crepuscular from Akua’s mind

  Speaking of, I feel like there lots of useful skills and knowledge to take from Akua. Magic, history, diplomacy, and so on. All of the blind spots that she's complaining about here that Akua had tutors to instruct her in.

  > Most of those had come from Great Lotow, reluctantly bending the knee after wandering around the outskirts of Arcadia for a while and finding no way out save the one I’d offered. Slaus and Sagas had been the first to fold, remaining where I’d left them and taking the oaths after a single day. The others trickled into my service over the following week as my sigil settled our other affairs in the city. Nodoi and Vasyl had held out for three and five days, respectively, finding no trouble living off the land but no way back to the Everdark either. By then I’d already bullied  Losle and Zarkan into oath-taking after a few demonstrations of how dangerous living in places with only one entrance and exit could be when that space could be closed off by gate. Kanya and Soln had refused the longest, the full seven days, and they’d only changed their minds after Mighty Orelik vanished without a trace. 

  Wait, what?

  These seven demigods wandered around Arcadia for anywhere from a single day to a single week, couldn't find an easy way out, and so *sold themselves into slavery*?

  Huh?

  What was even dangerous to them? The cold? The fae? Will spent six months running from the Wild Hunt back in Arcadia back in book one, then left under his own power. Black was using this for fast travel in book 2, before again leaving under his own power. These guys could crush a dozen Wills or Blacks without even noticing. Did the Drow get homesick?

  Seriously, we jump from chapter 66 when these guys are vowing that they will never bow down, that they will kill Cat for what she's done... and then 24 hours later they're signing away their autonomy so they can fight and die in Cat's slave army?

  I notice that I am confused.

    ```
    you have to look at it from the drow's perspective: you believe you're a demigod (and like you said, urulan was a tough fight for cat who *is* a demigod).  cat comes and with a *completely* unknown way, transports you to a land you know nothing about and you can't escape with your powers.  this might be enough for a few of them who believe might makes right and only look after themselves, but maybe you hold out.  then, one of your peers, who you likely would not want to fight solo, **disappears.**  no plotting, no attack ***fucking disappears.*** 

    the mighty signing on totally fits with their culture and should not really be too surprising.  you mention in another comment that it's most likely that orelik escaped instead of getting killed but even if that was the case, is that what the trapped mighty would think? no, they look down on each other but still respect their ability so *obviously* it was worst case scenario.

    e:minor wording changes.
    ```

    - u/Agnoman:
      ```
      >cat comes and with a completely unknown way, transports you to a land you know nothing about and you can't escape with your powers.

      This assumes that the Drow don't know that Arcadia, or gates to it, exist. Which is a weird assumption when all the knowledge since the fall of the Drow empire is freely floating around in the Night, and Arcadia was most definitely still a thing back then. They just didn't know Cat could make portals to Arcadia, going in, because why would they?

      > one of your peers, who you likely would not want to fight solo, disappears. no plotting, no attack fucking disappears.

      For one, you're making assumptions about what went down with Orelik, when the sum total we know about it is one throwaway line.

      For another, Mighty were surrendering well before that Orelik vanished. Slaus and Sagas gave in within a single day, deciding to sign away their eternal lives to Cat's slave army. Note that theire immediate reaction to being transported to Arcadia by an unknown power wasn't fear or dread, but a resounding "fuck you".

      > is that what the trapped mighty would think? no, they look down on each other but still respect their ability so obviously it was worst case scenario.

      They respect each other's ability, so obviously one of them got killed? Sorry, I'm  really not following what you're trying to say here.

        >This assumes that the Drow don't know that Arcadia, or gates to it, exist.

        Those permanent gates that William used were in the Waning Woods, which are supposed to be uniquely connected to the fae. They form Callow's southern border and are apparently the cause of some bizarre weather patterns:

         'The lands between Helike and Atalante were known for the occasional bouts of week-long rain and storms, blown south from the Waning Woods and the madness that passed for nature over there. The Fae toyed with the winds and the sky the way men did with their clothes, and the farms beneath them paid the price.'

        -Prologue Book 3.

        “There must be several gates, then, spread across the Waning Woods,” Masego replied, tone enthusiastic. “Few of them have the ability to actually cross from Arcadia into Creation.”

        -Chapter 25: Wake.

          And?

          I appreciate you providing quotes, but you've missed the point of what I was saying.

          ~~you~~ (Edit:XeL09) said:

          >cat comes and with a completely unknown way, transports you to a land you know nothing

          which has two claims in it.

          First, that the Drow have no knowledge of how Cat transported them to Arcadia (ie through a gate). And second, that they know nothing about Arcadia.

          Neither of these things are evidenced to be true, and are likely not. That's what I was responding to. Again:

          >all the knowledge since the fall of the Drow empire is freely floating around in the Night, and Arcadia was most definitely still a thing back then.

            - u/Agnoman:
              ```
              To be fair, apparently the Drow spent less than a day looking for a way out before they reconsidered signing on with Cat. Which is, uh, not really what I'd call trying hard.

              If they were going to get out, I think a better exit would have been a fae who can open a temporary gate, but there's a point I raised elsewhere - why would the Drow even *want* to go back to the Everdark? 

              That place sucks, it's about to be overrun with dwarves, and it means joining Cat's slave army where they're constantly under the threat of death and are about to fight their way to Sve Noc herself. Arcadia, on the other hand, is full of Fae to harvest, doesn't have dwarves or Dead Kings, and lets them keep their autonomy.

                This really is weird. 

                >why would the Drow even want to go back to the Everdark? 

                I never thought of this but you're right, why wouldn't they use Arcadia to travel to another part of Calernia and harvest Night without having to go through the Kingdom of the Dead, the Golden Bloom or the Chain of Hunger? Adding to the Night is a sacred task after all. 

                In reality of course they'd be killed by heroes in short order. Ancient monsters escaped from their underground realm feasting on innocents? That's one strong story especially if the Heavenly Light is as effective as I think it will be against the Night. But they wouldn't know that and even if they did they'd probably be arrogant enough to try it anyway.
                ```

                I think this has to do with culture shock. The vast majority of Drow have never left the Underdark. The outside is where the *weak* go. They couldn't "find a way out" because they have have no frame of reference to. Additionally these are not people who *learn* things, they *take secrets*. You've expecting them to act like scientific-rational!Drow, but harvesting Night is the be-all-end-all of society and it is extremely anti-intellectual. To misquote the philosopher Homer "[Night], the solution to and cause of all of life's problems".

                  >Additionally these are not people who learn things, they take secrets. 

                  Drow can very explicitly take Night from non-Drow:

                  >I want to be perfectly clear, here,” I said. “If you kill humans, or any other race. It grows the Night?”

                  >“That is so,” the drow reverently said. “All is one. All is strife. The worthy rise.”

                  This is, in fact, seen as a sacred task.

                Are you familiar with the term 'Race to the Bottom'?

                >Sve Noc ~~herself~~

                itself

                > Arcadia, on the other hand, is full of Fae to harvest

                You're following Cat's uneducated assumptions with this point. Even assuming Cat is correct, we don't know the conversion rate of non-Night death to Night or the Drow risk-benefit analysis going on here. We do know that the 'Splendid' are not considered cattle.
                ```

                - u/Agnoman:
                  ```
                  >Are you familiar with the term 'Race to the Bottom'?

                  Yes, but it also doesn't apply here?

                  A 'Race to the Bottom' implies states compete with each other by cutting taxes / business  lowering prices /wahteer in order to attract people towards  them, but at the cost of lowering living standards/product quality/working conditions/etc. and making everyone worse off.

                  Even if you take the logic of the situation at face value this isn't a race to the bottom, because this isn't a competition trying to attract individuals with positive qualities. This is Cat trying to enslave 7 demigods by dropping them in the wilderness, and then a day later they go "fiiine, I'll sign whatever you want" without actually looking around for a way out.

                  How do you relate the 'race to  the bottom' with the drow only looking around for a day before deciding that escape is impossible and they want to sign onto be Cat's slaves?

                  >itself

                  Right, thanks. Alien culture and all, I'm finding it easy to get tripped up by the "Priestess" of the Night.

                  >You're following Cat's uneducated assumptions with this point.

                  I'm really not. I'm following Ivah's highly educated knowledge:

                  >Killing cattle,” I said. “Taking it. What does it do for you?”

                  >“The Night grows,” Ivah smiled. “To do such sacred act would redeem any disgrace.”

                  >“I want to be perfectly clear, here,” I said. **“If you kill humans, or any other race. It grows the Night?”**

                  >**“That is so,” the drow reverently said. “All is one. All is strife. The worthy rise.”**

                  >I sucked at my lip.

                  >“Killing undead,” I said. “Would it also grow the Night?”

                  >The drow paled.

                  >“Speak not of the Hidden Horror,” Ivah whispered. “For its crown is dawn, and that pale light is the end of all things. Only the mad would enter the eye of the Host of Death.”

                  >“It does, doesn’t it,” I said. “The necromancy that keeps its army walking, you can claim it for the Night.

                  You see?

                  >We do know that the 'Splendid' are not considered cattle.

                  This is a function of their power, not their worth. Mighty aren't cattle either, but they can be harvested just fine. If there's some exception to the fae for night purposes, then it's not explained or hinted at anywhere in the text.

                  And it's still not an issue? Do you think the Drow said "Oh no, even after I casually kill fae, I can't harvest Night - I'd better sell myself into eternal slavery where I can't harvest Night freely anyway".

          Yeah, sure, the fae find them...but what are the far going to do to them that's worse than  being enslaved permanently into Cat's army, losing the ability to make decisions of their own under pain of death,and being the backbone of an army pointed first at Sve Noc, then at the rest of the continent?

          Even if the seven of them weren't close to the top of the food chain, which they are, it'd be a decision of questionable intelligence.

    Will was backed by a choir, and Black had Warlock. Both were prepared for the journey. The drow have none of that.

    Orelik disappearing almost assuredly means he died, which tells the Drow that they're not top dog here. If whatever lives there can take one of them out without any of the others knowing, then they can do the same to any of them.

    It's a matter of survival.
    ```

    - u/Agnoman:
      ```
      >Orelik disappearing almost assuredly means he died

      I think it's more likely he *escaped*, really.

      We all saw how powerful Urulan was, right? It was the weakest of the bunch, and it nearly killed Cat several times. There were nine of these guys, all stronger than Urulan - what do you think killed one of them? We've seen the full gamut of fae, and unless it ran into the Summer Queen / Winter King (whatever they're called now), it would have been fine. These guys could have taken the Sovereign of Moonless Nights in a fight, are you telling me some Winter schmuck got the drop on them?

      Hell, a powerful fae would have been its ticket out of Arcadia.

      What could they have run into that made signing up for Cat's slave army for all eternity and fighting and dying against the strongest threats in the Everdark a good idea?
      ```

      - u/tavitavarus:
        ```
        I don't think the fae's performance in Book 3 is an accurate depiction of their combat power. Remember, fae nobles contain immense power. 

        The Duke of Violent Squalls was called a lesser god. Masego told Cat that if he crossed into Creation in his full power he could quite possibly conquer Callow single handed. Every fae noble killed by the Woe and the Legions was either in Creation (and had surrendered most of their power to cross the boundary) or fighting a Named with a strong narrative advantage in Arcadia, where stories are much more important than anything else.

        The Mighty, for all their strengths, are not Named. They lack the advantages that come with a Name. They lack narrative weight, unnatural instincts and the way powerful Named warp the people and the world around them. Against fae their only tool would be the Night, which is formidable, but the fae would be able to wield their full power against them within Arcadia. The Mighty also have no idea how to leverage narrative or avoid dangerous stories. They would easily fall into traps by behaving like the Evil creatures they are.

    ```
    Yeah, this is kind of weird. If anything, it would have made more sense for Cat to swear the weakest Mighty to her, and use them to gang up on the stronger ones one by one using portals to separate them.

    Or use Arcadia time schenanigans so that they have to spend months living in the wild, slowly being ground down, with no news from their Sigil, while only a few hours pass in the physical world.

      >Yeah, this is kind of weird. If anything, it would have made more sense for Cat to swear the weakest Mighty to her, and use them to gang up on the stronger ones one by one using portals to separate them.

      Yeah, a slow build up tipping into an avalanche would have made much more sense to me than all the Drow deciding that, no actually, being Cat's eternal slave under threat of death in an army pointed at Sve Noc sounds quite nice.

      >Or use Arcadia time schenanigans so that they have to spend months living in the wild, slowly being ground down, with no news from their Sigil, while only a few hours pass in the physical world.

      Maybe this is what happened? If so, it was very poorly communicated and doesn't really jibe with the description we got.

      I'm also not sure it would have made much difference if they were there for that long? Like, what's threatening them in Arcadia? A guy noted as weaker than any of them was almost a match for the Queen of Air and Darkness herself, and there were *seven* of them. What was going to threaten them?

      We've got a good idea of the power level associated with a Duchy, with the Duke of Violent Squalls and our very own (former) Duchess of Moonless Nights, and it seems pretty clear that any one of the seven Mighty could have won such a fight alone. And if they'd run into such a fae, well, that's their ride home. That's how Black and Warlock got in and out of Arcadia back in book 2.

      Hell, why did they even want to go back to the Everdark? That place sucks, it's about to be overrun with dwarves, and it means joining Cat's slave army and fighting their way to Sve Noc herself. Arcadia, on the other hand, is full of Fae to harvest, doesn't have dwarves or Dead Kings, and lets them keep their autonomy.

        Is this what they see off the bat though? Or are they more like Ivah, seeing another up and coming Sigil, albeit with weird rules. It only dawns on them later that they're successfully fighting against all of the other Drow. 

        This is a society taught to praise strength above all. When Cat comes in with a great show of force, the first inclination is to cozy up to her to barter or take. And if submission is necessary then they might as well get it over with than risk angering their betters. You don't become Mighty by fighting injustice.

          >It only dawns on them later that they're successfully fighting against all of the other Drow.

          This seems like it would be quite dumb of the Drow, when Cat has already explained how she's heading to see Sve Noc, and has just shown them the methods she's going to be using. Add to that tht conquering the Everdark and jostling for better positions is the default stance of Sigil-Holders and, well, I don't see how they could have missed it.


          >When Cat comes in with a great show of force


          But that show off force is locking them away from Arcadia, where they're stronger than 99% of the natives, aren't concerned with environemtal hazards, don't have to deal with the dwarves or the Dead King or the Ratlings,  don't have to spearhead an army pointed at bigger and badder drow than them, and they don't have to swear binding oaths which permanently restricts their behaviour under the threat of death. Weigh up the costs and the benefits, and joining the slave -army doesn't seem like a great idea.

          What on earth made them start giving up after 24 hours and sell themselves into slavery? Was it the health benefits of Cat's army?

          >the first inclination is to cozy up to her to barter or take

          Again, this is not a regular deal. The Drow had the terms and coniditons of cat's oaths, which are fairly all encompassing, signs away most of their free will, and could lead to their deaths at any given moment. Their reaction to this idea in chapter 66 was pretty telling.

          But with the amazing, awe-inspiring ability to send them to *Arcadia*, where almost nothing poses a danger to them... made them give up in 24 hours? Even before whatever happened with Orelik happened?

            Why would any of that matter to the Drows?  Ivah already explained in his interlude that Cat is only following Drow rules.  To them following the weird rules and whims of their ruler is the norm, and even the oaths isn't any different from a powerful and rare secret that only Cat has.

              Why would any of them want to follow Cat to death? A weird secret that can remove all of your free will is something to gtfo from.

              Slavery is acceptable in Drow culture, sure. But the thing is, *none of the Mighty want to be slaves.*

              We both remember the reaction they had to Cats terms back in  66, right? The Drow weren't having any of it.

              And then a day later they charge get their minds and jump headfirst into a really shitty situation, without much of a good reason given.

        > is full of Fae to harvest

        You cannot harvest a fae, only other Night holders.  Growing the Night is a different thing from harvest the Night; the former adds new knowledge/experience to it by fighting, the later just redistributes the Nights around.

        Well, the Everdark is where their seat of power, and presumably all their earthly comforts, are. But yeah.

        - u/Agnoman:

          They're not getting access to either their power or their earthly comforts by signing on with Cat, that's for sure.
          ```

            They *are* getting their sigils back
            ```

            - u/Agnoman:
              ```
              They're getting their sigils folded into Cat's army, giving up control of them, and signing over their right to make deicsions for both themselves and their sigil in exchange for the constant threat of an icy death.

              This does not seem like a move which increases their power.
              ```

    The Drow aren't welcome by the Fae in Arcadia, meaning they'd be hunted for sport there if they stayed. Working for Cat was the alternative to certain death.
    ```

    - u/Agnoman:
      ```
      The Drow being hunted by the Fae is something that would go poorly... for the Fae. We got a whole book showing off the power of the Fae, and most of it was unimpressive compared to one random Drow who was weaker then the seven guys here.
      ```

  - u/TideofKhatanga:
    ```
    I don't think the drow are nearly as good as Cat sell them. She just got shit at fighting ever since she became unburdened by mortality. She doesn't even dodge attacks nowadays. And maybe there's some bullshit going on with Sve Noc's domain too, but that's secondary to Cat becoming really complacent.

    Seriously, Cat froze a city once, and that was before ascending. The higher ranked Fae routinely pulped mountains and torched armies. The Mighty? The dwarves hunt them with ballistae ffs.

    Remember the previous Black Knight? He could destroy monuments by willing it so. He got killed by a conscript.

  Drows feel increasingly like a game of Tokyo Jungle.

- u/MasterCrab:
  ```
  Is Catherine still in contact with the wild hunt or are they busy helping Juniper? They would probably be incredibly useful.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  She should call her Drow the Moonless Knights.
