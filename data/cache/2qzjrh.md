  That hoothoot... *damn* that's a grim way to go.

  You are the master of an emotional rollercoaster. I was like "Oh sh*t it's Zapdos... No, wait, this is just regular Pokemon... No, wait, they can be screwed by regular wild Pokemons here".
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Haha. Good to hear :) I was a bit worried about people's reactions to it not being Zapdos, and am glad I made up for whatever disappointment might have resulted.

  Totally uploaded this before the month ended, for the record: FF just didn't update on time :)  Enjoy!

  Leaf is the type to run away or avoid problems, interesting. I like how we are now seeing more fleshing out to the trio, making them even more distinct from each other. I am eagerly anticipating the next episode, keep up the great work.

    Thanks, glad you're enjoying it :)

  Haven't mantained an active participation in the threads like I would have liked(also, sorry for not continuing the feedback regarding the scientific job ladder discussion of some chapters ago), but I can't ignore this chance to tell you how much I've been adoring this work. You've really been managing to mantain the tension of Viridian forest while building slowly on the mythology and role of the species in a way I've been finding extremely gratifying. It really cements your work as a reconstruction instead of a deconstruction.

  I've always taken a relatively pragmatistic approach to the Pokémon mythology and tried to avoid thinking about it in common western tropes terms, so the heavy portrayal of Zapdos as more of a force of nature than a usual 'god' really does help in making it turn intoa  believable setting.

  Another point I wanted to ask, as you've been more or less developing Pokémon and their utility alongside the society besides just justifying their functions in battles, is whether you're thinking of exploring the more 'social' consequences of relatively smart and capable animals, such as in [this famous and adorable comic](http://shavostars.tumblr.com/post/92053199341/i-think-about-pokemon-in-non-battle-situations-a) or just keep the story more constrained to battles for now?

  Am I the only one getting errors trying to read this?

  On mobile, BTW.

    ```
    No, can't read this on pc either.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Think it's working now. Try again?
      ```

      - u/Lethalmud:
        ```
        Yes! thank you!
        ```

      - u/failed_novelty:
        ```
        Yup! Thanks!

  ```
  Why is Leaf concealing the fate of Hoothoot from Red?
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    She's worried about his guilt and recriminations over something he won't be able to do anything about, and thinks it's not something that he needs to know right now.

    I usually refrain from upvoting comments in my own threads, but I am doing so to yours to offset whoever downvoted you, since I don't think you've said anything downvote-worthy at all.
    ```

  - u/throwaway234609:
    ```
    Are you seriously asking why she's not telling a seriously injured friend of hers that his pokemon has died? The situation is bad enough already, news like that can wait until they're safe
    ```

    - u/RMcD94:
      ```
      Hardly making the loss any better by delaying it, especially if he's going to be thinking about his plans all evening.

      As well considering he just caught it it's not like he's that attached in terms of emotional impact, as well as I would hope these characters realize that you simply don't withhold information because you know better than the other character. I'm sure if Red was asked whether she should keep information which he explicitly asked her for (aware that it could be a death) from him.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Yes, if he was aware of it, he would prefer to know.
        ```

- u/FeepingCreature:
  ```
  So what happened to the Pichu?
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    The other 'chu got it free and its mother carried it off.
    ```

- u/1337_w0n:
  ```
  If I had to summarize the end in one word, it would be: "ew."
  Also, I need to start writing my predictions down.
  ```

  - u/liamash3:
    ```
    Indeed. Who knew the horrors that can occur with damaged matter reconstruction?
    ```
