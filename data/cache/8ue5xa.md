  In case you've missed it, Ward (aka Parahumans 2, Worm's sequel) is still around, though it's been a while since anyone mentioned it.

  The last chapter, told from Kenzie's POV, is both the longest and one of the most intense that Wildbow has ever published. As always, trigger warnings for various forms of domestic abuse apply.

    Thanks for posting! I found it really hard to get into Ward, but maybe if a later chapter grabs me I can get there.

      It's been a bit of a slog.  Ward is getting better as it comes into focus.  It's just not as intense and the premise of heroes  and villains still bothering to use the elaborate costumes post apocalypse feels a bit contrived.

      Though the story seems to be heading towards the final collapse of that system.
