## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Are there any good retellings of stories from the perspective of the villain, but made sympathetic and good and reasonable? Maybe set in alternate continuities, or else alleging that the originals were told from the perspective of a *very* biased narrator? This seems like a pretty straightforward premise but I don't see it too often in fanfiction.

  The best example that I know of would be [Twisted: The Untold Story of a Royal Vizier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-77cUxba-aA), which I believe I've recommended here before and would be happy to recommend again. To quote the YouTube blurb:

  > Long ago in a Magic Kingdom, one misunderstood Royal Vizier will go on a quest to save his city from its bumbling sultan, an invading prince, and the most notorious thief to ever live! With the help of the Kingdom's free-spirited, teenage Princess, the Vizier must find a magical lamp containing a wish-granting Djinn (who's really funny, by the way) and defeat the city's most-wanted criminal... Aladdin!

  (mild spoiler for the above, unrelated to the main plot but a nice surprise: >!the other Disney villains [have a song in there too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-77cUxba-aA&feature=youtu.be&t=5831) -- any of *their* stories fleshed out would also have been welcome!<)

  (*Wicked* could also qualify, maybe)

  I feel that "rational/ist" fiction would be especially appropriate here, since often villain characters are already written to be methodical and ruthlessly calculating (e.g. Danzō from Naruto).

    The Last Ringbearer seems to fit your criteria. It's a 1999 published Russian novel/sequel of LotR from the perspective of the orcs. Elves are eternal, unchanging oppressors while orcs are designing new technologies and undergoing a industrial revolution. Got released free once copyright laws started applying to Russia. 

    I bounced off it from translation and political issues, but others might find it good.  It is arguably a precursor of rational fiction in that the whole story tries to take an existing fantasy world and retrofit it into realism.

    *Phantom*, by Susan Kay, re-tells *The Phantom of the Opera* from the perspective of the titular character.  I don't think the continuity lines up (it's trying to walk a tightrope between the novel and the Broadway musical), so this would probably fall under "alternate continuity."

    If you like musicals, *Into the Woods* isn't from the perspective of any of the villains, but it paints both them and the protagonists with a more complicated brush than "one side good, one side evil."

    If you like *Wicked* (the novel, not the musical; they're for very different tastes), Gregory Maguire has written other retellings of classic fairytales (*Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister* (Cinderella), *Mirror, Mirror* (Snow White)).

    There's the juvenile but funny "The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs!" which might not fit but is still worth checking out.

    *The Mists of Avalon* is Arthurian legend from Morgan Le Fay's perspective.

    Those are the ones that immediately come to mind, but for more examples (TVTropes warning):

        I liked the first a lot, but the reviews of the second make it sound pretty meh. I think I've decided not to see it so as not to taint the first by association. In particular it sounds like they butcher the magic system via over explanation, a system I kind of liked in Maleficent for its vagueness yet sense of having a hidden logical structure behind it.

    > Twisted: The Untold Story of a Royal Vizier

    I finally got around to watching this and it was... okay.

    There are a couple of really good songs (A Thousand and One Nights is a stand-out), and the actor for Aladdin pulls off a surprisingly great >!Smeagol/Gollum!< act.

    That said, it doesn't have quite enough story for its runtime, so it lags in the middle.  It's in desperate need of a straight-man for all of the jokes and references (they sometimes try to put Ja'far in that role, but they can't quite commit to it, instead getting him to make a bunch of those references himself).  The plot...  Let's just say that it faces the choice of being a plot that makes internal sense, or of being an allegory for the [Post-Renaissance](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Disney_Post-Renaissance) Walt Disney Corporation, and it chooses the latter at every opportunity (>!"Ha ha!  Pixar has conquered you, Magic Kingdom!"  "We'll pay you a bunch of money, that would be yours anyway if you conquered us, to let the Magic Kingdom buy Pixar instead."  "Deal!"!<).

    It's a credit to the show that it can rise above most of the stuff I just mentioned and somehow is still very enjoyable.  I'm just a little sad at those moments of greatness, the profound emotional arc and the perfectly serviceable plot structure, that could have been expanded upon to make this so much better than "okay"... were pretty much all tarnished by making them subservient to the ">!Disney sucked between ditching 2D animation and buying Pixar!<" theme, instead.

    I'd recommend either the book or watching the show first (it's based on the show, but I read it based on the book with no problems).  I can't recommend the show, not having watched it, but the book is pretty hopeful in tone.

    The fanfic is one of the most hopeful things I have read in the past year.

      This is pretty much the anti-Worm webfic. Story tropes are employed and justified rather than subverted, pretty much *everyone* is secretly a decent person (the Emperor is a nice guy even when it sometimes costs him, the Thieves Guild is more an unofficial anti-corruption agency dedicated to knocking power-hungry people down a peg, the slavering Drow actually have a divine mandate to serve as a barrier between the Surface and the even *worse* Deep Elves, the Demon Queen cultists mainly try and curtail wild warlocks or demon outbreaks) - it just sometimes takes a few arcs (or a dozen) until that becomes obvious, and *noone* ever dies.

      I'd recommend it for its excellent party banter alone, but it's also got a great magic system and an interesting setting. Also, character development! It's taken a *long* time until I warmed up to some characters, but by now I really like most of them.

          On the other hand it means you're hardly ever really afraid for characters. You already know the "worst" thing that'll happen to them is they might come to some painful realization about themselves.
          ```

          - u/SkoomaDentist:
            ```
            Yes, and? I don't particularly _want_ to be afraid for the characters. Why would I want to worry whether some element I like is suddenly going to be taken away from the story?

            Not that you actually are in most fiction anyway, since very little fiction kills off the major protagonists (A Song of Ice and Fire being a major exception). A lot of the time it's just "Let's cause them suffering for the sake of suffering".

            Take the end battle in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. It was 100% clear that J. K. Rowling was never going to kill off any of the protagonists for real (and certainly not in a satisfying way), so killing off Fred Weasley comes off just as a means of causing suffering for the sake of suffering with no actual effect on anything (unlike killing off Dumbledore and Snape which were required for the plot).

            The point is that there are many - often better - ways of creating tension than killing off characters. In TGAB the major source of tension is whether >!and how far Justinian!< can pull off his scheme.
            ```

            - u/None:
              ```
              It's more... immersive, I guess?  

              I don't doubt Wildbow is planning on killing or worse some of his main characters, particularily if his next focus after Ward will be shorter stories, like I've heard people say.
              ```

              - u/SkoomaDentist:
                ```
                Killing off main characters can work, but it has to be done for actual story reasons, not to "create tension", "make characters experience loss" or other similar bullshit excuses. ASOIAF pulled it off particularly well when GRR established that _anyone_ can die by killing off one of the main protagonists in the end of the first book. The downside to that approach is that your world tends to end up as grimdark and that can be really depressing.

                Also consider the real world: There's plenty of tension and suspense in many peoples' lives without anyone necessarily dying. A good writer should be able to do similar things without having to resort to killing people for that purpose unless the setting is particularly militaristic or violent.

    The Goblin Emperor is quite good.

      If you like the No 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, I also recommend the Phryne Fisher books by Kerry Greenwood. They have a similar wholesome vibe to the N1LDA books but are a little more exciting.

        Not quite the same, but the Marcus Didius Falco books are quite good. It's more or less 'Harry Dresden solves crimes all over the Roman Empire' and a lot of pages are dedicated to his relationships with his friends and his eventually-wife.

        Also, Max Frei's Echo books. It's an incredibly popular, uh, cozy slice-of-life portal urban fantasy mystery series from Russia. Warning though: the translation isn't that great from what I hear (I read like fifteen of these in Russian) and the series hasn't caught on in English so only four of the books have been published. But if you can find a copy of the first book for cheap, give it a go.

          Oh man I loved the Falco books! I didn't know about Echo, though. They look really interesting! Do I have to start with the first one?

  ```
  A guilty pleasure of mine has always been overpowered characters. Unfortunately, they're pretty much never done satisfactorily. Are there any rational stuff with an overpowered protagonist out there?
  ```

  - u/Rice_22:
    ```
    I suppose rationally speaking, fights at this power level involves:

    * bringing an overwhelming amount of firepower and numbers (2x or more against 1)

    * meticulous planning & a wide range of options to best exploit any opportunities to use that firepower

    * catching the target alone and unaware, or isolating them from reinforcements

    * unleashing everything you got at them in seconds so as to exhaust all their options of self-defence, self-recovery or escape

    * leaving immediately after the deed whether you succeed or fail at the assassination

    It'll be an endless series of alpha strike sneak attacks and ganging up on each other, unless the protagonist is the only one who is overpowered (in which case it's more a man stomping on ants). Either way it's difficult for the writer to make this relatable to the reader.

    Edit: I just realised I described something similar to a DotA teamfight.
    ```

  - u/RuggedTracker:
    ```
    If you're fine with Manga, there's "Teppu". It's basically a parody of the standard shoen manga, as the personalities of the protagonist and antagonist is reversed. It's pretty short, only 30-something chapters, but it does end properly. 

    The main character is extremely talented, so she looks down on everyone else (hence, the personality of an antagonist). 

    Hands down the best manga I know, both from a "I like overpowered characters" perspective, and from a character study one (You actually get to know why the main character acts like she does).
    ```

  - u/tobias3:
    ```
    It's something I'd like as well. The problem is that overpowered + rational means conflicts get resolved pretty quickly (as others have noted). The bad solution is to randomly throw OP challenges or idiot balls at the protagonist (after noticing the fic is written into a corner). That's extremely unsatisfying because then i) the protagonist isn't OP anymore and ii) the conflict isn't foreshadowed and comes out of nowhere which is always unsatisfying. Many online fictions one finds also describe OP powers, describe how awed everyone is once they are revealed and then just stop (I guess because then comes the difficult bit about how to continue...).

    A few categories to work around the problems a OP protagonist causes

    * Working under heavy restrictions. E.g. being a god, but unable to take away free choice. Or one of my favourite HP fanfics [A Long Journey Home](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home) (HP time travel; unfinished). I'd guess [Dungeon Keeper Ami](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/) that gets recommended here often partially falls into this category as well (protagonist is morally restricted).
    * The fictions asking how having OP powers influences the character(s) long term and how the "normals" react. Unfortunately I can only think of "Mortal Gods by Bonnie Quinn" so far.
    * The curb-stomp fics. Worm itself isn't one, since the power scales up during it (like a lot of fiction). But there is a lot of Worm fanfic with OP powers (e.g. [Acceleration](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/acceleration-worm-au.284714/) or [Queen of Blood](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/queen-of-blood-worm-castlevania-complete.363842/)). Search for OP worm fanfic (reddit) and I guess you'll find most of it. Doing the canon challenges using OP powers begs the question a bit in my opinion (but I guiltily read those anyway).
    * Throw a difficult problem at the protagonist. But then the question is if the protagonist is still OP. For example this quest was recommended a few threads ago here: [Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest (No SV, you are the Waifu)](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/battle-action-harem-highschool-side-character-quest-no-sv-you-are-the-waifu.15335/) or e.g. "A Soldier's Duty by  Jean Johnson" (the latter highlights the problems with extreme competence)
    * Fics where the protagonist becomes OP at the end. Worm was already mentioned. One with extreme OPness is e.g. "The Library at Mount Char by Scott Hawkins". But really much fantasy falls into this category, I could list a lot of them. I wouldn't call those fics with overpowered protagonists (since they don't start off overpowered), but you have mentioned "I'm a Spider So What?"...
    * Making a comedy (or "light novel"?) out of it, usually with the protagonist being oblivious of the power or the responsibility that comes with it. Like "I've Been Killing Slimes for 300 Years and Maxed Out My Level", "Evil God Average", etc. I haven't read/watched One Punch Man... would that fall into this category? There's tons of (bad) HP and Worm fanfic in this category as well (like the popular HP "[A Black Comedy by Nonjon](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/3/A-Black-Comedy)"; haven't read it, but I guess...).

      ...Thinking about it, I've come to the realisation that there aren't many OP MC stories that I've actually liked. Off the top of my head, there's One Punch Man, The Eminence of Shadow, The Gamer, Solo Levelling, I'm a Spider So What?, Snake Report, and that's about it.

      I think what I'm looking for is something where the protagonist actually takes full advantage of their powers and don't get needlessly underestimated by idiot antagonists, or where they are actually successful at hiding their powers / knowing the relative overpoweredness of their powers and aren't just obliviously amazing people left and right.

        [Empire of Salt](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28062/empire-of-salt) has mostly been in the latter category so far; the main character has largely been underestimated _because_ she's done a good job of knowing how OP she is, and managing to hide it.

        That being said the systems in the book are a little incoherent, and also there's not much salt yet.

        Shit man! Read it! It’s great. I recommend reading the first chapter to see if you like the style and structure, but otherwise, if you’re looking for OP characters done *magnificently* this is your go to. 

        Also, it’s kind of long, but the story comes in bite-sized chunks called “arcs”. Don’t feel pressure to read the whole thing. (I did, but as far as I can tell, few do).

      Does it ever get better? I got maybe 100 chapters in and it was a constant MC wank combined with asspull powerups. And tonal whiplash going from "MC is a cool guy that likes helping people" to "Muhaha I love breaking people who mildly inconvinence me bones" and then back again. 

      Literally not a single part of it was well written (horrible translation aside) or rational.
      ```

      - u/Veedrac:
        ```
        Yes, the early chapters (‘early’ in wuxia terms) are much more about signposting to the traditional wuxia crowd, and it only gradually grows into full-on rational fiction. Some things, like the MC being OP, are staples of the genre that will never go away, but they do fade to more just being background facts rather than the core goal the plot focuses around.

        The translator changes a fair few times, from initial inexpert fan translations by a few different people, until Webnovel starts paying more real translators, first flycrane01 (starting Ch ~200) and then Henyee Translations (Ch ~1000), each doing significantly better work than the prior.

        Though I don't mean to encourage you to do something you dislike. There are plenty of stories that start strong from the beginning, and there's never a guarantee you'll love the latter parts as much as I do.
        ```

        100 chapters is about how long it took for the author to decide to take the story and characters more seriously than regular xianxia (before then he had set out to make a regular xianxia in a deconstructed setting).  The events on the train is basically the point where the author turns over a new leaf.

        There's still all the random powerups from the first 100 chapters to grapple with, but over time they're given less and less attention and Li Yao's successes start coming more from his own talents and ingenuity and the author seems to have (from where the translation currently is, at least) planned out how to justify all the powerups in big reveals later on.

        Also the translation *does* improve significantly, to the point where you should be able to easily acclimatize to it.  I recommend you give it another shot.

          Well, at least I can safely ignore the series without feeling like I'm missing out on anything then. Not sure why anyone would recommend this in a "rational" context.
          ```

          - u/Veedrac:
            ```
            People recommend this in a rational context because it's a rational story, at times even rationalist, and very strong in that regard. It hits all of the marks: intelligent characters solving problems with legitimate thinking, genuine introspection of goals and motives in a complex environment, intellectual payoffs after every plot, the whole story is *about* aspiring rationalism, and the worldbuilding is solid—that's just mentioning the points on the sidebar. I'm not sure what specifically you're concerned about with the linked post; ‘rational’ doesn't mean ‘never makes mistakes under pressure’.
            ```

          - u/Acromantula92:
            ```
            I mean, given that Eliezer draws parallels to HPMOR in his [recommendation](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7cdwbb/rt_forty_millenniums_of_cultivation_196203_hpmor/) it makes sense to call it at least "rational adjacent". Also, did you keep reading the previous example or did you stop early? It really is a prime example of the sidebar guidelines.
            ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        I have just finished binging the fic over the last... 4 days? Maybe 5, not sure. The story starts out very weak, so like you I had some initial problems with it; this is actually my second attempt at giving it a read. If you can get past the initial bit, though, I would definitely recommend it. It's not the best thing I've ever read, but it's quite well executed. It's less rational than MoR or, I dunno, Luminosity, but it's definitely within the rat sphere and closer than quite a few things on this sub. 

        It's definitely the best Xanxia novel I have ever read, bar none, and by a significant margin.

  Since the first round of nominations for the Hugos has begun, what are/would be yours?

  Here are mine

  Uncrowned by Will Wight

  3zekiel by Peter Cawdron (novel)

  Arkad's World by James L. Cambias (novel)

  Perhelion Summer by Greg Egan (novella)

  Knife Children by Lois McMaster Bujold (novella)

  They also give awards for TV and film, editors, fan works, and essays. Web serials count as novels (I think). Any scifi or fantasy that was finished or published in 2019 is fair game.
  ```

  - u/Turniper:
    ```
    I enjoyed Uncrowned but honestly consider the whole cradle series to be basically literary junk food. They're great and fun, and I would totally wear a The Dragon Advances T-Shirt, but I don't think they're Hugo material.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Honestly those were the only f/sf books published in 2019 that I enjoyed. That was my only bar :)

    [Blindsight](https://www.rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm) by Peter Watts was mentioned, so I'll go with his Echopraxia.

    [The Story of Emily and Control](http://web.archive.org/web/20110411140643/http://squid314.livejournal.com/293753.html) by Scott Alexander - a great story that deserves a better ending :)

    [Procrastination](https://365tomorrows.com/2015/02/27/procrastination/) by Jaime Astorga - not a horror story per se, but terrifying enough.

    [Coding Machines](https://www.teamten.com/lawrence/writings/coding-machines/) by Lawrence Kesteloot - a fictionalization of the [Ken Thompson Hack](http://wiki.c2.com/?TheKenThompsonHack).

    [Muse](http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/muse.shtml) by Alicorn is fantastic and horrifying (but not that rational).

  There's this really cool mini-game that I've been playing with recently called [4D Toys](https://marctenbosch.com/news/) where you get to interact with 4 dimensional shapes in a 3D plane as if you are a higher-dimensional baby learning about shapes for the first time. It's really cool how even though I can't see in 4D, I still can get a sense for how 4D objects are constructed and move. For anyone who had already heard of this, there's a new update with new star-shaped objects to play with.

  Oh man, oh man, where do I start? [All Night Laundry](http://www.all-night-laundry.com/) is an incredible webcomic that has just recently completed (except for the epilogues) and now was a good time to introduce it to you guys. It's a story that started as a short ghost tale that takes place in a haunted laundromat, but it rapidly spiraled into a much larger, intricate story which involves bizarre physics, doppelgangers, eldritch creatures, and >!read the story to find out!<! I don't want to say too much more since it's a very spoiler heavy plot line. Zack actually updated this daily for *seven years* straight.

  [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint](https://boxnovel.com/novel/omniscient-readers-viewpoint/) is another story that I'm sharing because it just finished. Kim Dokja is an avid reader of a Chinese webnovel, Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World, but the story has become real. However there are signs that he may not be anything more than a character in the first place. Really plays with meta-aware characters and use literary conventions as laws of physics.

  The next two stories are short stories that were posted here a while ago that I thought deserved a repost:

  [All Paths to Happiness](https://physicsnapkins.wordpress.com/2013/05/20/all-paths-to-happiness/) is an interesting take on how powerful a device to stimulate a version of Coil's power from Worm can be. But as discussed in the previous [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4chu76/all_paths_to_happiness/), the execution was a little flawed since UFAIs would occur long before the protagonist actually accomplished his goals.

  [The Great Filter](http://www.begoodenough.com/the-great-filter/) is a novel take on the Fermi Paradox where the Great Filter is time travel. Some interesting discussion in the previous [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4mwcvl/rt_the_great_filter/).

  Both authors also have some cool articles on their blogs if you want to explore their websites.

  I would like to recommend getting a drawing tablet. I just got a cheap one ($35, like a touchpad but with a pressure sensitive pen instead of your fingers) and was blown away by the quality. Paired with illustrator sketchbook (free for noncommercial use) or another art editor of your choice (e.g. gimp) they make it significantly more fun to make computer art compared to drawing with a mouse. I'm a garbage artist, so don't worry about needing to be any good to have fun. I can already tell I'll blow past my standard $1/hour cost/funtime ratio.

    If you have 45 minutes to spare, I'd recommend [Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4hdq4c).

    It's not rational, but someone concluding "The world is a mess, and I just need to rule it" and inventing a bunch of gadgets to try to help them achieve that goal (and win affection) seems, if not rational-adjacent, then rational-adjacent-adjacent.

      Dr Horrible's lab is a house in the San Fernando valley that was remodeled by one of those reality shows, with the explicit theme of "Mad Scientist". The only things the crew brought in were lights and camera gear; all the props were just the every day decoration of the house. As part of payment, they gave the owner (note: a production biochemist) a cameo in the last scene, and when the guy pulled out his first choice costume (something he'd already had in his closet) is was item for item Dr Horrible's. So instead he got his second choice. :)

    You might have read them already because they are popular on SB forums, but [Psi Effect](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/psi-effect-aka-chryssalid-writes-a-me-xcom-crossover.303390/) (Human x-com operatives go undercover as asari while postponing first contact . Mostly seen through the eyes of an asari maiden they recruit, which adds a lot of fun with how strange humans can be) and [The last angel](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/) (Humanity is mostly wiped out, AI decides to get revenge (think late-stage Chrysalis if you read that in HFY, if not then take a look). We follow different characters as they try to salvage a massive derelict ship without realizing what they've stumbled into). 

    Anyway, with those two out of the way there's my favorite r/hfy story [The year after next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/2bbsqd/oc_the_year_after_next_part_1/). Set around our time, it's a race for humanity to reach the stars because something (wont mention because slight spoiler for first few chapters) bad will happen if we don't. Interestingly, most of the story happens on earth, where we follow FBI agents getting involved with religious fanatics, a disgraced NASA scientist trying to set aside his humiliation so he can help. A woman dealing with an abusive stalker. People like that. Does have an end that wraps up everything, which puts it above 99% of internet stories. Aliens are also proper characters, not just wooden dolls to make humans look better, which is refreshing in the genre. 

    [Monkeys reaches stars](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/2hf1f9/ocjenkinsverse_monkeys_reaches_stars/) is in my mind, aside from the original, the only jenkinverse story worth reading. Absolute joy, but it's basically the same as every other hfy story so there's not much to say. "Human strong human smart raaaaagghh!". The aliens are the best part of this story, even has well written children in it, which I didn't think was possible to find on reddit. 

    A bit unconventional, but "The day the world came to town" is a feelgood book. It's a true story based on the events in a town called Gander after 9/11, where several thousand passengers flying to the US ended up. Not only is it fun with a plethora of fascinating characters (the CEO of Hugo Boss, an US general, a family of Jews who starves in silence because there's no kosher food and they don't want to intrude), but the whole book is basically humans being kind to each other. There's some heartbreak in there, but you'll definitely come out feeling good about the future once you're done.

    I'm going to make some different recommendations, perhaps stretching rational a bit. If you're here and going through /r/hfy you've already scoured for new ones. 

    [First Contact](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7278544/1/First-Contact) - A Mass Effect Fanfic, unfinished / abandoned so be warned. Doe not requiring a knowledge of the game. Its a soft rational, in that the characters at least move to actively avoid a lot of the cliche's regarding alien first contact. Humans governments deal with alien contract a little to easily. Last Chapter has a very HFY discussion. 

    If you want longer HFY style things in scifi, I'd recommend this fandom as a whole. A lot of the stories are not rational, and hfy here can be very trope heavy. However their are gems. 


    [Forged Destiny](https://fanfiction.net/s/12044591/1/Forged-Destiny) - Long, and very slow. To it's detriment at parts. It is not a [Gamer](https://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/the-gamer/list?title_no=88&page=1) ripoff like a bunch of the RWBY stories are, but in a similar vein. Utilizing a non-combat 'skill' in a world based on vague RPG classes to become a powerful warrior. 

    [With this Ring](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-fourteen.8938/) - LOOONG. I've given up on it even with TTS playing it in the background. MC has some amount of Self Insert Knowledge, but having an Orange Ring must operate on selfish motives at all times to function as a superhero. So a lot of the story is 'rationalizing' fixing the world via selfish motive. (In between the much more expansive, less annoying than canon teen drama.) Might strike your fancy more than my own. Make sure to download the thing. 

    [Bobiverse](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41429774-the-bobiverse) The audiobook version of  this one is fantastic if you've got the money.
    ```

    - u/CaramilkThief:
      ```
      As a related recommendation to Forged Destiny, there's also The Games We Play by ryuugi on ff.net. It's not as good as Forged Destiny, but the lore is expanded in a very intriguing way and the powers have fascinating histories (plus it goes up to dbz power levels, which depending on your taste could be fun).

    I highly recommend *[Fevre Dream](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/382450.Fevre_Dream)*, George R.R. Martin's only vampire novel. It's unlike any other vampire story I've read, and it touches on some philosophical topics that would probably appeal to this sub.

    If you like scifi, then you might enjoy one of my favorite books: *[The Madness Season](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36161.The_Madness_Season)* by C.S. Friedman. It has an interesting explanation for the existence of vampires in a scientific world rather than a fantasy one. Woven into the plot, there are some great explorations of truly alien psychology.

    For a comedic take on vampirism, I recommend *[Thirsty](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/183274.Thirsty)* by M.T. Anderson. It's a satire of the typical teenage 'turned into a vampire' tropes, and the story contains some of (in my opinion) Anderson's best moments of dark [absurdist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism) humor.

    The Zamonian books by Walter Moers.

    [Eschbach](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Eschbach) has a few thought-provoking thrillers and Sci-Fi book, though I wouldn't call any actually "rational".

    [Eine Billion Dollar](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eine_Billion_Dollar) has a layabout inherit a sum of one trillion dollar, which came from an influential German merchant four hundred years ago. The story is about him trying to find a purpose which justifies him being gifted so much money, and the temptations he faces along the way.

    [Der Letzte Seiner Art](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Letzte_seiner_Art) is about ethics in science and war; it's told from the perspective of a young American who joined the Military, where he volunteered for a project that aimed to turn people into Cyborgs. After the catastrophic failure of the project, he was allowed to resettle to Ireland. 

    [Ausgebrannt](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ausgebrannt) deals with the effect that a sudden drying up of certain important oil fields would have on our society. It follows a German guy who came to the US as a translator for a software project, who has always dreamt of living in the States.

    Gurren Lagann is fairly rat adjacent while also being good, but it's an anime; Neon Genesis Evangelion is even further out but is the next closest mech anime that I can actually recommend. There's also a few fanfics of those.

    Are you averse to visual novels, anime, or LGBTQ themes? If not, I can recommend [Heaven Will Be Mine](https://store.steampowered.com/app/836450/Heaven_Will_Be_Mine/). In an alternate world, Humanity launched a space program to defend against an Existential Threat which may or may not have been born from the collective Human subconscious. After that war was fought, and Earth started to be afraid of the diverging pilots, the program was scrapped and all pilots recalled back to Earth. Most of them didn't like that one bit, and now two factions are in open rebellion while a third faction tries to get them to come back before Earth loses patience and kills them all. You play as the ace pilot of one of those three factions, and choose how your encounters with the other two characters play out. Each of those three girls really cares for their mission, but they also care for each other a whole lot.

    It's a heavily different world which seems to run on either narrative or subjective physics, expressed through Gravity which is how humans decide what is real, and you're often not going to comprehend stuff the first time you read it. Playing [We Know The Devil](https://store.steampowered.com/app/435300/We_Know_the_Devil/) might help with that, it's set in the same world, just earlier, and doesn't have mechs.
