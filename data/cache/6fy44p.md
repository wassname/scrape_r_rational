  I will be interested in seeing how many submissions resemble *American Gods* from a mechanical perspective, if not thematically as well.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  The only really interesting stories with gods in my experience are about pantheons with many non-omnipotent gods. It would be pretty cool to see rationalist!athena born from zeus' brain.

- u/None:
  ```
  Can someone explain what this thread is to me?
  ```

    ```
    Every fortnight there's a writing challenge for the subreddit. You can see [the latest thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6fxuzy/biweekly_challenge_gods/) here.

    The challenge companion thread is for discussing the latest challenge. If you want to comment on a submission you can do so as a reply to it.
