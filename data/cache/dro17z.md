## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

 Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  So, [The World As It Appears to Be](https://archiveofourown.org/works/9402014/chapters/21285149) by /u/Benedict_SC is an amazing piece of Overwatch fanfic. Let me count the ways:

  1. It succeeds *as writing*. The characters have depth and chemistry. The dialogues are on point. The plot twists are well done. 

  2. It succeeds *as science-fiction*. It takes a decent stab at hardening Overwatch's hand-waved soft-SF. It has non-silly AI. It has an SF device that I had never encountered before (and I've read a lot of SF), that raises interesting questions.

  3. It succeeds *as fanfiction*. All characters sound just like their Overwatch canon selves. You just naturally start hearing them talk in their voices. (With the unfortunate exception of Mercy. Though to be fair, Mercy has shown very little of herself in canon; in all her lines, her two emotions are detached heroism and doctor baby-talk.)

  4. But more than that: it takes characters which, in canon, are largely two-dimensional caricatures, and *gives* them depth, richness, and [intelligence](https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing) - all the while remaining true to the caricature. Same with the setting, which is faithful to canon but adds elements that just feel right. Almost everything about this fic slotted right into my headcanon.

  &nbsp;

  So, having read this jewel, I got hungry for more Overwatch fanfics. And I got forcefully reminded of [Sturgeon's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law). 

  Most of what floats to the top of AO3 doesn't even succeed as fanfic. It's just some (gay romance) story with characters who share a name (and *usually* species and *maybe* job) with canon but are nothing alike personality-wise. I have nothing against Hanzo/McCree slashfic if that's what you want to write, but dammit girl, McCree has one of the most recognisable voice in Overwatch, would it kill you to write your dialogue to match?

  I've lowered my standards considerably but I'm still disappointed. Does anyone have recs?

    - u/Roxolan:

      Hmm, the fic does reference Overwatch canon a *lot*. Much of the plot points and surprise character appearances might seem a bit... random, without the background.

      So I do think that the more you know about Overwatch, the more you'll enjoy this fic. (There's even subtler references to game mechanics and cosmetic items, for the enthusiasts.)

      That being said, there's not that much Overwatch lore altogether, and at least some of it is accessible through competently made animated shorts. If you have half an hour and don't mind being marketed to, I'd recommend watching:

      I personally read it before my first time playing Overwatch and quite enjoyed it. I had probably absorbed a little knowledge of Overwatch from cultural osmosis in the gaming community, though.
      ```

    - u/hyphenomicon:
      ```
      Nope. Overwatch is a team of military government people and they fight some team of bad guys, and there is future tech. Also, the game has healers and other people with weird powers, in addition to standard guns. That is literally the extent of my knowledge of the lore, never touched the game, but still enjoyed the FF.

        Oh, yeah, I wrote a thing about a dude with save scum powers trying to avert the apocalypse for NaNo last year, but I felt like it sort of fell apart at the ending (which I rushed because NaNo) and I've been meaning to rewrite and expand on the ending and actually put it up somewhere (outside of a google docs link on my Tumblr), but I got this full-time job eating my time. It's [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SddGHeVfcVa5SCDHHTOA4RlKwnef-Q6IMw_Jqw9I0Mw/edit) if you really want to read it, but it's not really up to my standards since I was forcing it to the end to hit the target. Plus, while I try to be clever, it's probably not proper rationalfic since there's surely ways an optimizer who was really trying could have done considerably better (as opposed to the protagonist, who's kind of a slacker.)

        Also, thanks for the TWAIATB rec! I... don't have any real recs of my own, unfortunately. I read a decently IC McHanzo fic once that had a pretty compelling B-plot for a while, but it's not rationalfic and it kind of lost the plot after the sexual tension resolved and it switched over to being mostly smut and angst. Don't recall the name off the top of my head and I can't unreservedly recommend it, either. It's a dang shame.

        Wait, no, I remember, it was [Hang the Fool](https://archiveofourown.org/works/7127210/chapters/16186526). I never actually finished it, but yeah now that I found it again, I can confirm that it's, like, pretty darn well-done for what it is, but the what-it-is definitely traded off against my enjoyment and I kind of lost interest once it took the foreground.

  I wanted more places to discuss one of my recent favourite webnovels, so I'm going to recommend [Lord of the Mysteries](https://www.wuxiaworld.co/Lord-of-the-Mysteries/1486806.html) again here and hopefully get more people reading.

  The story takes place in an alternate universe Europe in early industrial/colonial era, and the setting is basically a mix between SCP Foundation, Bloodborne/Dark Souls, Lovecraftian horror and Dickens-lite stories. After a relatively slow start where the background of the world is methodically fleshed out (until the MC joins the equivalent of magic Scotland Yard), the plot begins accelerating from one story arc to the next with minimal filler and minimal "idiot balls required by plot".

  I think one of the things I appreciate most is how the Chinese protagonist being from Earth actually is significant to the plot, both to his advantage in surviving the world of mysteries as well as in how he reacts to little things other writers usually skip over. From little things like his love for trying out local cuisines, to his empathy for colonised natives / poor washerwomen / lead-poisoned factory workers common to that era, trying his hardest not to get innocent lives involved despite that being riskier for himself and his goals, and the feeling of going home alone while gazing out at the stars and bright lights shining out from the windows of other houses. It's also refreshing that the MC is unable to uplift the world significantly because he doesn't have photographic memory and >!because someone already did it before him.!<

  He's also one of the few main characters that goes to the toilet often and consistently, funnily enough.

  However, one of the most common criticisms of the novel is that it is translated from Chinese, and thus occasionally suffer from strange prose and anachronistic names. There's also some folks who thinks the protagonist didn't suffer enough permanent consequences from courting death so often.
  ```

  - u/Igigigif:
    ```
    I'll give this a tentative rec. By the standards of it's main selling point as xianxia by way of hermetecism it does an excellent job. Well researched, several fleshed out characters, and an interesting world.

    The MC has clear, thematic, and limited powers that reward creative use and is decently intelligent, and the magic system is very consistent as of chap ~550.

    By the standards of normal fiction, not so much. Translation jank, aggravating transphobia, and a good deal of as yet unjustified plot armor make it a harder sell to anyone outside the existing audiences for translated webnovels.

    But seriously, if you do read this stuff, definitely check it out. IMHO its on par with Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint and Way of Choices

        Can't pull up a direct quote, but basically one of the cultivation routes, in addition to incentiveizng the user to act evil (on the order of wanton blood sacrifice), turns them into a woman. The thing is, whenever this pathway is mentioned, whoever brings it up will condemn or mock them for this trait. It's on the order of 1 sentence every ~50  chapters so only grating if you're archive bingeing.

        I'll also specifically note that in setting it mostly been the case that people grudgingly accept it as the price of power, not bc the're actually trans. Almost certainly just authorial bias shinning through and not a deliberate plot point.

            Not sure if you're referring to the Korean historical figure constellations, or the whole thing with japan in the peace land arc.


            For the former, every country would have had equivalents, it's just that Korean incarnations were unreasonably successful.

            For the latter, while it is a reasonable outgrowth of how stories/tales work in-setting, it's also undeniably unpleasant. Thankfully, that arc was relatively short.


            Regarding the MC's martyr complex it might be some combination of >!access to resurrection abilities, trauma from his family situation, genuine affection for the other people involved, and his (incorrect) self-perception as the only person able to change the story!<

          Agree that these items are pretty messed up when they come up but this reflects the state of the art on trans issues in mainland Chinese culture, as far as I can tell. If you can read 19th century novels, i.e. if you can read things by people with somewhat alien and. from where we're standing, unenlightened views, then you can likely read this. Remember that we won't be remembered well by history for our own unenlightened views, judging from every possible past historical precedent.

    ```
    I’m not going to de-rec this because I don’t think I got far enough in to give it a fair chance, but wow, that prose is awful. I really hope it’s just a result of the translation.
    ```

    - u/Rice_22:
      ```
      Yeah, I understand if it's a turn off for a native English reader used to quality stuff like PGtE etc. I'm used to it because I regularly devour translated Japanese/Chinese/Korean series and even stomached through hundreds of chapters of pure machine translations, so I built up quite a tolerance. 

      I would recommend you to keep reading, at least for a "novel" experience involving the work of a writer from another culture. The writer's plot ideas and weaving narrative definitely shines through despite the occasional bad prose, I guarantee.

      Part of the prose is because of the translator's choice of words, but the Chinese language (like other East Asian languages actually) favours a lot of quirks in writing like repetition for emphasis, off-hand references to idioms (that comes off as long-winded in English), onomatopoeia, and words with double/triple meanings which are all relevant in context.

      If I have to rate the translation, it turns what should be a 9/10 story into high 7/10. Not as great as it should be, but still definitely worth reading.
      ```

      - u/IICVX:
        ```
        Ya for anyone wondering, the prose is roughly standard webnovel translation fare; if you've ever enjoyed a translated Chinese web novel, you'll enjoy this. If you've never tried a translated web novel before, this one is worth giving a shot.

    I'm reading it, and I like it, and it helps that new chapters get translated pretty much every day (sometimes a few times per day). To follow up on some of your comments...

    > the setting is basically a mix between SCP Foundation, Bloodborne/Dark Souls, Lovecraftian horror and Dickens-lite stories 

    You're not kidding here! Bloodborne especially, as one of the aliases the protagonist is using is >!Gehrman Sparrow, which is a combination of Gehrman the First Hunter from BB and Jack Sparrow from Pirates.!<

    > It's also refreshing that the MC is unable to uplift the world significantly because he doesn't have photographic memory...

    Well, he does kinda get a photographic memory eventually, as well as the ability for others to create copies of things they have read. And another part of the reason he isn't able to uplift the world is because oil essentially doesn't exist, so a lot of the technology he knows about isn't something that is feasible. It is a refreshing take on the trope, though.

    > one of the most common criticisms of the novel is that it is translated from Chinese, and thus occasionally suffer from strange prose and anachronistic names. 

    I have never seen so much lampooning before!

    There's also some amount of cultural differences too. The protagonist seems pretty disgusted by trans characters, and mocks gay people. It took me a long time to figure out, but "curly-haired baboon" is a an awkward turn of phrase that seems to be a translation for a gay slur of some kind. Originally I just thought it was a generic insult, but later on it is used specifically to refer to a gay character. 

    It definitely isn't the worst kind of work for these things, and they are fairly rare. But each time they kinda caught me by surprise.

    > There's also some folks who thinks the protagonist didn't suffer enough permanent consequences from courting death so often. 

    I'm not in this camp, but if I had a criticism it would be that the protagonist doesn't really seem to focus on getting back to his original world, nor does he miss his friends/family/old life. Yes, you can argue that his eventual goal is to ascend to godhood and hopefully have enough power to send himself back... but it really doesn't intrude on his mind. It's like he claims he wants to go back because the author feels like that's an obvious thing to want, but by not focusing on what he's missing it just feels like an excuse. It also stood out to me that the protagonist refers to himself by the name of the person whose body he took over, not as his original name. Even internally he thinks of himself as Klein, not Zhou Mingrui. I feel like this is a common isekai problem, where the protagonist being pulled into a new world is just a simple plot device so that audience understands where his references come from, but it isn't how a real person would likely act or think. 

    Those minor quibbles aside, I second the rec. It's an interesting world with a neat power system that gets used in creative ways.
    ```

  - u/AzaleaEllis:
    ```
    I'm a fan.  Started this recently due to what was likely your recommendation. As to the statements about bigotry, I've seen hints of whay might be insensitivity, but it's such a small part of the story it's hard to tell, and especially so because the targets aren't real trans people but "bad guys" who got surprised with the need to change into a woman to upgrade their evil superpowers, because the path only allows women. There's an opposite power path as well,  that requires only men. As of the current translation, the characters haven't shown any views that made me actually feel like the author had a problem with any minority groups or other countries, races, etc. I'm not okay with bigotry, but I don't think people should be scared off the story for fear of it. Judge for yourself.

  Since it just updated after a long hiatus, I'm going to post a rec for [Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest (No SV, you are the Waifu)](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/battle-action-harem-highschool-side-character-quest-no-sv-you-are-the-waifu.15335/) here.

  This is a quest (so, reader voting and all that) about a very traumatized child soldier learning to recover her humanity as she participates in an ongoing war between all of humanity and an invasive, incomprehensible alien force. The initial premise is that the protagonist, Anna, is one of the supporting characters in a harem anime, but the incredible worldbuilding, characterization, and combat scenes quickly leave that premise in the dust with their sheer excellence.

  Anna is very well-written and engaging character, and the journey she's on has me 100% hooked.

    One thing I like about The Reckoning is that there's almost a role reversal between Alloran and The Visser, relative to the dynamic between ordinary Yeerks and their hosts. Alloran nudges the Visser into doing things subtly differently than he otherwise would, while Yeerks, despite having complete control, are constricted to their host's previous habits to maintain an appearance of normalcy. I generally think of Yeerks as being locked inside the host, but Alloran as being locked inside The Visser. The Visser has a stronger claim on Alloran's body than Alloran, at this point, and it's almost Alloran who is the parasite.

    I mention this because

  I'm looking for heavy AU fanfiction focused on indiscriminately disregarding canon after a certain point in time, and writing down the rest while trying to not be influenced by it. Think writing something like The Games We Play or Ectomancer *now*, massive AU elements be damned. Or completely ignoring everything after the Prisoner of Azkaban, and so having an AU in which, amongst many other things, the Unforgivables don't exist, Slughorn or Ariana Dumbledore don't exist, Horcruxes don't exist, Tom Riddle was a relatively normal prodigy from a pureblooded Riddle family, and so on. Basically, going back in time and finishing the story your way, *without* the appearance of later worldbuilding and characters (this is important; without that, it would just fall into a 'normal' AU category [and inevitably fall back onto the Stations of Canon anyway]).

  Alternatively, just good *old* (written in an early stage of the original story in question) fanfiction with expansive worldbuilding.

  Don't care about the fandom.

It's a Ranma 1/2 fanfic (but you don't need to have read the series to understand it) set in a dark AU where demons are slowly devouring the entire multiverse, world by world. 

    I would recommend skipping through the first four arcs and straight to On A Clear Day You Can See Forever. You don't need to have read the other arcs to understand it, and it's where the crazy worldbuilding really kicks into high gear, and if you enjoy it the previous arcs make a nice prequel.

  This week I watched:

  *The Lighthouse*. Very artsy and allegorical, sometimes at its own expense. The horror elements were understated. I confess I don't think it lived up to the hype it's been getting. Pattinson and Dafoe were excellent, but the movie was overlong and, after a fashion, under-resolved. 8/10; if you liked Robert Eggers's other work, *The Witch,* you'll like this.

  *The King* on Netflix. An amalgamation of Shakespeare's Henriad and the real history of Henry V, I think it tried too hard to hit a middle ground between the two and failed to live up to its promise on either side. I liked, among other things, the reimagining of Falstaff's character and basically everyone's performance. The combat scenes were brutal. Making a Henry V movie without the St. Crispin's day speech is attempting too much to subvert expectations, though. 7.5/10; wonderful cinematography, acting, and sound design that carries a slightly thin script quite far. Undermined a bit by a whitewashing of Henry's motivations and his lack of agency in some ways and a cartoonish depiction of the Dauphin (although Pattinson is magnificently over the top).

  And I read J. M. Coetzee's *Disgrace* in one sitting on a flight. Absolute gutpunch of a novel. A tight and gripping first half that turns exhausting yet held me hostage until I finished it. An interesting meditation on apartheid, reparation, gender relations, and language set in racially divided South Africa. Coetzee's prose is as excellent as always, and the religious symbolism and political commentary manages to be simultaneously overt, explicit, and impartial. 9/10, but I'm never going to read it again.

  In terms of web fiction, I'm continuing to be disappointed in the LitRPG / Gamelit stuff out there. From RoyalRoad's offerings, *Azarinth Healer* was poor, and *New World* too; the stories available for free trend towards endlessly introspective garbage with more time spent on character stats and bland fight scenes than narrative substance. 

  *He Who Fights With Monsters* was quality, though, and I would recommend it (which makes it amongst the only gamelit stuff I would that I've read, along with *Worth the Candle* and *Threadbare*). I can't quite call it rational fiction, but it is somewhat internally consistent and the main character's social intelligence is higher and better written than you often see in these kind of stories.

    *He Who Fights With Monsters* is pretty decent and updates a lot.

    If you liked that, you might like *Eight*.  One of the most sensible protagonists in the LitRPG genre and it looks like they are setting up a semi-hard magic system.  Probably closer to rationalist fiction then *He Who Fights With Monsters.*  Lots of stat screens, but not a lot of numbers.
    ```

  - u/pldl:
    ```
    I agree that *Azarinth Healer* and *New World* were poor. 

    He Who Fights With Monsters was OK in terms of worldbuilding, but I thought the main character was bad and got progressively worse. His social intelligence only seemed high in the beginning because the social intelligence of the other characters were being dumbed down. >!What would you classify openly disrespecting an extremely powerful entity as, in terms of social intelligence?!<

    Have you tried [Delve](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25225/delve)?
    ```

    - u/ivory12:
      ```
      I am current with Delve, yeh. In some ways it's good, but in others it exemplifies the worst of the genre with the avalanche of numbers that bury the reader. Thanks for the rec!
      ```

      - u/xamueljones:
        ```
        Yeah but for me, the numbers/math is a pro, and it does some cool stuff with it. By having the main character figure out the formulas behind his stats and skills, he can use it to figure out the fastest leveling speed and best skills to buy.

        It makes the specific numbers actually meaningful instead of the nearly meaningless stat increases in say, Azarinth Healer and Legend of Randidly Ghosthound (no links because I recommend against them).

        If you really want some litrpgs with the stat pages and numbers a rarity, try [Way of the Shaman](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B074C9P3YF/?ie=UTF8&fp=1&pc_redir=T1).

        There's a focus on the game but it's on skill usage instead of increasing the level/skill number. Stat pages are shown like once per book.

        PS The preview sample pages on Amazon do a good job of conveying the story. If you don't like it after reading them, don't get them.

        PPS Have you tried the r/ProgressionFantasy subreddit?
        ```

        - u/RetardedWabbit:
          ```
          I'm also a fan of the math in Delve, it scratches a problem solving itch for me and serves as a interesting advantage for the protagonist to have over the locals. Have you read anything similar? 

          The closest most litrpgs get is calculating stamina and Mana for training.

    *Street Cultivation* by Sarah Lin.  Not strictly rationalist fiction, but at least rational fiction.  It tries to figure out how elements of the standard Cultivation magic system would work in modern society.  The main character behaves in a reasonably sane manner...and when he does something dumb he realizes it and stops.

    One of those books that fits the groups criteria as well as some of the stuff that gets mentioned, but is never mentioned because it doesn't quite fit with the very specific tastes of the community.

  - u/GlimmervoidG:

    I like Will Wight's Cradle novels. They're written in English (so no amateur translation - which is my number one problem with other cultivation stories), have good popcorn action plots, there's quite a few of them and the story advances at a fair pace. I enjoyed them a lot. If you're looking for a competently written progression focused series, Cradle is a good place to start.

    The quest  Forge of Destiny / Threads Of Destiny by yrsillar is also worth mentioning. It stars a young street urchin who joins a cultivation school - the  Argent Peak Sect. Power growth is keep in check. While we see the upper reaches, the MC is still steadily working her way through the first and second years of her school. No young masters causally knocked down. Features an engaging plot, likeable characters and a *lot* of content written so far. Also notable for the MC taking at least partly a support focus. She uses a magical flute that plays haunting magical music.

    A quest called [White Collar Cultivator](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/white-collar-cultivator.44460/) on Sufficient Velocity and a story on RoyalRoad called [The Dao of Magic](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/11397/the-dao-of-magic)

    Note that White Collar is on haitus and it's unknown when said haitus will end and I sort of dropped out of Dao of Magic because for a while it had sluggish updates... Geez there's 276 chapters now.
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      FYI the sluggish updates in Dao of Magic were because the author was working on his other story, Skeleton in Space. It's a fun magic / tech fusion thing with a really stupidly fun protagonist (he starts out with literal "animated skeleton" intelligence, but at least it's only up from there...)

    [Record of a Mortal's Journey to Immortality](https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/rmji) has a cautious and pragmatic protagonist. The series is a slow build but the protagonist is very careful not to get involved in conflicts without a reason and to only start fights with overdetermined outcomes given how unpredictable xiaxia combat is unless the benefit is worth the risk.

    Can you sell me a little harder on One Piece? I have the occasional weakness for shonen anime but have bounced off this every time, seems a little too frenetic too fast. For example, I like Hunter X Hunter as a show that pretty well draws you into an expanding world.

      How far did you get in OP before you felt it got too hectic? Luffy starts his adventure in East Blue, meets friends and enemies while traveling the world. I wouldn't say it's very rational as too many people have crazy powers and aren't using them optimally, but it's definitely a fun story with some truly fantastic world building and character development. 

      I think my favorite part of One Piece is exploring this crazy world of superpowers and seeing our protagonist+crew travel from island to island and righting the wrongs they see. It's got some genuinely funny moments and surprisingly dark scenarios (children being abducted for research, a villain whose power makes the victim forgotten by everyone, etc.) for a shounen series.

      It's been a long time since I read/watched HxH, I think I stopped around when the chimeras were introduced, but I feel that if you liked HxH you should definitely give OP a try. 

      Let me know if you have specific questions, I'm pretty bad at just selling something haha. I have spent way too much time reading OP so I'm pretty confident I can answer any question you may have, though.

        It sounds very ~~monster~~ island-of-the-week ish. Do past plot threads recur as the story progresses or is it heavily attached to a formula of sequential isolated arcs?
        ```

        - u/fassina2:
          ```
          The arcs can be seen as books. They tend to be long. Some took 3 years+.

          &#x200B;

           I can see how people may think it's some kind of 'each week is a different thing' story from the outside, but really the arcs function as most stories do, it's just that here it's more blatant because they almost always come in by ship and leave by ship..
          ```

        - u/Wolydarg:
          ```
          Oh yes past plot threads definitely recur, but there's definitely a "formula" of (crew travels to new island, encounters conflict, gains new skills/allies/strength). There is this overarc-ing goal of becoming the Pirate King, and you can definitely see progress being made and roughly where the end of the story would be (which should end in like, 10 years...).

          Also, to add on to what someone else wrote, definitely read the manga instead of watching the anime. The anime has a lot of pacing issues.

    I personally liked "This bites!". It's a self-insert with kinda obnoxious MC, but authors try hard to preserve that overall One Piece feeling while exploring characters and taking into account big-scale power dynamics.

      It's pretty explicitly non-rational though, with the SI explicitly, yet inconsistently, hiding plot details because of "spoilers."

  I have recently read [Aircraft Design Company Quest](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/aircraft-design-company-matsuras-planes-are-always-fastest.48927/)
  on SF forums and am now looking for similar themed fiction or quests, where I can follow arms or technology race in some conflict, similarly fiction works on prolonged conflicts that involve problem solving would be appreciated.

  Also, the linked quest itself was refreshing in that players had a more open way to look for solutions that fit the proposed requirements. It was very fun to read about proposed plane designs to meet certain criteria, within specific limits. I would gladly devour anything similar as well.

    Not sure if it's similar enough, but Wildbow ran [a quest](https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/PRT:_Department_Sixty-Four) where players controlled the actions of a newly instated PRT director in Anchorage, Alaska. They had to manage schedules, budget allocations, important meetings, interrogations, recruitment, and office politics. All with *superpowers* and parahuman criminals!

    Also, *fuck Faint.*

  ```
  [The Scythe](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28954189-scythe) was an excellent read. Well thought out post-singularity YA novel. It's technically utopian from the general perspective of society, but despite the constraints of living under a strong, friendly AI, still managed to *feel* dystopian; not because the AI fucks up, but because humans do, and the AI is programmed not to stop them.

  It simultaneously benefits and suffers from the YA imperative to keep novels short and condensed. On one hand, the plot feels a little rushed and a lot of woldbuilding is condensed, but on the other hand, I never read a scene that I think the book could have done without. If I wasn't used to webfiction's sprawling works, I'd probably think it was the perfect length.

  I got suddenly interested in *dungeon core* as a genre, but everything that is top-rated and most-recommended on RoyalRoad is "a fresh take" or another kind of subversion. And I want to get acquainted with the genre itself before delving into plays on its common tropes. 

  So, any recommendations for a straight-forward but well-written dungeon core story?
