## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  Wired has [a new excellent web series on Youtube,](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLibNZv5Zd0dzmgAyav3R8SfXc-64Oly_k) each episode of which concentrates on a particular trope used in various films and TV shows and analyses how accurately it has been used in specific titles. Particularly interesting here should be [this one on constructed languages.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa6cHEJIjYI)

  NB. I'm a little late to the party and will likely also post this on the comming wednesday worldbuilding thread. 

  A friend of mine has asked me to run a short(either everybody dies within a few IRl hours or the goal is quickly achieved) roleplaying game and inspired by [Scott Alexander's story about the 8 pill choices](http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/02/and-i-show-you-how-deep-the-rabbit-hole-goes/) I want to give my players the options between a number of various powers, with the caveut that each power is equally 'deadly' if managed improperly. Here I mean deadly in the sense that it either litterally kills the character or removes their character from taking any meaningful actions for the rest of the game. 

  Stealing some of Alexander's points. Green pill let's you shapeshift, unfortunately pretty much anything in nature have a natural killer who might be humans. Yellow pill gives you mindreading but you every time you use it you become a little more insane due to the massive information dump/get depressed because people. Pink let's you make anyone you touch love you and also makes them unlove you on another touch, beware of jaleous partners. Red makes you superstrong and aside from a 'how much does raw strength actually matter in real life' I'm unsure. Thoughts on other powers that easily can go horribly wrong?
