## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  So, I'm designing a setting for a potential future project, and I come up with a really elegant low-magic system that makes the world immediately completely different from the real one and opens up all kinds of interesting story possibilities.  I'm completely satisfied with it, but - it only makes the world *socially* different from ours, and not *visually* different from ours.  It changes the relationship people have with each other, the relationship people have with their government and religion and family and so on, but it doesn't change anything you could take a photograph of.  No fireballs or antigravity, y'know?

  And that's perfectly fine, but I kind of want some visual distinction from our world; I kind of want it to be specifically a fantasy setting and not just a general specfic setting.  But I don't want a second tacked-on magic system, because it wouldn't be as good as the first one, and would only really distract from it.  So instead, I'm adding fantastical but non-magical creatures and races to the setting, things that are physically possible and could exist in our world but simply don't.  "Dragons" that are just slightly larger and venomous pterosaurs, predatory mountain goats the size of bears, nations of people with various animal features like horns and natural armor, and potentially intelligent species that evolved alongside humans but didn't have natural lifestyles conducive to forming civilizations of their own.

  Is this a good approach?  I think it's an ideal compromise between not distracting from the central magic system and giving the setting some visual flavor distinct from our world.  My only fear is that being nonmagical, ie, already physically possible, won't stop the various creatures and races from feeling tacked on as a "second conceit" on top of the central magic system.  Any good tips for avoiding this?

    Civilization could respond in an artistic or stylistic way. You could look around at different ancient building styles for inspiration, Eastern, Indian sub continent, Norse, greco-roman, Central American pre-columbus, etc.

    Lets say you have a magic system that allows some low level mind reading. Maybe people tend to want their privacy back, and their architecture would be based around giving people their own space and sense of privacy. Or cultures just adapt to having no privacy, and its something they don't care about, so things we might consider private or intimate they consider public.

    Basically anything that changes social dynamics could have an impact on artistic and architectural styles.
    ```

    If each species had their own complement to the human magical system, that would make it feel more integrated. For example, you mention evolution, as in you're not basing your world on intervention of Gods, so it would stand to reason then, that if this magical power is inheritable (evolutionary) then some of the other species in your setting would be able to have their own systems of magic similar to other species'. By doing that, you make the creatures in the world not so tacked-on, since they are involved in (at least their own) magic systems similar to what normal humans would have.
    ```

  - u/trekie140:
    ```
    I think it's a good idea, and don't think you should worry about whether people will suspend their disbelief for creatures in a fantasy setting. Your audience only really cares about how those creatures effect the story, so unless their biology is plot-relevant people will likely accept it.

    > My only fear is that being nonmagical, ie, already physically possible, won't stop the various creatures and races from feeling tacked on as a "second conceit" on top of the central magic system.

    Think about how evolution might exploit your central magic system, then work out your various creatures and animals based on different concepts from this.  For bonus points, don't explain this to the reader directly in the narration, but let them work it out from hints, and/or let a character figure it out and exploit a creature in a new way by realizing that the creature uses the same magic as everything else.
    ```

  - u/Dent7777:
    ```
    Few questions about the pseudo-people:

    Are your planned nations of beings human? 

    Can they still reproduce with each other? 

    How would they have diverged so far phenotypically while still remaining human, for all intents and purposes? 

    Will they all communicate through speech, or have mutually intelligible languages?

    Did they evolve naturally or are they a product of willful modification?

    I feel like the cat/wolf/bear/goat people trope is often really poorly justified and sorta lazy. If done properly, it can drive conflict and be a very interesting and important part of a story. Good luck!
    ```

- u/trekie140:
  ```
  In the Night Angel Trilogy the magic system can do pretty much anything and has very few limitations. While this is almost exactly what you shouldn't do when writing a rational fantasy story, the author does manage to subtly pull off some really good worldbuilding by focusing on what magic is used for in different cultures. 

  Each country has its own taboos against magic and professions it encourages mages to enter, and that says a lot about them. Healers, battle mages, and enchanters all come from different schools across the continent. The few truly academic schools that will teach a student anything have treaties with neighboring countries meant to restrict their power.

  You can even learn a lot about a character based on what magic they use. The majority of mages just find a niche for themselves and profit from the few spells they're good at, which is easy because so few mages receive training. It helps get across the disorganized nature of medieval society.

  There are downsides to this, of course. Munchkin characters are extremely powerful in this setting since they'll use magic no one is expecting in ways no one would expect. This sort of worldbuilding isn't even a big part of the book, I just thought it was interesting way of going about it that was worth sharing.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    I always like it when writers take the time to show how different cultures react to and grow around their magic systems. Makes them feel more thought out and immersive.

    One of my favorite examples of this is the Alvin Maker series by Orson Scott Card, where Native Americans, European colonists and African slaves all had their own magic systems rooted in their cultures.  They weren't tied to genetics, anyone could learn any of them, but they were so distinct it was easy to use it as another source of cultural conflict and insight into their differences.
    ```

    - u/trekie140:
      ```
      I've been nervous about checking out more of Card's work. Ender's Game may be my favorite book and I really liked the rest of the series, but Pathfinder was boring as hell and Empire was just weird. I've started to think that the guy has lost his touch, I didn't even bother with Shadows in Flight. Is Alvin Maker worth reading?
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Empire was terrible. I felt actually cheated, after I read the synopsis. Almost returned it for false advertising.

        Alvin Maker is definitely worth reading, with 2 caveats: First, it's incomplete. The last book was published in 2003, and while the conclusion is still reportedly forthcoming, that's a looooong gap to overcome, and like you say, Card has really kind of lost his touch. Second, the last couple books that are out show a slight degrade in quality, to the point that I barely remember them. 

        But the premise is really unique and interesting, and I enjoyed it a lot, personally. One of my favorite alternate-history-with-magic book series.
        ```

        - u/trekie140:
          ```
          I didn't hate Empire, I just found it really forgettable. The politics were not realistic, but I give it some credit for showing conservatives accept a liberal-ish President for logical reasons. It's still weirdly skewed towards Card's beliefs, thankfully not bringing up same-sex marriage, but there's a lesson in there somewhere about people of different ideologies working together. It's weird, but occasionally insightful.

          What ruined it for me was the characters, in that they were all written the same way as the kids in Ender's Game. It didn't make any sense for them to act the way they did if they were supposed to be normal people, which they kind of need to be for a modern military-political story. The book might be worse than I remember since I wasn't as good a judge of quality back then, and I remember nothing about the action scenes.
          ```

          - u/DaystarEld:
            ```
            See, what ruined it for me was that it was still explicitly politically biased, even though it tried not to be. I was looking forward to a truly politically neutral conflict, with heroes and villains from both liberals and conservatives. That's what the blurb on the back implied.

            So when the story starts, we get a conservative villain in the form of the xenophobic military general who tried to incite a coup, and a liberal villain who used supertech to try and take over the country in response.  All so the real villain can become president, who's described as being "on nobody's side" but his own, and who was pulling the strings.

            The problem is, the conservative villain was a fake. He literally was just acting that way to goad the liberals into trying to take over, and worked for the grey super-villain. But the liberal villain was apparently genuine.

            Which wouldn't be so bad on its own if the main characters were mixed as well. But no, every single one of them is a conservative... except the main character's wife, who if memory serves does nothing, literally nothing, all book, except occasionally remind the main characters that she's liberal to point out that #NotAllDemocrats are evil.

            It wasn't a badly written book other than that, it was pretty standard and entertaining political action thriller. But it was so politically biased, with its straw liberal protagonist and its straw conservative antagonist, it just offended me beyond what it normally would have if it hadn't made any pretense at neutrality, like most political action thrillers by conservative writers (*coughs* Vince Flynn).

  What would it take to make a biological axle work?

  Living creatures can't have wheels, because as the wheel turns around its axis, the blood vessels and nerves and miscellaneous sinews will become twisted until they can't twist any further. This makes axles the simplest machine that can be made by tool-using creatures which doesn't exist in biology.

  Is this a limit of life on Earth due to some evolutionary accident, or is it likely true everywhere?

  Philip Pullman wrote a species that uses their long, sharp nails to grip two hard-shelled fruits and ride them like a bicycle. This is an interesting way around the problem - the "wheel" isn't actually part of the creature's body.
  ```

  - u/Cariyaga:
    ```
    Couldn't the wheel be made of hardened keratin or some other substance dependent on the body for its source, but not in itself living?
    ```

    - u/Sailor_Vulcan:
      ```
      you'd need smooth flat surfaces with little friction but not too little. Too little friction and you're on icy ground and biological ice skates would work better. Too much friction and it would be better to just walk, like on grass or bumpy rocky ground. Maybe it could work on a plain if the grass there had evolved to survive and even benefit from being trampled on. Like say being squished underfoot releases their seeds, and so they would have evolved to make it easy for wheels to run over them.
      ```

  - u/Muskworker:

    There is a wikipedia article about this and the pros and cons of what it would be like:  
    [Rotating locomotion in living systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotating_locomotion_in_living_systems)

    In particular, it seems the system in a bacterial flagellum can be considered an example of a biological wheel.
    ```

    - u/Sailor_Vulcan:
      ```
      are you sure that counts as a wheel? that sounds like a rotor or propeller. While technically that is a form of wheel, I don't think that's what the OP of this subthread is asking for.
      ```

  - u/scruiser:
    ```
    >  the blood vessels and nerves and miscellaneous sinews will become twisted until they can't twist any further.

    Transfer the nutrients to the wheel through a mucus layer.  The mucus also acts as a lubricant.  The wheel itself just needs enough metabolism to grow, the muscles that help turn it are in the main body of the animal, so the wheel doesn't need circulation or anything like that.
    ```

  - u/IomKg:
    ```
    > Living creatures can't have wheels

    Couldn't the axle and wheel combo simply have its own dedicated bloodcycle?

    think of this similar to how corals have a symbiosis with seaweed, or how we have mitochondria in our cells.
    Only instead you would have the "main" animal, and the wheel/axel animal. each with its own heart, digestive system(the main animal would excrete some compound on the axle/wheels which they would further consume) .

    I don't see a theoretical aspect preventing this.
    ```

    ```
    Not a wheel, but there is a jumping insect called an *issus* that has [natural, functioning *gears*](http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/animals/a9449/the-first-gear-discovered-in-nature-15916433/).

  ```
  Premise: You are an incredibly healthy, genetically modified human. Your natural lifespan is now about 1000 years. You recover from injury and other problems much faster than other humans. You have better reflexes, a higher than average intelligence, and a bunch of other minor improvements over normal humans. One more thing: you are stuck in pre-modern times, and you basically grew up there, so you have none of your current knowledge.

  What do you think you would do? Try and rule a country? Travel all over? Get involved in fighting for good causes? Be ultra careful and never get involved in something that might get you killed?

    Fairly creepy answer incoming, but I'd be motivated to get as many people as possible to 'share' my abilities so I don't have to keep seeing loved ones dying on me. So, I would attempt to have a lot of kids in good homes/family situations spread out over a wide area of several continents. Then I would work on minimizing any potential racial issues preventing my kids from breeding and being a part of society. Within a few generations, there should be only Humanity 2.0 left due to natural selection.

    Yes, I agree that this is a creepy answer due to how strongly it smacks of epigenetics, but I just felt like writing about something morally *off* today.

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      I mean, that would happen over time anyway. Assuming your traits are dominant, it wouldn't take very long at all for the superhumans to outnumber the normals just because the superhuman population increases exponentially for the first thousand years while humans are still stuck at linear growth.
      ```

      - u/xamueljones:
        ```
        I keep forgetting to reply, but the idea is to have lots of people who are like me before I die of old age or for some other reasons.

        Also, the traits don't have to be dominant to spread. If they provide X% of greater fitness compared to the general population, then according to some genetics formula I can't remember, the traits have 2*X% of spreading to everyone in the population regardless of whether it's recessive or dominant.

  Its Thursday but maybe I have a chance.

  So I have this whole northern kingdom. Its big, cold, forest, savage, yadayadayada.

  I have different ethnico-cultural groups but the main group is around 80% of the population of said kingdom. My question is: Is there a way to avoid the typical barbarian Northman?

  Is being tall a must in the North? Or can I make them smaller than average? (-->using less energy-->surviving?)

  Is there a way that they won't be savage brutes? Or is that also a must?

  The north has recently transitioned to feudalism. But they take knight-stuff super seriously. That makes them very honour-bound. Isn't that to game on thronesy?

    You could always go the route of "sufficiently harsh conditions require sophisticated social networks and cooperation" - think Antarctic base rather than vikings.

    ```
    I can't comment on biology, but I know actual Viking culture had several facets to it other than being a warrior or sailor. That was more of stereotype that the rest of Europe held because that was who they interacted with the most, but they were actually ahead of Europe in terms of a legal system and civil rights.

    It's my limited understanding, though, that one of the core ideals of the Vikings that allowed them to thrive was determination. These were the people that kept a colony in Greenland going for generations out of a pure stubborn refusal to leave. I don't know if you could pull off something similar without keeping that.
    ```

  - u/Dwood15:
    ```
    If you're not going for the Viking stubbornness, there needs to be a reason for your people to actually be living there. Are there mines? Is it in pockets of mountains with large numbers of warm springs? Lots of wildlife despite the weather? 

    Essentially, what makes the land itself livable? Once you figure that out, see how it's different from the Norse and go from there. /u/trekie140 mentions their stubbornness, and if you make it a land without any pluses, you'll end up with a people in similar vein as the Norse or dwarves, especially if it's a kingdom of any significant size/power.
    ```

  - u/chaosmosis:
    ```
    Where are they getting food? Fishing would allow you to avoid the whole warrior culture thing, it's basically just a different version of farming. I guess they would potentially be less sedentary. Maybe make it so that they all live on fleets of boats all year round, with no land they call home.

    the Neanderthals were more adapted to the cold than modern day humans. the Neanderthal were short and stout  because that gave them a more favorable volume/surface ratio and made them more resistant to cold. they also had big noses to better heat the air they breathe. you could make your nordmen like that.



    the old norse people were not all of them raiders most were simple traders, merchants, lumberjacks, farmers, and fisherman you could think of them as "Canadians that minored in murder"

  I've been designing a world and a magic system for an original rational fantasy story I'm planning in which I need souls to be real, but I've been having a bit of trouble figuring out a mechanistic explanation for how they would interact with the physical body (the brain in particular). My main stumbling block has been things like telepathy, mind/memory magic, and even mental casting of magic. 

  Motivation: I've always found it annoying when supposedly-anatomically-normal humans can use telepathy or other kinds of "mind magic" with only meat brains as sources and targets. Even casting "normal" magic by using thought/will/imagination doesn't ever seem to get a satisfying mechanistic explanation. I doubt that the electrochemical activity that occurs in a brain from a certain thought is really isomorphic to that thought, or that the thought could be reconstructed from analyzing the brain activity, even in principle. And even if it could, the intricacy and processing power required to do so would be so huge that it sets a pretty high lower-bound on the potency of magic that makes it difficult to set reasonable limits and rules on magic without contradicting that. 

  So, I'm trying to work out a system that addresses this and am hoping to find a way to make it work through the use of "souls" (I have quite a bit of other interesting things planned involving souls too). I've explored a few possibilities, but haven't quite found one I'm satisfied with, since each has their own problems. I was hoping for some feedback, suggestions, and/or recommendations to other works that may be helpful as inspiration.

  Some of the possibilities I've considered (and their problems) are:

  1. The "mind" is (a part of) the soul and is *not* the brain. The brain doesn't store memories nor does it produce consciousness on its own; it's only functions are controlling and regulating the body the same way it does IRL, and being the place where the incorporeal mind/soul "connects" to the body. So one's consciousness and memories exist only in the soul and it *somehow* causes your brain to send signals to your muscles to move when you want to move (I can't think of a satisfying mechanistic explanation for how the soul could do this, but was considering just making it unknown in-universe, just like how even in real life, I can't explain how my will to move my arm, but not imagining doing so, gets converted into the electrical signals that end up actually moving it). I'm hesitant to go with this option though because having the mind not depend on the brain is just *really different* from real life and it could make it awkward to ascribe real-life psychological features like imperfect memory, heuristics and biases, etc. to this completely non-physical mind. (It also necessitates that all living creatures have souls, which limits a few lore-related ideas I had, but that's not really a deal-breaker.)
  2. The physical body (including the brain) works exactly the way it does in real life. The soul is a "projection" of the body (including the brain) in the "information dimension" / "spiritual plane" that contains all the information about the body, but encoded in such a way that the information can be accessed and read with magic. So while thoughts, consciousness, and memories exist as electrochemical signals, an emergent phenomenon from those signals, and neural connections (respectively) in the brain, one could broadcast a thought or memory using mind magic by using the encoded version of the thought or memory from the soul as the source. The biggest problem with this (that I haven't been able to solve) is how the physical brain (and therefore the actual mind/consciousness) could *receive* telepathic information. Even if souls can be transmitters, receivers, and (mirrored) storage units for mental information, how can information received from the soul turn into actual thoughts, mental images, or anything that one could actually experience through their meat brain? That seems like it would require very complicated magical manipulation of the physical brain by the soul, the explanation of which would likely be very hand-wavy and unsatisfying and subject to some of the same issues I was originally trying to solve by using souls in the first place, especially considering that the body is supposed to be the "original" and the soul the "projection". 
  3. The soul is sort of like an individual's unique platonic form (encoded somehow as information), and the physical body is the (perhaps imperfect) "projection" of the soul in the material world. If the audience is willing to accept this one fact as a given, then I can have anatomically normal humans where consciousness happens in the physical brain, but when there are magically-induced changes to the "mind" portion of the soul, those are reflected in the physical brain (as electrochemical signals for thoughts and sense-data and as alterations to synaptic connections for memories) as well because the brain is a projection of the soul. The main problem with this is that it would probably have to be a bidirectional synchronization between the body and soul because otherwise, how would thoughts, memories, and sense-data that occur based on experience by the physical body end up being stored in the soul so that magic could do anything useful with them?

  Note: If I could solve #2 in a satisfying way, it would be my preferred solution because in-universe humans would be anatomically identical to IRL humans, meaning that while souls are empirically verifiable, they wouldn't actually be *necessary* (though they'll be the source of many in-universe advantages over IRL humans, including magic), which would allow for some interesting lore where maybe animals don't have souls and maybe some ancient/lost society (or gods) granted them to normal humans at some point in the distant past.

  If anyone has any ideas, thoughts, or even notices any additional problems with any of my suggestions, I'd appreciate it! Thanks
