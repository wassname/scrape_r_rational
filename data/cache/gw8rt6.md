  I want to thank the author for this chapter. It made me feel things. A mix of melancholy and hope.

    Holy cow, that was quick.  I was planning to leave the news to somebody else, since it's not really advancing the main plot and it's been a month coming.  So I felt a bit awkward about putting myself forward with this.  But it took a month because I started it five times, only to delete and start over.  Hopefully the next update will be quicker coming.

    All of which is to say, "you're welcome."

      Haha, I've got your rss feed set up so I get notifications. I've been looking forward to an update, so I was excited to post it. I wouldn't be worried about not advancing the plot: character development is still development!

  What a terrible situation these people find themselves in. How very realistic for young parents.

  Rams done a lot of growing in the past chapters. He's made a lot of progress. I can only hope that he is a good priest for his people, who uses his power to lift up his people.
