## [Q] How can I reasonably restrict the scope of a story where the premise is the discovery of the supernatural in the modern era?

### Post:

For ages, I've wanted to write a story about the liminal stage of the modern world discovering "magic" or "superpowers" or whatever you want to call it, that represents a massive departure from our understanding of the universe that's also almost immediately useful. Something that the entire world could potentially make use of, but at least for now, only a single person or small group of people know of.

The problem is, I'm an inexperienced writer. And more importantly, I couldn't reasonably predict how such a discovery could change humanity on the societal level. (If I could, I'd be in some highfaluting think tank.)

As such, I've determined that my best bet for writing a novel length work about this topic would be to limit the plot to a fairly limited geographic area and smaller cast of charachters, effectively reducing the number of moving parts so there's less that could break.

HPMOR limits its own scope with the statute of secrecy, but in the real world, any testable supernatural phenomena provides the immediate temptation to run straight to the Randi Foundation, or equivalent, and claim the Randi Prize before someone else can*, because if the supernatural could be discovered once, it could be discovered again. And of course, there are plenty of other ways to capitalize immediately or very quickly, whether by making an instructional website, a well-produced youtube video, a tutorial app, writing a book, whatever.

The obvious answer is the generic shady government agency/NGO route, but that's been done over and over and over again, and regardless, the idea is that the person mentioned in the story would be the very first to discover the new phenomena.

On the plus side, if I can find a good scope limiter, the plot would basically fall into place.

I don't have any specific magic system in mind yet, but it would have to be either something that wouldn't be possible to use until the modern age, or something that could plausibly be discovered, lost, and rediscovered continuously.

*evidently it's not actually being offered right now, but the sentiment holds

  What if there's no shady government agency, but the main characters are convinced that such an agency likely exists and are driven by this speculation to keep relatively quiet about their discovery?

    That doesn't seem very rational, though-- if you're afraid of a government agency because you hold knowledge about the supernatural, you get your name out there ASAP so they can't take you away or censor you.

      It was my immediate first thought as well; if I stumbled upon some massive secret of the universe, completely by accident, I would *not* take for granted that I was the first to do so.

      I don't know that I would go so far as to directly assume "government conspiracy," myself. It's just that if a such simple but far-reaching truth exists, but is not widely known, there may be any number of reasons it remains a secret which are less immediately obvious than the direct ramifications of the power itself.

      Additionally, if I *am* the only current holder of the secret, I'm in no rush to claim any Randi-esque prizes, and should focus on R&D until I know what advantages I could get by keeping it secret, if any. If I'm *not* actually the sole user, claiming the prize carries risks of unknown magnitude, and I would be better off focusing on R&D until I know what advantages I could maintain in the event it *does* go public.

      Finally, if there isn't really a conspiracy of any kind in place to limit *my* knowledge and use of the secret, then there's a narrative void I might as well fill, right? Maybe get some friends together, start my own agency, hopefully have fun with it!

      tl;dr CONSTANT VIGILANCE

        I'd think about it like this.

        Assuming I discovered magic, while I'd like to believe I'm above average, I'm nowhere near exceptional enough that I could reasonably believe I'm the only person who could have discovered it. But given that the magic would be something axiomatically only possible in the modern age (that is, I'd construct the magic system so that would be an obvious conclusion) it would be reasonable to expect that either I got to the discovery first by luck, or that other people got the discovery but where then silenced.

        In the second case, I'm basically guaranteed to be boned regardless, so I might as well make it public and try to profit. In the first case, however, I have a strong incentive to go to the media, because someone else will probably discover the magic eventually, thus removing my advantage, so I might as well try to capitalize early. Of course, the "cooperate" option would be for any individual who got magic to stay silent, and thus get an advantage before the rest of the world at large catches on, but you only need one person to say "screw it, I'm going to be famous" and everyone else is thrown under a bus. It's like the prisoner's dilemma, but with no chance for coordination.

        Though writing this has given me an idea, actually. Maybe I could make a magic system where all magicians become immediately aware of new magicians, and are aware that they become aware. Then there's an obvious reason to keep silent (don't get sensory overload from new magicians) and an easy way to coordinate. This bears further investigation.

      "Richard Leviss, 45, was arrested Tuesday on murder charges. Prior to his death, he orchestrated a number of hoaxes centered around his aparent ability to conjure and throw spears of blue flame. These culminated in an altercation with police forces, in which Richard set a bystander on fire and burned him to death before being shot by police. Upon examination, his ability was in fact the product of a home-made flamethrower he hid beneath his clothes, a design several experts have commended for being "horrifically effective". Richard is currently in hospital with non-critical wounds."

        And then what? The government, or the freemasons, or the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants just hides this incredibly useful magic without using it themselves? Either magic is useful enough to, you know, get used, in which case it's going to get out one way or another anyways (it only takes one defector) or it's useless and thus there's no need to suppress it.

        Of course, I can see an *irrational* agency or group trying to keep stuff secret just because, but writing dumb villains isn't appealing.

        It's like the moon landings. The knowledge that the moon landings are fake would be so compelling that it would be impossible to keep hidden, because each and every person could stand to gain something from revealing it, even if they're not outright antagonistic to the US.

          If the shadowy government conspiracy holds a monopoly on current tech, AND magic is superior, AND one defector is sufficient to promulgate a full magitech revolution, then there is *still* a motivation to collude. Since one defector is sufficient to break the monopoly then we may conclude that the new method (magic) lacks the barriers to entry of the old (tech). Thus no defector can hold on to the advantage of defecting long enough to make defection profitable before perfect competition kicks in. 

          This equilibrium becomes more sustainable as probability of detection of new users goes up.

            > defection profitable before perfect competition kicks in.

            It's not hard to make an immediate, short-term profit, however. If you become known as "they guy who revealed magic" you're basically guaranteed book deals, talk show appearances, and, as I said, money from prizes like the Randi Foundation seeking to disprove the supernatural. If it took a long time to make a profit, colluding would of course be beneficial, since the cabal could easily punish defectors, but as it stands, it doesn't. Indeed, the sheer number of ways to convert magic into cash kind of implies that there is no secret organization trying to block the propagation of magic. And of course, you're likely to get the kind of people who have strong personal beliefs regarding the freedom of information as a matter of statistics, of people who already are part of large organizations that would likely defend them.
            ```

            - u/earnestadmission:
              ```
              Not if the conspiracy is playing an immediate and maximal punishment. Say revealing magic to the public nets an instantaneous 5 billion dollars. If the conspiracy captures you within the business week, then that gives you a billion dollars to spend each day. Maybe you can spend that much, but I doubt I'd be able to. And I certainly wouldn't be able to put together an adequate (active) defense against a shadowy conspiracy within 5 days, for any amount of money.

              As long as the conspiracy plays a sufficiently odious punishment with high probability of detection, I'm inclined to think that arbitrarily high amounts of money don't translate into positive net utility.

              You seem to have a very particular idea of what magic exists, what incentives exist for the surrounding world, and so on. Why not just write the discovery scene (for your main character) and see what consequences feel most natural?

      I think that's a little naive. The only way "getting your name out there" would protect you is if your only fear was your reputation. If you're afraid of being arrested on trumped up charges, or outright assassinated, then keeping things secret is incredibly important.

      And those are both reasonable fears considering modern government.
      ```

      - u/GaBeRockKing:

        My thinking is that if the information is already out there, there would be no point to assassinating me, because then all that does is convince other people there's something to hide. Character assassination would be a threat, of course, but what's the point?

  ```
  Say little about societal outcomes, and let readers work out something consistent from hints in your characters lives.

  There are basically two approaches, both of which largely avoid looking at a national scale.  

  1. Before blowing the secret wide open.  Reflect on the absence of known magic - either it's new, or there's some filter you don't know about.  What's the appropriate level of paranoia to defeat a thus-far-perfect conspiracy?  (story ends at go-time, unclear if it worked)

  2. A decade or two after; in the style of *Snow Crash* or similar.  Mostly character-driven in a weird setting.

  What if it was previously a scam, but a small change made it into actual magic?  The two things I can think up for this are homeopathy actually creating magical potions (with precisely the right procedures) and psychics/mediums/dowsers having high (but imperfect) accuracy.

  As for keeping the scope small, the practitioners wouldn't spread their knowledge for a combination of two reasons:  They are drowned out by all of the scams (which they incorrectly assume are the real thing), and because they aren't that good at marketing or that business-oriented.
  ```

- u/scruiser:
  ```
  If magic depends on secrecy/mystery to work properly then it makes sense to hide it in order to preserve its power.  To this end there are multiple different magic rules/systems that may make this work.  Here are some examples:

  The more people know/use a spell, the weaker it is, its power is divided among people. (See Nasuverse, the setting Fate/Stay Night for an example of this in the backstory)

  Magi is limited by belief (Like in the Old World of Darkness setting).  Using magic in public forces the user to disguise it as something mundane or not use it at all.

  Magic is easily/automatically disrupted by people observing it/examining it (Like the mad science in Genius the Transgression fan expansion for New World of Darkness)

  Magic fundamentally tries to hide itself and karmically punishes people who expose it (See Wildbow's Pact for an example of this)

  Mix and match these types of limitations as fits with your magic system.  You can have the main characters accept magic's limits as a given after minimal experimentation, or make it a running plot point where they try to find a way around these limitations to make magic known to the world and/or accomplish whatever other goals they have driving the plot arc.
  ```

- u/DocFuture:
  ```
  Have the characters that first discover it be smart enough to know it would cause faster political and economic disruption than our present system can deal with without collapse and war.  So they need to disguise the effects as something else at first.
  ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    Could work. The main problem is how the character expects to deal with other people discovering the magic-- there's no guarantee future mages would have anything resembling similar values.
    ```

    - u/DocFuture:
      ```
      Yup, that's going to be a problem however you slice it--and can add a nice sense of urgency if you turn it into a plot element 8-)
      ```

      - u/Jiro_T:
        ```
        That's a specific case of a different problem: why is the protagonist the first person to discover it?  If there's a serious threat of other people discovering it in the future, there's also the possibility that other people have already discovered it in the past and the protagonist is just a latecomer to the whole thing.

        (Unless there's some reason why it was only discovered *now*--you need a specific level of computer tech to do it, the Earth just passed into a region of space that supports the supernatural, etc.)
        ```

- u/TennisMaster2:
  ```
  The movie *Chronicle* (2012) might offer you some inspiration; watch it without knowing anything beforehand, don't read about it.

  My suggestion: Have the discoverers be researchers in an outpost in Antarctica, or villagers of an Alaskan, Greenlander, Siberian town with limited contact with the outside world.  Limit your timeframe to changes to the town over a predefined span of time, perhaps the time between supply missions, or during a month-long night (the vampire movie *30 Days of Night* did this).  Have the town cut off internet access, and you have your sandbox.

  The story's end could be an epilogue written in the style of a traveler's tale of one sent to discover why the town or outpost went off-grid.

      This is where research comes in. 

      Choose something very small -- perhaps the [Amundsen-Scott station at the South Pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amundsen–Scott_South_Pole_Station), which is about 50 people in the winter. That's a manageable number. Read up on it, find some biographies of people who worked there, research the Pole -- what lives there, temperatures, etc. 

      If you want something even smaller, try a research mission in the back woods somewhere, with just half a dozen people. Again, find similar examples in real life and read up. 

      You don't need to be a world-class expert. Your audience isn't going to know anything about the A-S Station, so as long as what you write sounds plausible you'll be fine. (You still need to do the research, though, or you won't sound plausible.)

      When I wrote Baby Blues I did an insane amount of research -- tide tables and current maps for the East River, crime statistics / demographics / income levels in the Bronx and Queens, etc. For everything I've written set in "the real world" (including Baby Blues) I've spent a ton of time on Google Street Maps and Google Earth looking at what's in the location I'm writing about. 

      For Induction, I needed a location that would have certain elements, one of which was a marina with boats large enough for several dozen 
      people. A lot of digging on GSV and GE led me to Vermillion, Ohio. 

      The good news is that the research is fun all unto itself, so give it a chance. 

      One more thing: Don't ever say "I'm not the sort of author who could write that" -- that's just a lazy copout. You can write anything you can dream up, you simply need to do the work to develop the necessary skills and knowledge.

  There would not be a reason to tell Randi, if you could make money easily without. 

  Magic could be given by demons or some intelligent party, who would take it away if revealed. This is why you can't demonstrate magic.

  Maybe magic actually would not work around sceptics? It would depend on intent, and trying to prove it works just is not a good mindset of casting a spell?
  ```

- u/None:

  I think there is not going to be much immediate effect, actually. If we take a look at a person with no access to magic, they observe 'magic-like' things frequently, but this is ignored by the cultural belief that 'magic does not exist'. If we see someone on TV performing 'healing', it doesn't matter if we cannot explain the healing, we know it to be fake. So there is little reason to believe that the average person is going to believe in magic immediately if it does exist.

  Some people on the fringes might organise information about magic, but they are also not going to be able to distinguish between true magic and false magic, because they believe false magic is true magic in the first place. Unreliable information about magic and the general lack of credibility on the fringes is going to further the delay of any realisation that magic is real.

  Those are the considerations for people with no access to magic. What about the people with access to magic? This depends on what exactly your magic is. If your magic does things like bring back the dead, then maybe it'll take a year or two for the majority to believe in magic. If your magic is to create a lighter fire from your finger, or requires development and expertise to use well, that is not immediately advantageous, then it might be two decades before the majority agrees.

  Gradually, more and more people are going to believe magic exists as more and more evidence appears. But it's not going to immediate, and that is the key. 'Is it real?' allows the thinking sort to hypothesise structures and organisation, possibilities and danger. 'Is it real?' also prevents the government from acting, or it'll look stupid if it isn't. So it's never going to be a complete surprise with all the overreaction and coverups that suggests.

  Sorry that this doesn't really directly answer your question. I would like to see a story about a society that gradually learns the truth from multiple different limited perspectives though, sort of like World War Z the book.

    It could work, but of the specific areas I think I could describe accurately, anything special enough about them to justify that would also lead to including some mid-to-large cities. So hard-limiting the geographic area alone wouldn't do a good job of keeping a reasonable limit on the extend to which the magic could go "foomf."

  Have a number of limitations that minimize the risk.

  1. Randi prize is a supernatural body chop shot. Lots of supernatural beings do go to it, and get cut up and sold on the magic black market or sold into slavery to the military and businesses.

  2. Magic gives off electromagnetic fields which tends to make electronic cameras fail around it. This can be dealt with, but makes observing magic trickier.

  3. There are open (not secret) government schemes to stamp out belief in magic http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-17006924 ostensibly to stop child abuse.

  4. http://www.gallup.com/poll/19558/paranormal-beliefs-come-supernaturally-some.aspx Around 10-20% of the populace believes in magic, perhaps due to a personal encounter. 

  5. http://www.spellsofmagic.com/tips.html There are, online, a number of accurate and detailed guides as to how to do magic, as well as a number of tv shows devoted to showing off magic. 

  6. In places where the government isn't working as hard to stamp out belief in witchcraft, like Africa http://www.livescience.com/8515-belief-witchcraft-widespread-africa.html belief in magic is widespread. 

  7. http://www.safechildafrica.org/ There are a number of charities designed to protect witches from abuse in africa and stamp out belief in magic. 

  8. http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/witches-guinea-pigs-dilemma-censorship/management/article/1289813 there are active attempts to censor media involving magic, heavily led by the churches. This prevents too many obvious magic things getting onto youtube. Magic organizations likewise use their pull with the media, governments to minimize mass media exposure.
