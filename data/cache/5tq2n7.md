  For the first time, I am actually considering the possibility that not all of the children might actually make it out alive. I was confident that this manga would follow other shounen manga by having an "everyone lives!" ending. While I know that good stories are supposed to make me doubt this idea while reading, this chapter has succesfully shaken my belief in a guaranteed happy ending.

  Props to the author for creating such an engaging story.

  Holy crap, the mangaka took the story a turn I had no clue they'd even try to go to. Woweee.
