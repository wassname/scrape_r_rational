World War Two

"....Written by M.J Blanks, this series chronicle the fictional development of the atomic bomb...."

Fucking World War Two.

It was less of a book series and more like a genre, published singularly by the Watson company since the turn of the twentieth century, and since then, had spread to every corner of the Earth.

Not even Shakespeare can measure up to its influence on human civilization.

Now, it was required reading, snapping any hope of enjoying it all.

A loud thud shook me awake. The teacher had slammed a thick book against the top of my assigned desk.

"Wake up, Mr. Nakamoto," Mr. Fruegson said. "You have detention for the afternoon."

Giggles followed.

"Think this is funny?" he asked in a totally unamused tone.

The most boring lecturer in the history of man would do well if he was actually interesting. He wasn't. Literature class sucked every interest and curiosity out of reading. Now this man had the aducacity to butcher World War Two.

It made Nakamoto sick of world war two. He was cursing every moment of it even as his little brother took in rapt attention as was common for everyone growing up. It was the best that anyone had ever published, since or before in the history of man.

The bell rung.

"Remember! Extra credit for anyone who watched and reviewed the latest world war two movie in celebration of Watson's first WW2 book being published!"

Right. Extra credits.

Nakamoto supposed he should watch it, *The Nuking of Japan*. Even if he didn't, he already knew the novels by heart.

When he was young, he had been enthralled by *The Manhattan Project*, *The Nuking of Japan*, *The Unbearable Surrender*, and other topics related to Japan and nuclear weaponry. The nuking of course, never happened. Nobody was ever nuked.

The Great European War did, and as soon as the war was over, everybody realized the prophetic nature of the books published by the Watson company.

Of course, it didn't prevent all the misery in the world, but a second world war didn't break out.

Would a second world war happen after The Great European War? Nakamoto frequently ponder this question, but dismiss it as unlikely.

Some details in WW2 was just ridiculous no matter how realistically portrayed.

  The idea is that the entire history of WW2 and a little bit after that is published as a series of book in a different timeline, written by the best novelists in the world, and true to the history of WW2.

    If I got ROB'd into another world, making a fictionalized (and poorly recalled) WW2 into a novel series would definitely be one of my goals.

  Well. Didn't you know? Fiction is just the human race expressing it's psychic potential to tune in to other worlds, limited by the authors psychic skill. Most fiction sticks pretty close to spectrum close to our world as it's easier to home in on.

  Good quality rat fic? Well, they've just seriously honed their ability to hit worlds very similar to ours in their targeted requirements.

  And of course inter dimensional psychics are only interested in seeing the entertaining bits!
