    I don’t know if I missed a sentence but did time flow faster while fenn and Juniper talked? Was that one of that hell’s rules or does it extend over all the hells?

        Interestingly, isnt' thee years the time that a bottled soul survives? 

        Also, he seems to have been dropped into hell right when rune magic was excluded.
        ```

        - u/Prankster42:
          ```
          Probably the rune magic exclusion was due to the antimatter bomb used on fel seed. So the reson they went ahead with this plan might have been because time was short on getting Juniper unbottled.

      I believe the infernal lied to Juniper when he said that they were recent arrivals. The interrogation happened 3 years after they arrived.

      Edit: Wait, never mind. Juniper had been bottled, and they resolved that by nuking the City of a Thousand Brides 3 years later.

        OH. I thought he wasn’t bottled but they bombed the place just in case.

          ```
          Considering the level of threat he actually posed (evening he had no chance) and the amount of power he managed to bring to bear, it was likely a risk management act. Better to have him gone to oblivion than knocking about in hell, where he could cause trouble down the line.

          That, or he just wanted a souvenir of the only impressive fight he's had in a LONG time.

  Thoughts

  * it was fun to see so many chekhov guns go off! AW must have fun writing these chapters
  * hell-a-copter was a real delight, not to mention doom sun, chaos moon, yellow-fall 
  * we could call that he'd seen Fenn from a mile away, but it was still great
  * It was surprisingly fun to see Lisi! Didn't know she had it in her to do something badass like this.
  * Tension was really high, first from the chilly meeting with the DM, then the frantic tension from Mary showing up and the slow reveals of all the bad shit going down

  I have to wonder why DiceGuy acted the way he did. He seemed so _final_ - but at this point, the party's plan for hell extraction was already underway. Was he just lying? It all seemed just _off_, and I have some crack theories about DiceGuy not being as in-control or all-knowing as he seems, but it might just be that DiceGuy was playing the thematically appropriate role of the contemptuous DM.

      Same here. I thought it was odd Joon didn't recognize the yellow-fall given his general intuition for what was going on in each of the other hells.

      Doom sun just seems like such a childish name compared to some of the wild and exotic stuff we've seen though, lol.

        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          I assume as a joke about yellow snow, especially with the mention of it smelling like ammonia.

          The Pokémon game names are kind of simplistic in the same way the hell-names are so I wouldn’t be sure without a few more examples... (I think a red and a blue name would be enough to convince me).

    > crack theories

    These new pages fit pretty well with theories that >!the DM was in some way a copy of Juniper, maybe from not that long after Arthur's death, who made an 'interesting heaven' for Arthur that went wrong before turning it into an interesting adventure for a copy of himself.!<
    ```

  - u/TheDefterus:
    ```
    I don't think causality as such exists normally. 

    Don't get me wrong, the Plan had to have been in motion for 3 years for this to make sense.. and that could be the  case. But Fel Seed bottling Juniper, really? That's the kind of 180 move you make your villain pull if the party does something to suddenly, if not deserve, open the possibility of victory. 

    I think the DiceGuy intended it to be final, and but he really really wanted to keep it going just like with Uther, so when Juniper asked him give them a fair 2nd round he retconned the bottling and the rest falls into place easily.
    ```

    - u/ashinator92:
      ```
      Does fel seed really have a personality? He seems to be described as 'fel seed wins, you lose'. 

      Same argument could be made for why fel seed would use supersonic rocks as a deterrent. But he did.
      ```

- u/adgnatum:
  ```
  I was not expecting that meeting with the Dungeon master. The claim that he couldn't have met with Juniper without the Helldiver setting enabled is an interesting detail. The postmortem of how the DM misunderstood Arthur and how Arthur *rejected* the call to adventure was quite compelling. I was surprised to hear the DM speak so openly of his hatred.

  Infernal negotiations take a backseat to a reunion of sorts, even if a (lack of subjective) time hasn't cured any wounds in the interim. It seems appropriate to the characters involved.

  Ah, so Juniper *was* bottled by Fel Seed. Curious. Certainly very genre-savvy. Or perhaps he had some use for Juniper's soul? But the soul magic exclusion would prevent most of those...  
  Maybe the Fel Seed entity read *Degenerate Cycles*?

  I find myself curious about the failed ways to extract someone from the hells. The rune magic exclusion (I'd found the possibility troubling) was from the (non-void !?) antimatter bomb. The actual soul retrieval method might not have itself been exclusion-worthy.
  ```

  - u/ZurrgabDaVinci758:
    ```
    > was surprised to hear the DM speak so openly of his hatred.

    He made it sound very personal, which I think adds credence to the DM=Juniper theories. Fits very well with his own self hatred. Noone else would hate him for the fell seed incident so much
    ```

    - u/abcd_z:
      ```
      I still think the DM is more of a self-insert than Juniper is.
      ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      Enough to create the hells? And to screw with Arthur for fun for so long? The DM might be a part of Juniper, but he isn't just a different version of Juniper. Or at least not one constrained by a human psyche.
      ```

      - u/Xtraordinaire:
        ```
        Yeah, that's my thought as well. Want to torment Joon and maybe Arthur, fine. Dick move, but okay. But don't drag others into this shit.

            There are no p-zombies. If you think that someone is a p-zombie, you're just modelling at the wrong layer.
            ```

            - u/ImNotABotYoureABot:
              ```
              You seem pretty confident making that statement. Wouldn't we need to know the answer to the hard problem of consciousness to say that? (I'm counting 'there is no problem' as a solution, here.) To my knowledge, nothing definitive has been discovered.

              Even if you accepted that there was no problem, you still would need to prove that *any* system that can give rise to *apparent* sapience would also give rise to qualia to say that the simulations Joon interacts with are not p-zombies, no?
              ```

              - u/EDSorow:
                ```
                How would you test if someone is a p-zombie if they are physically indistinguishable from a normal person? How would you ever know if p-zombies exist? How would you ever come up with an explanation for how p-zombies work, if there is no physical explanation nor anyway to behaviorally distinguish between people and p-zombies? P-zombies are not a real thing, nor do I think it's meaningful to talk as if they are.

                This whole AI simulating a person thing isn't even a question about p-zombies. There are other potential avenues to produce realistic (seeming) Human simulations that are not p-zombies, nor sentient beings. In other words, you just need to fool Joon
                ```

                - u/ImNotABotYoureABot:
                  ```
                  > How would you test if someone is a p-zombie if they are physically indistinguishable from a normal person? How would you ever know if p-zombies exist? How would you ever come up with an explanation for how p-zombies work, if there is no physical explanation nor anyway to behaviorally distinguish between people and p-zombies?

                  It's impossible, but that's the point of the thought experiment. Because p-zombies are *logically* possible, it follows that there is an insurmountable gap between explaining the physical (which includes the functional components of consciousness) and qualia (subjective experience).

                  Chalmer's book is probably the best source if you want to read up on the precise reasoning. Keep in mind that there are some steps in the chain of logic that people disagree with. Personally, I find that any argument that stems from logical possibility very odd, but I'm not a philosopher.

                  I doubt anyone reasonable seriously considers the actual existence of p-zombies, but the fact that, even with a perfect understanding of the physical world, it's impossible to prove someone else is not a p-zombie is what's so interesting about them.

                  I agree with your second point, like I mentioned.
                  ```

              - u/thereisnojellyworld:
                ```
                in order for a p-zombie to effectively blend in with real humans, there must be someone or something smart and perceptive enough to write out a list of most possible situations the zombie will encounter and a list of responses the p-zombie must make for each one. but to actually write out those lists requires having a map of a hypothetical person to imitate in the first place. the intelligence writing those lists would need to visualize that hypothetical person in enough detail to actually write those lists in sufficient detail to fool real humans.

                for all "you" "know", "you" could be a p-zombie without "realizing" it. the only way to "know" would be to find "yourself" in a very particular niche situation where you "know" for a fact that you would have a "mental", "emotional", or behavioral response to it if you were "thinking" "feeling" and acting like "yourself", but instead "you" have no response at all. and then "you" would need to "notice" that, assuming that "noticing" it is even a response on "your" list of responses to begin with.

                if "you" do "notice" it, "you" may also have a response on "your" response list which says to say the following sentence or a paraphrased version of it, whether or not anyone is around to hear it: "that means there was a situation which this zombie encountered which its list of situations did not include, or which its list of responses did not include a response for."

                ~~>!p-zombies aren't merely nonexistent, the very concept of a p-zombie is incoherent.!<~~
                ```

                - u/ImNotABotYoureABot:
                  ```
                  I don't really understand your argument. Are you saying mapping out a person would necessarily generate qualia?

                  It's impossible to be a p-zombie without realizing it. If you have qualia, you're not. The whole point of p-zombies is that they're physically indistinguishable from beings with qualia. It's impossible by definition to disprove someone is not a p-zombie with physical means - if it is, they're something else.
                  ```

                  - u/thereisnojellyworld:
                    ```
                    p-zombies are impossible by definition too, if it looks like a human, talks like a human, and acts like a human in every possible situation, then it's a human. without either having qualia or having a sufficiently detailed and sophisticated model of qualia,  your "zombie" can't imitate humans well enough to blend in with them let alone act like a human in most situations.

                    qualia are just sensations/feelings, which is something the brain does.

                    the essential "domains" of the human psyche loosely match up to functional brain anatomy:

                    Mind= left brain aka the more logical and analytical part

                    Soul = right brain aka the more emotional part of you which tends to be more involved in music and art etc.

                    Vision = back brain aka the part of you which "absorbs signals from sensory stimuli" which is another way of saying "sensation" or "qualia".

                    Will = front brain aka the motor cortex aka the part of you which outputs actions.

                    the very concept of p-zombies is incoherent.
                    ```

            - u/--MCMC--:
              ```
              Even absent sufficiently convincing automatons, actors exist. You could have entities who have that spark of sentience whose every word and expression is pretend, which to me seems ethically pretty indistinguishable from p-zombies.
              ```

              - u/wren42:
                ```
                This exactly.  An AI pretending to be a person is not the same as that person existing as a complete conscious entity.  We can be fooled by actors, therefore it's possible for convincing non-conscious simulacrums to exist.  The hard test for consciousness is not human credulity.

      ```
      I don't know.  This batch actually took me the other way, so that I think that's now *less* than a 50/50 shot.  And that was from a prior of >80% certainty that DM=Juniper.

      Joon loved Arthur so much that losing him **broke** him.  I don't think any version of Joon, especially not some future version of Joon that has gained DM powers, would do what the DM did to him.

      I suppose it could all be "DiceGuy was playing the thematically appropriate role of the contemptuous DM" as u/tjhance suggested, but if the DM is being honest...  No, I think the DM is someone else.  I still have to sort it out (best current guess for not-Juniper DM is "one of the other Earth gamers," with an off-the-top-of-my-head ordering of Arthur, Reimer, Craig, Tiff, Maggie, and Tom, from most to least likely).
      ```

      - u/kurtofconspiracy:
        ```
        I'd put Reimer before Arthur. He is the kind of person to iteratively hack himself into omnipotence and cruelty after being uploaded. Tiff would have the most reason to do it, but also most reason to not. The idea doesn't feel quite right about anyone.
        ```

        - u/Nimelennar:
          ```
          Yeah, I agree about Reimer, especially since the Reimer expy ended up with another Penndraig.  The big reason that I put Arthur first was because (according to the DM) Aerb was made, by the DM, for Arthur. And I think that's something someone would do for themselves or someone else they really liked, and I didn't get the sense that Reimer was that close to Arthur.  That one piece of information is being weighted very heavily in my contemplation of this mystery, and that weighting pushes Arthur past Reimer.

    - u/JonRain:
      ```
      The only reason I can't understand the DM being Juniper is the fact that I can't see "our" Juniper creating this Hell called Aerb and sentencing millions upon millions of beings to eternal torture for any reason. Now if we say that most if not all the "beings" on Aerb are p-zombies then I suppose it's not as bad. But at the very least if the DM is Juniper then he is clearly from some alternate timeline or universe where I guess he became a sick twisted fuck on a cosmic scale.
      ```

      - u/DavidGretzschel:
        ```
        Why would they be p-zombies?   
        Just fake all the infernoscope feeds, noone is ever escaping the hells and it's not like you can count all the 9 trillion demons. That's what I'd consider ethical game design, anyway. Had I no ethics, then I'd still do it for efficient game design. Really, given the backend portal having Schlossvolk influence, that's probably their job. To make the illusion so damn good, that everyone thinks, the hells are real. Procedurally generate and retcon on the fly.  


        If I was to be a player in the game, I'd also totally manipulate my internal processes, so that whenever I consider the illusion, I'll not find it convincing.  
        That's all gonna be in the sequel "We are selling so many candles! Fuck yeah!", though. It focusses on VR game design, corporate politics and the societal ramifications of readily available hyperstimuli.

            ```
            Yeah I can see how it can be read wrong since these chapters are specifically about hell, you're right that I meant the whole of Aerb though. Obviously the hells in Aerb are terrible, but the whole of Aerb itself is just filled with horrific realities and beings that can not be beaten. So unless there is a point to the DM having created this would besides putting Juniper into it then it just seems cruel even compared to how cruel our own reality can be a times.

          I'm a little confused as well. Is there a time dilation effect between the hells and Aerb that has been previously unmentioned; or was Joon game over'ed, bottled by Fel Seed, and nuked into hell by Mary for the 3yr time difference? Or maybe the dilation occurred during the DM conversation for some inscrutable reason?

              It is very unclear! Joon had a perk called Dead Man's Switch:

              >◻ Dead-man's Switch

              >If you would suffer a fate worse than death, you die instead.

              It seems like between that perk and the Helldiver option, Joon was designed to go to hell upon death, bypassing torture or bottling or anything that would have prevented a trip to hell.

              But yeah, I'm leaning towards your explanation, especially after reading some other comments. 

              Joon was in stasis, for some reason, until he was sent to hell via WMD. I don't think we'll get the "some reason" defined, but I'm still curious as to what happened there.

                Dead Man's Switch is actually not active. Juniper considered toggling it on, but decided not to. From "Diamond and Iron":

                >Similarly, the “Dead Man’s Switch” would kill me if I was going to suffer a fate worse than death. That seemed on the surface like a similar deal with regards to death and suffering, but it left me asking the question of “Worse by whose definition?” so the checkbox was also left unchecked.

  A 3 year time skip, the rune magic exclusion zone, this really feels like the endgame. Really no choice left but to try to beat Fel Seed fast.

  I only wish that the hells arc was longer than this (dialogue with only 1 infernal in the whole mini arc...), with some POV chapters of other people too, like Amaryllis. This was competently done, but it seems to me AW wants to end the story, fast.

  - u/eltegid:
    ```
    I think that any interaction with the infernals as presented is a losing one, it just means being tortured. So a longer arc would probably mean some torture along the way and being more explicit about the horrors of the hells.

    I expected something longer, with the game layer active in the hells, but I'm completely fine with it being resolved this quickly and neither Joon nor us having to dwell on the horrors and discomfort down there.
    ```

- u/ZurrgabDaVinci758:
  ```
  >“What was Fel Seed’s weakness?” I asked.

  >“There’s an entity that exists above him,” replied the Dungeon Master. He pointed to himself. “But you already knew that.” He had already heard my prayers on the matter.

  >“So all I had to do was convince you to let us through?” I asked. “Convince you that he shouldn’t have killed us? That it wasn’t fun or entertaining?”

  >“Maybe,” he shrugged. “What would have convinced you, when you were the DM?”

  >“At the time, nothing,” I replied. “Except maybe if the characters had been thinking, feeling creatures, not just avatars.”

  >“That didn’t stop you from doing your best to inflict harm on the players,”

  I take this as semi confirming the theory from the comments on the last chapter that the point of the Fell Seed encounter was that Juniper should realise that the out of game considerations should take precedence and if the game isn't fun it should stop. Though the DM stops short of confirming it. Sounds a bit like the DM, like Juniper in the original incident, didn't actually have a plan for how it would all end, so he's saying that maybe he could have been convinced, but that it wasn't what he had been planning?

  - u/TridentTine:
    ```
    Yeah. Personally, I thought it was a shape-changing devil come to try and give false hope/extract information, because Fenn had mentioned Amaryllis' name shortly before the demon left. I guess that doesn't necessarily make sense if the demon he was talking to was being truthful? But I still don't see why Joon would have not even checked.

    E: Oh, OK, it's explained literally at the start of the chapter. Clearly not paying enough attention.
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      Yeah, he says that shape-shifting infernals don't exist, but *come on*. What if the infernals had eg a long-dead cousin of Amaryllis lying around for an occasion like this, or a secret shapeshifting hell-entad that they kept in their pocket, or *something*?

      Especially since Mary's behavior had a strong vibe of "put the mark under time pressure so he doesn't take the time to think critically".
      ```

      - u/LeifCarrotson:
        ```
        I'd paused when that happened, too.

        In-story, it appeared too good to be true, in a setting where stuff too good to be true is practically guaranteed to be a lie calculated to produce maximum suffering. The timing felt off (I didn't understand why Fenn appeared when she did, I hadn't guessed at the 3-year Fel Seed bottled time skip). Narratively, I assumed that he'd have lots more time to either acclimate as a hermit hidden away in an upper hell or to become a broken, kept mortal with no hope of escape.

        My hypothesis was that the infernals had somehow messed with his perception of time, and had introduced Fenn and subsequently Amaryllis after breaking them both, in an attempt to produce maximum suffering. "Convince Juniper you're here with a grand rescue plan or we'll resume another subjective century of torture" would be indistinguishable from everything we already saw. But, of course, keyrings wouldn't help if the target was not an imitation but the actual person, fully turned against you.

  I'm mildly disappointed that no one used Face Protocols. I would be happy to see Amaryllis too, but surely Joon is smart enough not to just shrug and say "I don't know about shapeshifting infernals or hell-entads, so they must not exist."

  Maybe paranoia and strings of arbitrary words make for tedious storytelling and the omission is on aesthetic grounds, but it feels like an oversight unless this is all a trick to get Joon to the Omega Hell.
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Yeah, that was my immediate reaction, until Mary namedropped Grak. Still, the part where she shut down Fenn and called Valencia "the weapon" felt sus as hell.

    "Sure, Mary, let me rush my way to the place where infernals have the most control and information, in a way that might lead Val to lose track of me depending on how precise soul descent is and how accurate infernoscopes are. Oh, there's a time pressure and we can't ask any follow-up questions? Well then I better follow your instructions blindly and not think about this too hard."

      If the Infernals wanted him in the bottom hell, they wouldn't need his cooperation for that.

      I was weighing evidence for and against this throughout this batch. In the end I'm 95% certain it's real. The "the weapon" line was most likely a precaution because:

Not that I want her to be bitter and angry, but it just makes her feel more... normal. Real. Like she's a character with her own agency instead of just a potential love interest for Juniper.

  Also, was anyone else surprised at how much of a nonissue the hells were? There was still danger and drama and such in these chapters, but the "I'm in hell, what do I do now" bit didn't last long at all.

    Well, having a *schloss* be a big, borderline meta-textual, part of the solution makes sense at that level. If the rescue operation is only possible through *deus ex machina* then using the in-world mechanisms for creating *deus ex machina* is sound strategy.

  Re first and second chapters:

  Hells are just as creatively awful as we were promised, and this is supposed to be one of the nicer ones. Reminds me a bit of the hells in Iain M Banks Surface Detail. It's easy for descriptions of hell to become uninteresting as pain as an end in itself is monotonous, but details keep it concrete

  Fenn being back is cool. I'd forgotten how snarky she was. And her dislike of Juniper at the point she died. Opportunity maybe to demonstrate a bit of his character development in dealing with her. The summary of all the insane things that happened in the relatively short time since she died was funny as well.

  I hadn't been anticipating them at they'd be able to use the threat of Valencia to gain leverage in the hells, but it makes sense given the infernals have organised to deal with it, and the prospect of genuine death would be terrifying to them. Would be interesting to get some insight into the psychology of the infernals themselves, their design makes them pitiable and tragic in their own way. Possibly that they'd welcome the change given the option.
  ```

  - u/ZurrgabDaVinci758:
    ```
    >Possibly that they'd welcome the change given the option.

    Occurs to me that one option for dealing with the unified hells would be recruiting a group of infernals to their side. Offer places in the new hells to lots of the lower ranked infernals for whom the current system isn't working. So would rather take the chance of an alternative over their current situation of a reliable tiny amount of human suffering to feed on
    ```

    - u/gramineous:
      ```
      Teaching people that are deeply ingrained to trust no one, and that any positive emotion comes from fighting tooth and nail for it against everyone else, was bought up in the Doris Finch arc and it took one of them reaching the power of a god to feel secure enough to be able to start trying to trust another. Hell pre-dates Doris, and the average impoverished demon won't be willing to trust anyone from Aerb, less so when they're actively attempting to wipe out all demons, and less so again after however many years they spent seeing non-demons as commodities rather than forging a baseline understanding required for any dialogue.

      - u/CouteauBleu:

        On the other hand, the good guys have constant surveillance and a constant threat of immediate execution. It gives them a lot more leverage than they had at the beginning of the DFEZ.

        Have 10 demons lined up in a room, execute one of them to show you're serious, tell them they'll die if they don't obey orders, give them orders they'll inevitably refuse, kill a few of them to drive the lesson home.

  I've read 1.5million words of this story, I know damn well it's not a power fantasy and I love it for what it is, but is living up to the awesome concept of "helldiver" before reality asserts itself really that much to ask?

  I'm aware it's a thematic choice, that it's supposed to highlight the sheer hopelessness of the hells if even the Hero can barely fuck up a random mook in the top 1% without getting mangled,  but dammit I would have appreciated even a split second of Juniper going ham. Even a paragraph of [this](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/7dHtxlgFeEa0UAes80Ss0i/d6ddd7957c71d4bd76fefd62d4e9cdfe/doom-mobile-hero.jpg?q=70) and then he gets piled on and we go back to themes and subtext and allegories.

    Really, what I was hoping for was to witness *Onion* fucking all the devils up, since he seems perfectly specced towards that; I think some people predicted that back when his full skills were shown off. I hope we get a description of that at some point.

      I think you lose your blade-bound ranks when you lose your sword.

      If he prepared a Tuung blade, and got the time to train up with it up to full strength before the demons showed up, then *maybe*.

      If he ran into a demon before then, though, he probably didn't fare better than Joon and Fenn did.

        ```
        >I think you lose your blade-bound ranks when you lose your sword.

        I don't think there's *any* evidence of this. You keep your ranks, especially your stats and Parry / One-Handed / Two-handed skill levels that you needed to become a Blade-bound (Onion would be a monster with those alone)       
        You just can't use a lot of the Blade-bound-specific perks like infinitely sharp swords until you bind another weapon.

        Onion with a stick and some time to meditate and bind it should theoretically be as powerful as Onion with any other non-Entad sword.

      I mean, that's author fiat. If AW wanted to write some cool action-y stuff, there's a million things he could have done. Like had the DM let him keep one of his magic powers as a "final boon", for example.

        I'm not sure that was ever an option. I think a pacifist build gets ripped apart and never makes it out of the Risen Lands. I think this is ultimately a combat game. He could have gone a more social route, but I don't ever think pure pacifist was a realistic option.

          The memory wipe is presumably part of being reset back to being a baby - the method used just unwinds everything life has done to you, including all your experiences - which makes it ego death, of course, but that is no different from bottling. 

          Presumably the original conspiracy just raised the new Dahlia with a fiction that she was the sole heir of the previous one, and rode the coat tails of being the step parents of the entad hoard holder, and this conspiracy fell victim to Anglecyn intriques sometime between last reset and start of the plot.

            It's non falsifiable from the text, but it seems like it'd be caught by soul mages or soul monitoring, unless the watchers were in on the plan, and that seems unlikely with the infighting.

            All that said I really do like it as something that could explain the sheer effectiveness and ruthlessness of Mary while still having a moral compass. Her being centuries old and that her procedural memory is being retained or refined across iterations.

            That must be basically impossible for most others to do, as it's a form of physical immortality. Ego death is (arguably) better than outright nonexistence. If it were available at *all*, you would see a lot of people doing it instead of having children. After all, who better to trust to raise you than your own adopted child, who expects you'll return the favour?

    Nearly every Earth and Aerb romantic relationship Juniper has had is somehow linked to Arthur. 

    Tiff, obviously Arthur liked her on earth. Probably the root of a lot of this stuff.

    Amaryllis, looks exactly like Arthur's daughter. 

    Maddie/Raven, Arthur apparently  had some paternalistic feelings for Raven, Juniper acted not completely ethically with Maddie. 

    Arthur > Bethel > Juniper.

    The locus and Fenn are the only two without some clear Arthur baggage. I wonder if when the confrontation inevitably happens if all of this will get hashed out.

  But this means... Esuen led a counterrevolutionary Tuung rebellion?  
  That's so awesome!  
  I always felt, that how she was handled, outmaneuvered and done dirty would need to have consequences.  
  I hope it's something like that. And not Mary making a narrative choice.

  Not that this would be stupid for her to do, just that I think overly narrative-based decisions, even when ration always feel a little cheap to me.  
  Like Aerb is just the stage for Joon drama, instead of a rich and vibrant world.

    Is there anyone other than Amaryllis who could show up, tell Juniper, "I don't have time to explain, kill yourself 20 times and go to Omega Hell, the worst place in the universe, it'll be fine" and have Juniper agree?

    Maybe any of the companions would have done, but if you want the job done right, do it yourself. This mission is the difference between Aerb being eaten by the Void Beast and potentially reaching the Good Outcome, and we've already established that Amaryllis would make any sacrifice to get a Good Outcome instead of a bad one.  Given the importance of the mission, and the fact that staying on Aerb would be ruling a doomed land, I can't imagine Amaryllis doing anything other than handling it herself.

    >But I am curious why Mary herself had to risk all her forty selves to do this in person.

    If Mary becomes one of the few people who has returned to life, it would likely afford her a great deal of political power. If you're a friend and she asks you to do something which might get you killed, you'd probably be much more willing to trust that she can bring you back. If you're a rival, you're probably going to think there's much less of a point in trying to kill her when she's already risen from the dead once. You might as well join her since you probably can't beat her.

  Val's tendrils can go to hell and there is now a portal from hell to Aerb. Do we know what kind of eldritch horror is she? Can her tendrils go through that portal and dismantle Fel Seed?

  Secondly, Fenn being back means more elves. And her companion quest. We're going to Celestar next, because the entity above the Fel Seed is not the DM, it's that huge Celestar gun. Pew, void beast is dead. Pew, Fel Seed is gone and door opened by Overwhelming Violence.

  Finally, it is possible to convince Fel Seed that there's entity above him and it's very simple - all Juniper needs to do is to wish for a hot dog, since he still has like 96 of his hot dog wishes. Fel Seed will certainly be surprised that a hot dog appeared ex nihilo in the centre of his domain and can then be convinced of DM existence above Aerb.

        That would make sense if the center of the bell curve was the same as the average value (i.e. if the bell curve is symmetrical). But it isn't, the distribution is clipped on the left (so the value is greater then 1), which makes the average value greater than 400, which means that it would take fewer than 22 jumps.

        It does check out though if the bell curve is tight enough (e.g. if the bell curve only covers values from 1 to 799, or from 395 to 405). This way nothing is cut off and it remains symmetrical.
        ```

        - u/Xtraordinaire:
          ```
          > But it isn't

          This I missed. Why do we think it's not?

          Edit: A symmetrical bell is quite likely if it's a random number determined by several dice (as is customary in tabletops) or by several calls to rand(), as is customary in computer games.
          ```

          - u/314kabinet:
            ```
            Because if it’s wide enough, it will be clipped on the left. For example, it can go from 400 to 1000 on the right side, but it can’t go from 400 to -200 on the left, because you always go down by at least one hell. In this example we’d end up with a distribution that covers values from 1 to 1000, with a peak at 400. The average of such a distribution is necessarily above 400.

            Therefore, we can conclude that for it to work, it’s impossible to jump more that 799 hells in one go.
            ```

            - u/Gr_Cheese:
              ```
              Different guy here, but I think I'm getting what you're saying. 400 can't be the peak in a standard distribution with a start point of 1 and end point of 1000, because 500 is the middle and standard distributions have equal probabilities for each bin on each side.

              I can see where you're getting the 799 from, but I don't remember enough math to recall whether standard distributions had to have defined upper and lower bounds.

              I mean, couldn't the bin for [Down 1 Hell] and [Down 800-8999 Hells] have equal probabilities of occurring and still be considered a standard distribution? It would shift the mean, sure, but it should still be standard, no? The range of the numbers don't matter, just the probability of a value in a population falling within them?

              Is there another mathematical term you feel would be more suited to describe this distribution of probabilities?
              ```

            - u/Xtraordinaire:
              ```
              Ah, I see what you meant. I did not consider a cap on jump length of 799 to be a problem in the first place. It's actually more fitting in a video game. You can't just skip to the "Boss" hell, need to slog through some thrash hells before that.

              That said, Mary's statement can still work with a clipped curve, for example, if fall depth of 800 is outside of 3SD interval. That way the mean depth and the peak will be different, but *roughly* the same, and the average number of jumps would not change because it's an integer.

    Previously, on WtC Chapter 175:

    Juniper looked into the spirit of Speculator Masters and found a construct made by Uther that let him see the Outer Reaches, a plane of abstract ideas. The denizens of the Outer Reaches are able to retroactively instantiate modules of content on Aerb. Uther called those modules "schloss", German for castle, in honor of the story of a dude who woke up one day and apparently had been living next to a castle his whole life and never noticed it.

    So what Lisi is getting at is that Mary created a way back from the hells into Aerb by retroactively making it so that way back to Aerb had always existed.

    This also tells us something about the limits of magic in the Outer Reaches, since if Mary had her way, I doubt she'd have intentionally created a way back to Aerb that required human sacrifice. So it's probably something like, you can only retroactively create stuff in the flavor of what's already there.

    EDIT: Outer Reaches, not Other Side.

  Grak mentions that they can teleport to Fel Seed because it is now in their worldline. This got me thinking... Can they teleport to the hells too?

    Well no one can follow you down there and they've hit all the tourist spots.   
    Even with Val being dead, there might be temporarily safe options among them, assuming they don't automatically die if they visit and can teleport back without the Omega portal. The regeneration would be quite a boon.  


    But in the game layer, hells are another realm, I think. And you can't teleport to the infinite library iirc. Probably not Celestar either.

      Excellent point.

      > you can't teleport to the infinite library iirc

       I don't remember, but it makes sense to me; after all the Infinite Library resets every time someone enters or leaves. So the "place" in your worldline doesn't exist anymore.

      > Probably not Celestar either

      Is Celestar really another realm? I mean, Joon literally flew there. But you must be right, because otherwise it would have been trivial to pick up the gold left there by the gold bug.

      I imagine Mary can't teleport to p-space either.
      ```

      - u/Fredlage:
        ```
        Celestar probably still counts as part of the Prime Material Plane, but no, the teleportation key doesn’t work there, Juniper tested it when he left the gold there. I think it’s more the case that the key just works in Aerb proper, not on all of the PMP, and almost certainly not on other planes.

      - u/Seraphaestus:
        ```
        Exclusions are a random zone which sometimes follows natural boundaries or a geometric shape, of random size, which are centered on a random point such that the site of the exclusionary event lies within the zone. It's not explicitly stated if an EZ is created on the location of a calamity vs the origin of calamitous magic, but the latter makes more sense given that exclusions are sometimes non-calamitous ("silent" exclusions); the RMEZ could be centered on the rune forge where the bomb was created, for example. It could also be a zone that only intersects some part of the blast zone, but leaves out the center of the FSEZ where the door to the Long Stairs is.
        ```

        - u/Versac:
          ```
          Is it ever stated that all exclusions have a corresponding zone where the effect still works?
          ```

          - u/dantebunny:
            ```
            IIRC in-universe they don't know whether there are nonzoned exclusions or just some exclusions where they don't know where the zone is.
            ```

            - u/Versac:
              ```
              Sure, it's unfalsifiable in principle. We see an example of immediate loss of ability due to an exclusion though, and if zones can be created sufficiently disjoint from the inciting event then there's no meaningful difference.
              ```

          - u/Seraphaestus:
            ```
            No, it's ambiguous, but it's heavily implied, because exclusions which are thought to be silent are sometimes found to actually have an exclusion zone somewhere that people just didn't realize.

            You can read all the worldbuilding about the exclusionary principle [\[here\]](https://archiveofourown.org/works/20629112/chapters/48985469)
            ```

            - u/Versac:
              ```
              Right, the worldbuilding doc breaks full exclusions out as a distinct category. I wouldn't count the note of relative indistinguishability as "heavily implied", and feel like the assumption that all exclusions have a zone somewhere in the world is an unwarranted one. (Certainly not worth the weight it gets in fan speculation.)

      - u/GlimmervoidG:
        ```
        What if it was also an Enpersoned exclusion with Mary as the person? That would give her another reason to kill herself, to attempt to bypass her imprisonment.
        ```

- u/CaptainMcSmash:
  ```
  Wait, I'm a little confused about the infernal plot, correct me if I'm wrong. June dies, Mary spends 3 years searching for him with Val continuing to kill infernals slowly to look for evidence of him. This slow killing unifies the Hells though against what specifically, they don't know. They don't know why their being killed, only that their being killed. During this cold war, they make plans to hit back at Aerb to destroy this weapon and are questioning every mortal to find out what this weapon is. Mary eventually bombs Flesh City and this somehow tells them that someone with a connection to the weapon died there?? Within the space of that day, the information spreads to the entirety of Hell and they now know about Val. 

  Why are the infernals even fighting back? Aren't they notoriously selfish? And since Val can kill literally the most powerful of them as easily as the weakest, there'd be no leadership, just the vague banner of defiance to rally around. If they just give Mary and June what they want, they get to exist; refuse, and oblivion, wouldn't most make the same choice as the interrogator? 

  The idea of trees that tortursynthesize on nausea is demented and very interesting. 

  Why would Fel Seed bother bottling June? 

  Do dragons go to Hell? Would they be a delicacy or would they be too much trouble to bother torturing?

  I know there was a 3 year gap but from a story perspective it still seemed like the Hells were a cakewalk. In and out, 5 minute adventure. For something that was hyped as flatly impossible, that's a little disappointing. 

  Also, it's interesting to note but 60 chapters ago, Raven mentions they got the warning that the schlossvolk had begun interfering again; I wonder if Hell to Aerb portal was the change they made. The schlossvolk kinda seem like the answer to a lot of the intractable problems. No way to do something? Schloss! Now there is! They are straight up reality warpers and if they could just be friendjitsu'd onto Junes team...
  ```

  - u/ImNotABotYoureABot:
    ```
    The infernals reasonably suspect that the second coming of Arthur might be related to the weapon. They know June died in the Fell Seed exclusion zone and set up a system to quickly respond to his appearance in those three years, which got triggered before the team found him. The bombing would probably start their plans or at least put them on high alert. Once the descent starts, the suspicion is confirmed and they're forced to make their move.

    They're fighting back because Val can't actually kill the leaders quickly enough before they unify and invade Aerb. If they don't, she'll eradicate them all eventually. IIRC she has killed them completely at random so far to mask the killings as a potentially natural or at least undirected process, because if she'd start killing just the leaders, the infernals would mobilize too quickly.

  The thought occurs that Fel Seed is very much about control (both as a character and in origin), and he might react...interestingly to being told that his sadism is essentially a tool baked into him by "an entity above him" in order to produce specific outcomes.

              Bottling isn’t worse than death given how bad death is in Aerb, so the perk wouldn’t activate just from bottling.  Or even if it “normally” might the term “worse than death” is ambiguous enough to give the DM leeway.
