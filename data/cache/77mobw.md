## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  CGP Grey and Kurzgesagt collaboratively posted videos about old age and death today, and I don’t know if I’ve ever seen sister videos where I completely agreed with one while the other...offended me. Kurzgesagt frames the issue as about improving the length and quality of life, which we’re already doing and I’m totally on board with, while CGP opened by calling the acceptance of death a form of madness similar to Stockholm Syndrome and I instinctively felt attacked. 

  It’s not that I’m opposed in any way to what CGP wants to do, I want humans to live longer and don’t have any arbitrary limit on how long I think life should last, I just hate the way he derogatorily describes my mindset (not belief system). He doesn’t even refer to it as if it’s a mental illness or institutionalized ideology that people are victims of, but simply calls people out for thinking that way at all. This is an effective a technique for persuasion as when atheists tell theists they’re idiots. 

  I was introduced to the idea of immortality as a *good thing* by HPMOR, and the reason I was accepting of the idea at a time when I devoutly believed in New Age pseudoscience was because Yudkowsky took care to portray Harry as the smart weirdo who wasn’t always right in a world of sympathetic people who who at least thought they had good reasons to believe what they did. It placed rationality in a similar social situation as it is in reality.

  I loved how Yudkowksy seemed self aware of how most people do or would think he’s weird, how his moral convictions conflict with so many other people’s, and the potential negative outcomes of that situation. It was a humility that I see too rarely in a time when empathy for people who believe differently from you is in short supply, including in myself. I can’t help but see CGP’s statements as hubristic in an eerily similar way to religious fundamentalism. 

  EDIT: Shout out to u/eaturbrainz [response to the video](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/77lzq9/cgp_grey_about_death_and_the_false_pedestal_it/don1xp7http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/77lzq9/cgp_grey_about_death_and_the_false_pedestal_it/don1xp7) that I wholeheartedly agree with and think deserves attention regardless of what you think of my response.

    I can come up with more, hm, polite ways of talking about popular attitudes toward death without saying "stockholm syndrome," but I don't know if I can come up with a more succinct way. 

    You don't find people arguing that we ought to die at forty, or that we ought to still die from smallpox. If we lived for a thousand years, I don't think we'd have people saying that we ought to live for only five hundred years, or a hundred, or seventy.

    Somehow, magically, people seem to believe that the current human lifespan is good enough, or, if it isn't good enough, then it's just a little bit short of good enough. This, among other things, suggests that our "death is ultimately good" attitude is a coping mechanism, and "Stockholm Syndrome" seems like a pretty good shorthand for "coping mechanism which works by causing us to like the thing that is causing harm to us."

    > He doesn’t even refer to it as if it’s a mental illness or institutionalized ideology that people are victims of, but simply calls people out for thinking that way at all.

    Hmm... I've always considered this way of approaching a disagreement to be a sign of respect. If I attributed what I believe to be your false belief to mental illness or institutionalized ideology, I'm not really taking your beliefs seriously. I'd be being dismissive of you - effectively telling you that I don't think you can handle a real conversation about this. You're just a victim. You can't handle the truth. On the other hand, if I straight out tell you that I think you're wrong for reasons x, y, and z, that suggests I think you're capable of engaging in a discussion.

    Having said that, I think the opposite of your statement here might be a fair summary of why you didn't like the video. Grey didn't say, "I think you're wrong and here's why." Instead, he said that he thinks that you're wrong but you probably have Stockholm Syndrome so you can't handle a real conversation about it anyways. He essentially *did* refer to your belief as a mental illness, and that's annoyingly dismissive.

      For me, I think it’s less a belief that predicts observations and more a mindset that helps to deal with existential dread. I expect my place in the universe to be small and finite so I feel less dissatisfaction with the life I am able to live. I will continue to work to live the best life I can, but I need to remind myself that there is a limit to it. 

      If I believe that people can become truly immortal and that preserving life the *penultimate goal of existence*, then that will give any other life I choose to live less value according to my worldview. Given that I have depressive episodes due to not being as intuitively talented at achieving my goals as I’d like to be, I need existential serenity in my life.

    I find it odd when people consider whether to accept "death" based on lifespan rather than circumstance. If you're enjoying life, "death" is bad. On the other hand, if you're undergoing excruciating torture, "death" could be sweet release. 

    For example, lots of people claim to wish to be immortal, no qualifiers attached. This is a rather dangerous wish, seeing as you'll eventually end up floating in a black empty void for all eternity if the universe goes into heat death before anyone finds a way to reverse entropy.

  Weekly update on the [hopefully rational](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11QAh61C8gsL-5KbdIy5zx3IN6bv_E9UkHjwMLVQ7LHg/edit?usp=sharing) roguelike [immersive sim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbyTOAlhRHk) Pokemon Renegade, as well as the associated engine and tools. [Handy discussion links and previous threads here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EUSMDHdRdbvQJii5uoSezbjtvJpxdF6Da8zqvuW42bg/edit?usp=sharing).


  ----


  So I had zero time to work on either Renegade or XGEF this week.  As briefly mentioned last week, my work deployed a new version of our product on Sunday, and it wasn’t until Sunday night that it was pointed out to me that this basically meant I had had no weekend. Saturday had a few hours of me remoting into work and getting backups squared away, as well as shopping around for and testing a camcorder last-minute so I could record the process to document later.  Sunday was the early-morning deployment itself, which was about 5ish hours or so, but all of this meant that I was left without sufficient unwinding time to recover from the previous week (which was more stressful than average due to needing to prepare for a deployment with only scraps of documentation). 


  Anyhoo, I hope to get that time this weekend and hopefully claw my way back up the work/home balance scale.  On that note, however, due to my changing duties at work, I’m probably not going to have much downtime to design or code at work like I have been--or rather, that time now has legitimate work-y things for me to instead channel that energy into, which means that I need to transition from having essentially worked on Renegade part-time back to it being a regular old side project.  It was nice while it lasted, tho; I got XGEF about 80% of where it needs to be, with most of the trickiest things addressed, so that’s good at least.

  ----

  So we had a bit of a discussion about sapience/sentience vs intelligence, which mostly came about due to taking a look at the pokeball question again.  In the beginning, we essentially took Origin of Species’ stance, which is to say that anyone over a certain intelligence level (or brain density or whatever) comes out of a pokeball comatose or braindead, so naturally it’s illegal to capture humans and safeguards are put into balls to prevent human capture as per national and international law.  


  The *reason* for this occurring has been a bit of a thorn in the side of the lore for some time; I seem to recall that /u/DaystarEld even just sort of handwaves it as a necessary limitation without a real justification.  I’m inclined to agree with that approach, but over time we’ve accumulated additional lore for the pokeballs that has made the intelligence thing more and more unsupported.  Specifically, we sort of decided (and apologies if this is actually aping your lore, Daystar; it all runs together and I couldn’t possibly identify the original source of all of these ideas at this point) that pokeball technology came about after studying Ghost types and their phasing and interdimensional travel.  

  (Ghosts are themselves following the original Gengar concept of a creature slowly pushing itself into our dimension.  We figure they’re distortion-born pokemon that are essentially Chaos/Warp demons out to wreck shit for no good reason.)


  The father of the pokeball tech found that by isolating the organ that triggers the phasing from a Ghost and hitting it with enough power, one could open small portals into other dimensions that follow other physical laws.  The vast majority of dimensions explored are just facets of the Distortion world (and thus highly dangerous and not very useful on net, considering that it’s basically like a portal to Hell, demons and all), but someone somewhere figured out a way into a dimension that seems to have properties that we associate with pokeballs: all but halted time passing, non-euclidian geometry, etc.  After a lot of iteration (facilitated by the apricorn tree growing outside, which doesn’t really have any super special properties but is a *very* convenient source of sturdy, hollow spheres), the pokeball was born.

  Now, this explanation (such as it is) doesn’t do much for avoiding the intelligence threshold handwave, short of pushing the question further away a bit.  We could say something about the chaotic distortion energy field that every captured object has to pass through, and higher complexity minds just can’t handle it, yadda yadda, but it’s still pretty much just an arbitrary decision due to not wanting to let the player being able to capture humans (or rather, not being able to *enslave* humans; I actually have no problem with people getting black market balls and using them to inflict mental retardation on enemies as a particularly heinous means of tying up loose ends.  Funny what feels acceptable and what doesn’t).

  Anyway, so all of this lead to exposing the inelegance of having this effect tied to an INT threshold.  INT so far affects things like the number of moves that one can easily keep in mind at once, the speed with which one learns moves, a general small boost to skill gain in general, and as a modifier to how a pokemon reacts to certain stimuli.  Some of this seems to overlap with the whole “the more of this you have, the more likely a pokeball zaps it out of you” thing, but some of it doesn’t, and so it was proposed that an additional mental stat be added, that of Sapience (SAP).  It would usually (probably) correlate with INT, but there would be room to allow them to deviate, such as, for instance, a particularly dumb Growlithe (low INT, medium SAP).  With this addition, SAP would affect speed of training a move to associate with a command, number of commands known, and act as a modifier to loyalty-affecting actions (higher SAP means tending to its wounds counts more for a loyalty increase).

  It still doesn’t address the inherent hand-waviness of the arbitrary pokeball threshold, however, and in absence of that I’m not even sure I’d entertain the idea on its own.  I’d love to hear any ideas on the subject, either pertaining to the INT/SAP split or to addressing the core “can capture pokemon just fine but can’t capture humans without devastating results”.  I *would* like to avoid “pokemon are magic” at all costs, so fair warning, but I’d love to otherwise consider any thoughts y’all might have.

    What if being smart somehow helps you get out of a pokeball and avoid full capture? This would mean that, just as healthier pokemon are more likely to escape a pokeball when you are trying to catch them, high-INT/SAP pokemon are also more likely to escape a pokeball. 

    Altenately, aren't all pokeballs created by Silph Co? Maybe they rig their pokeballs to reject humans. Since pokeballs are pretty complicated stuff, I don't think it'd be unreasonable that they still have a monopoly (especially if anyone trying to reverse engineer pokeballs has to deal with Pokemon Hell World and a slew of other dimensions as they perfect their off-brand ball), but if there are multiple companies then you just have to say that it's an industry standard.
    ```

    - u/InfernoVulpix:
      ```
      For the second idea, on a Pokeball monopoly, all legal Pokeballs are programmed to reject humans.  Like, it's *super*-illegal for them to be otherwise.  Silph doesn't have a monopoly on Pokeballs, though, and you can find jailbroken Pokeballs on the black market.  Super-illegal, still, but there.

      As for the first, we took inspiration from Pokemon Origin of Species in the sense that if a Pokeball connects it automatically captures with no chance for resistance (the trick is being able to hit the Pokemon in the first place, and size/mass limits.  Higher level Pokeballs can take more of a beating and can hold larger Pokemon).  Though, OoS approached Pokeballs from a 'convert to mass-energy and recreate' angle and we adopted the auto-catch rules before coming up with the ghost organ idea, so it's not impossible that we may return to canon's interpretation there.
      ```

    - u/ketura:
      ```
      Regarding your first paragraph, I *do* want to include something where higher INT pokemon are more likely to treat otherwise innocuous-looking pokeballs as a threat, but as Vulpix pointed out we've got the OoS contact-means-capture mechanic.  I don't particularly like the whole "captured pokemon can disengage freely" thing, it always seemed a bit too...anime.

      Regarding Silph having a monopoly, I'm thinking it's a Microsoft situation where 75%+ of the market is dominated by them, but maybe there are some rich or otherwise stubborn companies that are in on it as well.  However, as you point out, due to the danger involved, I bet that most other companies are more concerned with ease of use and capture features, not actually improving the tech itself due to the sheer costs involved on that end.
      ```

  - u/BoilingLeadBath:
    ```
    If we're OK with capturing-but-not-enslaving humans, and are basically writing flavor text...

    Perhaps Pokeballs work by modeling the nervous system at a very low level, and subverts a critter's natural psychology by application of a carefully tuned stimulus, Snowcrash style.

    You could choose to limit this by computation: using an algorithm that has a run time that scales very fast - perhaps even exponentially - with brain complexity. This would makes human-capable equipment way more powerful as run-of-the-mill stuff (assuming that Pokemon top off at about "gorrilla")... and so the stuff designed for capturing beasts, even with a modest computational safety margin, just doesn't cut it - but specially built research hardware might have a chance. (And if capture-tech that high-powered is illegal, it'll be hard to get: these are ASICs supercomputers in the high Request-For-Quote range, not guns.)

    Alternatively, the limit could be sensor/emitter technology... which isn't nearly as subject to More's law, and so doesn't trip the "but the world will fall apart in 5 years" intuition that the computational complexity problem does.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    You could do a hand wave involving human and Pokemon evolution. If they have no relation and the world has supernatural stuff then why can't Pokemon have some resistance to something that effects humans in the dimension the pokeball uses.

    It seems like you're looking for some force or effect that applies to humans and not Pokemon. What if humans developed cancer from the dimension due to radiation. While the Pokemon are fine.
    ```

    - u/ketura:
      ```
      This is actually very similar to where the current discussion track eventually landed on in Discord.  I basically got thinking on what distortion negatively effects, and since that basically means "what is Ghost and Dark effective against", the natural conclusion is something to do with Psychic typing.

      Thus, the current idea is that all humans have a small Psychic typing %, and unlike a normal Psychic pokemon which has a more-or-less isolated and separate organ that the brain merely commands, in humans the psychic-ness is interconnected within the brain, like white matter in our brains.  

      Repeated and chronic exposure of a standard Psychic pokemon to distortion via pokeball might introduce microfractures of the psychic organ, but unless it's above and beyond normal use it's probably not going to have much of an effect.  You can't say the same for micro-alterations of the brain itself, however, and so humans that are captured are essentially lobotomized: at best your personality completely changes, at worst (if you were Psychic on top of the latent brain structure) completely comatose or braindead.  Most individuals come out completely infantilized.

      This also would mean that Dark humans would have an additional but probably undiscovered boon: due to their latent absorption of distortion energy via the Dark organ they've got somewhere in their head, *they* can probably hang out in pokeballs no problem.  Due to their overall rarity and the absolute social outrage over the problem (lobotomy is actually a very good parallel in this sense) experimental evidence for this would be hard to come by.

      Unless, maybe, you're an individual as powerful as Giovanni with a host of loyal Renegades at your disposal, with a higher than average distribution of Darks in the ranks...  

      EDIT: oh, and then we could say that the higher a unit's SAP stat, the more any Psychic typing is inseparably connected with the brain.  Thus, brain damage per capture/release can be calculated on an individual basis, meaning that while in-universe people think that the rule is "humans and pokeballs don't mix", the *actual* rule is "medium-high SAP + any Psychic typing and pokeballs don't mix".
      ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    My problem with the pokeball-as-portal-tech idea has always been that it isn't supported enough by canon, where we clearly see pokemon in their balls able to be interacted with digitally, such as through virtual training regimen and bonding exercises. I guess there's no reason one couldn't mesh the two and say that pokeballs both put the pokemon in a pocket dimension and also have an interface that allows them to experience simulations, but at that point it feels like adding complexity without benefit, if there's going to be a handwave at the end of it anyway :)
    ```

    - u/ketura:
      ```
      It's just stupid hard to make a pokeball system that does not by dint of existing create the means of full digitization and uploading, which then dominos to a completely different world.  I'm okay if the player asks questions such as "how does X even work", but it's more difficult when they can ask "why can't I just X" when interacting with systems of explicit rules. For that reason, I find the digitization model brings up some of those questions, such as "why can't I make backups of my pokemon if they're being digitized" which then leads to "why can't I duplicate my OP pokemon" or "why isn't everyone just carrying around a copy of Lance's Dragonite", and that doesn't even get into the questions of how we can digitize, simulate, and train brains but not add more muscle mass or bone density at will.  If the reason that humans can't be uploaded purely comes down to a lack of processing power, what happens in a few years once Moore lets us catch up?  

      These could actually be interesting ideas to explore in some context or another, but in the context of a game sim where one is expected to explore and manipulate any of the world's rules they come across, I don't want to veto any player's ideas soley because I decided I don't want the world to work that way.  So while "it only fits in the pokeball because portal tech, and only so much mass can be actively accessed at once because The Devil and humans can't even use it at all because Power of Hell" is a bit, I dunno, intellectually dissatisfying on a certain level, it's a lot more ironclad from a systems-to-work-around level.  If the player is able to research and fund a pokeball that could actually within the rules of the universe simulate a human, then I don't want to stop them just because I said so.

      Instead I'll summon Giratina and make it a boss fight.

  The 2017 NYC Rationalist Solstice has been [officially announced] (http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/pi1/nyc_solstice_and_east_coast_megameetup_interested/) for Saturday, December 9th. For tickets and fundraising info, check [here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1939801081/nyc-secular-solstice-2017-generations/description). Usually about 150 people show up, so it's a really nice celebration.

  Simultaneously with the solstice, there will be a [Rationalist East Coast Megameetup](https://rationalistmegameetup.com/). A bunch of rationalists (current estimate: 40) will be hanging out together in a large AirBnB in NYC for the Friday-Sunday containing the Solstice event.

  In the asking of questions, some ambiguity regrettably is unavoidable. Let's consider an extremely boring question:

  > Between the colors pink and green, which would you estimate to be your favorite?

  \- What do I mean by `pink`? What, *exactly*, is the range of colors to which I'm referring? Does `pink` include lavender or maroon? Am I talking about RGB or CMYK? (Similar complaints can be made about `green`.)  
  \- Explicitly, I've directed the target to consider only the pure and undiluted colors. However, it's eminently likely that he instead will contemplate various items that in his experience have *represented* the color. (This is the difference between "I prefer green because, being the color of nature, it seems calm and soothing." and "I prefer green because leaves are green and I like leaves.", which says nothing about whether the speaker likes green *itself*.)  
  \- What does `favorite` mean? Again, explicitly, I inquired solely about the isolated color&mdash;but maybe the respondent will think, not of amorphous blobs of color in a featureless black void, but of buying a pink car or of painting the interior of his house green. Certainly, "What would you prefer the color of your primarily-driven car to be, if you could choose any single solid color of glossy paint?" would be an interesting question, but it isn't the question that was asked *in this instance*.

  That's the problem. What's the solution?  
  \- Describe the intended context with excruciating detail, leaving no room for error  
  \- Allow the respondent to request clarification of the question's intended context&mdash;even incrementally, if he finds it necessary  
  \- Ensure that the respondent explains the context of his response alongside that response, regardless of the context in which you yourself plan to answer  
  \- Allow the respondent to deliver multiple responses, each with its own context provided alongside

    A quote from some article on numerical methods:

    This appears to hold for everyday conversation too. Providing excruciatingly detailed context for every question/statement is too inefficient, since it is rarely needed/relevant. It is much more reasonable to just say the thing, and allow incremental refinement of contextual understanding via requested clarifications. Which people generally already do.

    Your questions actually make me wonder, do some colors have larger scopes than others? For example, what is the color range of "blue" in the English language? Something like #CCCCFF to #000066? Could it actually be bigger than the color range of "red", and hence more likely to be someone's favorite color?

    This actually seems likely, since most people know that "pink" is different from "red". Meanwhile, how many people disqualify "cyan" as a "blue"? And "black" and "white" probably have extremely limited ranges compared to the other colours.

  EDIT: The GDD is now officially complete... um, complete-ish. I still have to add illustrations.

  EDIT: Done.

  The [almost-final version of the Game Design Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t32OHPtbsFtlOi70zNL5RrwwPbuZhkBHfZbRScFcrhg) is out. I need to either complete two sections or leave them unfinished, do some proof-reading, and add some screenshot and images, but I will not otherwise modify this document for at least a month after today.

  It's a very long document (roughly 50 pages) that goes into a great amount of details on the engine, the editor, what dynamics I want to encourage, what I need to research, and which features I want to have. It went through something like four drafts, and took month for me to write, and have written almost no code so far.

  Now, that is by itself a very, very worrying sign. The standard way to approach a game project is to smart small. You're not supposed to spend months planning, you're supposed to make minimalist, flexible plans and make a prototype as soon as you can to test your idea. The world of game development is full of enthusiastic people full of dreams who spend six months detailing variations of their great ideas, then 3 weeks realizing their ideas are actually terrible and only work on paper.

  Given that I know that, there are three reasons I spent a lot of time planning anyway:

  - I honestly think I'm way better at planning than the average amateur game designer. I have worked on software projects and games before, both successes and failures; I think I have a fairly good instinct for differentiating "good idea on paper" vs "good idea in practice". Part of the reason I took so long to design this thing is that I wrote a lot of plans which, on second examination, didn't feel like they were actually going to help me implement the thing.

  - The classic trap when writing a GDD is to write features, when what you should do is write objectives and dynamics. You make decisions like "and then character X will have a +5 sword, and the sword will be able to do Y", even though you're not able to visualize the impact these decisions will have. The GDD I wrote has considerations like "I want the user to feel X", or "I want the user to be able to do X in context Y" or "I want to avoid trap X that I've seen other projects fall into", which I think are actually useful to write down in advance.

  - I need it for motivation. When I begin a project, I have enough motivation to power through difficulties; when the project is close to completion, I can motivate myself by thinking of finishing what I've started. The biggest motivation drain is when I'm in the middle of a project, I've worked on it for 4 days/weeks/months, and I don't feel any closer to my objective. At this point, I think having a framework of thoughts and a project philosophy already written will be a life safer, because it will give me milestones and a sense of progression. It easier to feel the progress I'm making if I feel like I have a global view of what the project is about.

  That being said, I'm still worried I spent too much time planning, which is why I'm officially stopping today. For the near future, I'll be doing as much implementing as I can.

  In that spirit, I won't be making a long list of milestones and deadlines. I have one milestone ([described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18fdaeiuhH3kNYXS8nM29aAbvC0AFzyr15oJMIGIVlwU)) with no deadline, and once it's done I'll make another.

  Next step: Have a game engine where the Player can walk around, jump around, add and remove blocks.

  This is a bit of a false start, since I was supposed to update this week.

  I'm still uncertain about how to this. I want to set up these regular updates to force myself to work on the project regularly, to make it into an habit I have, but honestly, I've never had much success with commitment mechanism. I think I'm going to sort of compromise and commit to updating every week, but if I haven't worked on the project I'll just talk about whatever comes to mind instead; the idea being that I never really forget about the project enough that it's hard to get back into it.

  Anyway, I'm going to commit to several people I know, friends, colleagues, and on several subreddits to update. We'll see how long it lasts.

  I welcome all questions, criticisms, and absolutely any feedback you have. Despite (or because of) the amount of planning I've done, I'm going into this pretty much blind, so I'll take whatever advice I can get.

    It took me reading the whole document to really understand that you basically want a game map editor that is edited by playing a game.  I have to ask, why not just make a mod for Minecraft's creative mode?  So much of that document is saying "do this just like minecraft" that you may as well start with the game that is most like minecraft (that being minecraft itself) and then going from there.  If nothing else, it would let you prototype the feasibility of what it is you want to do, without wasting time cloning minecraft just to discover that the part you *actually* want to do isn't what you thought it would be.

    You really should put all that at the beginning, tho.  I left other comments on the document; sorry if it came across a bit mean.

      Oh wow, lot of useful feedback here. It's very harsh and a bit mean, but I get the gist. Thank you very much :)

      I'm going to try to answer everything later, but to address your main points:

      I did write the GDD a bit like a diary. When I was writing it with a team, it was with the idea that everyone already knew what the project was about, which is why I didn't open with the "meatiest" parts.

      On the other hand, the GDD also serves as a kind of proto-to-do-list, in the sense that it's supposed to have be exhaustive-ish overview of what the final project will be like. So while I agree that some parts feel a bit shallow and read like "this feature will be good instead of bad", I still want to include them in some form. Idem for the "I don't know how to do this" parts, which are intended to remind me of which subjects I need to research.

      But yeah, I should probably rewrite these parts to make this more clear. On the other hand, this isn't exactly a promotional document; it's better to be readable and interesting to get useful feedback, but it doesn't really *need* to sell the game.

      Regarding whether I should make a Minecraft mod... I don't know. I've kind of taken it for granted that I need to build the thing from the ground up to have enough flexibility, and on the long term I do want the engine to be 100% my own... but it's true that it might be faster to make a prototype to test features by modding Minecraft than from the ground up. On the other hand, I feel more comfortable with C++ and Ogre than Java and Minecraft code, but yeah. Another possibility would be to make a fork of Minetest's code, which is C++ and Irrlicht.

      I'll think about it.
