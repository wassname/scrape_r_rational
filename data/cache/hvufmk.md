## [RT] [FF] Worth the Candle: A Uniquities Meeting

### Post:

"You can come in, Finch," Cynthia said, continuing to write.

Figaro Finch opened the door to her office, wincing slightly at the brightness in the room, as he always did. Cynthia liked to keep her workspace brightly lit. She enjoyed the irony of the head of Uniquities, often seen by Imperial citizens as a shadowy force, living in light. It also appealed to her sense of— not justice, exactly, but her idea of who she was as a person, and what her duties were. To shine light in dark places, to hold it up as a torch against an encroaching night; that was part of what Uther had represented. What Uniquities was still trying to do. Even if the Second Empire had perverted it, she couldn't deny its appeal as an ideal.

And, of course, it gave her an advantage to have guests momentarily dazzled when they entered her presence.

"Report," she said, still scribbling away.

Finch squinted through stubby fingers at her, a rough approximation of a salute. "Director Sims. The situation in Li'o is stabilizing. The Empire is still going to have to deal with the political fallout of Article 86, but as that's not our department I feel safe enough in asking for a break. Again."

"Ideas don't get breaks, Finch," Cynthia said. She flipped a page. No one had told her that her job would be ninety percent paperwork, but it was hardly a surprise. Her only complaint was that, considering how many pen cartridges she burned through, it was a waste for her to be untrained in Ink magic. "Did you get any new data on the status of Smith's condition? Does he have new insight on how he emigrated from Earth?"

"If he does, he's not telling me," Finch said. "It would be easier if I could ask directly, but their info-sec protocols are, frankly, remarkable for a group of amateurs." He paused. "Also, Earth isn't real. It's a dead end."

"You have evidence of this?"

The shape of Finch's mouth was a flat line. "No, I don't have evidence that the material reality of a shared delusion— one without any physical impact on Aerb, something undetectable to the best star mages and planar experts ever born— is make-believe. I also don't have any evidence that the birthday cake in my last dream wasn't real. Do we really need any?"

"A poor choice of words, considering that the Plane of Dreams is a real place, if temporarily inaccessible," said Cynthia. "Come now, Finch. I would have thought that you, of all people, would understand the potential physicality of a shared idea. New codes of law, fresh technology, prescient urban planning, hundreds of plays, dozen of linguistic and cultural artifacts… Uther would have been enough evidence all by himself, despite not admitting his condition. The information is coming from somewhere. There is a truth hiding in the myth."

He almost sighed— she could see the lines of his chest expand— before Finch remembered that he was talking to the equivalent of a superior officer. "We should resume looking in other places," he suggested after a moment. "Books with reliable information on the dream-skewered are hard to guarantee, but no one ever accused them of being tight-lipped."

Cynthia put down her pen. Her hands, renacim-pink, folded on her desk. "We've already pumped Speculator Masters for everything he knows," she said. "There are no other living sources. I need more, Finch."

He frowned. "Can I speak freely, Director Sims?"

"I don't seem to have been able to stop you so far," Cynthia said dryly. "Go on."

"This seems— unimportant. Smith's group killed a World Lord less than seventy two hours ago," said Finch. "An antimemetic one, at that. Something that the Empire was categorically incapable of responding to. If Harold had gotten off another summoning, that would be it. Our resources are too important— my time, as your Agent, seems too important— for me to suddenly start studying the Dream that Skewers when the world is at stake."

"I'm well aware of how close to the edge we were, Finch," said Cynthia. "Murillo's Skull triggered twice during the events in Li'o. I didn't get this position by ignoring such signs."

"I'm surprised we could even notice the Skull." Finch rolled his shoulders. His short back popped, little auditory firecrackers filling the space. "Mome Rath's antimemetic effect was… remarkably powerful. I'm still not sure how many degrees of inference would have been needed to pierce it."

The Skull of Bishop Murillo was one of the most powerful precognitive entads in the world, and one of Uniquities best-kept secrets. It was a runed skull, human in shape but twice as large, set with— at the moment— forty-three spikes, each driven deep into bone. The runes made the Skull's observer think of the concept of Aerb, although the correlation between the markings and the hex as a whole wasn't apparent.

The spikes were more obvious. Each referred to a different potentially world-ending threat that Aerb was facing, or would soon face. When it had been crafted (a hundred and thirty years after Uther's disappearance, by a wandering prince who'd turned to banditry) it had only eleven such spikes. That number had risen and fallen in the centuries since, but it had always trended up, with the latest spike appearing about five months ago. The spikes drove themselves deeper into the Skull whenever one of the threats came closer to actually ending the world, and, based on past results, it was assumed that the top of a spike ever becoming flush with the surface of the bone would indicate a no-win scenario.

The end of each spike was inscribed with a single mark, symbolizing whatever threat the spike represented. Some of them were still unknown, but most had been analyzed into near-certainty. When the spike representing Fel Seed moved, even if it was only in his capacity as one of the World Lords, you paid attention.

"Somewhere between three and five degrees, depending on how one counts them," said Cynthia. "We did our hourly check of the Skull and counted one fewer spike than normal, but no one could remember which spike was missing. Naturally that set off enough alarms for us to review the cameras recording the Skull's movement, and one of the technicians, an Elephant Animalia, noticed that the World Lord spike had depressed another four inches." She paused. "Thank you for your prompt response in Li'o, by the way. I do appreciate your work, even if I don't express it."

Finch scratched the back of his head. "Thank you, but— that's exactly what frustrates me, you see? If I hadn't been there, Harold would have escaped again, and probably performed a second summoning. And instead of tracking down threats like that, you've got me dancing around the subject of Juniper's history, trying to figure out whether Canada is a real place."

"Yes, I do." One of the things Cynthia liked about Finch was that she didn't have to move to look him in the eye. Stress gave her enough neck pain without constantly having to look up and down to impress on her Agents the importance of what she was saying. "I gave that order for a reason. It's the most important thing you could be doing."

"Smith is certainly important, if he's Uther reborn," agreed Finch. "But the object of one of his many delusions seems less so."

"Uther reborn," Cynthia mused. She stood, stretching, and moved over to the map of Aerb that took of most of the left wall. "I always thought that idea was interesting. The greatest King, returned to save us, to strike down evil…" Her hand trailed over the map, slowing in certain places. The Boundless Pit. Glassy Fields. Anglecynn, where Uther himself had struck down the Apocalypse Demon.

The exclusion zone of Fel Seed.

"Even putting aside the possibility that a power like Uther's is part of what draws new disasters down on Aerb, another Uther won't be enough," Cynthia said. "He was the best to ever play the game, but even he never became strong enough to change the rules, even if he sometimes broke them. And the rules are what we're really fighting, Finch. The laws of this world are our true enemy. Uther never made them. He was as crippled by the exclusionary principle as the rest of us."

"I don't understand," Finch said. His eyes tracked the motion of her hand, watchful, curious. "Our duty is to prevent the end of the world. If Smith becomes strong enough to fight the coming threats, the way Uther was, we'll have postponed it for decades, maybe centuries."

"A postponement is not a solution," said Cynthia. "Aerb already has gods; it would be nice if they intervened more in mortal affairs, but they'll be devoured by the Void Beast just as we will when the time comes. And there are other threats that Smith's physical strength, whatever level it reaches, won't neutralize. Power isn't enough. We need out-of-the-box solutions. Specifically, we need to *get out of this box*."

Finch was squinting again, lips pursed, brow furrowed. When he understood, he spoke slowly, as though he didn't believe the words he was saying. "You're suggesting a retreating action. You want to… abandon Aerb?"

"Aerb is dead, Finch," Cynthia said. She gestured to the map. "It's a corpse still pretending to breathe, still pretending to eat and drink and shit. But it's not a walking corpse. It's not going anywhere. It's rotting. As a place, and as a concept, Aerb is just waiting to die a final death."

"Not words I'd expect from the Director of Uniquities," Finch said. He looked unnerved, and it took a lot to unnerve Figaro Finch.

Cynthia was still looking at the map. "In some ways, Uther made the world worse," she said quietly. "I don't mean to diminish his accomplishments, of course. He saved the world a dozen times and more. But to do it by causing so many exclusions, and eliminating so many useful magics… think of how many problems Uniquities could fix with just one Pathist."

"We'd be just as likely to get those magics excluded as Uther was," Finch said. "And we'd do it without his level of skill."

"Part of the power of an institution is in its oversight." Cynthia turned back towards him. "Yes, we'd make mistakes, and some of those magics would be excluded. But some wouldn't, because the power of a competent— a *competent*— institution to check its own protocols and revise its practices is better than any one person's."

"Unless that person is Uther, perhaps," said Finch. "All stories grow in the telling. But I doubt Uniquities could have handled some of his challenges, as good as we are."

"Perhaps." Cynthia sat down again and spun, once, in her chair. When you were the Director no one could judge your little exercise for stress relief. "In any case, my point stands. Uther solved the problems facing Aerb in his time, but he didn't create solutions to the ones that haunted its future. Aerb's enemies aren't limited by existing exclusions, not in the same way we are. Every passing year diminishes us. Another mortal species, another necessary magic, another critical entad, extinct every decade. Skin magic wasn't degenerate; no one knows why it was excluded. Velocity magic doesn't even need to be excluded— its own induction conditions will write it out of Aerb in decades."

"That doesn't mean we give up on Aerb," Finch said. He was putting heat into his words, now. "If we're fighting systemic issues, we work together to find systemic solutions. That's what Uniquities does. It's what every citizen of Aerb does."

"Indeed. And there were twenty billion Aerb citizens, when Uther was alive," Cynthia said. "That number is five billion now. Even ignoring the threat of exclusion, we have a quarter part of the manpower, a quarter part of the entad production; the athenaeums produce mages more efficiently than anyone did in Uther's time, but that number is on a downward trend as well. New entads are one of the only ways to develop new magics— if you asked me what the most valuable entad in the world was, the one that was singlehandedly contributing the most to staving off the end, I would tell you the Rod of Whispers. An entad, made by one person, that created a whole new field of magic. And that's only if you don't count the Li'o Temple itself as an entad of a sort, since Still Magic is even more vital to combatting Aerb's foes."

"Magics created by entads are in the minority," Finch said. "You don't need a large population to research new materials; that's where at least a third of new magics come from."

"What new magics?" Cynthia said. "A third of a number that barely exists is itself negligible. If we had enough people, it's conceivable that magic-bestowing entads could be built faster than old magics are excluded. There was a time when Uniquities thought that was the solution— that we only had to increase population enough to reach that critical point, whatever it was. Forge frenzies are, in the long view, a hexal resource. Do you know what we found, when we got the Empire to impose tax breaks for citizens who developed large families?"

Finch frowned. "I didn't know that ever happened."

"Before your time, perhaps," said Cynthia. "I'm not surprised it didn't enter the history books, considering the results." She felt a headache coming on, the same one that always appeared whenever she thought about this for too long, and suppressed it ruthlessly. One of her favorite skills, a gift from a past life. "I don't have to tell you this, Finch, but population growth is exponential. This is true for almost all the mortal species. Even if we ignore the tuung, the Ha-lunde, and all the other species that ignore the normal limits— a human population can double its numbers in thirty years, easily, on a scale of millions at a time. Exclusions are devastating to population centers, but they don't actually take up that much space; there's plenty of arable land. So where are the people? Why is the population of the Empire of Common Cause not growing?"

Finch held up a hand and started counting off fingers. "Infrastructure, natural resources, culture, prophylaxis, economics—" He switched to the other hand. "Natural disasters, exclusions, land, education and food bottlenecks—"

"Having a long list of reasons isn't evidence for the validity of those reasons," said Cynthia. "I told you that, for a time, we pursued a policy of population growth. What you don't know, what didn't make it into the history books, is that every single pursuit of that policy failed. Every time. Sometimes for good reasons, like the ones you listed, and so we controlled for those. Then some failed for ridiculous reasons, and sometimes for no reasons at all. The fertility of a measured demographic actually *went down* for a decade, during our third attempt, about a hundred years ago. People were having more sex, not using birth control, and just not having babies. Pursuit of a growth policy actively lowered the population. There was no observable cause."

"Then you got the math wrong," said Finch. "Or were unlucky. There could be a thousand reasons for that."

"Whatever the reason might have been in that particular moment, Finch, it's not enough to support *systemic* population decline, on a scale lasting centuries. The problem is universal. It's happening everywhere, and it conflicts with every model we make, no matter what kind of math we pursue. Something is causing the species of Aerb to die out."

Finch paused. "This has nothing to do with Smith, though."

"It has everything to do with Smith," said Cynthia. "As long as we are on Aerb, there will be new exclusions. Some will save us from greater horrors, and some will not. But each of them is another dripping wound, bleeding Aerb unto dust. The only solution the Empire sees— and this is classified, obviously, along with the rest of this conversation, so don't even get me started on proper classification protocols— is colonies."

"The exclusionary principle extends to every plane; an exclusion on one plane means one on all of them," said Finch. "It's been tried. And they're almost all inhospitable to life, at least as we know it."

"Not all," said Cynthia. "Only the ones we've reached. Which is why, Finch, I am once again ordering you to get every bit of information on the Dream that Skewers out of Smith and his ragtag little group. Now do you understand?"

Finch was very still. His mouth opened, once, then closed again. It was a controlled movement— Figaro Finch did not gape, it wasn't in his nature— but even the best, Cynthia knew, could be at a loss for words.

"I see that you do," said Cynthia. "Smith's power as Uther reborn is irrelevant. His status as dream-skewered, his arrival here from one world to another— that is the key. The population of Earth is growing. Its technology is growing; its reach, growing. The power of a whole world, waxing, not waning. Because Earth's most unique facet, the aspect that most intrigues me, is its utter lack of an exclusionary principle."

"You want to invade Earth," said Finch. There was a kind of awe in his voice.

"I want to save the people of Aerb," corrected Cynthia Sims, Director of Uniquities. "And get you to stop complaining about this assignment. I'm authorizing you to be less circumspect this time, as long as Smith doesn't directly realize your aim. Now get out of my office."

Finch left. Light spilled from the doorway, the over-bright office of the Director beaming out before the entry closed again.

A kilometer underground, a skull impaled forty-three times was shivering slightly. Its newest spike, etched with the shape of a Juniper tree, was inching downwards again.

  I do like this, but there are a number of factual errors. Alcidia is the head of Uniquities, for one, though that could be an intentional change on your part. Aerb doesn't have video cameras, only crappy still cameras. Then there's various things that the characters probably shouldn't know at this point: That the Dream Skewered are almost entirely fabricated, that Joon is Dream Skewered, that Earth has better technology than Aerb, and that the Plane of Dreams isn't actually excluded.  I think you could move the timetable of this meeting up to be after Anglecynn, which would let them know that Joon is dream skewered, and maybe they could read his testimony and infer that Earth is doing alright relative to Aerb even if they don't know about the technology. They might plausibly know the other two, but it's a little odd that they mention offhand knowledge that should be really rare.

    Good points! To respond to them individually:

    •	Alcidia is intentionally different, partially because I couldn’t remember who the actual Director was and partially because I’ve found it implausible in the story that there aren’t at least a few pseudo-immortals running major political positions. There are, what, twenty thousand renacim? It’s bizarre that they don’t have a stronger grip on the politics of Aerb (although, to be fair, Vitrics are described as ‘long-lived’).

    •	Radio was discovered on Aerb in 413 FE— quite a while ago. On earth, there was about a gap of 30-40 years between the invention of radio and television; progress on Aerb is considerably slower, but I don’t think it’s unreasonable for Uniquities to have access to a prototype or an entad that performs a similar function.

    •	They know that the Dream Skewered are fabrications because they’ve talked to Speculator Masters in between the timing of the story and Juniper’s own visit. For the same reason, they know most of the details of Earth, as Masters understood them, and have confirmation that Joon is dream-skewered.

    •	Worth the Candle is really long and frankly I’m surprised I was able to maintain any internal consistency in this oneshot at all. I’m a pretty new writer so I’m still getting a handle on these things. How A.W. does it, I may never know ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
    ```

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      Alcidia's grandmother was alive 500 years ago, so yeah you're looking at a north of 200 year lifespan.

      AW maintains consistency by spending a bunch of time on it, searching the posted text really frequently, and having patrons do consistency checking before the next batch gets released publicly. I'm mainly just nitpicky, the fic you posted is good in both quality and internal consistency.
