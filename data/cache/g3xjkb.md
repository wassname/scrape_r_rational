  One thing I’m surprised by is that humans don’t make potions of mana recovery. If magical creatures have much better mana recovery and we already know alchemy can be used to temporarily gain a magical creatures traits, it seems like a pretty obvious a+b.

    This question was asked in the comments. The answer was "it would be possible, but no one has succeeded so far".

      Cool! Thanks for letting me know.

    It probably fails some kind of munchkinry test. The criteria for an ability being gained through potions is unclear, but from the examples we see in the story it's either full on transformation or limited senses. For example Lukov transforms into a magic beast, and Zorian uses potions of eagle eye and tremor sense from the Grey Hunter. You probably could get better mana regen, you'd just be stuck as the magic beast for the duration making it a lot less practical.

    Either that or author oversight. That in mind MoL has earned enough benefit of the doubt for me to assume that it was thought about at some point.

      It was mentioned in story fairly early on in a conversation with Kael
      ```

    My guess is that, mana recovery is probably more deeply connected to the core of the soul than the outer layer that is changed when a transformation potion is drunk. So drinking potions does nothing to help the natural mana recovery.

  I’m surprised that Zorian didn’t look into simply increasing his mana regeneration rate. From an in-universe perspective, it’s something that he could easily take advantage of in Cyoria, and something that is certainly possible. From a meta perspective, it doesn’t take away his primary limitation of not having a lot of mana at his disposal, just gives him staying power (though, let’s be honest, if he doubled his mana regen he’d just double how many simulacrum he had active).
  ```

  - u/aAlouda:
    ```
    I am pretty certain that it was mentioned that the mana regener rate is  mentioned to be dependent on the overall amount of mana, and can just be increased through mana assimilation.
    ```
