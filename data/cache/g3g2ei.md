  Congratulations! This writing is simultaneously funny yet pretentious and insightful yet obtuse.  I therefore assign a probability of 15% that your are Eliezer Yudkowsky, a 15% probability that you are Scott Alexander, and a 10% probability that you are Wertifloke.  I have discovered a truly marvelous bayesian proof of these odds, which this comment is too narrow to contain.
  ```

  - u/MadVaughn:
    ```
    Hmm. Interesting probability spread. I can't quite say whether it's in my interests to confirm or deny, but I'll ask you this:

    What's your probability that I'm all three stacked in a trench coat in order to sneak into a rated R movie theatre?

    CONSTANT VIGILANCE.

  ```
  Having read all the material referenced here (save >!Waves Arisen!<), I did *not* see that coming. Great post.
  ```

  - u/MadVaughn:
    ```
    Thank you :) It was extremely gratifying to write

    If you're ever in the mood for a new story, it's definitely a fic worth at least trying out. With your background knowledge, you'll probably get a lot out of it!

    ```
    Same, especially because it‚Äôs explicitly spelled out that >!Alexander Wales!< is >!cthulhuraejepsen!< [here](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249).
    ```

- u/Mowtom_:
  ```
  >Sai‚Äôs soup had been poisoned-

  >Humanity encountered something alien in space and brought it back to Earth-

  >Neji had been madly in love with Naruto and violently jealous of Hinata-

  Are these...common takes?  I've read discussion threads for Waves Arisen and never seen anyone even hint at these before?

    Re: Sai‚Äôs Poison

    In [the chapter following the Chunin Exam](https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/02/04/the-waves-arisen-chapter-11/), we see certain characters executed for crimes which they may or may not have committed:

    >The knowledge and its implications came all at once, like a memory he‚Äôd briefly forgotten. One of the guards had delivered a meal of soup to >!Kakashi‚Äôs!< cell, like any other, and within minutes he was dead. >!Guy !<too. 

    Naruto (and therefore the reader) also sees that:

    >The guards all had some weird seal technique imprinted on their tongues, too. He‚Äôd seen it on the Hokage‚Äôs guards as well‚Äîsome new ANBU policy, probably.

    A reader familiar with the Naruto-verse will understand these ANBU to be a part of ROOT, a military force directed exclusively by>! the new Hokage, Danzo!<.

    Further along in the chapter, Naruto reasons out that it‚Äôs pretty likely the mission that Team 7 had been sent on with Sai was meant end in their assassination. Naruto also sees that Sai has the same tongue tattoo as the guards who assassinated the aformentioned characters..

    In [the next chapter](https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/02/05/the-waves-arisen-chapter-12/), after >!Naruto and Sasuke have their bout!<, we see that Sai is in charge of cooking the soup. Before anyone can eat any of it; Sai is assassinated by Sasuke, spilling the pot of soup in his death throes.

    &#x200B;

    To me, it seems that all of these observations are explained by the hypothesis that all ROOT are trained in poisoning food as a means of assassination. And if that's true, then Team 7 just *barely* escaped a death from a direction they didn't see coming from.

    That being said, I'm realizing that can't explain *exactly* what my brain is doing to go from Point A to Point B, and so I'm open to being wrong here

    (Re: ALIENS coming up)
    ```

  - u/MadVaughn:
    ```
    Re: Aliens

    Okay, just to clarify: When I say 'something alien,' I don't mean to evoke images of little green men in space suits with plasma pistols. I just mean *something* which did not originate from Earth.

    &#x200B;

    The hypothesis comes from a conversation that Naruto has with >!the Slug Sage!< [later in the book](https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/02/09/the-waves-arisen-chapter-16/). We know that this entity has strict rules as to *how* exactly it can communicate, and we see that Naruto *eventually* pieces together some semblance of meaning from the message, but if you're a reader and can scroll back up to experience the first part of the conversation again, this is what you read:

    >>!Hello. Is anybody there? Anybody at all?!<  
    >  
    >>!The cause in which they died will continue.!<  
    >  
    >>!Do you read me, Hal? Hello, Hal, do you read me?!<  
    >  
    >>!One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.!<  
    >  
    >>!What‚Äôs this? What‚Äôs this! ‚Ä¶Wow, what a totally amazing, excellent discovery‚Äînot!!<  
    >  
    >>!‚Ä¶Stop that astronaut! Bring him to me‚Ä¶!<  
    >  
    >>!A witch! A witch! We have found a witch‚Äîmay we burn her?!<  
    >  
    >>!I found him, I found that karate motherfucker!!<  
    >  
    >>!We have found a witch! That karate motherfucker‚Ä¶!<  
    >  
    >>!That karate‚Ä¶ witch! That karate‚Ä¶ witch!!<  
    >  
    >>!Here he is. Here‚Äôs who? The man from the moon‚Ä¶!<  
    >  
    >>!Surprise motherfucker‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm the king of the wooorld!!<  
    >  
    >>!‚Ä¶Randy, is that water down there?‚Äù !<

    And then Naruto figures out what it's saying from there on.

    I'm down to do a line by line analysis, but before I just do that and spoil the fun; I'm *very* interested in whether you come to the same conclusion that I do, or if you read the text as saying something else that I've missed.

    Because again, my brain isn't *quite* giving me the answer of how I got from A to B, so if someone can show me where I've accidentally made a cognitive *uh-oh,* I'd *greatly* appreciate it :)
    ```

    - u/MaxDougwell:
      ```
      I like this theory. My own at the time was the Slug Sage was just greeting Naruto (Hello, Do you read me? You do? *sarcastic* Great! get over here.) Then commenting on what Naruto was (A witch! A karate witch!). It seemed to me it was limited in its means of communication to recordings it was carrying so was forced to improvise.


      I think there were some strong references to the anime From the New World, >!A post-apoc world set in an idyllic village where everyone has psychic powers. There are slug-like simple AI that hide out in the wilds and carry vast libraries of human knowledge which they try and share!< So I believe the Slug Sage may have been based on one of these.

      Edit: >!Checking again, the brand of the slug-record found in the story was a "Panasonic Automotive Archive" which meshes with what we already know from the story: Panasonic is built to last.!<

      DOUBLE Edit: I almost forgot to upvote and tell you I enjoyed this!

      I mean the obvious interpretation is that the Slug is replaying movie and TV quotes, quite a few of which are space related. 

      It also seems to be trying to synthesize the quotes into something appropriate to the current discussion, but isn't able to do so perfectly. 

      My conclusion at the time was that the setting is after some sort of bio-punk apocalypse that happened in our future, and the slug is a semi-autonomous biological data store that had been set free somehow. 

      For reference: 

      1. From [The Day After](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_After), though I initially thought it was from Pink Floyd's Comfortably Numb (it's not)
      2. From the Presidential Address after the Colombia disaster
      3. 2001 A Space Odyssey
      4. First words said on the moon
      5. Wayne's World (specifically about the Flobee I think)
      6. You Only Live Twice
      7. Monty Python's Holy Grail
      8. This one I dunno - googling for it just brings up a Tenacious D song and [this weirdly cursed YouTube clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-_Ee6E3vDU)
      9. Seems synthesized from 7 & 8, and is particularly relevant to Naruto
      10. Seems synthesized from the same sources as #9 but mostly I think the author just wanted to write "karate witch"
      11. Also dunno, and The Man in the Moon makes this particularly hard to search for. 
      12. Synthesized, but from two previously unseen sources - Dexter and then Titanic. Seems to be attempting to indicate its unexpected importance. 
      13. Seems to be from an incredibly bad movie called [The Beast of Yucca Flats](https://uncyclopedia.ca/wiki/The_Beast_of_Yucca_Flats), but is also weirdly relevant to The Waves Arisen.

        11 seems to be from E.T.

    The first two were serious, the last was wasn't üòÇ

    Give it a moment; I'll reply back citing the in-text evidence that led me to those conclusions
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Honestly if that last one was in the story I would think it even \*more\* likely that it's EY.

      (...or even more likely that it's someone wanting to make it SEEM OBVIOUS that it's EY...)

      ((...or...))

  > ‚ÄúIn this line of work you learn that there are three types of redditors,‚Äù Mad-AI Moody said. ‚ÄòThe type with one account, the type with two accounts, and the type with more accounts than you or I could ever a-count.‚Äô

  I mean, I used to have like four or five (or six?) accounts and now I have three because I deleted all but two of them (there might be another one floating around out there lost to time) and then made a new one.

  Anyways, I still think EY's secret fic is that Star Wars one with the holocron. A Voice Across the Void. Evidence: After two years of inactivity, Zoltan Berrigomo posted a short fic like a week after that thread that was discussing what the secret fic could be.
  ```

  - u/MadVaughn:
    ```
    Is [this](https://zoltanberrigomo.tumblr.com/post/133818575647/a-voice-across-the-void) the one? I'll check it out :)

    Would a reader need to have any Star Wars knowledge to get into it?
    ```

    - u/Anna_Emloch:
      ```
      That's the one. [It's also on ff dot net](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10740793/1/A-Voice-Across-the-Void). I don't *think* familiarity with the Star War is a prerequisite for being able to follow that fic's plot, but Disney+ is cheap (and you can probably get a free trial), you could always just watch the Original Trilogy.

  ```
  Is Waves Arisen really that good? Do I need to know about Naruto to read it?
  ```

  - u/PeridexisErrant:
    ```
    Yes, it's very good, and no, you don't need to know Naruto to read it. Basic familiarity with the canon plot and characters does add some depth (and a lot of dramatic irony) though.
    ```

  - u/GrizzlyTrees:
    ```
    The waves arisen is very good. 

    It's very different from Naruto, the differences are felt imo more sharply than hpmor, because there is more of a genre "distance" between shonen (boys anime) and rational fiction, compared to YA fantasy and RTfic. 

    Full enjoyment of the fic would be had by naruto readers/watchers, I think knowing a bit about naruto would go a long way, but it might be worth a try anyways. It pushes different ideas and values than hpmor (while still rational), and seems to me to be somewhat educational in a similar way, if not quite as pedagogical as hpmor.
    ```

- u/Ms_CIA:
  ```
  Okay but like...not sure about Wertifloke, but EY probably has at least one other account where he shitposts stories and writing advice he doesn't want associated with him.

  Three reasons:

  1) Writing HPMOR is fun and he likes it.

  2) He wants to write HPMOR without people bugging him about "where's the epilogue?" and "Is this canon?"

  3) He likes to see who likes his writing when not associated with his name, plus sometimes he wants to write literary criticism about his own work but not have anybody think he's a narcissist.

  All this to say I think PM_Me_Rational_Fics is EY and maybe Timecubefanfiction.
