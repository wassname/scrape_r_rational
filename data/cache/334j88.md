## Sapespeck computing question(GWSI spoilers all)[q]

### Post:

How precisely does sapespeck computing work?  It seems that with the specifications of the sapespeck spell all you should be able to create is an [artificial adder](http://lesswrong.com/lw/l9/artificial_addition/).

  ```
  You can construct an adder by taking many artificial adders that work only on the numbers between 1 and 10, and then hooking them together by having them mumble to each other. That's how calculators work, only their artificial adders only work on binary digits.

    ```
    When computers add, they look up a 2x2 table of answers for (1/0) plus (1/0). When we add in base 10, we look up a 10x10 table of (1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/0) plus (1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/0). 

    In the story, their problem was they didn't have a base system. All of their numbers had unique names, making their table infinitely large.

  ```
  Remember that it 'whispers' other things before producing a result, so it can basically run a function, then do something else with the output of that function. I'd guess that there's an input translation section (converts English words for numbers into something more consistent), then there's a base-ten single-digit adder, finally a section to announce the final output. And the chapter mentioned 'code-words' or something, so I'm guessing it uses words other than parseltongue zero through nine in order to not confuse which function outputs connect to which function inputs.

    Author here confirming that this is correct.  Various other techniques that assist in *Sapespeck* computing:

    * You can manipulate the volume of the output, to distinguish between "things you want the user to hear" and "internal signals"
    * You can put a lot of specks very close together into a "clump", and have a clump elsewhere distinguish incoming signals on the basis of what clump they come from.  The base-ten single-digit adders form clumps, for example.
    * *Sapespeck Maxima* allows you to easily rewrite specks - even rewriting multiple specks at a time - without individually deleting and recreating each speck involved.  Sometimes it might even be easier to make a bunch of blank specks with *Sapespeck* before actually making them into a functioning system with *Sapespeck Maxima*, because once you've gotten the hang of the latter, it's just much easier.
