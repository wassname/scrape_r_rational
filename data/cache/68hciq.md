  Pleasant!  [Spoiler:  ](#s "The near-senility adds quite a bit of perspective to his lack of memory of Nic when they met.")

  Just started reading it. Seems fairly good so far, although it's not quite the 'Mother of Learning' level. Thanks for the update!

    To be very clear it's not my work. I just posted it. I will say that while I think the plotting is worse I actually like the writing itself a bit more. It seems to read more smoothly for me.

      I find writing to be a bit amateurish though, not quite fleshed out and it spoils the whole thing for me.

  If the pen absorbs magic attacks why did he give it away? It makes no sense if he has no expectation that Nic would carry it around as a security measure. I assumed he was trying to spy on Simole with it or something.

    He could just be a nice guy who also happens to be ~~a spymaster and master of assassins~~ running the ministries of truth and love.

      Sorry, I couldn't help but laugh out loud at your reply. AHAHAHAHHAH

      edit: you could also put Ministry of Propaganda in his CV.

  Delcroix ....do we read his surname like the del and french croix ? because thats the way i had been doing this...

  and i am glad we are getting the perspective of multiple characters. All of them are really interesting and the plot starts to ramp up!

  I am currently liking the portreyal of elitism and aristocracy. The propaganda within the country is done really well too. The only thing that really bugs me is the level of studies the main character had to do to get to the school. It seems almost impossible to have such self control and determination to do such a thing + what is the real level of knowledge he had to absorb and all the kids in this elite school? And he is only in the low level class that is supposed to be expelled anyways ? I get that they are high born people and they are destined to do many nice jobs like running this god damn country and all of that but i find it hard to suspend my desbelieve over it. 

  Another thing could someone tell me the age of these kids. I cant recall it but  i think they werent that old which in another way kinda bugs me with the whole how do they learn that much and how intelligent they are.

  but as the story stands those are my only complaints tho.

  - the characters seem really intelligent but i dont remember their exact age

  - the amount of work in studies they have to do to be that good etc

   the story is really good and i recommend it for anyone

    Yes, some things don't seem to make sense.

    Getting the also-rans into the school makes sense.  Find the smartest and most driven people who aren't already part of the aristocracy and getting them incorporated into the aristocracy so they are less likely to try violent revolution.  But then trying to get them thrown out of the school doesn't make sense with that.  That makes the plan into 'find all the most intelligent and driven people who aren't part of the aristocracy and make sure they now have an axe to grind with the aristocracy'.

    We'd also expect the regular ransom students to be more normal in their achievements.  The aristocracy probably isn't so large that it's just the smartest and most driven members that attend Ransom.  And we assume the average aristocrat is only slightly better off the the average non-aristocrat because of how readily available schooling is to everyone.

      One of the better rules I follow in the real world is that, when either malicious intent or incompetence are both possible reasons for a thing, assume incompetence. In this case, its likely a system enacted by a well-intentioned powerful government official, that fell prey to rampant classism. It continues because it makes no political sense to end the system, but no one really cares to fix it.

      It sounds more like a "You don't have to revolt, if you bothered trying you could totally be a part of the upper class" kind of thing.  Except of course it's rigged against you.

      so fun fact. I have known that croix means cross but the whole surname is a classic french surname meaning "of the cross"

      quite nice

      and yes the part where they try to drive also rans students away doesnt make much sense but i guess nepotism and the elitism in the society kinda does explain that ? idk. I dont feel like it is that much weird. the system was decided with it in mind ,aristocracy is just against associating with commoners i guess

      >  And we assume the average aristocrat is only slightly better off the the average non-aristocrat because of how readily available schooling is to everyone.

      Nah; I think this is easily explained by the difference in level of expectations in schooling (for Ransom specifically), school environment, and the level of education offered in each school. There would also naturally be a level of culture shock/playing catch-up when the Also-Rans come in (hence the opportunity for remedial classes in Chapter 4) - but if the school doesn't offer to help the Also-Rans automatically, the gap widens and it increases the chance that the Also-Ran would drop out. In that case, the Also-Ran would be more likely to say "I dropped out because I couldn't keep up," rather than "I dropped out because I was thrown out the system was stacked against me".

      For a real-world example, see [this article about American college drop outs](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/12/the-added-pressure-faced-by-first-generation-students/384139/).

    > the characters seem really intelligent but i dont remember their exact age

    Chapter 1:

    > The Ranvar school system required every child to be educated to the age of fifteen, after which they would sit the most important exams of their young lives. The results would determine their future, what kind of work they would be eligible for, the kind of people willing to employ them.

    Re:

    > the amount of work in studies they have to do to be that good etc

    This doesn't break my suspension of disbelief - Nic is supposed to be extremely self-motivated, and for the other Ransom students - it reminds me a little of Japanese cram schools.

      Germany has a similar system too I believe.

    I've been reading it as Delacroix since the beginning, hadn't noticed that a 'a' was missing.
