  As always with Dinosaur Comics, don't forget the following after you've read the strip:

  [Mouseover Title Text](#s " tied for first with that author in "stranger than fiction" who controls a real-life person and who never even TRIES writing "and then he cured cancer and all other disease, the end". WILL FERRELL I CANNOT ENJOY YOUR MOVIES WHEN THERE ARE PLOT HOLES THIS BIG IN THEM NO MATTER HOW DEPRESSED YOU TRY TO LOOK")

  [Contact Link Email Subject](#s " the backup moral is, hey, have you considered making all your characters Chinese sometimes?")

  [RSS Entry Title Text](#s " the other backup moral is that, in retrospect, i guess the sorcerer didn't need aladdin at all, that's weird")



  Also, check out [the sequel](http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=2015)!

    Why didn't he need Aladdin. He was trapped in the cave, but he could have been killed, and that could have been the Sorcerer.

      He already had a wish-granting ring, though, I think is the point. Even if it was limited.

        Maybe he wanted an upgrade since his current one wasn't powerful enough to end all suffering.

        As I recall from actually reading the story, the magician is for some reason unable to use the ring or retrieve the lamp. I think that you can only do either if you are naive, or something, kind of like the "diamond in the rough" concept from the Disney film. That's why he sends Aladdin: the magic somehow bars him from retrieving the lamp himself. I don't think he actually knows that the ring can summon genies, only that it's magical and somehow related to retrieving the lamp.
        ```

- u/Nepene:
  ```
  That's the sort of wish you make very carefully. If there's one genie there's probably others. You first need to check on the local magical threats.
  ```
