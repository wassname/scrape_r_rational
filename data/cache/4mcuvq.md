  So domesticated animals are a thing in this setting.  That leaves the obvious question.  What happens when you feed a thousand hearts to a pig?

  I get the feeling nobody really wants to invest the hearts in finding out.

  For the reader's sake, translations have been made whenever the subject of weeks and years are brought up. At the time *The Glimwarden Chronicles* takes place, the calendar system in use was a remnant of Tor Ellsum. The clergy there used a base nine numbering system, which was largely vestigial in Light's Hollow. This calendar had nine-day week-equivalents, nine-week month-equivalents, and a nine-month cycle. This resulted in a calendar with 729 days, with a single extra day tacked on at the end to make up the difference (Tripartite Day). As the Jorón lived on a planet with years equal in length to our own, each calendar cycle covered two orbital periods. While the clergy might have found the symmetry of nines pleasant, there were some obvious problems with regards to this calendar, namely that some conversion was necessary if (for example) you wanted to plant your crops at the same time each orbital period. Nevertheless, no later attempts at reform met with success, even after society had largely switched away from the nonary system.

  Whenever a year is expressed, it refers to an Earth calendar year rather than the Jorón calendar year, which is twice as long. This is primarily to avoid confusion with regards to ages, all of which the reader would have to mentally double if translation was more literal, e.g. the text would describe Sander as being eight years old. Depending on context, I have sometimes translated the Jorónese word for a nine-day calendar period into a literal "nine days", but in many places I have simply left it as "a week" since it seldom matters to the narrative whether a week consists of nine days or seven (and a declaration of nine days might feel oddly specific if the reader does not know or remember the cultural context).

  Sander's math is therefore somewhat more simple than the translation would suggest, because he is only multiplying basic numbers together and doing a standard conversion from nonary afterward.

    Oh, you haven't been told? The editor felt "The Glimwarden Chronicles" was too long and complicated to understand for readers of this world. We just call it "Glimwarden" here.

  So I wonder about limits and hacks to the system. Lanterns 2-7 are usually built in the natural hexagonal circle packaging. What happens if you then turn of the middle one, taking care to have a high flux in the interlapping zones? 

  Do darklings just SPAWN inside the light hollow? If not you can get away with much fewer lanterns overall. Either no one ever tried - or they did with catastrophic results.
  ```

  - u/SometimesATroll:
    ```
    Another possibility:  some darklings can fly or burrow.
    ```

    - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
      ```
      Thats a terrifying thought. I think that not happening, the world would look different if it were - airdiving darklings and (possibly) earth-protected burrowing darkling attacks would make the cities less secure than they seem.
      ```

      - u/CCC_037:
        ```
        Maybe lanterns protect in a sphere, and that sphere is not blocked by mere dirt and soil? So burrowing darklings can't even get close to the surface, and air-dropping ones would evaporate in mid-air?
        ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    This will be at least partially answered in the next chapter, and fully explored in chapter 7 (according to current plans anyway; I only write about two chapters ahead).
    ```

  - u/RMcD94:
    ```
    If darklings spawn then you can farm them and people wouldn't have the setup they have now. That's my guess.

  Sander sure didn't have much of worth to say to his dad. No wonder he wasn't looking forward to it. 

  >. “Of course, it leaves you weak and helpless after the fact, not to mention drained of bind, but it’s better than dying, and if you don’t have anything to lose, why not?”

  Maybe this would have been better to test after taking Sander into the woods rather than before? You know, so if a Darkling got past Merry he would be fit and fully charged to have a better chance of not being harmed? It's nice to have the information about his signature beforehand, perhaps, but it's not useful if he has no way to use it. Oh well, Merry seems competent enough.

  >She paused for a moment and then grinned at Sander. “The bad kind of friction, mind you.”

  >Sander blushed. “It wasn’t just the runeworkers,” said Sander, eager to move on from Merry’s lewdness. 

  So pure! Someone could take advantage of him through this in the future.

  Something I was confused about before that hasn't clarified on reread: the first chapter says

  >Killing a darkling wasn’t supposed to be about making a killing blow, or even removing its body parts one by one, it was about inflicting enough cumulative damage that it was left with no reserves. 

  This gave the impression that taking down Darklings is a battle of endurance in most circumstances, a diminishing of HP bars that theoretically can make a group of them dangerous even for experienced Glimwardens (since they can't just one-shot them with superior power).

  But that seems to be exactly what Merry is saying her guns are capable of.  Except when she shot it:

  >The darkling didn’t seem to be effected by the hit; it began sprinting toward them, occasionally pushing off the trees with its claws as it went by for more speed. Sander had thought that it would die from the pistol shot; he stepped back with his borrowed pistol drawn. For her part, Merry had drawn a dagger and seemed unconcerned by what was happening.

  Not even a visible loss of substance, until

  > She had stabbed it through straight to the very core and killed it in the instant that it jumped at her.

  So apparently a one-shot is possible if you can pierce the heart, but that's difficult normally because of all the substance being in the way. My hypothesis is that the bullet bored a line through its substance near enough to the core that she could just pierce it with a dagger and go for an insta-kill. If that's the case, why didn't it close its wound the way it did against Sander? Not enough time? I get that Merry's not the best verbal instructor, by her own admission, but I think it can still stand to be better explained. 

  Looking forward to seeing the new type of monster in action next chapter!

    If I had to guess, I'd say that a darkling is basically a construct like the Lanterns that utilises the energy of the hearts in a different way. Damaging it saps energy from the system (potentially causing it to lose coherence), but destroying the heart shuts it down outright.

    I'm not terribly confident in that model, but it makes a nice literary parallel with the Lanterns. "HP and heart=crit" makes about as much sense, but doesn't quite fit with the technical portrayal of the Lantern technology.

    In this case, Merry was either trying to illustrate the issue of effective range with her pistols or trying to goad the darkling into attacking.
    ```

  ```
  Mhhh... As other people said, the fact that the town in completely glimlit instead of bordered by a glimlight fence probably means that the centre of the ring wouldn't be safe from darklings, either because they can spawn in or because they can bypass the fence.

  Could you make a hunting reserve that way? If the darkling spawn inside, it would probably be a much safer hunting ground than the forest, with bunkers, easier scouting, etc. The amount of darkings there might not be enough to sustain the lanterns, but it would still be a nice bonus.

  Otherwise, I like Sander's arrogance here.  He says: "Half die in the first year, but it’s not so grim after that. If you could figure out why that first year was so bad then you’d be able to mitigate whatever factors are at play." 

  Okay, so let's say those factors are, 1: they suck at fighting, and 2: their bones are too easy to break because they haven't eaten enough hava yet. What do you do about that? Make double sure the darklings don't eat you?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    It's pretty easy. If you ever find yourself about to be devoured by a darkling, don't do that. If it happens again, don't do that a second time. Really, it's as easy as not doing that, and doing it again! And again. And again. For the rest of your life.

    I don't quite follow what point you're making about self awareness being rare. Main characterdom is hardly a randomly assigned process, so the characters both being self aware is entirely plausible
    ```

- u/alexanderwales:
  ```
  Last time, Sander made a journey into the woods in order to become a glimwarden against his father's wishes.

  This time: Training, visiting a lantern, a power is revealed, and an omen for the future.

  (I'll get to any comments or corrections later in the day today. Thanks for reading!)

  I really hope that this fiction ends with something in orbit.  Or at the very least, you could use long range teleportation for trade with adjacent cities... That must be expensive and dangerous right now!
