## [Q] Any recommendations for "infrastructure fic"?

### Post:

/u/alexanderwales's excellent recent [Instruments of destruction](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11685932/1/Instruments-of-Destruction) (also [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3y0mu3/rt_instruments_of_destruction_a_star_wars/)) reminded me of my own [Stargate Physics 101](https://archiveofourown.org/works/3673335) (also [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/323qwe/dcsf_how_the_stargate_system_was_designed/)).

I'm interested in more examples of similar fiction: Behind the scenes looks at how features of existing canons came about. Especially if it has the same effect as these two of making people in some specific job go "Oh god this is too real" when they read a work of fiction about their job...

This seems like a thing where instances would have appeared on /r/rational. Any recommendations?

  Does Instruments of Destruction have any Force Awakens spoilers?
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    It's original trilogy only (plus some numbers for specifications pulled from the EU).
    ```

  - u/bbrazil:
    ```
    No apparently.

  The martian, and Seven Eves . . . maybe.  I'll have to think about but that's all I have after five minutes.

    BTW thank you for stargate physics: I routinely recommend it to non-fanfictiony programmers as a way of explaining proper software testing and design.

    Seveneves wasn't Infrastructure fic, it was really good Kerbal Space Program fan-fiction.

    Which I enjoyed, up to where the physics got literally impossible, and the sociology astronomically unlikely. But the first two thirds was good.

    Other stuff in the same vein you might enjoy: Heart of the Comet, and the Queendom of Sol trilogy, and The Wreck of the River of Stars.

      Completely agree on seveneves, I think I picked it because it was a recent listen, you summed it up nicely.  I did especially enjoy the heroic culture of astronauts being willing to die to do the impossible, though the nuclear power inaccuracies/sermonizing/strategic failures were fairly annoying, though the depiction of a fuel element failure was fairly on point.  Beyond that, like you said KSP fanfiction.

      For true fiction about infrastructure, try Kim Stanley Robinson's *Aurora* or *Red Mars*. But they're not infrastructure fanfic, sadly.
      ```

  - u/DRMacIver:
    ```
    The Martian isn't quite what I had in mind, although I agree it's excellent. I usually describe it as "A novel about logistics only not boring like that makes it sound". :-)

    I've not read SevenEves because I don't really like Neal Stephenson.

    And you're very welcome for Stargate Physics. It does seem to do a really unexpectedly good job of conveying how to do my job (although my job usually involves fewer genderqueer werewolves)
    ```

    - u/ArgentStonecutter:
      ```
      The world doesn't have nearly enough genderqueer werewolves.
      ```

    - u/Empiricist_or_not:
      ```
      Do you work in software testing then?
      ```

      - u/DRMacIver:
        ```
        Kinda. I write [testing software](http://hypothesis.readthedocs.org/), and historically my job has involved a lot of being the go to person for "oh god everything is broken why is it broken?" in companies that don't have testing teams.
        ```

- u/FeepingCreature:
  ```
  It's not a fic, but I'd like to strongly recommend [A Succession of Bad Days](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25635541-a-succession-of-bad-days) by Graydon Saunders.

  It's Infrastructure Fantasy. Thanks for giving me a new term.

    ```
    I've started reading the first book (The March North). It's amazing, thanks for the rec!
    ```

- u/alexanderwales:
  ```
  They aren't existing canons, but *The Traitor Baru Cormorant* and *The Laundry Files* both hit similar notes. If you want to read about vampires using a burndown chart or the Occult Secret Service doing paperclip audits, *The Laundry Files* is the series for you. *The Traitor Baru Cormorant* is largely about the intersection between people and economics.

  I've also heard that the Star Wars EU novel *Tarkin* is largely about the construction of the first Death Star, but it's still in the mail, so I don't know whether that's true (or whether it's good).

  ```
  It's in its own universe, but Superiority by Arthur C Clarke is a similarly lighthearted story about R&D and military inefficiency.
