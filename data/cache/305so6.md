  Flitwick seemed remarkably un-Flitwick-like here, in his speech patterns and personality - just felt like someone else who happened to be named Flitwick. Still, nice to finally get some explanation concerning wizards' definitions of the different spell classes.

  Also, I don't know if I'm the only one, but I would definitely be in favor of a less frequent update schedule if it meant longer chapters. These are more like single scenes, which would benefit from being strung together into a _sequence_ of scenes, which would in turn make up a chapter. I have a hard time getting invested when the story is released in periodic-but-small snippets, rather than less-periodic-but-larger chunks. A personal preference perhaps.

    Flitwick seems strange because he's clearly Mad-Eye Moody polyjuiced  to impersonate him and try to tempt Ginny, the obviously-a-dark-wizard, with strange ideas about dark magic.
    ```

    - u/brandalizing:
      ```
      Not only that, he must be time-turned as well as Polyjuiced in order to also have been Polyjuiced Pomfrey in the Hospital Wing.
      ```

        inb4 Ginny is timeturned polyjuiced confunded Moody

      This is going to become a thing, isn't it?

        All joking aside, the time that "Pomfrey" used leglimency on Ginny was 100% Mad Eye Moody. These other mentions, yes, have been jokes, but there's nothing more serious than the threat of a Dark Wizard. We should note, also, that Moody completely called the entire thing (Quirrell being the source of the problems, etc) during Multiple Hypothesis Testing. It's hard to even call the man Mad when he's so 100% right.
        ```

          ```
          He's obviously not mad and nobody calls him mad. They call his eye mad. And the eye is so cool it's mad. They are just jealous of his artifact.
          ```

  What brandalizing said about Flitwick times thousand.

  There is NO way Flitwick knows about logic gates. There is no way he would talk about them even if he knew, as the kids wouldn't know what they are. He didn't even explain them.

  How does Ginny know about logic gates too?
  ```

  - u/RandomDamage:
    ```
    The logic gate terminology is definitely out of place. It takes months to teach the concept of a logic gate to muggles properly, it wouldn't be tossed into a first year magic class first day like everyone could be expected to understand it.
    ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    I was assuming these were curricular changes brought by Harry, now that he is a "permanent fixture in the school." Harry likely explained computer theory to all of the faculty over the summer, and figured out how charms and dark magic should actually be defined.
    ```
