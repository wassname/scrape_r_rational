## Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

The Powers:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *clearly* defined rules that are consistent. The powers may be original or may be from an already realised story.

* The power to be munchkined can not be something broken like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.

The Reverse Munchkin:

* In these scenarios, we will find ways to beat someone or something with a power which is, well, *powerful*.

The Problem:

* In which we solve problems posed by other users. Be smart and expect other users to be smarter.

Note; All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You are an average middle class Joe. You don't have a PhD in physics, you don't have Lex Luthor's resources. But you have the mind of a rationalist and a superpower which you only use once.

  Your power is not something you'd expected when you signed the Pact of Deux Ex Machina. After activation of your power, you will gain perfect knowledge of the functioning of all objects you see for 40 minutes without being overwhelmed. You must see the object directly, no pulling up pictures from the internet.

  Now what would be the things you will choose?

  You can add as many objects as you wish but remember that acquiring them must be economically and physically viable. You can build up on the answers given by others if you desire to do so.



  My answer would be the human body. I can revolutionize medical, chemical and biological sciences + write the comprehensive papers on psychology.

    Does "completely understand" answer the question "how do I make this?"

    If so, my answer: spacetime. If that's not allowed, gravity.
    ```

  - u/Noumero:
    ```
    I do have time to prepare, yes?

    What does it mean, 'see the object directly'? If I look at a part of the object, it counts as 'seeing' it? Can I *understand* the Earth by looking at the ground? If I look at the starry sky at night, will I get the complete knowledge of the evolution of galaxies? Of stars? How can I get the complete understanding of something abstract, like human civilization? Or politics? Or an industry?

    The goal is to figure out Theory of Everything, and preferably become a social expert while I am at it; the Theory of Everything is more important. Hence, it could go two ways.

    I will start near something scientifically controversial (and at night), akin to the aforementioned EM Drive. I *understand* it and the surrounding machinery, then people around me and myself, then the starry sky and the Earth. If it seems I have got everything I need for the Theory of Everything, I refocus on the civilization instead, running to the helicopter I hired and flying around, trying to *understand* cities, businesses, and local governments.

    If the laws of physics seem more complex than that, I should try to *understand* as much various objects as possible. EM Drive, human body, animal's body, some microorganisms, a laptop, a galaxy, a star, the Earth, a vacuum, everything I set my sight on. Instead of going up to *understand* the bigger picture, I drive around the city to get as much different objects as I can.

    Worst-worst-case scenario, I am the best physicist, biologist, and probably psychologist in the world. Best-worst-case scenario, I have a Theory of Everything. Best-best-case scenario, I have a Theory of Everything and a better understanding of humans and human-based systems than anyone else in the world, making the world optimization trivially easy.

    That is, if I don't insta-win by figuring out the mind.
    ```

  - u/InfernoVulpix:
    ```
    One thing I'd consider is the EM drive.  If it works just by a quirk of understood physics that we've missed, it's little loss, but if there really is something producing thrust out of nothing but energy there, I'd gain perfect understanding of it and be able to possibly revolutionize our models of physics or overturn other laws assumed fundamental.

    Hook it up to a power storage unit or a dozen. Contact scientists and make it clear that it is impossible to reverse engineer, have them design something that can generate maximum output from the battery (something strong enough to drain a normal AAA in nanoseconds), and you have a lot of power to waste in creating more consuming devices. Sell giant batteries charged by the infinite battery cheaply to alleviate energy crisis and to make money. 

    Eventually you may want to connect the battery to the power grids of the entire world, construct super batteries to  store excess power in different location so that in case of damage to the connections people won't be deprived of power.

    And then think about entropy. 

    My answer has some problems though. Governments may not be willing to cooperate, they may pressurise you to weaponize it, maintenance of a unified global power network would be tough.

    What's the maximum current it can put out? AA batteries are constant-voltage power sources; you can choose how much current to draw, but most batteries get less and less efficient at high currents.

    A magic AA battery could be realistic and just have its voltage go down as the current goes up, or it could be munchkinable and put out a constant 1.5V no matter what you plug it into.

    I think I read somewhere that if you could have a source of free energy which violates the second law of thermodynamics, then you could break any other law of physics depending on how much extra energy is being created. Anyway, I would sell it as the power source of something that we absolutely need to keep running without ever shutting down, possibly as the power source of a space craft?

  You have the ability to make and reload savestates, as many as you want, however, you lose your memories of the time you spent when you reload. For example, you can save and reload if you are going to die, but you lose the memories since you saved when you reload.

  So far I've got:
  Write a list of things you could do, leaving the last as think of new ideas. Save, get as random a random number generator as you can, either by random.org or something better and do whatever that path is. If it works, save there and repeat, if not, reload, and you would reroll and get something new.

  Is there anything actually random enough? Is there any better options available?
  ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    Ooo! I love this sort of question! Here's a list of important things to keep in mind:

    So the only information I get is whether or not I currently dealing with a load or unloaded save state. This is a horribly broken power if I was allowed multiple save slots so I'll assume that I only have one 'save' at a time (if I saved an hour ago and then save now, I'll only have the latest save of 'now').

    If I could keep a running tally of how many times I have repeated a day, that massively increases the effect of my power. So what I do is write down '1' and make my first save. When I reset, I'll have the knowledge that I made a reset, but not why. So I then write down '2' and make a new save slot 30 seconds later. When I reset again, I write down '3' and save again with a small time delay. This allows me to keep a running tally so I can learn how many times I repeated something. Otherwise if I keep resetting from the same point in time, I won't know how many times I have repeated the same day. NEVER reset more than once from the exact same point in time.

    Okay, now that I have the ability to count my time loops, I can start using my power by taking a list of options of things I want to do and I tie each option to a particular loop number. If I reset after option 1/Loop 1, then that means something bad happened with the first loop. This way I iterate through different events until I hit something I like and don't want to lose the memories of. If I reach the end of the list and there were 60 different choices, then I have gone through 60 loops and with 30 seconds per reset, I have spent only half an hour just testing out all of the options. I can easily use this power to rapidly speed through large lists such as combination locks, different experiments, or anything that we only need a single bit of information on. You don't need randomness, just following a predetermined list will provide enough changes loop to loop.

    Ideally, you want to keep a 'save' ready well in advance of life-threatening accidents. So keep a 'save' ready and resave every third day (or some arbitrary span of time). If you suddenly reset without knowing why, start changing what you do randomly (roll dice or flip coins when making choices). The moment you know (or think you know) what is causing your reset and have the chance/time to make a difference, decide on some condition to determine success or survival, save immediately, and reset ONLY when you don't meet this condition. This way every time you reset, you know for sure that the condition has not been met. If you keep a running tally of how many loops has occurred, then you can know in advance something is seriously wrong if the loop number reach a ridiculously high number.

    You should never rely on randomness to make enough variation from loop to loop. Otherwise if done poorly, there won't be enough variation loop to loop.

    If you want to test whether or not something is random and different loop to loop, then what you do is roll a dice and decide to only loop if you don't get a six or have reached 100 loops. If you reach Loop #100 without rolling a six, then you probably rolled the dice the exact same way getting a four on every loop. If you get a six roughly in the first ten loops, then it's statistically normal and dice rolls can be treated independent of each other loop to loop. If you only get the six at Loop #50 or #75, then it likely means that there are some randomness causing variations between loops, but it's at a lower level than it should be or events are statistically likely to repeat loop to loop, but have a chance to vary and turn out different.

    Now another interesting aspect to this power is if you have two or more people with the same power and the only person who has knowledge of whether or not a loop has occurred is the person who resets first. It would require [vector clocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_clock) to keep track of the current loop numbers!

    Wow! I wrote a lot more than I was expecting. You know what, I think I'm going to play around with this idea and write about it for NaNoWriMo.

    I'm going to have to think if it's possible to solve the halting oracle problem with this power.
    ```

    - u/NotACauldronAgent:
      ```
      ..wow, that's really good, I hadn't thought of consecutive saves. That really just solves the problem, /u/xamueljones. Randomness isn't needed, just simple patterns. Resaving after 30 seconds, documentation, and standardisation make this an incredibly versatile power. Weeks of work in hours, leaving you at the end in a state you are successful. 

      Some traps/counters present themselves:

      1)If someone can kill you before you can make a new save, that sequence just repeats itself, you trying to write 7, getting killed, reloading and repeating. Some of the risks could be mitigated by only saving in areas you know are safe, and perhaps varying your times so a skilled spy and assassin combo can't activate it. Basically, the Death Note problem, try and give away as little information on how your power works as possible.

      2)The RPG classic- The save trap problem. There may be a problem you can't solve, so when you save you get trapped in the proverbial boss room, with weapons that can't damage it, and no way out. Lateral thinking and longer saves would weaken this, but it is a real problem that must be taken into account.


      Also, all this time travel really is more mindbending than I thought it would be when I started. Feel free to use it, I'd love to see where it could be taken.
      ```

      - u/xamueljones:
        ```
        > If someone can kill you before you can make a new save, that sequence just repeats itself.

        I think that's only an issue if you automatically reset when you die. If I was writing a story, I wouldn't give my protagonist that much power and require him/her to perform an action to reset. This way, when the protagonist is dying of old age, there aren't infinite resets.

        > The RPG classic- The save trap problem.

        That's true and my protagonist would only notice it as the number of resets increase and increase. The problem is further compounded when you realize that due to not remembering your previous thoughts about a problem, you are very likely rethinking similar solutions or ideas. This problem is mitigated by asking other people for ideas (conversations are more likely to vary than thoughts) or free word association where you randomly generate three words from a dictionary or online and try to come up with new ideas starting from the words. Anyway, there is no fear of spending literally infinite time on this, because you are making consecutive saves which each has a time delay meaning sooner or later you will run out of time and have to face the consequences.

        I have a question for you. What do you think would be an interesting problem for someone with this power? Because I have been deeply drawn into the idea of writing a story of someone with this power. It's so fascinating since most time travel powers are so powerful while this one is deceptively weak. So I was wondering if you can think of an interesting conflict to base the story around. I want to write about two or more people with this power, but I would find it boring to simply set them against each other.

        Here's a time loop story I would like to recommend. It's [Hard Reset 2](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/145711/hard-reset-2-reset-harder) a My Little Pony fanfiction story. I know ponies aren't everyone's cup of tea, but it's a really good story about multiple intersecting time loopers dealing with an invasion. Warning, it hasn't updated in 2 years, so that might aggravate you. Don't worry about missing the 'first' book in the series, because that was [Hard Reset](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362/hard-reset) written by another author which Hard Reset 2 is based on and is not required reading.

    If you're reloading a save state and cannot take any information back you'll just reroll the exact same thing, pseudo random isn't random. Random.org is incredibly difficult to predict, but not actually different if you reset the world and push the button at the same time.

          I admit to my physics ignorance on this topic, but my understanding of electron probability clouds aren't deterministic. Obviously, this is hard to check irl, but if you were to split the universe/do the time reload, and checked the same atom, would the electrons always come out in the same way?

        - u/rulezberg:

          Yes, you're right. You would "wake up", and even if you decided to wait a random time before rolling a number, it would always be the same time.

  I guess this is just a general munchkinry problem, but I'd like to see what exploits everyone can see in this CYOA.

  I feel two of the powers deserve errata:

  Rewind: If you go back to before you obtained the time reversal power, and obtain it again, you are still under the effect of the cooldown until it would naturally end. You are under no obligation to take it a second time, however.

  Portals Maker: For the purpose of "organic matter," any matter that is or was alive at some point, was biologically created by something living, or was biologically attached to something living is considered organic. Chemical refinement of organic materials tends to destroy the quality of "organicness" that is used by the portals.

  I believe that my own solution to this is perhaps one of the best builds initially, but I'd like to see what others come up with individually to see if they can spot the same exploits I can.

  Not knowing how much interest I'll get, I'll just put it in a [spoiler.](#s "Celestial Courier:")

  [](#s "Loadout: Portals Maker, Divine Speed, Divine Guardian, Godly Mind, God's Eye, and Ancient Mysteries.")

  [](#s "Strategy: I'll use Portals Maker and Divine Speed to whiz around the world far faster than anyone else with either, using Godly Mind to keep my position straight and God's eye to spot the cubes for ancient mysteries. However, with just that loadout, it's not much use. Sure, I can cover the surface of the earth in hours instead of weeks, but I can't carry the inorganic cubes with me through portals. That's where Divine Mule comes in: It can be summoned instantly to you, carrying whatever it's supposed to be holding. After I get all the cubes I meditate for less than two weeks to get Ascended and then screw off to the middle of space to get all the points in peace. Depending on how long it takes to meditate with a cube I'll probably get sixth sense. After the couple of hundred points from all the cubes, I steamroll the competition and eliminate any existential threats like telepaths.")
  ```

  - u/Menolith:
    ```
    What is the point in _not_ taking Ancient Mysteries? On short term you have slightly less abilities, but you have access to 1000 extra points which makes splooging in Portal Maker so much worth it. You just need that and Godly Mind to be able to easily track down most of the cubes, and you'd only need something to help you survive underwater to get them all.

    After you've spent some time unearthing and subsuming the cubes you have more points than you started with _and_ a free mobility kit.

    After that, I think that Divine Engineer, Creator, Sanctuary, Divine Memory, Double Trouble and a pile of Expertise/anything intelligence-affecting would be pretty broken.

    An polymath genius engineer god with absolute local omniscience and the ability create exotic materials out of nowhere? Good luck tackling that.
    ```

  - u/xavion:
    ```
    Time travelling to before you obtained the powers to get more powers seems unviable, consider that per the lore at the top it's a god who possesses those powers giving you part of their power to grant you powers. Hence the source of powers should be fully aware of time travel, and presumably can detect that you already have a fragment of their power and won't just decide to give you another one for no reason.

    Your plan also has an inherent flaw, there are 999 other people out there, and a lot of them should be competing with you. Sure if nobody else was after them you'll be fine, but everybody else knows they exist, and who knows how many took the ability to sense any cubes within 1km of them.

    God's Eye doesn't grant you the ability to spot the cubes either does it? Sure it grants super vision but remember a trait of the cube is that they appear to be unremarkable stone cubes, or will you just scour the earth looking for any stone cubes and hope they're all the same size to simplify things?
    ```

    - u/CreationBlues:
      ```
      Time traveling to before you got your powers to get a second chance to spend points, not double dip on your points.

      God's eye grants you the ability to see through matter, and you can tell when a cube is definitely within a kilometer of you. Being able to scan through walls and the ground will be easier and faster than trying to triangulate the position of the cube with your detection radius, or just randomly scouring the ground.

      The previous [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/makeyourchoice/comments/3kuvu2/demigods_cyoa_from_tg/) had about a third of the people gunning for the cubes. If your serious and start running from go, it'll take a couple of days or weeks to cover the entire surface of the earth using superspeed, and there's not much you can do to speed that up, so you'll be splitting your loot with everyone who had the same idea.

      With portals you can cover the entire surface of the earth in hours, giving you a humongous advantage over everyone else. However, that only allows you to find the cubes quickly. Because of the nature of the power, you can't take them with you.

      My ideas pretty unique because it bypasses the portal's restriction on inorganics by using the Divine Guardian as a mule that can be instantly summoned wherever I am, sort of as a secondary inventory. I didn't see anyone going in this sort of direction, or really discussing the possibility of this particular exploit in the old thread.
      ```

      - u/xavion:
        ```
        How would going back in time to spend your points again help though? Seems like three options. 

        1. It's just your mind going back, and thus you'll have lost all your powers due to not having the spark of divine power so you just get a single chance to repick your powers which expires in 24 hours. This seems by far the least likely.
        2. It's your mind and divine fragment going back, in which case things get kinda weird but you've still already picked out your powers so nothing changes really other than you get an ~24 hour head start.
        3. You physically go back, body, mind, fragment and all. In this case it's still just really getting an ~24 hour headstart, as you've already chosen your powers and you just displace yourself physically back through time and don't reset your spark to a state where you hadn't chosen powers.

        God's Eye could help over triangulation, but that's unlikely to be too much of a help. As far as scouring the earth's surface? We can just input the relevant numbers in to Wolfram|Alpha to find out. Movement speed of Mach 1, covering an area 2km wide, assume you can somehow maintain that constantly and don't suffer delays or the like. It's [a mere 7 years to cover all the land area of earth](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=land+area+of+earth+%2F+(Mach+1+*+2km)), that's assuming surface counts as just land area and they won't be hidden underwater or anything. Needless to say if you also have to scour the oceans things get a lot slower.

        For portals I'm presuming you're presuming that portals can be created and destroyed as fast as you can think of them? And you can target them with something like "1km ahead of me" with ease so you can basically just dip into the universe for a tiny distance every 1km along you leap frog? Depends on how people want to exploit them to counter that, for example the portals power neither lists that your portals aren't linked to anyone else's portals or that you can destroy portals, in fact it actually states the exact opposite for both of those, although it at least implies that they can be destroyed. Even with that you'll still likely attract a huge amount of attention and suffer mental fatigue, along with it still taking a decent amount of time.

        It's still totally vulnerable to my own build for countering it however, which involves a power I've seen pretty much nobody take, and nobody mention taking for this purpose.

        Portals Maker, Divine Weapon (Laser Sniper Rifle), Divine Speed, Regeneration, Marital Prowess (Sniper Rifles), God's Eyes, Expertise (Contemporary History), Expertise (Theology) 

        And that is how I counter everyone taking Ancient Mysteries or the like, just steal the cubes off them myself. Right up to those last two it's basically just a very dangerous ranged build with high mobility, the ability to get anywhere and take someone out from range, and thanks to it being a laser rifle with God's Eye and being the best marksman with snipers on the planet along with Divine Speed there won't be any dodging or anything.

        No, the lynchpin is the exploit that are those two expertise. Granting you all of humanities knowledge, and the auto-updating knowledge, on gods and divinity. As demigods are still human, if enhanced humans, I'll also automatically get any knowledge they have or discoveries they make as to divinity and gods. You've found a cube? Well that's an interesting discovery as to divinity you've made there, and now I know it too, only you don't know I know it and I can form a portal a distance away and proceed to use the horribly broken ranged combo I took and unless you took Sixth Sense or Seer of the Infinite you won't even know anything is coming. Add in knowledge of all of humanities knowledge of present events? There's no way people should be able to go throwing around powers or discovering cubes or anything with out me knowing, and thanks to Theology I get automatic knowledge of all exploits anyone finds with the powers, as that's knowledge of the nature of divinity, nature of divine powers and all that.

        So yeah, in this scenario? You get off to a good start, before I realise what you're doing and know the exploit you're using as you're human so your knowledge is up for grabs if it regards divinity or modern events and proceed to snipe you from 20km away with a laser rifle and steal all the cubes you've helpfully gathered for me. Maybe wait till you start using them so I can grab them while you're meditating and figuring out how to absorb them more quickly using your heightened mind?

  You're lucky.

  This is not all that well-defined, exactly because I'm exploring the idea of _how_ to define it in such a way that it's not enormously overpowered, but let's try these rules for starters:

  * Things happen to you in an oddly convenient way for you. For example, if someone shot at you, their gun would jam, or the bullet would hit the cigarette case in your top pocket; if you bet on a roulette wheel your number will come up; if you jumped out of a plane without a parachute, you'd be that lucky person who landed in a soft snowdrift; you get the job and others don't. That sort of thing.
  * The power tries to minimise the "outlandishness" of what it does: it attempts to give you the least lucky thing that gives you the luck you want. So the gun jams rather than your enemy spontaneously exploding. It finds local maxima, not global ones.
  * It's got some sort of geographic and/or time range; it only looks for "lucky" things that can happen within 10 miles or an hour or something like that. So a lucky-but-plausible chain of events which would have had to have been started over an hour ago can't happen.

  Is this still so overpowered that you can take over the universe with it? (That's not necessarily a deal-breaker, _if_ doing so is difficult and requires lots of working out.) How do you defeat someone with such a power? If you thought you _had_ such a power, how would you test whether you did?

    Sell your hair for money. I found a calculator where you could input information to find out how much your hair is worth. Twelve inches of brown hair, one inch thick, with hair products previously used on it (the worst options for hair quality I could guess at from the options) is worth 84 dollars. If you work for 8 hours a day 5 days a week with two weeks of vacation on just growing hair you would make $24000. However if your hair was blond, over six inches thick (it would probably be pretty thick since you can grow body hair), and untouched by hair products it would be worth $573. You could make about $160,000 per year.  [Here is the link of the hair price calculator](http://hairsellon.com/hair-price-calculator/).

  **Problem: Scientific Theory vs Existential Risk**

  You have learned of a scientist who has, like Maxwell with light, become the first person to understand what a particular fundamental piece of physics is really made of. Hooray, science advances, everyone wins, right?

  The standard Yudkowskyian issue: Said understanding opens up some more opportunities for random individuals to create WMDs with a lower amount of resources.

  The particulars: Let's say that the basic piece of physics is 'inertia', in the form of a tweaked version of [MiHsC](https://physicsfromtheedge.blogspot.ca/), and the form of WMD is that if you can rocket anything up out of the bottom of Earth's gravity well, even something as small as a cubesat, you can accelerate it out and back fast enough to have nuke-level kinetic energy impacts within a moderately short timespan. (Introducing a possible solution to the Fermi paradox - every species in our past light-cone which made it to orbit blew themselves up.)

  What changes to your choices should you make based on these conditions? What choices should high-level politicians make with this level of changes to the current form of nuclear stalemate?
