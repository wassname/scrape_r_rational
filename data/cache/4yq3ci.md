## [Q] What are the staple histories that are not on the wiki

### Post:

Hi guys,

I found this subreddit a couple of weeks ago and i am loving it. I have read through a bunch of stuff already including a lot of the stuff on the wiki. I would now like to move on and read some of the stuff that is nor marked on the wiki but that is really good.

Right now my favorites from here have been:

* A hero's war
* Mother of Learning
* Harry potter and the methods of rationality
* Practical guide to Evil
* How to avoid death

With that in mind what  stories from this subreddit would you recommend?

Thanks for any help you can provide.

  [The Waves Arisen](https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/chapter-1/) is a personal favourite of mine - it's a rational!Naruto story, and while the author is anonymous, I think the consensus is that most likely the author of HPMOR wrote it.
  ```

    I also love *The Waves Arisen*, but I don't think it shares an author with *HPMoR*.  The styles are reasonably different, I don't think the timing works, and there are a few minor things that support the conclusion.  It seems likely to be someone in the core LW membership though.

    (Also, I feel like EY is the kind of person who likes to take credit for stuff they wrote? I don't see why they would publish a work under a pseudonym.)

  Heya, welcome to the sub!

  I should probably plug the podcast (by Alexander Wales and myself), as Episode 0 goes over the history of the genre and lists some other stories you might enjoy:

  Hope you enjoy it!

  2YE should really be on there as well and I just added it.

  Also, Chiang's stuff is good. I'll add that to the wiki as well.

  I would highly recommend "Significant Digits" and "Draco and the Practice of Rationality". There's also EY's earlier fiction, "Three Worlds Collide".

  Anything by alexanderwhales; "The Metropolitan Man", "Shadows of the Limelight", "Glimwarden" (currently being written).


  Also commonly listed are Wildbow's "Worm" and "Twig" (and for some of us, "Pact").

    ```
    Er, you do mean alexanderwhales, right? Scott Alexander is of slatestarcodex and unsong fame.
    ```

    - u/narfanator:
      ```
      Dammit, names. Yes, alexanderwhales.
      ```

      - u/Fredlage:
        ```
        There's no 'h' though
        ```

  - u/noggin-scratcher:
    ```
    I know that getting his name wildly wrong is a running joke on /r/parahumans but that looks close enough up be a typo: author of Worm is wildbow, not wildb**l**ow
    ```

  - u/waylandertheslayer:
    ```
    The Superman one is 'The Metropolitan Man' and the lantern one is 'Glimwarden'. If you've read Worm, I also recommend the Memorials series (about as rational as Worm is, and very well-written - basically solo!Taylor the fanfic).
    ```

  - u/trekie140:
    ```
    Fair warning about Metropolitan Man, it is not a superhero story. Do not expect to get out of it what you normally get from a superhero story, let alone one about Superman. It is intentionally depressing and cynical, and if you don't want to see Superman in a story like that you shouldn't read it.
    ```

- u/ToaKraka:
  ```
  The first four books of *[The Runelords](https://www.goodreads.com/series/41322)* have been discussed here [previously](http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ket47).

    i read the summary and it just doesn't seem appealing to me.
    ```

- u/Xenon_difluoride:
  ```
  /r/Hpmor has a sticky with some stories that aren't on the wiki
  ```

  - u/techgorilla:
    ```
    thanks i will check it out
    ```

  ```
  Is "staple histories" some kind of rhyming slang variant for "stories"?
  ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    I'd guess English is his second language-- 'historia' is spanish for 'story' (and not just history) and "hist√≥ria" is portuguese for story.
    ```

    - u/waylandertheslayer:
      ```
      Histoire is french for story, too - maybe it's common to all latin-based languages?
      ```

      - u/Liberticus:
        ```
        Historia is a Swedish word for story, pretty close I guess.
        ```

    - u/Solonarv:
      ```
      It's the same in French ('histoire') and German ('Geschichte'), too.
      ```

    - u/techgorilla:
      ```
      oooh i see now i wrote histories, not stories. Yes my main language is spanish and i sometime get those confused.
      ```

  - u/techgorilla:
    ```
    i do not understand the joke. sorry.
    ```

    - u/TJ333:
      ```
      Staple histories does not make sense as a phrase. He is asking if you are using some kind of slang.
      ```

      - u/techgorilla:
        ```
        Ahhhh. well English is not my first language. Y thought staple also meant something like the main or best of something. I guess i am wrong.

        EDIT: oooh i see now i wrote histories, not stories. Yes my main language is spanish and i sometime get those confused.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          Staple does mean that, but history means past. I think you meant stories, not histories
          ```

          - u/techgorilla:
            ```
            yes i meant stories. i get those confused a lot. sorry.
            ```

- u/Areign:
  ```
  Eliezer Yudkowsky endorsed Significant Digits as a great continuation fic of his HPMOR

  There are a lot of shorts on here if you go to 'top alltime' that you should check out

  1) ...And i show you how deep the rabbit hole goes

  2) the great filter

  3) The Randi Prize

  4) The Rules of Wishing
  ```

- u/Fredlage:
  ```
  I strongly recommend [The Gods Are Bastards](https://tiraas.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/)
  ```
