## [Q] The Power of Truth

### Post:

Consider the following power. Any handwritten note that has any set of true statements will burn green. If the note contains any false statements or any utterance that is not a statement then it will burn red. The method of burning does not matter, nor does it matter who wrote the note. It does not matter what the note is written on. You must be directly causally responsible for burning the note. The power is infallible except when considering the future. (It can predict what is likely to happen in the future, but not what actually will happen.)

Given this power, I have two questions. First, what would you use this power to do? Second, assuming someone else has this power, what would you recommend they do?

EDIT: As grammatically correct meaningless statements are possible, they would burn red just like non-statements and false statements.

  uh. immediately collapse the complexity class heirarchy into at most linear time/space. become god, a la scott aaronson:

  >Even many computer scientists do not seem to appreciate how different the world would be if we could solve NP-complete problems efficiently. I have heard it said, with a straight face, that a proof of P = NP would be important because it would let airlines schedule their flights better, or shipping companies pack more boxes in their trucks! One person who did understand was G ̈odel. In his celebrated 1956 letter to von Neumann (see [69]), in which he first raised the P versus NP question, G ̈odel says that a linear or quadratic-time procedure for what we now call NP-complete problems would have “consequences of the greatest magnitude.” For such an procedure “would clearly indicate that, despite the unsolvability of the Entscheidungsproblem, the mental effort of the mathematician in the case of yes-or-no questions could be completely replaced by machines.”

  >But it would indicate even more. If such a procedure existed, then we could quickly find the smallest Boolean circuits that output (say) a table of historical stock market data, or the human genome, or the complete works of Shakespeare. It seems entirely conceivable that, by analyzing these circuits, we could make an easy fortune on Wall Street, or retrace evolution, or even generate Shakespeare’s 38th play. For broadly speaking, that which we can compress we can understand, and that which we can understand we can predict. Indeed, in a recent book [12], Eric Baum argues that much of what we call ‘insight’ or ‘intelligence’ simply means finding succinct representations for our sense data. On his view, the human mind is largely a bundle of hacks and heuristics for this succinct-representation problem, cobbled together over a billion years of evolution. So if we could solve the general case—if knowing something was tantamount to knowing the shortest efficient description of it—then we would be almost like gods.

  What about indeterminate statements?

  You've just created a perfect oracle. You can use it to generate the answer to any question that has a knowable answer expressible in a finite number of symbols, including creating working software to solve any computable problem in any instruction code.

  And I don't even have to be able to think up the solutions.

  First step, don't reveal it until I've gotten it to tell me who the best person to reveal the power to. I don't want to end up in a basement cell in Fort Meade.

  Second step, create the Singularity.

  Do the binary search to find the answers I need the most.

  - "The first letter of of the most valuable sentence I can read is in the first half of the alphabet." [True/False]

  - ".... is in the first quarter" [True/False]

  Same for the second letter, and so on.
  ```

  - u/Norseman2:

    You might need to rephrase that to "The first letter of the sentence *I would consider* most valuable to read is in the first half of the alphabet." Seems like a very promising approach.

    ```
    You get back gibberish because humans are complex systems and the most valuable sentence you can read fluctuates from instance to instance.

        Sentences are unbounded in length, you would need to bound the sentence in order to know the time you will be able to read the sentence at.

  You're asking how to achieve godhood with a perfect binary oracle?

  Firstly, check stuff like "there is a God", "this is a computer simulation", "time-travel to the past is possible". Oh, and "FAI, as conceived of by MIRI, is possible and desirable."

  After that, binary searches are probably the way to go; I'd use a dictionary, or maybe a list of the [ten hundred most common words](https://xkcd.com/1133). "Is the answer to my question in the first half? Is it in the first half of the first half? Is it in the first half of the second half of the first half?"

  The *ideal* way to do this would be to assign binary codes to each word, and maybe even have a program automatically print out the "answers" you're going to test. But the main thing is the binary; "The first digit of the code for the first word in the answer to my question is 1; the second digit of the code for the first word in the answer to my question is 1", etc. can all be tested simultaneously.

  Given that ... questions. I'd go for "what is the correct ethical theory", or some slightly better-worded version of that, first. Then maybe some stuff to make money (you could solve some well-known unsolved problems and make money off that, or just ask for the words to email to rich people that would make them give you their money), then I guess you should go on to "what is the shortest program that generates an FAI?" Maybe ask for the Theory of Everything and a way to unify all nations on Earth under you or some other benevolent ruler, as well.
