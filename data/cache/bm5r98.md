      I did something similar while I was taking a Journalism class, but based on My Little Pony's series premiere: [the journalist's first draft](https://www.deviantart.com/duplexfields/art/Nightmare-Moon-News-Article-1-205877939) and the [government-censored version](https://www.deviantart.com/duplexfields/art/Nightmare-Moon-News-Article-2-205878610).

  I don't really get the implication of the strickland connection.  was the funeral staged or time-manipulated somehow?

    ```
    There's implication that a time traveler (not necessarily Doc himself) killed or staged the murder of Strickland to cover up the existence of teleporting car with working portable nuclear reactor from the feds.

  I haven't seen Back to the Future, but nice!
