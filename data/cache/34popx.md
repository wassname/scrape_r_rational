## Mysterious Post-it notes left in apartment

### Post:

Not sure, if [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/34l7vo/ma_postit_notes_left_in_apartment/) really fits here. It reads like the start of an interesting horror story, so it might be inspirational. The [top comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/34l7vo/ma_postit_notes_left_in_apartment/cqvrdz6) suggests an explanation, which is [verified in another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/34m92h/update_ma_postit_notes_left_in_apartment/). Fascinating how chemicals affect our brains. The "protagonist" seems quite rational about it, but is completely off.

  It's very scary to look at the explanations in the other thread and see what was really going on. Memory loss I can almost cope with, but he doesn't recognize his own handwriting, and later thinks a letter from his mother is really from his landlord. He thinks there's people breaking into his apartment, but it was just him all along... It reads like something from the SCP Foundation.

  Except it's real. (Assuming OP isn't a pathological liar on top of everything else, of course.)

  I'm confused as to why the webcam files were deleted. Is the implication that he viewed them and deleted them?

    Nah, I think there were never any files to begin with.

I also "set up" a webcam by placing it on a shelf, downloading a camera app to my phone, and making a folder on my desktop called "WEBCAM" and made an iphoto library in the folder.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/34m92h/update_ma_postit_notes_left_in_apartment/cqw99ip)

  [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/34m92h/update_ma_postit_notes_left_in_apartment/cqwheig) comment has a video showing how terrifying it is. [] (#s "Symptoms like euphoria and overconfidence mean survival is pretty much a matter of luck.")

    On the other hand that video is from a documentary about executions and basically says that CO is the nicest way to kill someone.
