  Oh yay, I'm glad I found this subreddit. Seems like the perfect place for something I wanted to bring up. I don't know if anyone else noticed it, but here I go...

  Over the couple of re-reads I did during the wait for a new chapter, there was one off-hand comment that really interested me. In chapter 17, as the matriarch explained what being "Open" meant to Zorian, she mentioned that one of the characteristics was having "an occasional prophetic dream".

  On the next re-read, I noticed there *was* one instance where Zorian's dreams had been mentioned: in chapter 5, just after Zorian restarts for the first time, where though he speculates that he was just dreaming, he reasons that his dreams were usually bizarre and fleeting and that the memories he got from his previous live-through of the month had "no talking birds, floating pyramids, three-eyed wolves and other surreal scenes his dreams usually contained".

  Hmm...

  Chapter 28: when Silverlake starts a conversation with him, "the source of the speech was the raven perched on a nearby branch".

  Chapter 38: during another of Xvim's sessions, one of the shapes that Zorian was ordered to make out of the mass of marbles he had to levitate was a pyramid.

  I think we can assume that there'll be a three-eyed wolf sometime in the future? Possibly the Silver One/the sapient alpha wolf guarding Iasku Mansion?

  Another month, another chapter. My only criticism of this story is of how long I have to wait between chapters... heh, a month time loop, a  month(ish) between chapters... 

  Since I'm (once again) dying for another chapter, are there any other good time-loop stories out there? Aside from Time Braid I haven't been able to find many that aren't crackfics or single-backwards-time-travel-do-overs. (aka peggy sue)

      I read a terminator one that I really liked but I can't for the life of me remember what it was called....

      -edit- Found it! [Branches on the tree of time](http://rationalfiction.io/story/branches-on-the-tree-of-time). Plus there is another Naruto looping fic that was pretty good: [time braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid)

      -edit2- And I just realized you probably didn't meantion time braid because he explicitely mentions it in his post.

        Indeed, I did mention Time Braid, but it is still an excellent time loop story. So karma to you. :P I'll look at Branches on the tree of time too, sounds like an interesting read. :D

      And of course [Hard Reset 2: Reset Harder](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/145711/1/hard-reset-2-reset-harder/redundant-verification). It's not actually a sequel to Hard Reset, it's just a version with many more time shenanigans and better planning. It's pretty awesome.

    I discovered it when the last chapter was published and binged on it for 2 days. Now I wish I found it when it was completed. (Was rather lucky wrt. HPMOR in that I found  out about it when it was almost finished). I'm also looking for more rational(ist) stuff to read.

    There's the time loop multiverse [Innortal](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/681915/Innortal) started. There's also Chunin Exam Day for another Naruto. Temporal Beacon and Department of Mysteries Day for Harry Potter.

    [Branches on the tree of time](http://rationalfiction.io/story/branches-on-the-tree-of-time) is a pretty good one, written by /u/alexanderwales

    There is a light novel series called [Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria (The Empty Box and the Zeroth Maria)](http://myanimelist.net/manga/55215/Utsuro_no_Hako_to_Zero_no_Maria) which may interest you. The first volume deals with a time loop, and it's a mystery. The time loop is excessively long, and in an interesting twist the main character has what I guess would be the equivalent of Alzheimer's and the amount he remembers from the loops varies, sometimes just faint feelings of Déjà vu.

    >Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria, tells the sinister story of Kazuki Hoshino, who is almost madly attached to his everyday life, and his antagonist Aya Otonashi, who suddenly transfers into his class—for the 13,118th time. She majestically announces to "break" him, without paying heed to anyone else around them.

    >This is but the start of a dark roller coaster ride that turns the two against themselves, the people around them and the one who may be god. Read on as their relationship slowly changes and they go against their most basic values in their struggle against the world itself.

  It's interesting to note here that as /u/avret said, the invasion wasn't fully successful.  And Red Robe wasn't involved.

  Perhaps Zorian should meet with Zack, and see if he has encountered Red Robe recently?

  So, it seems we will get time loop explanation relatively soon.

  My favourite theory is a primordial prison failsafe. 

  The loop probably started at summer festival, because we now know that dormitories (with original Zorian inside) are not destroyed without RR interference. The loop probably goes for a short time in the host world with great time dilation for the guest world.

  Zach might be the original sacrifice, and prison is configured to select it, because sacrifice restrictions filter out unsuitable heroes. His marker probably has higher privileges as well.

  The endstory bossfight might get quite big.
  ```

  - u/minopoked:
    ```
    I kind of like this theory. But i think that Zorian's marker was more of an accident by the result of the failsafe. Xvim also seems linked to this. Maybe the reason he's asking all these unreasonable manipulation tasks is to weed out the time traveler and assist him/her on his quest. Surely he doesn't know who has the marker in the first place, so this is the method he uses.
    ```

- u/avret:
  ```
  So, Zorian was able to repel the invasion this time.  

  Is there anything we've already heard about cat shifters?  Any piece of world building information?
  ```

  - u/Anderkent:
    ```
    Shifters were mentioned before, chapter 29 at first:

    >"Tell me," he asked. "What do you know about shifters?"

    >"That they're people who have the ability to turn into animals?" Zorian tried.

    >"Shifters are people with two souls," Vani said. "Long in the past, the ancestors of the shifters enacted rituals that fused their souls with the souls of their chosen animals, allowing them to take the forms of the animal in question and even access some of the abilities of said animals in their human form. It is a very old form of magic that predates the Ikosian invasion of Altazia, and I'm sad to say that most shifter tribes have lost the knowledge of the original rituals they used to create their kind. These days, they grow in numbers purely through mundane reproduction, with children of shifters inheriting their parent's dual soul. There exist, however, tribes that retain the knowledge of ritual magic and soul mechanics necessary to perform the ritual in the modern age. While the purpose of such expertise is to turn regular humans into new members of the tribe, it may very well be general enough to help you with you issue."
    ```

- u/FTL_wishes:
  ```
  If we can correlate the appearance of red robe to what Zach does at the beginning of the loops (just vanishing or fighting his way out of his house), I think we can either cross off another speculation or answer the question of just how red-robe time travels.
  ```

  - u/FuguofAnotherWorld:
    ```
    I've been wondering if Red Robe got hit with some beasty backlash by whatever he did to those spider souls. Like how Zorian was comatose for however many loops. If so, now is the time to get shit done.
    ```

  - u/doug89:
    ```
    I wonder if it's possible that RR knows about Zorian already but for what ever reason won't act against him. After the soul kill incident there were two ways I can think of for RR to learn who Zorian is:

    1. If Zach hung around in that loop he could go use mind magic to extract the information, because Zach learned it was Zorian at the end of the soul kill loop.
    2. If he did an investigation he could have found out who was missing in that loop.

    If Daimen was RR and found out he was fighting with his brother, do you think he'd leave the city alone?

  Remembering how good this series is I decided to re-read it, and I was struck by the fragments of the message left behind by the matriarch in Chapter 26:


  [Missing] …mean things went awry. I know you think I had it coming by rushing into this but… [Missing] …simple: the time loop is degrading. I can't tell how long it will be before… [Missing] …can leave at any time. Thus, stopping him was… [Missing] …can only ever be one winner in this game. I am truly… [Missing] …hope it won't be necessary, but just in case I put in a map to… [Missing] …whole other continent. I didn't think it was possible, even with the help of… [Missing]


  A few key points that don't seem to be fully addressed: The matriarch clearly tells Zorian that the time loop is degrading, and his time is limited, yet it still seems like there is all the time in the world. It just seems like things could go on, without end... Additionally the one winner part seems rather important, as do other bits, yet Zorian seems to dismiss it all far too casually. (This is all just my opinion, of course.)

    ```
    >"The Sovereign Gate is an artifact supposedly dating back from his time," Alanic said. "Like many great rulers, Shutur-Tarana has a great many fanciful stories and grandiose claims associated with him, and this particular one claims he either made or found a doorway into another world. Having found he did not age at all while on the other side, he spent '11 lifetimes' there, learning their secrets and honing his skills. Eventually, he grew homesick and decided to go back home. Once he was back in his own world, however, he found the doors forever barred to him. He stored the Sovereign Gate in his royal vault, there to wait for a worthy successor who would repeat his feat and usher the empire in a new age with the wisdom gained from the other side. Or, well, resurrect it… since it is thoroughly dead at this point."

    Yeah, but even if it's degrading, if it originally lasted 11 lifetimes like in the Sovereign's Gate story, it's probably still got a good bit of energy left, even considering that it's probably doing triple duty now. (Which is just one theory about the origin of the time loop, but an interesting one.)

    The part I found most interesting was the "can leave at any time. Thus, stopping him was".  I'm assuming "him" is Red Robe, and that he can leave the time loop at any time, but the Matriarch might have just been referring to him leaving the city and cutting his losses if he knew he'd get interference there.

    The strangest part to me is the last line, which mentions a "whole other continent" we've had almost no mention or interaction with another continent besides Zorian's parents vacationing to where his oldest brother is.

      We could harvest the power of reddit to reconstruct this message :P

      >[You receiving this message must] mean things went awry. I know you think I had it coming by rushing into [this but I do believe it was our best bet. My concern is] simple: the time loop is degrading. I can't tell how long it will be before [it ends. Red Robe?] can leave [the city? the loop?] at any time. Thus, stopping him was [of the greatest importance. There] can only ever be one winner in this game. I am truly [sorry?].

      >I hope it won't be necessary, but just in case I put in a map to [all Bakora Gates in Cyoria, some of which can take you to a] whole other continent. I didn't think it was possible, even with the help of [?]
