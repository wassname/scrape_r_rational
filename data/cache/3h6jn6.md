  The one thing I dislike about this is how the author keeps a lot of the canon characters wearing their idiot hats while the OC get a major upgrade in the thinking department.

  Tomas is Frodo's lightsabre in this story, but where is Cavil's death star?

    I don't think he made his OC that much more unreasonably rational so much as he gave his OC better ships and people to work with.  His OC has people used to living in space (belters) and a specialized factory ship.  The canon characters never had those advantages to work with.

    Canon was a story of a remnant just desperately trying to survive.  This story is setting itself up into a story of humanity rebuilding and reshaping itself.  I think you don't necessarily have to upgrade the villain if they already had an overwhelming advantage in the original story or if you are trying to tell a story with a different set of goals than the original.
