## What's the dwarven word for " mourning what could have been" in WtC?

### Post:

It's in an earlier chapter where Grak is mourning a "what could have been" with Joon. 

Joon offered to be his platonic cuddle buddy to help with that.    Solace became Grak's cuddle buddy instead and they were sleeping in the tree in the bottle together.

Fenn was still alive I think and Joon was learning to speak with Grak in his native tongue.

  Is this different than wistful?

    Yes.   It's grief not tinged wishfulness.    It's what happens when you have a chronic mental or physical illness that shapes your life in such a way that you feel that you have lost much potential and missed out on opportunities and aspects like love, education, jobs, stability, and travel.   You are in a sense mourning lost time and agency.
