  ```
  Multi-chapter finale tomorrow.
  ```

  - u/gregx1000:
    ```
    It's been a pretty amazing and wild ride. Thank you.
    ```

  - u/logrusmage:
    ```
    Oh wow! Didn't realize it'd be ending so soon. Hope the ending is satisfying and/or a sequel is planned.
    ```

    - u/scruiser:
      ```
      A sequel would just have Naruto spamming chakra factories, Rinnegan, and shadow clones to just fix everything forever.  I guess if Kaguya isn't beaten in this fic, she could come up in the sequel.
      ```

- u/Kodix:
  ```
  Poor Hinata. It seems like she'd much rather keep Naruto's eye instead of a sharingan.
  ```

  - u/INeedAUsernameToo:
    ```
    Remember that comment of hers, about how Naruto's chakra would keep trickling into her, forever, now that she had his eye? She'd have something of him inside her always.

    Poor girl. Pretty funny though.
    ```

    - u/rumblestiltsken:
      ```
      Would that "trickle" have led to infinite chakra for her as well? It suggests it boosts her regen, but it certainly hasn't been tested since he had chakra factories.
      ```

- u/scruiser:
  ```
  So Naruto has a human affinity?  Looks like /u/kaukamieli [called it again](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2vd5f5/ffrst_the_waves_arisen_ch16/cogmrdh).

  I think it would be more rational for Naruto to wait till he get more chakra factories online, but it is understandable that he doesn't want Jiriya to die.
  ```

  - u/PeridexisErrant:
    ```
    See, when I first read chapter sixteen I thought his regen was 6.5 *million* per second, not 6,500.

    There's no way stopping there was a good idea - if you've got potentially-infinite regen, there's no sense in stopping before you're at least two orders of magnitude above the theoretical maximum expenditure rate (also uncapped via shadow clones?).

    Naruto!  With just a few more days to work, you could have been a transhuman indefatigable swarm, instead of merely strong...
    ```

    - u/Transfuturist:
      ```
      Naruto might not have had the best grasp on self-reinforcing feedback loops.
      ```

  - u/Nevereatcars:
    ```
    The trouble with that is that, while rational, it's very rarely a good plot point to give your protagonist literally limitless power. Afterwards, there's no tension. If Naruto were currently regenerating four or five thousand times more chakra than every other ninja together, the story would be over.

    As an aside, it's likely that he'll be regenerating four or five thousand times more chakra than every other ninja together by the time the story is over.
    ```

      > If Naruto were currently regenerating four or five thousand times more chakra than every other ninja together, the story would be over.

      I disagree - especially with the final arc starting.  That kind of power isn't a "fix everything" button - simply power.  What do you do with it?  What are the unintended effects?  Would it have been better to simply talk things over?

      There's still an interesting story to be told, when an imperfect character gets grand but still limited power...
      ```

      - u/kaukamieli:
        ```
        The enemy can also have lots of power.
        ```

        - u/PeridexisErrant:
          ```
          Such as, eg, the "legendary bullshit tier" Rinnegan, which he is currently facing six time over...
          ```

      - u/Charlie___:
        ```
        >What do you do with it?

        Literally throw the excess water into space.
        ```

      - u/mns2:
        ```
        Well, being able to learn everything ever all at once with an army of clones is a start.

        Also, having a million or so of yourselves helping everyone out is effectively a win.
        ```

    - u/scruiser:
      ```
      Yeah, I know that.  That's one of the problems of having your protagonist actually munchkin really effectively.
      ```

      - u/Psy-Kosh:
        ```
        Solution: Have the antagonist also be reasonably skilled at munchkining.
        ```

  - u/Transfuturist:
    ```
    I doubted that he would pull a Potter-Evans-Verres, but okay, sure.

    ...How exactly are you supposed to make a summoning contract with humanity?
    ```

    - u/abstractwhiz:
      ```
      Sign a contract giving them money in exchange for labor. Pretty sure we have those IRL too. ;) 

      Well, except for that instant teleportation part. That's probably for the best.
      ```

  - u/kaukamieli:
    ```
    Thanks for callout, but twice you have spoilered me before I read the fic! :D It comes at 03 am my time, I've usually stayed up for this, but not always. :) Shouldn't read the messages before the fic.
    ```

    - u/scruiser:
      ```
      Ouch, sorry, didn't realize.  Well, it was stuff you guessed both times, so I hope it wasn't too ruined for you.
      ```

- u/JanusTheDoorman:
  ```
  And, somehow, the fic that I thought had decided it had gone far enough in making my skin crawl via eyeball-swapping musical chairs opens up a new can of worms with a couple of friends casually discussing the pros and cons of raping adolescent prisoners of war as opposed to regular old serfs.

  Naruto Fanfiction - It's for kids!
  ```

  - u/rumblestiltsken:
    ```
    Considering it had been hinted at already (and the fact no "realistic" ninja fiction can ever get by without at least passing mention of rape) I was actually more surprised that it took until this deep in the fic for Naruto to explicitly point out that civilians were *slaves* with *owners*.

    I guess he just doesn't see it as unusual, having grown up in the society.
    ```

    - u/JanusTheDoorman:
      ```
      I don't think it's the rape itself as much as the casual conversation about on the way to the shop that's skeezing me out. And the fact that it happened *in* Leaf. I guess I'd always thought of wartime rapes as the sort of thing that happens along with the looting that follows a successful invasion in foreign territory, away from the restraints of the centralized institution.

      This says more about how authority and institution have skewed my own sense of what's okay than it does about the relative immorality of raping someone versus talking about it. "Such things are 'uncontrollable deviances of base human nature' as long as they occur away from me and not under the auspices of the institutions that protect me. Or at least, if they are under their auspices, they don't do it *here*"

      Reminds me of the debates about torture in Guantanamo Bay. I wonder how that would have shifted if it was happening in the continental US. Probably not that much if we had been promised that torture was only happening in "special zones" and would surely not happen in the protected zones where human rights were actually a thing and *real* people lived.
      ```

- u/Aretii:
  ```
  I just read this to date in one sitting. It is very, very good, and I look forward to seeing how it ends.

  ...of course, now I've got all these sad feels, because of all the death and of all the callousness to death. Ah, well.
  ```

- u/JackStargazer:
  ```
  >Lee moved to attack, and Naruto recalled the strange-sounding title he had heard used to refer to such people, in ancient timesâ€¦ a title he would have to earn, now, with the strength of infinite chakra.

  >*Emperor.*

  Remember before when I said that escalated quickly?

  That escalated quickly.

  *Again.*
  ```

- u/eltegid:
  ```
  It makes sense that Sasuke and Hinata would not leave clones in Sound, but why wouldn't they leave clones right outside of Rain village before going in for recon?! I thought this was an obvious mistake and it disappointed me :/
  ```
