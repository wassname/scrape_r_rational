## A Rewrite of Empress Theresa and or sequel

### Post:

I've been binge watching a lot of videos of reviews Empress Theresa and the utter insanity of Norman Boutin's attempt to defend his what it comes down to "Don't Disrespect my OC Joan of Arc or get blocked". 

For More Context:

Here is an in depth investigation on both the book and the author: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TedsiCaV2B4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TedsiCaV2B4)

And here is an actual review of the book: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JopR-biL0I4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JopR-biL0I4)

I'm just asking to all the people who share my sentiment with this book, has there been anyone attempted or made a complete rewrite of Empress Theresa? Like remaking it into something more readable and good?

  So much of the plot depends on the general public worshipping Theresa, it would need a *major* rewrite.  
  From reviews I first thought that Theresa was brainwashing everyone, but reading the first page made it very clear Norman was just writing a self-insert power-wank fantasy.  
  Perhaps the brainwashing route, with Theresa being the antagonist and an unreliable narrator, could work.

    My fanfic fluff is that a rag team of anti-Theresa agents infiltrate the inner circle and try to kill Theresa in a direct or indirect way. They'll learn that Theresa quite literally lives inside an echo chamber. Where everything she sees is manipulated or covered so she can live in delusion because of either Blare and or HAL.

  Sounds a bit like the Youjo Senki fanfic [A Young Girls Political Record](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-political-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.660569/), about a reincarnation from our world unwittingly(and competently) politically dominating a weimar Germany analogue.

  First half is an excellent farce type story, but the second half stretches the protagonist's central conceit of "unwitting competency" too far and the story loses a lot of its charm, IMO. Still pretty good.

    I'd completely dissagree; I don't actually think that its "unwitting competency" later on, she is very purposeful in what she does, the unwitting part is more from the perspective not the actual policies put forward. My main example is her reaction to the first cheep car export of not-Germany: She is all for and pushes for investment into a cheep car. She thinks the car that comes out of it is fugly and "who the hell would want to buy this?" but its still her policy of investing into the endeavor that made it successful.

  He reminds me of Henry Darger.

  It's depressing that people spent so much time baiting a man who is clearly mentally ill.

    Its not so much baiting, its more so that people are pissed that the Author is incapable of recieving any criticism for his supposed "magnum opus".

      Incapable is the key word.

  I think you would like "A Better Place". It has a practically omnipotent main character that works to make the world a better place. It's a rather dark deconstruction of a lot of assumptions present in that sort of story and this forum and simply a good read.

  So I realize I'm committing a faux pas in commenting on a super old post, but yesterday during work I ground through KrimsonRogue's entire review of this... *incredible* magnum opus and was struck with inspiration. I've been struggling creatively so hard lately that I've jumped into this feet first, and I'm not coming out til I have at least a vomit draft of a rewrite. I've got the original book in a 178 page word doc and am already 4 pages and about 2.5k words deep (apparently the original is about 120k words). 

  My current goals of this rewrite are:

  * Make the US government's role in this more understandable. Think Bubbles a la *Lilo and Stitch*. He was part of Lilo's life due to the death of her parents and ended up also being connected to a secret alien agency. Also, re: the attempted execution. I do genuinely like the idea, if not how it played out. So perhaps there are other HALs already in the world and one of the recipients snapped and proved rather hard to kill. 
  * Make Theresa more self-reflective. I also happen to like the idea generated at the very start that Theresa is sort of directly talking to the reader. She wants tell her side of the story. It just happens that the original story is incredibly boring because everyone loves her. How much more fun would it be if she get scapegoated as the villain of a worldwide narrative because of some sort of external need but also her own selfishness?
  * Ground some of Theresa's powers in reality. This is going to be the biggest change of all, given that she's given more and more power after her ice pillars are made and the entire "plot" goes sideways because of it. I like the concept of HAL - a fairly non sentient creature whose existence is preserved by responding (or over responding) to external stimuli in order to keep its host body alive. What I'm trying to decide is how Theresa's powers manifest that would make a proper threat or boon to the world. I kept getting Snyder's Superman vibes from the story (will she help us or will she doom us?). Theresa ends up a Superman who just wants to be left alone and is mostly hated by the world.
  * Instead of the "wind stopping" that originally occurs, I think having her address global warming would be an interesting choice that still addresses many of the problems Theresa faced canonically. This book is already steeped in politics; I don't think there's any stepping away from that. In this rewrite, her abilities are revealed to the public when she refuses to "fix" the problem of global warming (or she tries, only to realize that companies are just going to keep doing what they're doing now that she can neutralize their destructive tendencies). 
  * Queer it up. Listen. I'm a trans man dating a transmasc enby. We're both recovering Christians, me Baptist, they Catholic. Anything I get my grubby fingers on, it's going to be queer. Theresa will die, and she will come back as Theo (name pending). She'll have married Steve while still unwittingly in the closet, wanting to try and make herself feel normal, only to realize she's trans. Steve won't be able to handle Theo's need to transition into a masculine body. Their relationship will fall apart after Theo's killed by the government only to come back and be found on talking to someone like Oprah about how he's mysteriously come back to life after a long ass coma period. Theo gets HRT via HAL. 
  * Norman wanted to crow on about how Theresa was a good Catholic girl while sexualizing her as much as possible and putting a veneer of religion in place. So just as one particular *fuck you* to the author, I'm running with sexual exploration and the potential loss of religious identity. 

  I'm giving myself 30-40 days to do the full rewrite (should be possible given the whole thing will be much shortened by completely not touching the North Korea or *Star of David Israeli island* thing). Set it aside for a month, then do a second pass of editing before finding 3-4 beta readers. I'll post the story on AO3 or something, but since KrimsonRogue gave me this idea, I'd also want to send him a physical copy, just to see if it has gone from garbage fire to passable in his eyes. 

  Wish me luck.

  Down the Rabbit Hole had some seriously weird stories, like the Final Fantasy House. That one was legit scary and I donâ€™t want to admit that it might be real.

  rofl that investigation video was amazing. I don't know if I can handle an hour an forty minutes of review, but now I have to try.

  edit: and OMFG he made a part 2 which means there are 3 hours and 20 minutes of review... XD

  edit2: there are more parts. The reviews are over 6hours. Dude should be given a literature PhD for that amount of work.
