## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You have a tablet similar to what was shown in the first Night at the Museum movie with some additional more clearly defined rules.

  - Radius of effect is 100 m, forming a sphere centered on the tablet location. Tablet is only operational during the night (when the mass of the earth sufficiently blocks some inhibiting influence of the sun).  When exiting the area of effect during the evening and when the effect ends during the day, animated objects simply return to their unanimated state.

  - In the area of effect, objects are animated based on the intentional/unintentional thoughts and knowledge of their creator.  For example, a wax model of Einstein will act as the artist imagines Einstein would act and would only as intelligent and knowledgeable as the artist. Animated objects retain memory from previous animations.  Subsequent animation behavior is influenced by this memory and any decisions made. (i.e. personal growth/learning is possible).  Objects created without any sort of intent for representation, like a table, will not animate.  A motor would not animate, but a complete system like a robot might.

  - Objects that were previously alive are also influenced by their previous sense of self.  For example, an animated unmodified dead person will act like and have the memories of the person right before they died.  However, dead components that have been made part of a larger creation (say, a dinosaur skeleton display composed of real and cast fossils) will be influenced by their previous experiences and the artist/constructor to greater or lesser amounts.

  - Deceased organic tissue will return to its living state under the effect.  Any additional mass gained is taken from an unanimated mass within the area of effect. Regeneration is limited and whole missing tissue will not reappear.  No regrown limbs, organs, etc.

  - Animated objects are limited to internal force generation for their motion. No floating rocks and the like. Capability to sense light/sound/force etc. is possible if intended.  Object strength is limited to their constituent components.  Overall power and energy is not unlimited and is capped at some value each evening (collected/stored/generated by tablet over time).

  What interesting ways might you take advantage of this tablet?

    - Go to the poles or on an airplane, to get 24 hours of night instead of 12.

    - Get Steven Hawking to draw/sculpt one or more copies of himself.

    - Interview murder/assassination victims.

    - Limited utility, but it allows for secure magical message encryption.  Since it can react to epiphenomena like the artist's intent and nothing physical can, you can receive uninterceptable messages.  Bonus points if sending a file to a 3D printer counts as "being the artist" for the purposes of behavior.

    - Is there a size limit?  Can animated nanobots build *real* nanobots?

    > For example, a wax model of Einstein will act as the artist imagines Einstein would act and would only as intelligent and knowledgeable as the artist

    If the artist imagines Einstein to be more intelligent/knowledgeable them themselves, what happens?

    >Deceased organic tissue will return to its living state under the effect. Any additional mass gained is taken from an unanimated mass within the area of effect. Regeneration is limited and whole missing tissue will not reappear. No regrown limbs, organs, etc.

    This needs to be HEAVILLY elaborated on. e.g. what are the limits on sources for the mass? Also, what happens to it once the effect ends? does it decompose again?

    >Radius of effect is 100 m, forming a sphere centered on the tablet location.

    What of objects lying on the sphere boundary, half-inside half-outside?

    Ok so your first goal should be to accrue resources for the later steps in this world domination plan. Do this by adding some googly eyes to computers and imagining that they are maximally intelligent and loyal servants, who have access to their own source code, think at incredible speed, and are extremely motivated, basically just max out every attribute you can apply to them. If the access to source code thing works then they should be able to figure out how to improve themselves into a FAI pretty quickly given subjective time letting you win in hours or days.              
    Otherwise have your many googly eyed laptops/smartphones take many online jobs each getting you more money which with to buy more laptops to googly eye, basically you'll be making a sort of intelligent server farm. Having hundreds of these diligent servants working on getting you resources they should be able to make you a millionaire (at least) within a year using a massive variety of techniques from the basic online work specified earlier to exploiting their high thinking speed to do high frequency trading, using social engineering to do scams or hire people do various real world tasks, etc.            
    Then you should get bases far into the arctic and antarctic to exploit the months long nights. 

    Now earlier your servants would have been finding geniuses to hire online (through looking at social media or perhaps by creating an online IQ test that's actually valid and using it to find geniuses). The purpose of this is to come up with some excuse to get them to create something (could be a sculpture, a googly eyed computer or anything really) that they imagine to be totally loyal to their employer and possessing of all the other qualities mentioned previously. You only need to get one genius to complete this weird task then you can ship your creation to you and animate it, and if it has the attributes you asked for then it can create more of itself getting you more servants this time limited to the smartest genius your servants can find. Obviously you can create many thousands of servants like this animating whatever the smallest functional interface you can get for your purposes is.

    At this point you are probably starting to realize why I said this is a world domination scheme. Since you can have your army of world class genius servants (you should be able to find one supergenius to do your weird task or who you can bring on board with your plans, motivations not an issue since the only limiting factor on mental attributes is your own intelligence). Now simply have your super fast geniuses work on science and technology and not only can you make more money through shell companies but you should be able to solve problems like safe GAI that would take decades or more otherwise.
    ```

      ```
      Now I'm imagining googly-eyed genius computers who are also creepy stalkers who want to cut you off from all contact except themselves so that *they* become the most important part of *your* life...
      ```

      - u/vakusdrake:
        ```
        I mean the power clearly has no problem creating fully human-like intelligences so you shouldn't have to worry about AI alignment nor the computers acting in ways you didn't intend/expect since your intention/expectation was what shaped them in the first place.

    >Einstein will act as the artist imagines Einstein would act 

    To completely rip off Rick and Morty, you could use this for couples' therapy.
    ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    So, if I crate a wax model of *myself*, incorporating the tablet in the chest cavity, then I have a kind of night-only immortality? (The model only acts as I imagine I would act, and is only as intelligent/knowledgeable as myself, so...)

    Of course, we start to diverge pretty quickly, but we probably don't clash too much in terms of necessary resources....
    ```

- u/Frommerman:
  ```
  There is a glyph you can draw on a surface which, once the central circle is complete, will begin emitting red light. The red light exerts force on matter inside it, pushing those objects away from the glyph. This force is not reactionless, and the energy to do this (plus a little to account for distance) is stolen from the nearest star.

  The force emitted by the glyph scales with the size of the glyph and the accuracy with which it is drawn. A small glyph rapidly sketched out in the sand will emit less than a pound of force and probably be obliterated by the reaction force. A huge glyph professionally inlaid in a reinforced steel plate can exert tons of force. The distance that this effect travels scales with its strength, a weak glyph will only extend a few feet as it is attenuated by pushing air, a huge one can go miles. The light cannot penetrate matter which is opaque to light, and it can be reflected.

  What are good uses of this power? Assume a Victorian understanding of mechanics and that electricity has not been harnessed.
  ```

  - u/Totallysafeperson:
    ```
    Here are the uses I can see for this:

    1. For defense: imagine the great Wall of China but with massive glyphs on the side. It would be nearly impenetrable.

    2. For offense: These obviously could be used for weapons. Additionally, large mobile glyphs could be used to knock down large swathes of enemies

    3. For unlimited free energy: Since this is the victorian time period, they probably wouldn't use it for electricity. However, they could definitely create something similar to a waterwheel or a steam engine using a glyph that take itself apart and puts itself back together again.
    4. Hovercrafts/ hover-boots: A glyph that can provide constant force could be used to provide levitation and by angling them correctly, you could change your direction.  This could provide free transportation. A sufficiently big enough one could be used as a rocket. 
    5. As a bomb: put two incomplete glyphs near each other and complete them and you've got yourself something that explodes violently in two pieces. 

    With creative thinking,  the uses of such a glyph are endless. This sort of magic would change the economy and potentially jump-start the industrial revolution.
    ```

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      These are pretty much the things I came up with too. I'm imagining a civilization that lives in a dangerous jungle, except their city is on an enormous rock levitated by glyphs, far away from the dangerous fauna below.

      Oh, by the way: animals evolved to use glyphs as well. It's how humans discovered them.
      ```

  - u/ulyssessword:
    ```
    Power is renewable and cheap.  Windmills are useless, because glyphmills are smaller, cheaper, and more reliable.  Similarly, plows are fitted with glyphs instead of animals.

    Trade is much simpler, cheaper, and faster.  Almost every vehicle would become a hovercraft (glyphs sound cheaper than wheels and oxen), and global trade networks would flourish.

    Jetpacks!

    You said it can be reflected by mirrors, can it be focused by lenses?  If so, long range death-lasers are the new weapon of war.

    Rockets! (but not ones that can go out of the atmosphere?)

    ---

    In short, it would skip straight past animal power, the steam engine, internal combustion, and the electric motor for power sources, kickstart global trade with better transportation, and revolutionize war in many different ways.
    ```

  - u/Totallysafeperson:
    ```
    Another quick question;  does the glyph have to be drawn on a flat surface? If not, you could draw the glyph on a parabolic surface to concentrate the light to a point that can be used for cutting
    ```

  - u/Totallysafeperson:
    ```
    A few questions first:

    1. Can I simply print them out/ use a stamp? 

    2. What happens if I split it in two and then recombine it again?

    Without one of these two being true, the glyph is not much more useful than a strong magnetic or electric field
    ```

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    This can power cars and hoverboards/boots of flight.

    Does a mirror experience force, or is a glyph whose light is reflected at a right angle pulled sideways by the reaction force?
    ```

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      The mirror does experience the force, and can be shattered by it.
      ```

- u/GaBeRockKing:
  ```
  You've been informed by an ROB that it will be choosing an MMO. Two weeks hence, and from then on, anyone above the age of twenty one will get a character creation screen that will imbue them with the same sorts of powers/abilities/mechanics/classes/races/whatever that a character from that MMO would have. The sole exception will be that respawning after death no longer functions (although people will still be able to cast resurrection spells).

  1. Which MMO do you choose to maximize your own values?  
  2. What do you do to prepare yourself in the intervening two weeks.

  Do note that there won't suddenly be quests or monsters; xp gain will therefore be extraordinary difficult, and no magical items will be dropping (with the exception of items gained through character creation or leveling up).

  (If you're wondering, I was inspired by the excellent, albeit nonrational, SAO fanfic "fairy dance of death.")
  ```

  - u/Krashnachen:
    ```
    1. Am I choosing or is the ROB choosing?
    2. Do people younger than 21 get the character creation when they reach that age?
    3. (Ask someone to) code a very simple MMO character creation screen. With overpowered things. And add a happiness; luck; happiness buff to family, loved ones,... that is maxed out by default
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      1. You choose the MMO. I actually made a slight mistake, though-- I meant to say that you told the MMO which ROB to pick, and they'd implement the changes two weeks later. I'll edit that in now.

      2. Yes.

      3. Doesn't work for two reasons. One, even if that screen did exist, it's hardly an MMO-- there's no multiplayer gameplay whatsoever. Two, if there are no in-game mechanics to affect those stats, they don't actually do anything. Maxing out INT or WIS in an MMO doesn't actually make your avatar smarter or wiser, for example, it just makes it easier to pass some skill checks and increases their mana pool. There are a few exceptions to this (ex. Fallout) but it's not the kind of thing you see in multiplayer games.
      ```

      - u/Krashnachen:
        ```
        Well a text-based game where a 'massive' amount of players can play and interact is something that could be done in a few days if you contract a few coders. I think it is then technically an MMO.

        And having stats that have to affect the game in a certain way is really hard to translate into real life I think. I get your point but since this is munchinkry I have to point that out. I could just make one slider on make game's character creation that goes from "Horrible" to "Everything is Awesome" and have to game be really easy and 'awesome' if that is maxed.

        About INT and WIS in mmo's. Those are simulating real life intelligence or wisdom. You don't have real life skill checks. So stats would be useless I guess if they don't translate into what we perceive as intelligence, wisdom, strength, health or luck (...).

    > Which MMO do you choose to maximize your own values?

    Second Life. Infinite inventory with symlinks, you can change shape, gender, species at will. You can fly and teleport. Programmers are demigods who can create magical items at the drop of a script. Physical damage just doesn't happen unless you forget to fly in a damage-enabled zone, or get hit by a properly scripted bullet (normal impacts don't do anything, you have to fall miles)... and even there the worst that can ever happen to you is teleporting home. It's not respawning, it's just a normal teleport.

        SL scripts can't actually eat anything, and they have so many checks against self-rep now it actually causes problems for scripted vehicles that cross sim boundaries too frequently. It's been literally years since there's been a grey goo incident announced.

          Unless you expect ROB to play admin to nerf anything that might disrupt the status quo, this world won't last long. Assume that you can't just spawn antimatter or black holes or negatively charged strangelets or the up quarks of any substance without the down quarks. What happens if someone runs an infinite loop? What happens if someone runs AIXI-tl? What happens if someone copies the state of the world and runs it in a simulation (which recursively does the same), in order to probably retroactively have been ROB all along?
