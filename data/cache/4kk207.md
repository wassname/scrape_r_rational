  Is Scott finding all this kaballah stuff himself? That comparison between San Francisco and Jerusalem is crazy. Is there some kind of kabbalist wiki where you can look that stuff up? Did he put tons of research into this? Is he making some of it up?
  ```

    Some of the similarities are causal rather than coincidental; the Golden Gate Strait, which the Golden Gate Bridge is named after, got its name because John Fremont was making a reference to the Golden Gate of Constantinople, which in turn was named by Constantine, who was Christian and presumably knew about the Golden Gate of Jerusalem (especially given the symbolism).

    I'm fairly certain that Scott is just putting in a bunch of work though, and hiding all the comparisons that don't pan out, which makes it more impressive.

      Let us hope Scott never gets paranoid schizophrenia.

        At this point, I'm not sure that it'd be easy to tell. 

        I mean, for all we know, Unsong is his manifesto, and he just has enough self-awareness to market it as fiction.

  Well that was ... weird.

- u/LiteralHeadCannon:
  ```
  It seems rather odd that some of the statements used to wake up Ana (conservation of mass, the light speed barrier, natural selection) are things I'd assumed were retcons by Uriel.
  ```

  - u/Iconochasm:
    ```
    Uriel's retcons seem like exactly the sort of thing that would help break someone out of a severe attack of transcendent joy.  "No, now all that universal love junk runs through a filter that turns it into neurons."
    ```

      This is very much *not* the conflict between truth and beauty that the comments section portrays it as, though.  At least within the context of the world of Unsong, it's a conflict between awareness of a bigger-picture truth/beauty and awareness of the present, local situation - the latter of which is directly epistemologically inferior, as the former isn't *unaware* of the present, local situation, it just realizes its true irrelevance.

      The Right Hand Of God isn't ignorance, as the comments suggest; it's the opposite, awareness.  And the Left Hand Of God (Thamiel) isn't truth, either: it's a lie.

  The old man with "faces." Typo, or does being in the City of Angels change your physiology as well?

    Universal love.

  I just started reading this. I'm to ch9 so far. I think he wrong the entire story just so he had somewhere to put this amazing line:

  >“MOST OF IT RUNS ON SAPPHIRES ON PATHS, BUT I USE RUBY ON RAILS FOR THE DATABASES.”
