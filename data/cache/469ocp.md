## [META][Q][D] Should we have a Self Promotion Master post every week or so?

### Post:

I don't think this particular sub reddit is really so busy that we MUST have it, but considering the 'good reddiquette' and that we have several authors is this something we should start planning for?

I've seen it on a few of the busier subreddits.

  The main reason I come to this subreddit is that authors of stuff I like post here when they have new content, so I don't feel a need to remove these posts from the subreddit and hide them under a fold.

    I mostly posted this because I was not sure if self promotion was weighed differently over "cool thing I found that's rationalist/rational media" it's not necessarily clearly stated in the guidelines one way or another but it seems like the norm on reddit is post things you found?

    That might just be the areas I've checked around.

      Posting original content has never been frowned upon, the only thing that reddit (the company) dislikes is when people use reddit as nothing but a platform for self-promotion. There's a rule of thumb for this in the reddiquette:

      > Feel free to post links to your own content (within reason). But if that's all you ever post, or it always seems to get voted down, take a good hard look in the mirror â€” you just might be a spammer. A widely used rule of thumb is the 9:1 ratio, i.e. only 1 out of every 10 of your submissions should be your own content.

      Reddit (the userbase) doesn't tend to have as much of a problem with that, unless it rises to the level of spam, and the 9:1 rule is generally considered to be a pretty terrible one.

      As far as this subreddit goes, I'd actively encourage people to just link their stuff as a new post. If it does poorly, take that long look in the mirror.
      ```

      Reddit as a whole is a content aggregator, and I wouldn't be surprised if the really big subreddits are mostly about linking to things you've found. That being said, I don't really care about or use Reddit other than in the small communities I hang out in. 

      Here's what I care about: finding rational and rationalist fiction to read and enjoy. I don't care who the person posting the link is. I don't care whether or not it's "self-promotion" either. If alexanderwhales or eaglejarl post links to their stuff as it comes out, this makes me really happy! I want to read things. 

      If we put into place rules that make it harder to do what we want to do, and follow them because they are rules, the tail is wagging the dog. Rules exist in service of our needs and wants. They are our tools, not our chains. 

      So, feel free to post links to your stuff. If you find yourself getting downvotes a lot, then maybe rethink it, but those downvotes won't be because of self-promotion, they'll be based on the content. That's how I vote, at least.

  I'm more then happy with authors doing self-promotion in the subreddit proper, as long as the posts keep on getting upvoted to more then like 5-ish.
  ```

  - u/Cariyaga:
    ```
    It's worth noting that I, at least, tend to upvote fics regardless of their content as a low-effort means to encourage the authors. Others might do the same, which may affect that rule of thumb.
    ```

    - u/traverseda:
      ```
      I'm taking that into account. That's why it's set to ~5 and not just downvotes.

      That rule of thumb will have to change as time goes on, but I think just telling someone to tone it down should generally be enough.
      ```

- u/LiteralHeadCannon:
  ```
  Self-promotion is kind of what this subreddit is for. Non-content posts are considered off-topic and the rule of thumb is you can make one for each content post you make, IE, it's supposed to be like 50% content.
  ```

- u/dsraider:
  ```
  I'm fine with it... but I'm obviously bias :)
  ```

- u/VanPeer:
  ```
  I usually lurk in this sub under a different name, but started self-promoting under my pen name specifically to make it obvious. Also this is one of the few subs were self-promotion appears to be tolerated, even welcomed, and I will take a hint if the downvotes  indicate otherwise.
  ```

  - u/Nighzmarquls:
    ```
    I find the votes on my stuff a little odd, it seems like most of my updates have been in around the 10s-15s range... but some times it's just 'not a good day' or maybe the crowd is different or possibly I presented the update in the wrong light?

    But with posts ranging from the first post here about my comic to the last one some times people just vote it down with no comment. It's a bit less then helpful because also sometimes they just vote it up with no comment too. It feels very arbitrary and makes it hard to gauge which factors are 'good' or 'bad'.
