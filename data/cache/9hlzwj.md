- u/Ardvarkeating101:
  ```
  She has finally found her soul-mate in negotiation
  ```

- u/cyberdsaiyan:
  ```
  Holy shit... HOLY SHIT!

  All this time... equal enmity to *all* surface dwellers, whether good or evil... most prominent Empire on the continent... insanely proud... never involved in surface affairs... never aligned to any story... 

  The dwarves were the True Neutrals all along!

  And *of course* they'd be annoyed that their world was run by insane gods and would want to fix it...
  ```

  - u/Gr_Cheese:
    ```
    I thought they were referring to the Dead King? We don't have any named gods to pick fights with, only choirs of Angels, which don't seem relevant to barricading the Dead King.
    ```

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      >Angels useless in fighting the King of the Dead.

      Only in the Guideverse.
      ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  Ah, the old "pretend not to speak your foreign language so I can get an edge in negotiations" gambit.
  ```

  - u/Nimelennar:
    ```
    It's a cliché, but it was also the setup for a hilarious double entendre, so I'll forgive it.
    ```

    - u/notjustlurking:
      ```
      I missed the double entendre, can you explain?
      ```

      - u/Nimelennar:
        ```
        The Herald of the Deep starts speaking Lower Miezan, Cat's native language, and then a few lines later:

        >The Herald smiled, slow and mean.
        >
        >“I offer hospitality to you, Queen of Callow,” he said. “Let us eat, drink, and talk of murdering gods.”
        >
        >Well, *now* they were speaking my language.

        Maybe "double entendre" is the wrong term, as neither intended meaning is indecent, but I can't think of something better to mean "a phrase intended to have two different but equally valid meanings."
        ```

        - u/fortycakes:
          ```
          How about "pun"?
          ```

          - u/Nimelennar:
            ```
            That takes me back.

            I was in Grade 9 English, and my teacher, knowing my taste for bad jokes, invited me to help out, as we were going to be taking about wordplay.

            There were twenty of us, so the teacher took half, and I took the other half.  I asked each of the other students to write down a joke ending in a pun, and put it in a hat.

            After everyone had finished, I told everyone the definition of a pun: as opposed to other kinds of wordplay, a pun almost always involves a single word with multiple definitions, or two words or phrases that sound similar.

            I took each slip of paper out of the Harry and read it aloud, to see if any of them met that definition, and, wouldn't you know it, no pun in ten did.
            ```

        - u/xland44:
          ```
          how about just... "double meaning"? :p
          ```

- u/IgnatiusFlamel:
  ```
  I like those dwarfs.

  There we have the proof that Cat is indeed a most skilled diplomat.
  ```

- u/notagiantdolphin:
  ```
  I wonder if the staff contains a demon/devil? Wouldn't that be a kick for Praes - an entire nation of demonologists?

  Or worse, a fae, or something else otherworldly. Cat is having too easy a time of it, walking head first into an army whose people make a study of binding things like her for fun would be about par for the course.
  ```

  - u/notsureiflying:
    ```
    Maybe a lesser a God....
    ```

- u/JanusTheDoorman:
  ```
  Kinda funny, kinda terrifying seeing Archer so on her toes dealing with the dwarves. If Cat manages to swing an alliance or other arrangement that lets her make use of some of their military (the deed-seekers, perhaps?), I imagine it'll give everyone except the Dead King reason to pause and reassess.

  I dunno how Akua managed to do it, but I can't imagine it's a coincidence that she's found herself speaking on behalf of Cat in what's probably a make-or-break negotiation for Callow. I hope this doesn't end with Cat and Vivi breaking ties when Cat refuses to kill Akua sometime soon-ish.

  Cat's humanity continues to ebb, but it's nice that she's naturally referring to herself as the Queen of Callow without qualification or compromise.
  ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  >“Even a lizard can eat a tadpole,” he said.  
  >  
  >My brow rose.  
  >  
  >“Guess you had to be there,” I said.  
  >  
  >Which I had been. I did not smile.

  I don't get it.
  ```

  - u/Anderkent:
    ```
    "Guess you had to be there" is a common phrase for when something doesn't seem funny to you, whereas it's funny for the person speaking. It suggests situational humour for which you (the person not finding it funny) don't have the necessary context, because they weren't there.

    That is subverted by Cat actually 'having been there' (in this case, the dwarfs weren't actually there), and still not finding it funny.
    ```

    - u/SkoomaDentist:
      ```
      > 'having been there'

      But where's "there"?
      ```

      - u/Anderkent:
        ```
        'there' being where the lizard was eating a tadpole, i.e. where Cat was subduing drow.

        Basically the dwarves were being racist af, and Cat made it awkward
        ```

- u/TaltosDreamer:
  ```
  Ooooh, I love it!!

  I was mostly expecting this to go very poorly, but it figures the Dwarves would respect strength.
  ```

- u/eaglejarl:
  ```
  What are the chances that she can hire some dwarves as mercenaries? Because that would solve her problems quite neatly.
  ```

  - u/Megika:
    ```
    Well, she’s broke. Maybe she can convince them that she could pay in future, but that doesn’t really seem like something dwarves would go for.
    ```

    - u/ketura:
      ```
      Just gotta set it up so the mercenaries are payment for services *she* renders...presumably slaying the sve of night.
      ```

      - u/Law_Student:
        ```
        Or she gets rid of the drow for them by giving the drow a new homeland out of the dwarves' way (Southern Callow was pretty depopulated anyway.) thereby gaining help from both the Drow (as her new subjects) and the Dwarves. Everyone wins! Especially Cat. She wins twice.
        ```

        - u/Nimelennar:
          ```
          >Everyone wins! 

          Well, except Cat's enemies.  I don't think they'd be particularly happy about this development.

          Eh...  Cordelia might.  It'd give her an excuse to not fight Cat while still retaining power over Procer and the Crusade.
          ```

- u/MaddoScientisto:
  ```
  Who was the demigod she killed?
  ```

  - u/LordSwedish:
    ```
    The winter duke she killed to gain cosmic powers.
    ```
