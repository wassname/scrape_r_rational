## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  I'm looking for commentary on two types of (hopefully) *sufficiently alien* aliens - mostly tell me if you think they could plausibly evolve their stated characteristics.

  The first I call metallants for lack of a better name. They're highly social, motile critters that talk and coordinate with weak radio pulses (each strain has its own wavelength). They live in very high temperature and high pressure (comparable to Venus), solid or fluid (I have not decided yet), environments, they have limited endothermy by oxydizing liquid metals on one hand, and controlling their radiative emission on the other. They do cooperative stigmergic ecoresolution of problems by tagging resources and locations with small bladelets of metal (just like those antitheft tags commonly used in retail) that convey some number of bits of information when pulsed with the right radiowave. They dig and mine, mostly. They reproduce by collaboratively nano-assembling together extra-parts they grow and shed over time for that specific purpose.

  The second is a space tentacle / starfish, which grows in microgravity by eating off chondrites found in asteroid belts, in space vacuum. It's basically a near-sentient elongated blob of gel and low-pressure gas bubbles, reinforced with tendrils of carbon fibers or buckytubes (and maybe graphene membrane forming tanks or shells ?) that also serve as solar panels and possibly heat and current accumulators. It dissolves useful substances from whatever it is attached to, then either tethers directly to something else nearby (it can elongate for tens or hundreds of kilometers), or barring a suitable target it spins its rock up before launching itself - absorbing the angular momentum to convert it into centrifugal acceleration, much like a yo-yo de-spin system. It can reproduce by splitting in the middle, typically if lost in space too long, in order to launch both halves away from each other and onto new orbits. It lithobrakes on arrival thanks to its high viscosity and extreme (composite) tensile resistance.

    >chondrites found in asteroid belts

    I have no idea how realistic evolving either of these two creatures are, but I sincerely doubt that any life more complex than bacteria can ever be found in the asteroid belt. The reason why is because of how spread out the asteroids are. Those scenes in movies where spaceships have to frantically dodge balls of rock are complete fabrications. The average distance between the rocks is **600,000 miles!** To put it in perspective, the diameter of Earth? That's slightly below 8,000 miles. I don't care what the starfish aliens are eating on the asteroids, they should be starving to death before they ever reach their second asteroid.

    How do they spin up rocks without some form of thrust mechanism, and if they have said mechanism, why would they not use that directly instead of spinning up tons of rock? You can't just create angular momentum out of nowhere.

    I agree with the other poster that having the second alien live in the rings of a gas giant makes a lot more sense, because everything is very close together, and there's lots of ice that could be used. Although depending on the distance from the sun, having enough energy to support a complex mind would be an issue. Human brains use up a **lot** of calories, so you would need some way of using less.

    Are these aliens artificially created or naturally evolved? The first type might be plausibly natural, maybe, but I don't think the second could be. Life as we know it needs liquids to support chemical reactions, and liquids aren't stable in extremely low pressures like unconfined microgravity. They would have to start out on a world with enough gravity to support an atmosphere and some liquids, and then escape the gravity well and survive in a radically different environment. I don't think it's plausible, because the vast majority of Earth life simply dies in a vacuum, and only a few species can survive through going into hibernation, mostly microorganisms. The radiation outside of an atmosphere just makes it harder.

    I find the metallant reproductive system unlikely. If they can grow the parts then I expect reproduction by budding would be more plausible. Assembling a new life from out of parts of several parents would be an added layer of complexity and it's evolutionary advantage isn't particularly clear. Essentially every individual wold be the equivalent of a genetic chimera with several distinct lineages, which would make having an immune system very difficult, and would not provide the trait mixing benefits of sexual reproduction. Also I don't know how plausable the chemistry needed for them to exist actually is. They don't seem like they'd be able to be made of carbon and non-carbon based biochemistry is as far as I know purely speculative (it theoretically should work but would be different enough that a complex system like biology would be affected in any number of unpredictable ways) not something that's ever been confirmed possible by experiment or observation.

    Short version, I think the metalants should reproduce by budding (unless you have a narrative need for them to do the assembly thing) but are otherwise fine if a bit likely to someday get caught out by science marches on.

    On Asteroid-dwelling tentacle monsters. I think they would need an environment unlike any that exists in our solar system. They'd need the rock density of something like Sarurn's rings but to not be constantly bombarded by radiation like the rings of Sarurn are. They'd also need lots of organic molecules that exist in out solar system but aren't concentrated in asteroids.

    If it were me I'd put them in a recently formed star system in one of those "aclhohol nebulae", where the proto-planetary bodies haven't all clumped up into planets yet and the gas clouds everything is made from are richer in organic molecules making them more common.

    So creature A marks this thing as "mine!" Creature B observes this mark and...

    (a) Honours it or

    (b) cheats, removing the marker and taking the stuff for itself?

    In any evolutionary system, you'll eventually (and probably fairly quickly) find a creature B that takes option (b), at least some of the time. The ecosystem either needs to have some way to punish such behaviour for creature B, or creature B will bemore successful (because it has more resources) and quickly outbreed creature A; in a few generations, then, all the creatures will steal at least some of the time.

      That's not quite what I meant, markings are for locating resources, coordinate activity, indicate what is going on or maybe skew preferences of the ants coming nearby. It is not so much meant to tag "this is mine" as I would expect the concept to be meaningless here, but more as "this spot is dangerously cold", "this waypoint connects to route A", "this is good grade of ore", "place elements for assembly X here" and so on. Different strains having different frequencies so they would ignore other strains' tags and impeded each other's efforts whenever they run into each other (providing incentives to develop more active countermeasures).

      Within eusocial insect colonies there are slackers, but AFAIK there are no saboteurs. Same-strain metallants would be addressing several tasks in parallel, and divide resources among them by the weight the various stigmergic markers across would have on the population. I'd expect that they would disregard a marking only to replace it with a stronger one.

        Ohhhhhhh, they're *warning* signs, not anti-theft tags!

        Apologies. Misunderstood that. In that case, I put it to you that there's a distinct evolutionary advantage in *not* ignoring another colony's tags - after all, what is dangerously cold to colony A is also dangerously cold to colony B, and if A is going to be nice enough to spend energy signposting that then B can gain a relative advantage by reading A's signs (and maybe even swipe the nice ore that A marked as a good grade). On the flip side, that in turn gives A a means to affect the movements of B - if A marks a 'good grade' of ore, then B steals it, then perhaps A can swipe the mined-and-refined ore from B's storage rooms (by marking B's storage room as 'dangerously cold' to keep B's defenders away).

        Either way round, though, there's a clear and certain competitive advantage to be had in the ability to read another strain's tags; so I would expect that capability to quickly emerge in these species.

          Right - but at some point on that path the distinction between each strain fades. The ants are not meant to have much in the way of individual goals and utility or self-awareness. Once they take into account the content of a tag it becomes just as much part of "their" tags, and they start cooperating with the strain that laid the tag as if they were the same.

          But in this case, your second scenario (deception) becomes adversely beneficial. It could be blocked by having a consistency check / digital cryptographic signature, per strain, in the tags ; or full encryption, to block your first scenario (parasitism). But that would take quite the evolutionary leap to fit a whole strain through against many rivals.

          Alternatively, what if there is only one strain to begin with ?

          You can probably guess what I'm trying to get at: a not-quite-sentient species for whom the concept of rivalry is alien. That implies there would be rewards for strategies that are win-win across a given strain or the entire species, but none (or penalties) for win-lose strategies. I'm not sure that is even possible. Maybe if they have to maintain the environment's ambient temperature in a narrow range, or some other condition that would act as required commons ?

          At a higher level there has to be a way for whichever specific ants among the strain that are fitter to succeed better than the less-fit, in order for the species to have plausibly evolved up to that point. That means developing new strains and some form of measure of utility for each. And that is also a form of rivalry (competing for fitness, and ultimately for existence), already. So, a non-starter...

          Oh well, they will be more interesting and dynamic, with the added complexity of adverse strategies and balancing of competition/cooperation, and strain-wars.

            Not necessarily. Let us say that there is a strain A and a strain B; and that, for whatever reason, strain B is *slightly* better at handling cold temperatures that strain A. So, places that strain A has marked as dangerously cold, strain B can often mine from quite happily. Thus, if strain B figures out strain A's mark for 'dangerously cold', they can use that sign on their own mining operations, to prevent strain A from taking their ore. (If A encrypts their markers, then B can steal genuine A cold-markers and move then to B's mining operations).

            And it doesn't take that much of an evolutionary leap to do either. Evolutionary systems *cheat*, it's practically one of their defining features; they're not playing to your rules, they're playing to the world, and they *will* exploit inconsistencies in any ruleset suggested.

            > You can probably guess what I'm trying to get at: a not-quite-sentient species for whom the concept of rivalry is alien.

            A system that evolves traditionally is not what you want here, then; evolution has rivalry for scarce resources at its very *heart*. Now, if you want a species that cannot understand rivalry, that is I think possible with a slight tweak; you need exactly *one* Mother creature. Only *one* source of new creatures, new eggs, new generations. And all the rest maintain and take care of this *single* point of failure for their entire species; and are selected based on their ability to help their siblings take care of the Mother creature. Once you have that, then suddenly the only competing that they do is to compete to be the best team players, and be better noticed by the Mother/Queen...

            But the difficulty then is that you do have a species with a truly single point of failure.

      Well, in real life, a cat for example will mark with urine its territory. If another cat sniffs it, they can decide to respect it or ignore it. If it's the latter, they know if spotted they're going to have to sustain a scuffle though.
      ```

      - u/CCC_037:

        Exactly, yeah. The ecosystem punishes the cat who tries to ignore the claim by having the cat who placed the claim use his claws in defense of said claim; and while sometimes an invading cat can chase off the incumbent cat, that is still generally a good discouragement for visiting cats.
