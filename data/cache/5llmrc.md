## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  Thing that's bugged me lately - people using the word "evidence" to mean "thing that is pretty much impossible unless the hypothesis is true" rather than "thing that is more likely if the hypothesis is true than if it is false".  To uphold the "innocent until proven guilty" standard, our courts of law need to demand the former, but to function epistemologically as humans, we have to settle for the latter.

    I think that this can be explained mostly by people having very poor Bayesian priors.  My mental model of humans is that they use Bayesian reasoning, with roundoff errors.  In general, this works fairly well.  It fails when somebody has a prior probability that is very close to either 0 or 1.

    When the belief is close to 0 or 1, evidence can be observed, yet be insufficient to change the Bayesian prior, due to the roundoff errors.  For example, consider a belief A, with a prior of 10%, stored in 10% increments.  An event B occurs, which is weak evidence for belief, bringing the posterior probability up to 15%.  However, since the probability is stored in units of 10%, this rounds back to 10%, having no change.

    In general, the lower the prior probability, the stronger the evidence must be in order to cause any change at all to occur.  In order to have a change of `post - prior > epsilon/2`, where `prior` and `post` are the prior and posterior probabilities, and `epsilon` is the size of the unit being used, then the strength of the evidence in order to cause any change in belief is as follows.

        P(A|B) / P(A) > 1 + epsilon/(2*prior)

    So, when somebody says that they want to see "evidence", they are stating that they want to see evidence that is strong enough to change their belief.  If somebody has an unusually extreme prior, then the amount of evidence needed becomes increasingly high.

    I'll fully admit that I do this, too.  For example, my prior for "Homeopathic medicine works better than placebo." is low enough that hearing the anecdotal evidence of friends and family has no effect.

    This is also why summaries can be useful, even if a person has heard each constituent piece of information before.  A series of 10 events can each be discounted, one at a time.  Taken together, however, there is enough of a change to overcome the roundoff error, and cause a change in belief.

      This is very well thought out.  As usual most models break down near the extreme cases.  I think the biggest change I would make here is that the rounding increment isn't constant but probably has some tapering near the edges.  Otherwise there would be a smallest nonzero belief.  Which, maybe there is because people can't truly comprehend massively larger or massively small things.  But people can distinguish between 1% and 0.1% better than they can distinguish between 51% and 50.1%

      Also, the thing about summaries is interesting.  Since you have a finite amount of processing power then perhaps it is in fact rational to file away weak evidence and not worry about attempting to finely tune your probabilities until you accumulate enough of it to actually make a significant difference.

  I have done nothing this past week on /u/ketura's !Pokemon project besides lurk in the discussion on various biomes. If you wanna check it out, come join our /r/rational Discord!

  School starts again. 14 credits. Chemistry, an English class masquerading as a software engineering class, Linear Algebra course, and Calculus.

  My third run of Calculus since beginning Uni, taking a 3-year break, then starting again. Sometimes I hate my chosen profession's (Computer Science) degree path.

  Also, I'm packing up my stuff, and over break I have thrown away approximately 10% of the mass from my apartment, and I'm also storing about 30% of apartment-mass at my parents. The heaviest things I own is a pair of adjustable weights that go up to 50 lbs each. I'm a weakling, so about 40 of those lbs will be left at home unless I start gaining serious muscle in my arms.

  What does all this translate to? It means a couple of things. First, most of my **permanent** university mass now fits into the trunk of my car without complaint. I have a few things which won't - my nice office chair, and some of the bulk food I got at Costco.  The goal was to have enough room to ferry someone to/from my hometown to my college town comfortably. In this process I have eliminated 3 medium boxes, a medium tote box, and 2 large shoeboxes. (each one could fit a pair of winter boots).

  I estimate that the reduction in mass will reduce the number of runs I have to make to my car when I move into a new room at my complex by about 50%. I should be done unloading my car in 30 minutes from the time I get my room keys to a completely unpacked room. 

  That said, now that I have all this free space, I was tempted to take even more crap up with me, but decided against it. There's one thing I left home last semester, (my drawing tablet), which I plan on taking up to college with me.

  I received a N3DS for Christmas, and decided to modify the system with some custom firmware. Until recently, there was no way to hack the N3DS XL with cfw unless you hardmodded or had access to long-removed games from the DSi store. Luckily, there have been new hacks released (soundhax) which allows homebrew software to run, and shortly will be a new slowhax (custom firmware entrypoint) for the N3ds XL of the 11.0-11.2 firmware versions. I look forward to it.

  Side note: Sun/Moon is really good.

  On the note of Pokemon, my rational!Pokemon story is coming along, slowly. I have defined the length I want to aim for per chapter, and the number of chapters I want the story to encompass. Each chapter should be about 10 pages minimum using default 11 pt, single-spaced font Docs uses, and there should be about 8-15 chapters total. The 15 is if I choose some extended motivations of some of the main cast and an epilog. Eight chapters is if I keep the same character's motivations where they are right about now. The full story length will almost certainly fluctuate as I write it.

  The largest problem has to be nailing down the scope. /u/DaystarEld and /u/alexanderwales have both discussed at various points on their writing podcast the importance of having a fleshed out world - While I'm planning this out, the idea is that the world feels like it began long, long before the story did, and that the world will continue long after as well, which is why there's a range of 7 chapters right now.

  I'm about a month out before the first chapter is drafted, and probably two months from the time it gets released. If you are interested in being an alpha/beta reader, let me know and I'll add you to a list of people to ping when the time comes.

  I was hoping for a bit of help interpreting a moral argument in an article I read recently. Its an argument for why eating meat is in fact moral and acceptable. The two arguments I'm not sure about are the compassion argument (especially the part about what defines suffering and how animals are incapable of this) and his environmental argument. He cites environmental studies, but unfortunately I lack the skill to examine those studies with a critical enough eye to determine their veracity. Thanks in advance! Also its a pretty short article.
