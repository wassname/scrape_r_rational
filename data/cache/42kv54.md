  ```
  For lurkers: if you're not reading this already I can't recommend it enough. After checking out some other popular SU fics there's such a huge gap of quality between them and this it's ridiculous.

    ```
    What is this story and why should I know about it?

      >After Reformed, Steven asks why the Crystal Gems live apart from the rest of humanity. When the answer turns out to be unsatisfactory, Connie and he take it upon themselves to use magic to improve the world. To do this they will have to to answer a lot of tough questions and use the Gems' magic as never before.

      >During their misadventures Steven will threaten to leave the Crystal Gems, Connie will team up with herself, Garnet will split up, Amethyst will act as a voice of reason, and Pearl will come to find humans interesting; all while dealing with the looming threat of alien invasion, the perils of social obligations, and the infinite complexities of the modern world.

      >TWiYOTUiYN is a (mostly) canon-compliant story that follows the events of the show while adding in lots of interstitial details and adventures. It is meant to explore the setting of Steven Universe in a rational manner without shying away from realism or consequence.

      I like the author's versions of the characters more than the ones in the actual show, and it does a great job merging a rational plot with a cartoony setting. I'd recommend watching Steven Universe first, though, at least enough to get the basic concepts.
