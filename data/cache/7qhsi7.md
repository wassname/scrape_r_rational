  Not quite the standard “If god is wrong we still have to be right” but pretty close. The crescendo approaches. Let’s see how long Diabolist can keep up.

    You're more right than you know - amusingly enough, "Crescendo" is the title of the next chapter.

    I still don't expect this to end well at all for our protagonists. My current working theory is that they will win this battle after a difficult struggle, only to discover that Diabolist is already gone. She turns the weapon she creates not on Callow, but on Malicia herself. Thus plunging the empire into chaos on the eve of a Procer crusade.

  Whelp, for the longest time I was a Cat/Archer shipper, but this has converted me.  Cakram forever!

    Only if she can find a way to grow some proper teeth.

    ```
    No, that really isn't their relationship. They're comrades, joined by self and story, close enough that the fragile ties of romance need not bind them closer.

    ...maybe a little bit of cuddling.
    ```

    - u/CeruleanTresses:
      ```
      Exactly. It can be an intimate and meaningful relationship without being a romantic one.
      ```

  - u/Ibbot:
    ```
    I don't know about that.  I see Hakram as like Captain in a lot of ways, and if Cat is like Black...
    ```

  Just a reminder that we now also have our own subreddit as well for those who are interested

  These Hakram death flags are stressing me out. God damn it, Cat, you know how stories work. Don't you know better than to internally monologue about how he's the person you love most and losing him would hurt you more than anything?
  ```

- u/haiku_fornification:
  ```
  Fuck, that opening scene... that's the sort of stuff that makes this a great story rather than just a good one. Cat literally putting on a mantle of the queen. It seems like pulling out the sword from the stone is finally catching up to her. 

  I can't help but think everything is going too smoothly for the protagonists. On paper, it seems like they can't possibly lose, especially if you include Black and Warlock but I think Diabolist is playing a completely different game to what everyone expects. I predict that this will either be a defeat or a very costly victory for Cat.
  ```

  - u/ricree:
    ```
    I gave my main prediction elsewhere in this thread, but here's another alternate that comes to mind:

    At a crucial point in the battle, Diabolist will take control of Cat and force her to kill Black.

    In a contest between Names, much depends on the weight of narrative and convention. When the story is set correctly, events have a way of bending to get the "correct" result. It is far from absolute, Black has spent much of his career carefully defying and manipulating this effect, but it does skew the odds heavily. And right now, narrative convention says that Squire should betray the Black Knight and usurp his place. 

    This isn't new, it has been commented on by a number of characters, Black included. We feel somewhat safe because we know Cat, and can see that she has zero desire to betray her mentor.

    Diabolist, on the other hand, has no such compunction. We have seen her control even true fae princess before, and here Cat is with an explicit vulnerability to soul manipulation. There is a very real chance that this serves as forshadowing for this forced "betrayal".
    ```

    - u/haiku_fornification:
      ```
      You're right in that Akua definitely plans to control Cat (why else gauge her power as a fae?) however it feels more like her opening hand rather than something that she expects to work. Basically everyone knows it's Cat's big weakness so I would expect a ton of contingencies on her part and a lot of other schemes on the part of Diabolist. 

      This is a wild prediction but I think Black is planning to die in this battle. He's made a heroic speech, his successor is ready to pick up where he left off and dying here would make him a martyr for the cause. Perhaps most importantly though, if he died fighting Akua the Calamities wouldn't focus on Cat but rather on her nemesis -
       or maybe even on Wasteland nobility at large.
      ```

      - u/CeruleanTresses:
        ```
        I wouldn't call that a wild prediction. I think it's well supported by the scenes leading up to this, especially the fact that Black knows (or at least believes) that he's going to die very soon anyway.
        ```

- u/TheEngineer923:
  ```
  So Cat being Queened and Abua saying "Too bad this ends with you kneeling." 

  Interesting.
  ```

  - u/um_m:
    ```
    HOW DARE YOU!! Calling our Lady Ubua, Abua.
    ```

    - u/TheEngineer923:
      ```
      Ubua. Abua. Jabooyah. A walking corpse by any other name.
      ```

- u/TheEngineer923:
  ```
  Calling it now, Black does not survive this fight and neither does Abua's father. Who kills who's first? That, is the million dollar question...
  ```

  - u/CeruleanTresses:
    ```
    Black is definitely laden with death flags, but I don't think Hakram's out of the woods after that opening sequence.
    ```

    - u/ricree:
      ```
      With the Woe having been so freshly named, I would be somewhat shocked if one of them died anytime soon.

      Granted, that might be reason enough to go ahead and do it, but I don't think it's very likely by the end of this book.
      ```

    - u/TheEngineer923:
      ```
      Well, Erratic said somewhere in the comments he doesn't really go in for that G.R.R shit where everybody you love dies for the drama. So we can probably rest easy that Hakram will live.  

      Probably. 

      Though if I find it hard to imagine that Akua doesn't see how central Hakram is to the 15th operations. Her spies would have undoubtedly found that information out and ferreted it back to her. I don't think he'll die, but I do think he's going to get Nauked.
      ```

      - u/GeeJo:
        ```
        I don't think Names *get* Nauked.  

        Incapacitation means a Story trails off (unless they move on to a 'mentor' role). Death or Glory are the only options for a Villain.   
        Look at Tyrant - in-universe, he's got some kind of wasting disorder that would mean a slow and undignified death. But do you think that's how he's *really* going to go out?
        ```

        - u/TheEngineer923:
          ```
          I mean Nauked in the sense that the character is going to get fucked up, possibly to the point of death but being laid out for a couple of chapters (or months in Universe) also qualifies as getting Nauked. So the Tyrant WILL get Nauked too.
          ```

      - u/CeruleanTresses:
        ```
        "You" meaning the audience or the characters? Because killing the person the *protagonist* loves most isn't really a G.R.R. thing so much as a fiction-in-general thing.
        ```
