  D&D magic in all of its brokenness is taken to its logical extremes. If you like harry potter and the natural 20 you'll probably like this. One of the main factions exploits those rules to end transhumanist.

    I'm enjoying it quite a bit.  The narrator/protagonist is maybe a bit overly snarky, but some people are actually just that way sometimes!

      Thanks to both of you!  I'm glad you like it.  Yep, Jake is snarky.  Also, in the last chapter or two he's turned into a bit of a schmuck.  Stay tuned.
