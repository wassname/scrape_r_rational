  ```
  So. Anybody have any idea how to go about beating Gaara? He seems to be a polite, well-spoken avatar of death.
  ```

  - u/Nevereatcars:
    ```
    Sand is heavy when it gets wet.
    ```

    - u/Kishoto:
      ```
      Have fun getting enough water in there to stop him. You see how fast he got those collars on them? You'd need Suigetsu to deal with him.
      ```

    - u/noahpocalypse:
      ```
      It looks like either his sand can move absurdly fast (given how Sasuke immediately did the Kai when the barrier was dropped/lifted/whatever) or he can condense particle in the air or something.

      Perhaps he could be lured into an area that has a layer of dirt over a bunch of explosive tags.
      ```

      - u/Nevereatcars:
        ```
        I assumed Gaara was using his sand-o-kinesis THROUGH the barrier. Move sand near their throats > barrier drops > sand traps throats immediately.
        ```

  - u/MadScientist95387:
    ```
    Orbital Kinetic Strike?
    ```

- u/clawclawbite:
  ```
  White blood cells are immune system. To fight toxins better, you need to supersize the kidneys.
  ```

  - u/Velorien:
    ```
    Hmm. Probably too late to fix that, since he's using the partial form of the technique.
    ```

    - u/clawclawbite:
      ```
      Given its a clan of super-eaters, their first partial technique is likely to supersize the stomach, kidneys, and liver. Being able to better survive eating bad food is important to them. A bonus is being able to outdrink any other ninja too.
      ```

      - u/Velorien:
        ```
        Nice one. But presumably they'd need to supersize their entire torso to make room for the organs, which would look extremely weird (and make you a bigger target in combat).
        ```

        - u/clawclawbite:
          ```
          Well, if you just do it a bit, you may just get a big belly and look a bit fat.
          ```

          - u/kaukamieli:
            ```
            They just have that permanently!
            ```

  - u/KnickersInAKnit:
    ```
    The liver, too!
    ```

- u/Nevereatcars:
  ```
  So tell us more about this RatNaru quest
  ```

  - u/diraniola:
    ```
    Naruto isn't a rat, he's a fox.
    ```

    - u/Subrosian_Smithy:
      ```
      No, he's a human being! Don't you know the difference between a kunai and a sealing scroll!?
      ```

      - u/Nevereatcars:
        ```
        \*closes fic, assumes it can't be good*
        ```

        - u/Subrosian_Smithy:
          ```
          But my Namikaze clan compound!

          My civilian council, and my drunken civilian horde!

          My super!Naruto, my harems!
          ```

          - u/Nevereatcars:
            ```
            I actually enjoy those fics in low doses, as long as they're grammatically correct.
            ```

            - u/gabbalis:
              ```
              Grammar is four the week.
              ```

              - u/Velorien:
                ```
                Actually, that sentence is perfectly grammatically correct (if you know what is being said).
                ```

            - u/PeridexisErrant:
              ```
              (serious)  Which ones fit that description?
              ```

              - u/Nevereatcars:
                ```
                [Here's one, probably.](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5669723/1/Naruto-One-Man-Team) I read it like 18 months ago.

                Yeah, wow, this is literally every single check mark mark/checked off.
                ```

          - u/Transfuturist:
            ```
            *a thousand twitches bloom*
            ```

  - u/Velorien:
    ```
    The premise is that the player character is a Genin in a group of ninja who have been forced to become missing-nin due to unfortunate circumstances. Their village of origin is after them because they're missing-nin, and everyone else either considers them a threat to be eliminated, a resource to be dominated and exploited, or a tasty source of foreign village secrets to be extracted through capture, interrogation and probably torture. The players must find a way to survive in the rational!Narutoverse, and ultimately elevate their faction to a position of power.
    ```

    - u/Nevereatcars:
      ```
      Step 1 be Orochimaru
      ```

      - u/Velorien:
        ```
        I recite this every day as my morning affirmation.
        ```

- u/Aretii:
  ```
  Huh. Still no official word on whether Hinata or Neji advanced, unless I missed it.
  ```

- u/FuguofAnotherWorld:
  ```
  You guys want a 4th pair of hands with that rational quest? It sounds like fun.
  ```

  - u/Velorien:
    ```
    What are you interested in? Writing? Worldbuilding? Game mechanics?
    ```

    - u/FuguofAnotherWorld:
      ```
      Background stuff, worldbuilding, maybe thinking up plots for the villains. Stuff where I can help out but it won't ruin everything if I lose motivation.
      ```

      - u/Velorien:
        ```
        AugSphere and I have no problem with it. I'd like to get /u/eaglejarl's approval too, but he's been out of touch for a few days.

        If he doesn't turn up by tomorrow (or if he turns up and approves), I'll PM you a link to the GM chat, and we can go from there.
        ```

- u/xamueljones:
  ```
  So where will the rational!Naruto quest be held? Here or on some site like SpaceBattles?
  ```

  - u/Velorien:
    ```
    At the moment we're thinking Anonkun, but it's not set in stone.

    Edit: Someone downvoted this statement? If you don't think Anonkun is a good site for the quest, why not give a reason? It's not too late to choose somewhere else.
    ```

- u/abcd_z:
  ```
  Huh.  In canon, Kabuto was just a genin that repeatedly failed the test.

  Was he being honest with Naruto, or was Anko some sort of clone/illusion?
  ```

  - u/Velorien:
    ```
    > In canon, Kabuto was just a genin that repeatedly failed the test.

    He had Jōnin-level ability, though. He was also implicitly a high-ranking Root member (Danzō sent him on very advanced infiltration missions). So if smart!Kabuto chose to become a Leaf Jōnin, there'd be nothing standing in his way.
    ```

  - u/Transfuturist:
    ```
    > In canon, Kabuto was just a genin that repeatedly failed the test.

    Um... In canon, Kabuto was Root.
    ```

    - u/abcd_z:
      ```
      Ah, so he was.  Not sure how I forgot that.
      ```

- u/Velorien:
  ```
  The time has come. The rational Naruto quest is live.

  Edit: Nope, suspended animation. Turns out Anonkun wasn't the best fit for what we had in mind. We're migrating elsewhere now.

  Edit 2: Now reborn at https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/
  ```

- u/elevul:
  ```
  Caught up.

  I don't like it. The story feels empty, the characters feel empty and each chapter feels like a story in and by itself, with no real flow between them.

  Some changes in characterization like Gaara are very interesting, but they are lost in a sea of marionettes.
  ```

  - u/Velorien:
    ```
    I'm surprised you worked your way through over 130,000 words if you really feel that way.

    "The story feels empty" and "the characters feel empty" is too vague to be constructive criticism, though. Do you have any specific suggestions for improvement?
    ```

  - u/Subrosian_Smithy:
    ```
    I think part of that is just the nature of the Chuunin exams (or any tournament arc, really).
    ```
