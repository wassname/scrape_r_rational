  I guess omniscience is a decent power.  It's no bug control, but it'll do.

  How's the second book doing? I felt like it fell apart at the end of book 1, but I'm open to encouragement.

    It's interesting, but not as good as the first arc yet.  The second arc has seen Nick have a lot less freedom of action than he was permitted in the first arc.  As such it's been a bit of a downer since that character is best to read when he is being proactive and making plans.

      It definitely has given me the sense that Nic has control of his life and has been cast adrift in an environment he knows much less about.

      Its certainly been a move away from the academic environment, in a way he's no longer doing what brought him to the dance.
