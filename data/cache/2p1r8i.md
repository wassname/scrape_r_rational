## Challenge: things it would be impossible to write rational fanfics of, and evidence against each other's suggestions

### Post:

I'll start: anything by Mother Goose. Dead On Arrival (a classic Noir film whose protagonist is already surprisingly good at this).

  The Hitchhiker's Guide universe. Virtually everything happens "because the plot requires it" in there. There are rules, but they are definitely not sane. And you aren't statistically likely to be a hitchhiker, either -- unless the plot requires it.

    This universe is not even particularly causal. There are events that have been changed to have never happened that still have an effect on reality (e.g. postcards of a cathedral that was never built due to time travel). If you examine the mechanics of Milliway's, there's decent evidence that you can run a successful restaurant by simply cycling through the same time period repeatedly and expect to get different customers on each repeat. 

    I'm frankly not even sure if it's rational to try to be rational in a universe that divorced from cause and effect and other basic assumptions we make.

  Poems, songs, and rhymes are easy pickings, mostly because they don't have enough of a skeleton to hang a story on - they're nearly impossible to make a rational fanfic of mostly because they're nearly impossible to elaborate on without inventing details wholesale. You can't make a rational fanfic because you can't really make a fanfic.

      There once was a man from Nantucket
      Who kept all his cash in a bucket.
      But his daughter, named Nan,
      Ran away with a man
      And as for the bucket, Nantucket.

  I mean ... sure, you could spin some kind of lesson about diversifying your portfolio, but you'd get so far away from the limerick that there's hardly a point to it.

      There once was a man from Nantucket
      Who kept all his cash in a bucket.
      But his daughter, named Nan,
      Came up with a plan

  But I digress. If you really want to pick a story that *can't* be converted, pick one that can't be changed to fit.

    It doesn't have to be the mad character who is changed to a rational character. Just have someone else in the story be given the rational upgrade, turn them loose on the mad character, and step back for the fireworks.

    Alternately, write about how the mad character develops rationalist skills and learns to stop or work around his/her madness. Of course the second option is a lot harder than the first.

      Queequeg might make a very interesting rational character.  Even his religious beliefs are odd enough, and plastic enough that, if viewed from an internal point of view, he might be agnostic.

      IMO 'rational' stories don't necessarily need to contain rationalist characters, just characters who act rationally for their given values and character. So, nothing happens just for plot reasons. You could almost say the story is somewhat deterministic, if you fully specified the starting conditions.

  I think Warhammer 40K would be a good challenge. The universe itself isn't rational enough- you've got multiple godlike entities actively tampering with people and events, leading to significant difficulty predicting the actions of others,  and there's decent evidence that they target anyone trying to be rational.
  ```

  - u/Farmerbob1:
    ```
    From what I've seen, the Eldar seem rational at times.  You could probably write a rationalfic from the point of view of a craftworld Eldar.

    You could even write a rationalfic from the point of view of a member of a lost human colony on a null-psionic world.

    Of course, the WH40K universe being what it is, your rational character had best watch themselves closely if they ever think about leaving their craftworld or null-psionic world.
    ```

    - u/obviousdisposable:
      ```
      Hmmm. The Eldar as a whole don't tend to act too rationally, but individual Eldar are shown to be reasonable on a frequent basis. That could work. 

      I like the idea of the lost human colony, but it's hard to find a way to have them interact with the rest of the universe on a scale that works. 

      Oddly, I did stumble across what looks like an attempt at the "lost human colony" approach. See here if you're curious:

  - u/scruiser:
    ```
    Now that you bring up Warhammer 40K... I think any setting in with lots of malevolent higher powers would be difficult to write rational fanfiction for, because in universe any rational character who actually started winning would get smacked down by stuff they had no way to stop, or even see coming.  Additionally, settings in which all the powerful abilities damage the user's sanity/ reasoning ability because this creates a tradeoff between epistemic and instrumental rationality.  So Lovecraft's stuff, played straight also meets these requirements.  Old World of Darkness does to some extent too I think.
    ```

    - u/obviousdisposable:
      ```
      Lovecraft's stuff is particularly notable here because, although his works are legendary for sanity loss in characters, his protagonists tend to act in reasonable ways. Also, his higher powers are rarely actively malicious, which is something that many authors in his universe tend to forget. I've always wanted to expand on the "sane man in an insane universe" concept that he seems to be hinting at, but never have found a way I like to make it work. 

      I agree on the problem of malevolent higher powers in universes. Now that I think about it, it might be possible to write fiction where the rational character has to actively avoid catching their attention. That could lead to a really interesting story where the struggle is to make small changes that add up without disrupting the expected course of events enough to merit actual intervention. If it goes right, you could possibly have a story where the primary antagonist never actually does anything but still remains a massive challenge and threat, which would be interesting.
      ```

        ```
        > small changes that add up without disrupting the expected course of events enough to merit actual intervention

        I think you might need the opposite strategy, depending on how the precognition works.  If the precognition is just extreme predictive ability based on present information, yes this strategy might work.  If the precognition has some supernatural mechanism, then you might need to build up all preparations under some kind of anti-precog effect and then make one giant master move to change the balance of things. 

        Idea for rational WH40K!  A society of nulls, knowing they are immune to pskyers and warp precognition, go about setting up a master plan to disrupt the chaos gods.
        ```

        ```
        > small changes that add up without disrupting the expected course of events enough to merit actual intervention

        I'm now imagining a kind of cosmic Overton Window, where you have to gently ease the universe into the idea of you changing your fate, but where you *can* eventually arrive at the result you want by slow cumulative incremental means... so long as no one step is abrupt or drastic enough to draw attention.

    Could be done easily. Before the story opens, Emps dies and ascends to become a warp god. Big E loved reason, so his power forces things to make a little more sense, allowing a rational character to once again be effective.

    On another level, the Great Crusade and the Emperor's conquest of earth are basically the story of a rational guy (with godlike powers) playing out his endgame.

    That poem to me has always had a kind of zodiac ring to it. Like my depression is explained by being a child born on a Wednesday. 

    If I were to try to write a rational story based off of this poem, I would set it in a world where your birthday actually predicted your fate. The scientific method catches up with astrology and the protagonists struggle with the implications of their findings and what it means to be in a world where Fate is concretely real.

    FLCL would be great -- almost *Puella Magi Madoka Magica* style farming of teens for great power/giant brain robots. I could totally see that work as a rationally functioning world. I really want to see this fanfic now.

    ---

    In Excel Saga, it isn't clear if those people were just crazy and had weird abilities, or if the entire world worked that way. I lean towards them being the odd ones, as a normal person (the foreign worker) is initial shown to have been dragged into the craziness and then reacts as one would logically expect (i.e. horror and fear). It seems to take place in the "real world", so just do the standard *world++* thing when dealing with the oddities.

    Having another normal (rational) person interface with those weird Excel Saga people would work, as would something like a rationalHyatt dealing with being (apparently) deathly ill as well as apparently now immortal. All it would need is strong causes for everything (even if they aren't explained) and well-worked out rules, something the setting doesn't preclude.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  You could write a rational fic of anything if you're willing to change it enough.

  Actually, according to wikipedia, this is a poem about mother goose:

  > Old Mother Goose,

  > When she wanted to wander,

  > Would ride through the air

  > On a very fine gander.

  > Jack's mother came in,

  > And caught the goose soon,

  > And mounting its back,

  > Flew up to the moon

  Clearly HJPEV got to Jack's mother. "Jack" is a slang term for "man" so Jack's mother is humanity's caretaker aka a humanist scientist or FAI depending on your perspective and the silvery white goose a Patronus representing the will to power, so to speak. It's really just an allegory for humanity's potential if they have the will and wisdom to make use of their powers.

  So yeah someone could probably write mother goose rational fic.

    I assume a rational fanfic involves at least most of the original characters and setting being recognizable; otherwise, it's not a fanfic so much as original content.

    I do like the image of the king's sapient horses being talented medical professionals, though, who are stymied in their attempts to save Humpty because he hit his head and is unable to be saved by cryonic means.

      Well the real question is why you'd want a bunch of horses to be putting together an egg in the first place. HJPEV would set that shit straight like five minutes after he deposed the king and took his place.

        Old King Coal was a merry old soul, but he did spend most of his time calling for more and more novel forms of entertainment. Do we suppose his budget is efficient enough that he can pull this off without unreasonably high taxes?

        Then again, he does have a space program, if the cow that jumped over the moon can repeat that feat with a payload.

        On the other hand, if your working class keeps going out to see, and taking your food/candle production with them, there might be a problem.

        But Jack Sprat and his wife clearly contain valuable information for dietitians. I should hope someone's looking into that.

        Also, pass some child labor laws, or at least establish mandatory workplace safety classes. Littles Bo Peep and Boy Blue do not bode well for the wool or mutton industries, and let's not even get into all the head injuries from simple water-fetching operations.

        And spiders are clearly the oppressed underclass. After making it all the way out of that spout, against all the freak weather accidents and terrible plumbing, they can't even sit on tuffets without everyone running away!

        Really, signs do not point to Old King Coal's popularity lasting for long. His healthcare system is in shambles, sheep plunder the countryside while children are left unattended and injured (their parents doubtless recruited to be King Coal's dancers and trumpeters), half the economy is emigrating, and it's only a matter of time before the spiders go on strike. All the while, King Coal is partying in his palace. Black Sheep seems to be the only leg of this society that can carry any weight, and a full third of their output goes to charity!

          There are plenty of productive society members: Just look at Peter Piper, whose new agricultural techniques for growing preprocessed food have put our food production *years* ahead!

          On the other hand, the current housing crisis is certainly a problem, and improved agricultural techniques don't really help with it. But by the power of recycling, that problem too is slowly but surely being solved: Yes, having to live in a makeshift house made out of what was formerly footwear isn't pleasant, but it sure beats being homeless!

          (Furthermore, Peter's advanced horticultural techniques may eventually provide an alternative solution. Rumor has it that he secretly managed to grow a super-advanced proof-of-concept pumpkin house, which his wife is living in very happily.)
          ```

          - u/Lord_Drol:
            ```
            If you want more evidence of the current revolutionary technological progress, just look at Peter's arch-rival, Mary. Her agricultural exploits are even more impressive, ranging into the realm of growing *non-organic material*. No one is quite sure how she did it, but somehow she has managed to grow *silver bells*. Yes, really.

            It was impressive enough when she was just growing cockle shells, but this will probably increase the nation's silver exports tenfold! Peter is trying hard to replicate the feat, much to Mary's chagrin. She's trying to get King Cole to pass a patent law. Only time will tell what the result will be.

            (And they said she'd never amount to much! All those naysayers who said that her education would be disrupted by her strange fascination with sheep were **wrong**. Take that, naysayers!)

            It is true that we're slightly behind in our legal system, and not just on patents. We actually don't have a minimum wage yet. For years there has been a lobby for one, but King Cole has yet to sign off on the proposed law. Until then, poor Johnny isn't going to get more than a single penny for a day's work.

            Furthermore, the country's military expenses are generally considered extremely wasteful. We have ten thousand men under arms, yet all they do all day is climb up and down hills! That ridiculous Duke claims it's "training", but is that really how we want to spend taxpayer money?

            So yes, our government isn't perfect, as you alluded. Nevertheless, I do believe we are making definite strides forwards.

  I'm pretty darn late to the party but I would say Homestuck.  Changing the behaviors of one of the characters even slightly would just result in a doomed timeline.  

  Also, the plot is so heavily tangled with time travel shenanigans that you would have to basically rewrite the whole thing to change it significantly.  At that point it will basically be a different work of fiction with similar elements.

  Although now that I think about it, you might have a semi-rational actor who just sort of goes with the flow to avoid death by time travel.

    For the record, I know of it because I was one of the people who helped establish the setting as a shared universe for fanfiction, and he walked all over the point of the thing (true, it was technically a setting about broken people becoming more broken, but it was also about emotional abuse and trauma, coping skills, and the value of establishing social connections in the face of repression, and even served as a rather effective improptu group therapy for a while). Somehow I am *still* friends with the guy who did it (the pressure of 'belonging to the same group' is a powerful thing), although only after he grew up and realized that some stories are meant to fulfill other emotional needs and thus probably shouldn't be munchkinned - at least, not within earshot of the creators.

    I'm imagining Barney's evil counterpart (let's call him "Fred") being gifted to a serial killer on death row, who then uses his dread power to escape and go on a rampage. However, his imagination was no match for that of the local SWAT. The US Military naturally began searching all stuffed dinosaurs for traces of this power. Barney and friends tried singing a song about love to dissuade them from taking Barney for experimentation. It worked, but ... not as intended.
