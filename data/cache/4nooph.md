  HAH-larious! 

  Yeah, the planet base for rebels is a bit dumb, considering the Empire has vast resources to scour the galaxy and greater manpower.

    In fairness, there are advantages to a planetary base. You aren't living in a closed system, so you can easily get water, mine things, etc. Air is free. Fire and heat aren't nearly as much of an issue. You can do that in ships as well by mining asteroids/comets and careful cooling, but it's harder. 

    Also, it really shouldn't be possible for the Empire to find them with the tech shown. The number of probes it would take is off the charts. The. There's the way it happened: to he probe that discovered them, for example -- they sent one probe to search an entire planet, and it happened to touch down within a few miles of the base? Also, the probe sent a signal back to the Empire, which I think is the only time we see interplanetary communication in the OrigTrij. Could be that the probe transmitted to something in orbit which then traveled back to the Empire, I guess. That's my new headcanon.

  I wonder about the RoTJ railgun idea, I would think that the asteroid would punch through the planet like a bullet through a watermelon without transferring much kinetic energy to the planet.  Life around the entry and exit holes would suck, bu the planet would be basically OK.

  In order to achieve the 'trash the crust all at once' effect, the asteroid would have to be going fast enough to impart enough energy to the planet, but slow enough  to not punch through.

  The asteroid targeting the Death Star presents a different problem.  Even if the shield stays up, the kinetic energy has to go *somewhere*.  Possibilities include:
  1.  The shield heats up, cooking everything inside.
  2.  A billiard ball collision with respect to the shield, but NOT the contents.  Everything inside is turned into metallic goo.
  3.  The 'safe against any bombardment' wasn't planning on a 0.9+c asteroid strike, the shield fails like any other shield when hit by too much energy.

  > LEIA: I put them in my Dropbox and then emailed the link to everyone in the Imperial Senate, plus all the major news media, plus the Rebel leaders.

  ...surely Vader would be jamming all transmissions from Leia's ship? Dropbox is a great service, but it doesn't work if you can't connect.

  I really liked the mobile Rebel base, though. With Vader continually missing them by ten minutes...

    To borrow from Watchmen:  "She's not a comic book villain. She did it thirty-five minutes ago."

    More seriously: she did it before Vader got on her track. He couldn't be jamming transmissions, because he saw the incoming message. She saved that message to her Dropbox and sent out the pre-prepared emails.  It took about a second and a half. 

    Or maybe the Bothans put it in their own Dropbox, sent the emails with her name forged on the From line, and the transmission Vader detected was just "It's done."  I'm not really sure; she was being a little cagey when telling me the details, and kept going on about OPSEC and information hygiene and a lot of other fancy spy words.

    Whatever the transmission system is, if ftl is cheap enough in the setting you could have hyperspace capable message pods on ships for that sort of eventuality, especially if you are in the senate and at risk of politically motivaed attack. Pod jumps to an arbitrary system and broadcasts, bam
