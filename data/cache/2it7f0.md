## [R][DC] Kickstarter for "Pay Attention" to launch on Saturday.

### Post:

Hey everyone,

A few days ago, [I mentioned](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ie329/questions_about_a_kickstarter_to_fund_a_story/) that I would be doing a Kickstarter to fund the rational horror story that /u/Timewinders wanted.

That Kickstarter launches noon the day after tomorrow -- Saturday, October 11, 12pm Pacific time.  I'd really appreciate it if y'all would mention it to a few friends.  This is a test run for me; if Kickstarter works well for this project, I will be doing a lot more writing and funding it through Kickstarter.  I'm quite happy to write requests, so making this one work is a good way to ensure there's more rational stuff out there that you want to read.  (Or irrational stuff.  Or kinda-rational-but-not-entirely.  Or whatever; I'm not fussy.)
