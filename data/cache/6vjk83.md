## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  For elves, there are two competing ideals; fäsh and shilaal. Fäsh is sometimes translated as "perfection", but a closer reading is "homeostasis", in other words, a thing remaining as it is. Shilall is sometimes translated as "improvement", but a better, more complex translation would be "integration of the positive".

  Fäsh is the idealized end for an elf, a point beyond which no change will ever be made again, because all possible positive qualities have been integrated, thereby making shilaal unnecessary. Fäsh *by itself* is not a good thing, because of course homeostasis is possible when a thing is suboptimal - enduring, but not perfect. The specific word for "fäsh with no room for shilaal" is "ulfäsh", which "elvish" comes from in the human tongue (and the human extrapolation, "elf", which the elves disdain to use).

  The elven relationship with shilaal is complicated. On the one hand, shilaal is by definition good, but on the other, shilaal is also *aspirational*; the goal of shilaal is to move from fäsh to fäsh, which offers quite a bit of room for errors and in some cases will result in either extended negative effects before fäsh is achieved, or sometimes even death. Ideally, shilaal will be as fäsh as possible. Where a human will sloppily swing a sword over and over again until he finally gets it right more often than not, the ideal elf will study and meditate on the sword until he can perform his sword stroke perfectly the very first time he ever does it. Rapid iteration, in other words, is not for the elves.

    Congratulations, you have somehow found a way to make me hate the smug, pointy eared bastards even more. On one hand, really neat worldbuilding. On the other hand, it would be really, really irritating to live alongside a race that gets everything right on their first try (even if that's justified).
    ```

  - u/coolflash:

    I like it, which means I want to change it a bit: consider the sword swing example. At the moment I see a tension  between "will not swing" but "will study/meditate". After all, the new knowledge has to come from somewhere. So I propose that the elf keeps its current state so firmly in mind, like a computer backup, that essaying a swing would not necessarily change itself - unlike the human who rewires himself with every swing or thought. Then, any new information - from swinging, or reading about it, any practice that would make sense from the current state - would be used to create a mental conception of an idealised swing, and only when that conception becomes complete does the elf adjoin it to its current state. (It seems too easy to integrate small bits of improvement, which seems to be allowed by you at the moment.)

    So the elf might well swing the sword "clumsily" a few times before he adjoins an ideal swing. You could have it as a matter of status the fewer times some form of practice is used before the ideal is reached. 

    An elf would have to be careful what sort of things they decide to achieve: if they pick something they can't create an ideal conception of in a reasonable time or using forms of practice they can easily think of, then they might never finish, and they'd have this huge chunk of memory taken up which would be a psychological itch and occasionally spit out some new form of practice that would seem very strange, like, for the sword swing example (though I expect elves to handle that just fine) maybe they pick too broad a conception of swing to start with, and they end up having to try to get idealised proprioception like a sense of space that goes for a hundred metres in each direction down to the accuracy of what their fingertips can sense. A rare success along these lines would give differentiation among elves, because you'd get these from initial mistakes and lucky breaks, and most elves wouldn't want to take such a risk.

    You could get forms of madness from incomplete conceptions. Taboo madness might arise from multiple such. Or what happens when they successfully complete a conception, but it's a large one and would dominate their behaviour afterwards, and it becomes harder to think of them as humanoids because of it. Exaggerated example: all their motions have some of the motivation of a sword swing in them, because it's all mediated by a spatial sense which was created with that as a base. Plenty of opportunity for "quirks" that don't detract from perfect sword swings that way.

  I'm brainstorming methods by one might uplift or otherwise increase the intelligence of an animal. I'm personally interested in methods that would fit a science fiction sort of setting but more fantastic methods are welcome, since I hope that this can be of help to others as well. 

  Current ideas: 

  * The standard "do some gene tinkering, make the brain bigger" method. This might be sufficient for e.g. chimpanzees or even large dogs, but smaller animals will probably not qualify. 
  * Implant a very small computer, which essentially simulates additional brain matter. These uplifts are cyborgs, and they almost certainly lose their higher reasoning abilities if the computer is damaged.
  ```

  - u/trekie140:
    ```
    For me, the biggest question about uplifting was always why anyone would want to? Digital artificial intelligence can do things humans can't, can be programmed with safety features, and are subject to relatively easy modification as needed. Biological artificial intelligence is basically just a human, but more expensive to both create and maintain due to different biological and psychological requirements.

    The one story I've read that justified it to my satisfaction is Freefall, where the purpose was to create people who could colonize a planet with biochemistry that was compatible with some animals but not humans. Eclipse Phase gets an honorable mention for being a setting where mind uploading is so common that uplifts just means more options for your body, but I could never reconcile that with the systemic racism they face.

      Another reason that might be interesting to explore is that certain animals may think differently, which could lead to unique ideas that would be difficult for a human to visualise. Cephalopods, especially octopuses, are quite smart, but have taken a different evolutionary path to humans. Maybe a sapient octopus would be better at visualising higher dimensions? It would be an interesting idea to explore in any case, and might see more interesting uplift candidates than apes or dogs.

        Who says octopi *aren't* sapient?  They certainly seem capable of tool use, advanced motion-planning, and social recognition.

      Because animals are people.

    From your examples I'm getting the feeling that you're wanting ideas on how you have a small brain case fit a "humanly intelligent" brain rather than on, say, what the machine itself would look like or anything about the social consequences. So I'm gonna focus on those aspects, though the whole thing is pretty interesting to think about.

    You're basically limited to a few broad methods:

    * Make the brain bigger
     * Bigger head for bigger brain
     * Squish/reshape organs, have brain matter distributed somehow (think the incorrect meme about stegosaurs having a brain in their hips)
     * Cyborg tech: brain chip interfaces with "the cloud" for brain power (plot opportunity: if the internet goes down, the creature gets downlifted)
     * Cyborg tech: brain chip interfaces with "harddrive" that is implanted in skin or worn as backpack (hard for suspension of disbelief with sufficiently advanced tech, since the hard drive should be pretty tiny).
    * Make the brain more efficient
     * Cyborg implant
     * Genetic engineering (retrovirus?): have the neurons more efficient, closer together, etc
    * Re-optimise the brain
     * Birds (say) are really optimised to control their wings for flight (or: dogs for smell/etc). Perhaps if the parts of their brain used for flying were co-opted for higher thought, you'd be able to fit human-level intelligence into that brain. Practical upshot: the animal makes some "trade off" for its intelligence.
     * As above but you use tech to "give back" the ability that the brain is no longer able to do e.g. give the bird a jetpack, or e.g. replace the part of the brain that controls the heart beat with a pacemaker (from an anatomical POV not sure how much "thinking power" the pons or whatever has)
     * As above but make the animal a head in a vat/robot so all the machinery associated with controlling the 
    body can be used for thought (inverse of the "give them a cyborg intelligence chip" idea)
    ```

    - u/callmesalticidae:

      Excellent. Thanks! I especially like the idea about squishing/reshaping organs. 

      The idea of linking the chip to some sort of cloud is also rife with story potential. 

      > As above but you use tech to "give back" the ability that the brain is no longer able to do e.g. give the bird a jetpack

      That's one way to make a setting stand out. "Oh, that's the story where the intelligent crow protagonist has to use a jetpack to get around." 

      Thanks again.

        My pleasure! Thinking up a bunch of different ideas is a lot of fun when there's no existing universe to constrain you and no plot in mind to limit you. 

        I loved the idea of a bird with a jetpack too. Very visceral! From a realism point of view I'm not sure how many "CPU cycles" the capability for flight takes away from a bird's brain though.

  I think I've found a way to rationalize the slice of life genre. In the transhumanist future setting of Eclipse Phase, civilization on Earth was wiped out by the Singularity and the survivors fled into space. To help rebuild civilization, they decided to raise thousands of children in a simulation at accelerated time. This being Eclipse Phase, it of course all went horribly wrong and the kids were all driven insane, but what if it had worked?

  The kids would grow up in a environment meant to resemble reality as closely as possible, but lack the ability to do any real harm to each other. It'd be a relatively tranquil place where they're sheltered from anything more than inconvenience in order to condition them into being good citizens. Their lives would generally revolve around education since they're being trained to help rebuild society.

  That sounds a whole lot like a slice of life anime, doesn't it? Students dealing with low-tension problems in a world where bad things just don't happen to them regardless of their decisions or aptitudes. Even if they try to physically hurt each other, there are no lasting consequences to it. Yet it all still looks like our reality because they will eventually leave for the outside world to make a life for themselves.

  Trying to make a short post today, but as always it's about vampires! Specifically, vampire clothing!

  A lot of the time fiction has vampires wearing either really old-timey clothes (I guess because they're used to them), or just whatever people are wearing in the "present day". Old-timey clothes are often justified with "well it's what they grew up with!" and present day clothes with "they want to blend in!". Both of those justifications don't really work when you think about it.

  The idea of a vampire from ancient Rome just casually wearing a toga around is kind of lame, because did that vampire decide there was no fashion that appealed to them more in 2000 years of time and who knows how many different continents than a fancy draped sheet? Were they not as amazed by purple dye as everyone else? 

  But then the idea of a vampire in 2017 sporting purple hair and an undercut is also kind of lame. If this vampire is not trying to "fit in" with human society, why would she care about following a fashion trend that's only ~5-10 years old for anything other than a bit of fun? And if she is, she could "fit in" with clothes that are slightly dated: no need for her to be fashion forward. But really, why wouldn't she have tailors make her exactly what she wants to wear, and if it's a bizarre combination of a poodle skirt, corset, and stilettos, if she's only wearing those around other vampires and humans she's about to eat, why does it matter?

  Actually, on the purple dye thing: I could see a vampire enjoying wearing purple for a few hundred years after it was cheap to do so just because of the novelty of it. Are there any other "advances in fashion" that are surprisingly recent that vampires might be really into? Like, I suppose there are vampires out there who have tons of velcro in their clothing because they think it's so amazing and cool and new?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    If vampire interactions is almost exclusively with other vampires, then they likely have their own fashion conventions. How are vampire ages distributed? Obviously, the older the mean vampire age, the older fashion will tend to be as a result of inertia. I'm not familiar with your world, but if vampires are still highly empowered and decadent agents, maybe the trend would be the rarest and most exotic combination? Non-masquerade shattering mass theft seems feasible, if the population of vampires is small.
    ```

      I didn't want it to get too bogged down in my very expansive mythology, but since you asked, My Vampires' population went through a bottleneck ~1700 CE, reducing from 20k to 800 individuals. It recovers to ~20k in 1900 and then I believe that growth rate puts them on ~100k in 2000. This also makes the median age *very, very young* (85% of vampires are less than 100 years a vampire).

      > then they likely have their own fashion conventions

      My Vampires certainly do and it comes up a lot, but I tended to write it as the colour and the way e.g. the sleeves are rolled as being what has the effect rather than whether your suit is more appropriate to the 70s or the 90s. Essentially, a pale yellow shirt means you're appreciative that an important friend is honouring you with a visit, and it doesn't matter if it's a singlet or a button up. This doesn't make that much sense though it does give vampires a lot of flexibility in what they choose to wear if they want to blend in - but they normally don't need to. 

      So I wonder if my saying "vampires clothing colours, the way they fold sleeves up, and the way they lace their shoes matter, but it doesn't matter at all whether they're wearing a 3 piece suit or a bathing suit" is dumb. *Probably* they all intersect: a suit means something different than a bathing suit, and a yellow t-shirt means something different to a yellow button up shirt, but whatever outfit you choose is "Turing-complete" so to speak. 

      Here's a self-indulgent excerpt from my story to explain a bit how the clothing works, I might edit it to make it more explicit though:

      > William couldn’t help but take note of the precise angle that the night porter was wearing his hat at; the place he had rolled his sleeves up to, and the number of times he had folded the sleeve to do it. To a vampire, such aspects of one’s attire were carefully composed, and each button, each fold, and each accessory brought a meaning to the outfit. If the porter had been a vampire, he would be signalling for a private meeting with a superior. It was unambiguous. It was absurd; he had never heard of a human stumbling upon a coherent message like that.
      ```

    I'd expect the new vampires to look timeless, and the oldest vampires to look like painfully trendy hipsters.

    Figure I'm a vampire.  I get turned.  Then, I get distracted by vampire culture.  Years 0-20, I fit in as a native.  Years 20-60, I look like a weirdly dated native.  Maybe I was a kid who latched onto my parents' fashion.  

    At 60-80 years, everyone who grew up wearing my outfit is dead.  I'd look unnaturally dated, so I'd need to take a while to learn to look normal again.  Fortunately, I still have some baseline understanding of culture to work from.

    Contrast with a vampire who's 300+ years old.  They'd have no idea what's going on culture-wise.  And wouldn't want to spend a year talking to young people to figure it out.  Those vampires should throw money at the problem.

    This means that I'd expect old vampires to have a "cultural assistant" picking out their wardrobe, explaining current events, and updating them on slang.  In some ways, it would be a form of conspicuous consumption.  It also means that old vampires are taking advice from people who's livelihood depends on chasing new trends.

    So, the Master Vampire would have a hipster undercut and all-birds shoes.  They'd be fashion-forward in ways that require tons of effort (on behalf of their assistants), while 'timeless' clothing would be a new vampire thing.

    You'd probably get funny conversations where the ancient vampire graciously shares their "wisdom" about pop-culture with a vampire who's merely 80.
