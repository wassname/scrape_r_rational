    I also found it odd that there was practically a whole chapter devoted to how the "haves" don't do anything for the "have-nots" and how we should redesign society, but as soon as the main character gets his chance he completely forgets about the poor sods back in America. (And the whole "no one did anything for those in third world countries " is patently false.)

    Wide-eyed idealism indeed.

    Also, someone who figures out how to sell something to covertly control people through subtle shifts in perception.

  >[Anvilicious ](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious)

  >A portmanteau of anvil and delicious (or possibly vicious), anvilicious describes a writer's and/or director's use of an artistic element, be it line of dialogue, visual motif, or plot point, to so obviously or unsubtly convey a particular message that they may as well etch it onto an anvil and drop it on your head. Frequently, the element becomes anvilicious through unnecessary repetition, but true masters can achieve anviliciousness with a single stroke.

  Not that I disagree with their point, just the implementation is a little bit bad. Still, it seems popular.

  This part bothered me: 

  >  "What's to stop someone from taking over the system and turning us into an army of zombies?" I asked.

  > "I'm no engineer," Linda said, "But here's the best explanation I've heard. Why can't someone take over your brain?"

  > "What do you mean?"

  > "Why has no one ever been able to take over billions of human brains and create an army of zombies that way?"

  > "Well, it's inside of me. How would they take it over?" I replied.

  > "Why can't they just upload a program into your brain, and that program takes over your brain and turns you into a zombie a minute later? Why does that never happen?" She asked.

  > "Because there is no way to 'upload' a program into my brain. And my brain does not execute programs anyway. It is not a computer." I replied.

  > "Yes." She said.

  *My* answer to the question "Why hasn't anyone taken over our brains?" is not "because the brain is special", its "because no one has figured out how to do it yet." I would be incredibly wary about a computer being connected to my brain; especially after experiencing Manna. I would certainly ask about security risks before I attached a computer directly to my brain. 

  As a computer science student I know that any computer system can be hacked, given enough time and incentive. And from the wonderful world of [parasites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophiocordyceps_unilateralis), I know that you don't even need a computer to control brains. 

  Edit: grammar

    Definitely. I personally would never put a chip in myself that I couldn't remove -- the ability to "go off grid" should be an inalienable right.

      What's most remarkable to me is that this conversation was held *after* Jake got the (probably) irreversible surgery.

      That's kind of why I had such a problem with principle 3, nothing is anonymous. If that means anyone can look at [my internet history](https://imgur.com/VM198.jpg), I'm out.

    "What's to stop someone from taking over the system and turning us into an army of zombies?" I asked.

    "Nothing."

    "But-"

    *Gives blank inhuman stare.*

  It's absolutely about the setting and not the characters, but said setting is developed enough to keep it interesting. 

  The only thing I'm not getting is that uploading should probably have eliminated most of Australia by now, but I'm only on Chapter 7.

  edit: Finished, and turns out the whole uploading thing was just in its embryonic stages.

  I like this, but it reads as a long thought experiment, instead of an actual story. Yes, it would be terrifying if capitalism was brought to an extreme. Yes, just like now, the poor would want to change the system while the rich would want it to stay the same. And yeah, the Australian model would be pretty ideal and would prevent a lot of the problems.

  It reminds a bit of the plot of Atlas shrugged, where the world is going to hell and a small community has found a way to live that's much much better (which they will soon spread to the world in order to save them).

  It fails though to go into detail. What happens to an economic system when almost all of the recipients are without jobs? What happens to the owner of fast food joints, when those who frequent fast food joints are suddenly unable to pay for that kind of food. How does a hospital make money, if none of its patients can pay for the care? How long can rich people stay rich, if their markets shrink every day? If capitalism doesn't collapse, then how does it stay afloat?

  In Australia, there are serious downsides to the system that ought to be examined. The possibility of a virus is handwaved away, but what about a malfunction that won't let you control your body anymore? What about the sexual deviants who want to keep some of their kinks private? What about the people who live in VS who want to take on different shapes? Letting everyone do their own thing is awesome, but it also creates very different fractions. Within years, Australia might be splintered into parties or countries that want mutually exclusive things. Religious extremists probably won't be allowed to bully others into doing something they don't want because of the rules, but manipulation and emotional abuse can still exist and be very damaging. Whenever you make rules, there are people who can find the loopholes.

  And as some other people mentioned, how do you deal with other countries taking offence to your way of doing things? Even if Australia doesn't run out of room and wants to start expanding, other countries might demand some answers as to where their 400,000 inhabitants a day are going. I really wouldn't put it past rich guys with big egos to wanna selfishly hoard their wellfare families and launch a 'humanitarian rescue' for those 'unfortunate souls, probably used for slave labour'.

  So yeah, fun concept, but feels incomplete.

    You should check out "Freehold" by Michael Z Williamson for an exploration of exactly that "hoarding welfare families" idea. It's packed full of libertarian propaganda, but it's a rocking good war story with some excellent character development. The sequels are also lots of fun and at least occasionally start it brush up against the bad sides of libertarian society.
