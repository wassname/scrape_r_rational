## [Challenge Companion] Happy Stories

### Post:

I can't speak with any authority on this subject, because I've never written what I would think of as a happy story. I enjoy reading stories with happy endings, but I tend to like heroes that are put through the grinder before they get there. I don't really have any recommendations either; one of the reasons that this is the challenge this week is that rational fiction has what some have perceived as an over-abundance of dark fiction.

**This is the challenge companion thread, post discussion, recommendations, or ideas below.**

  Some thoughts on the list of prompts, specifically the "longer stories" prompt:

  I notice that most of the stories I remember seeing submitted for a challenge that were also *written* for the challenge are not all that long, and certainly wouldn't qualify in a "longer stories" challenge (the prompt list currently suggests a 10k word minimum for it).  I strongly suspect that this is because 1-2 weeks isn't long enough for most people here to write a decent rationalfic of that length, especially given my experience in trying to write a story for one of the prompts that *needs* to be on the longer end of "short story" to work.  (My (incomplete) draft currently stands at 13.5k words, and is slated to run under the upcoming "Superheroes" challenge instead of the "Reverse Portal Fantasy" challenge that initially inspired it.)

  Because of this, I don't think the "longer stories" challenge should be run as a regular challenge if it is run at all.  Instead, I have two suggestions (that could even both be used as separate challenges) for how such a prompt might be run well:

  * Announce the prompt for that particular challenge further in advance so that prospective participants have enough time to write an entry.  (How much further is an interesting question.)  Depending on the subreddit's intentions for the playing field, it may be helpful to limit the challenge to works created for it / within that timeframe.
  * Run the challenge as a showcase of *previously submitted* (whether for a challenge or just to r/rational) works, possibly further polished by their authors.  The trick here would be having enough entries without turning it into a contest between known major works, although allowing multi-part stories (where different parts were submitted for different challenges) to be showcased as a single entry would help.

  Further suggestions?  Thoughts on what you would want to see?

  https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff shows a Harry who uses his Muggle background and nous and his sheer laziness to make a lot of money and make his life easier. It's mostly Rational and is pretty funny. It's not very long (covers just year 1 and 2) but it's light-hearted enough to count as a happy story.

  Happy stories... I can do a veneer of happiness plastered over a backdrop of soul crushing despair. Somehow I don't think that counts.

  My recommendation, for those who find their inspiration in the darker themes, though my own attempt isn't going well: A Comedy of Errors.

  Much rational fiction is about characters who don't make major mistakes, and that isn't quite the same thing as thinking things through. Misunderstanding is less frequent when intelligent characters apply their knowledge and resources rationally... but the ones that squeeze through that sieve tend to be a LOT more impressive.

  Just make sure you remember your Aristotle: In a tragedy, everything goes well and then falls apart. In a comedy, everything falls apart but turns out well. In the best comedies, all the follies act as a sort of crucible that flares away the toxic gasses, skims the slag, and generally leaves everything better than we found them.

  It can get pretty grim in the middle there, though. So long as it's never taken seriously enough to convince us that that's the direction the story is going.
