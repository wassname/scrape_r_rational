## Secret Krampus Companion Thread

### Post:

This is a companion thread for the Secret Krampus Contest.

Since the top level comments are prompts or stories in the other threads, this is the thread to go to for anyone who wants to discuss the contest itself or complain about the raving nutjob who set everything up.

Let me know if there's anything you think I could have done better or different in case I choose to run something similar again in the future.

    Agreed.

  How about an official Author’s Notes thread to go with the eventual Results thread on the 14th?

  - world-building notes on things we didn’t explicitly put into the story
  - things we’d do differently or revise
  - prequel or sequel ideas
  - the story’s rationality focus and how much it affected the story
  ```

    I like this idea. It also sounds like a good place for readers' followup questions and critique. Not that we can't already do that in the voting thread, but replies to the story comments don't automatically ping the author, whereas a reply to an author's note would.

  /u/xamueljones I'd recommend putting the contest threads in challenge mode
  ```

  - u/xamueljones:

    Can't. It has to be a mod who does that and they haven't gotten my message asking yet.

  Hm. I like the idea of posting stories without posting their authors, but it's logistically hard if every author is providing their own link to the story hosted at a location of their choosing. I'm using a personal website, but even a Google Doc is attributable. The only alternative would be to have the contest-runner post each story to a standardized site.

  Why'm I thinking about this? It would divorce the story from the story-author, so that authors with established fandoms or authors with no fandoms would be able to have their stories considered on the merits of the story, rather than the author's reputation.

  With the current setup, it may be better to spoiler-tag author names, or to make the link to the story the top thing in each comment on the story-voting thread.

  aside from the stories themselves, one of the fascinating things about this even was the sheer variety in how people decided to upload their stories. It almost felt like people were trying to outdo each other in obscurity.

  You had the standard google docs and AO3 links, but then some personal blogs hosted on wordpress, github, a seriously retro webring blog, a pdf filehost... I couldn't help but be reminded of [xkcd's comic about standards.](https://xkcd.com/927/)

    I was initially gonna upload mine as a pastebin

  Am I the only one who's confused about how to vote? 

  Is it supposed to be like a regular Reddit thread, only no downvoting? Usually with these sorts of things, you only get to vote for one story.
  ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    Yeah. You can vote for as many stories as you want. But there's no downvoting allowed.

    In general, this kind of voting system is called approval voting if you want to learn more about it.
    ```
