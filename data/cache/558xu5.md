  I really love this fic. The characterizations are excellent, the choices everyone makes are rational based on what they know and believe, Ami's power grows steadily as she does smart things, and she sciences the hell out of things.

    It's the little things like [Ami](#s " getting dragged along by her cloak when growing the sword") that I love - even though she successfully thinks her way out of the problem, it doesn't always go completely to plan, making her much more human.

  Does the author mention any plans on wrapping up this fic? It's very fun to read, but I've erroneously expected it to be finished when I'd started on the 2350 pages long pdf file. Hitting the end was an unpleasant surprise after building up the excitement for several days (yeah, my fault completely, should've checked the status before). Now I wonder if there are rough estimates for when the finale will come out, like for Mother of Learning. Or maybe it's meant to be continued indefinitely.

    It's a bit of a perpetual zombiefic. You know the usual dreaded "hiatus" that fics never come back from? Or sometimes they pretend to come back six months later with a chapter or two but it's always false hope?

    This is like that only it just keeps happening and never completely dies.
