## [D][META] Calling All (Potential) Rational-fic Authors Who Can't Seem to Get Started/Have Writer's Block

### Post:

Are you a ratfic author suffering a writers/worldbuilder's block you can't quite tame?

Are you a potential author who has a grand idea for a ratfic that you can't quite get started with?

Well, I have a proposition for you: how about a co-conspirator? Someone to egg you on, someone
to throw your ideas at, someone to throw ideas back at you?

Fortuitously, such a person exists: /u/ArmokGoB

Co-conspirator and considered invaluable in the creation of
/u/Nighzmarquls' [Deep Rise][deeprise], [Oh My, Generic Monster Girls][omgmg] and [The Fate Market (unwritten)][fate],
/u/DataPackRat's [S.I. (unpublished)][si],
and /u/mhd-hbd's (that's me!) [The World is Your Oyster, The Universe is Your Namesake][oyster].

Armok is a mad worldbuilding genius who likes to work in Google Docs, and over Skype, he has enormous amounts of free time, and
he is very, very, bored.

If you think you could use his help, feel free to message him.

^^Disclaimer: ^^conditions ^^of ^^availability ^^and ^^quality ^^of ^^help ^^offered ^^may ^^vary ^^depending ^^on ^^many, ^^many ^^factors.

  This is a great idea, especially since most rational-potential stories dont get finished.
  ```

- u/UltraRedSpectrum:
  ```
  If this is a common problem, maybe the solution could be generalized? I've always wondered whether writing by committee would work or not. Do twelve would-be authors make six could-be stories? Does anyone want to find out?
  ```

  - u/blazinghand:
    ```
    I'd be [pretty surprised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month) if you could put a group of twelve authors together and increase speed on a fiction project. Even if it takes 9 months for 1 woman to produce a baby, it doesn't follow that 9 women working in concert can bring a baby to term in 1 month.

    Without doing any research, I'd guess that having more than two people helping you write a novel doesn't help, and probably hurts, and even that, a team of three is a stretch. If you compartmentalized enough, you could make a team with a visionary/worldbuilder, a writer, and an editor, maybe. 

    I'd guess most of the time the real issue is getting over the initial hump of sitting down and writing. This is very difficult.
    ```

    - u/UltraRedSpectrum:
      ```
      Ah, sorry, I said that really badly. I meant that in the sense of the twelve forming into six pairs, each of which writes a story.

      However, to pick up your metaphor, our problem isn't a late baby so much as a lack of one. We're talking about the proverbial pandas of rational fiction. I'm wondering whether more pandas per book means more books overall, or, conversely, too many women conceiving the same baby ruins the soup. So to speak.
      ```

      - u/blazinghand:
        ```
        Ah, makes sense! Hmm, I guess if your current problem is "zero babies" it makes sense to keep on assigning people to the problem until babies appear.
        ```

        - u/ArmokGoB:
          ```
          yea, sometimes it turns out what was lacking was paradoxaly the people who can't make babies at all
          ```

  - u/tahoebyker:
    ```
    Writing groups/circles are certainly a thing people do. It encourages consistent writing and fosters creative discussion by having fresh eyes.

  ```
  Can we get an intro to Armok, by Armok? (I don't know how to tag people in a reddit post such that they get an alert)

  I think I'd be interested. I have an idea that I've been mulling over that could do with another world-builder's mind.

- u/jkwrites:
  ```
  I may be in progress of writing a novel which may be rational enough. I do enjoy lurking here.  I also may be suffering to akrasia, procrastination and (therefore?) writer's block. I was thinking about publishing serial fiction, but I am afraid of licensing, since I may want to publish my works as a novel at some point in time...
  ```

  - u/UltraRedSpectrum:
    ```
    Your first dozen or so stories will probably be crap anyway, so don't worry about licensing. It's not a personal thing, it's just a general trend in writers. When Stephen King was young he had a nail he used to hang all his rejection letters on. He eventually had to replace it with a railroad spike.
    ```

    - u/jkwrites:
      ```
      That's a reason why I've decided to post stuff to /r/rational anyway - I have written stuff for nanowrimo but it was crap, objectively. I'm not a writer. (I've got all of my world in my head...) However, I enjoy to write and I enjoy world-building even more...Is there any correlation of an author preferring worldbuilding to just writing the story?
      ```

      - u/UltraRedSpectrum:
        ```
        By most accounts, most writers worldbuild constantly, so they probably enjoy it as well. There's a reason one of the industry slogans is that ideas are cheap. Stephen King again (*On Writing* is a spectacular book) anecdotally got the idea for *The Mist* based on a shadow he saw out of the corner of his eye while walking home from the store. He also blasts loud music while he writes, which is usually something people do to reduce perception of time, which would seem to suggest that on the Want Like Approve continuum he wants to write and approves of it, but doesn't especially like it. This is backed up by his tendency (since kicked) to write drunk, which again reduces perception of time.
        ```

- u/Vebeltast:
  ```
  Having someone to bounce ideas off of is a good thing to have in any even remotely creative endeavour. It's a wonderful way to fix creative blocks and tons of fun even if you aren't trying to worldbuild. Heck, sign me up too: if you want to bounce ideas off someone for worldbuilding etc, go ahead and PM me on reddit.
  ```

  - u/Nighzmarquls:
    ```
    Also on MULTIPLE occasions the film and show industry has demonstrated that otherwise 'creative genius' creators often go to shit when their decoupled from critique and sanity checking.

    This is not the ONLY situation that causes failures but I feel like there is a misconception that good works are created by genius springing fully formed from the heads of zeus and then restricted and corrupted by outside influence.

    It's more that good work comes from good feedback loops of what is working and what is not.

      > I feel like there is a misconception that good works are created by genius springing fully formed from the heads of zeus and then restricted and corrupted by outside influence.

      Of course, given how horrible the Greek gods were, maybe there's something to the idea of describing Jar Jar as having "sprung fully-formed from the head of Zeus Lucas."
      ```

    - u/LiteralHeadCannon:
      ```
      Where slavish obedience to feedback fails, I think, is when it, for example, turns a hundred neutral-to-negative reactions into plain-neutral reactions, at the expense of turning ten extremely-positive reactions into regular-positive reactions. Does that make any sense?

  I've got 3 stories in various stages of completion. I have Fall of Oso, I have Advent Signal, and I have the unnamed novel that takes place in the same world as Fall of Oso. I've not been able to do much work on my stuff recently, but if someone was willing to help me with it, I'd really like to see the stories continue. Send me a pm if you wanna help me out.

  Fall of Oso takes place in the universe of Aeria, (here's a blog link: http://talesfromaeria.tumblr.com/) I kind of know where to take the story next, but I'm working right now on hammering out the wider metaplot that will cover the whole world. That's a lot more complicated then the comparatively local stuff I've done so far.
  ```

  - u/ArmokGoB:
    ```
    Sounds interesting, but since you've writen quite a bit alredy it might take a while before I get around to catching up on the Oso one.
    ```

    - u/Sagebrysh:
      ```
      that's cool, take your time, the other is only two chapters so far, and only one of them posted, here's the link to that one:

        Just got around to reading that... soft, but you very much have my attention! I love it. :D

        (besides, it's not necessarily a flaw, it's a *challenge*. Plus so is Three Worlds Collide, so you're in good company)
        ```

        - u/Sagebrysh:

          For a sort of backstory on how the idea came about, check out this post:

          https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3onk74/looking_for_a_coauthor_to_help_write_and_publish/

          I've since sort of relaxed my stance on how I'm going to present the work, and really I just want to make a piece of writing that people can really enjoy and learn from.
          ```

- u/narfanator:
  ```
  I have a few ideas bouncing around my head, for original-but-inspired-by fiction. One thing I'm having trouble deciding is the type of story to go after - particularly, whether or not to aim for young adult, and then, what that means. YA novels have particular plot structures and archetypes (I think, basing this off HP, Hunger Games, Maze Runner, and that other one with four ~~houses~~ I mean groups set in a semi-apocalypse future). Or maybe there's something to be taken from Name of the Wind, Lies of Locke Lamore,  etc?

  I guess there's the possibility for a deeper question here - what are classic plot structures, and how to do they respond to rational'ing?
  ```

  - u/ArmokGoB:
    ```
    Just focus on writing what you'd want to read, and forget about target demographics and trying to fit into categories. Take inspiration from things, but don't follow them like rules.
    ```

    - u/narfanator:
      ```
      Well... yes. But the idea here was that I wanted to think a lot about what might have made these stories so successful - aka, what made them tick and be found compelling - so that yes, I could inspiration from them.

  I've been trying to write an HPMOR fanfic for nearly a year now, but never get anywhere due to writer's block.
  ```

  - u/boomfarmer:
    ```
    Same, really. I need to reread HPMOR while taking notes on themes and plot arcs, and then do the same thing to A Certain Show, and then map the two together, and write some other stuff to get back in the hang of writing fiction, and then I need to set the world on fire before drafting and looking for a beta and eventually publishing.

    Also getting a domain name not tied to my real name, and hosting for that. And probably a ffn account.
    ```

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      > Also getting a domain name not tied to my real name, and hosting for that

      Don't bother.  Just sign up for a Tumblr account, or host the files out of your Dropbox account; the links are sufficiently anonymous.  You can always get the domain later and move things over.

      Don't let the best be the enemy of the good.
      ```

      - u/boomfarmer:
        ```
        > Don't let the best be the enemy of the good.

        Ah, thanks. Now my problem is getting a second Tumblr account, since my primary is semi-personal and there's no way to have two "primary" Tumblr accounts under one email address.
        ```

        - u/eaglejarl:
          ```
          Doesn't have to be Tumblr.  Try wordpress.com or blogger.com or livejournal.com or dreamwidth.com or....
          ```

    - u/boomfarmer:
      ```
      Logistics.
      ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      > and then do the same thing to A Certain Show

      *A Certain Magical Index*?

      >Also getting a domain name not tied to my real name, and hosting for that.

      Yeah...
      ```

      - u/boomfarmer:
        ```
        No, I am not doing *A Certain Magical Index* or *A Certain Scientific Railgun*.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          Well, I hope you realize that if the show in question is not actually titled "A Certain ...", then you've given barely any information of what show it is, so I can either netstalk your reddit account to see which fandoms you like (uhhhh... fursuits at church?  what?), or you can tell the rest of the class, or I can go ahead and mentally record it as being My Little Pony (because huehuehuehehuehue).
          ```

          - u/boomfarmer:
            ```
            Well, if you're going to netstalk, look in /r/HPMOR about 6 months ago, and don't share your answers with the class.
            ```

    - u/ArmokGoB:
      ```
      what show? (answer in PM)
      ```

  - u/IomKg:
    ```
    sounds to me like you are trying to achieve too high a level so you just stop before you get anywhere..
    ```

    - u/Uncaffeinated:
      ```
      I know I need to just get over my perfectionism and force myself to write, but I just can't seem to. I've tried several times.
      ```

  - u/ArmokGoB:
    ```
    What's the divergence point and what's the twist/take?
    ```

- u/JackStargazer:
  ```
  I have an SI story I'm working on, which as yet is a paltry 2k words, but which I have storyboarded out in broad strokes to novel length. 

  It's based on a gaming world, and so it will be a combination of original content based on that world and published setting information. Having someone to beta read and help with in setting worldbuilding would definitely help with Book 1, which is set entirely withing that game's world.
