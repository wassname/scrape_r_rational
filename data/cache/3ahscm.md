## [DC][WIP] Catalysis

### Post:

An AU Fullmetal Alchemist fanfiction where Ed does the impossible and resurrects his mother, but pays a steeper price then he could have predicted.

I wouldn't call it rationalist, per se, but I'd recommend it regardless. it spends a lot of time on exploring the politics and plots of Amestris, and on deconstructing the big picture of the setting: Hohenheim, Father, and Truth.

  I think you forgot to link to the fic. Is [this](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5141657/1/Catalysis) what you're talking about?
