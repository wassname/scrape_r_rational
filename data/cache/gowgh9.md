  One big question that I feel is unanswered by this post is *why* to post serial fiction; this submission contains some discussion of what types of stories seem best-suited to serial fiction, but I think there's also an interesting conversation to be had around which types of *authors* are best-suited to publishing serial fiction.  I think one of the biggest reasons for publishing serial fiction is that getting feedback can be tremendously motivating: writing a 100k word novel in private can be a daunting task, and getting to stop every 2k words or show to share your creation with the world and get words of encouragement can make the journey feel less strenuous. (Some people will also be less likely to abandon a project if they know that an audience is eagerly awaiting the next installment.) On the other hand, not all comments will be positive, and sometimes the feedback can be discouraging, especially for authors who have a disposition that is inclined to pay more attention to negative feedback than positive feedback. (For some, knowing that an "eager audience" is awaiting the next installment can also lead to a sort of performance anxiety.)  For authors who want to get the motivating effect of positive feedback without the discouragement of negative feedback, one option is just to ignore comments entirely, and simply bask in the glow of the upvotes/likes/kudos and watch as your follower count goes up.  (Royal Road might be the most hazardous in this respect, since it doesn't have "upvotes," and instead opts for a 5-star rating system, which aggregates negative as well as positive ratings from users.)

  I'd add that one of the more popular methods for monetizing fiction is Kindle Unlimited, which is generally more attractive to Kindle readers since it allows them to read a story (while financially supporting the author) at no marginal cost.  For people who are already in the Kindle Unlimited system, "buy my ebook for $4" is a much bigger ask than "read for free with your existing KU subscription."

  The issue, however, is that Kindle Unlimited demands exclusivity for as long as the story remains on KU, with a 90-day minimum contract, which means that if you've been publicly posting a story as a web serial, you need to take it down from wherever you've been posting it (sans the first 10%, which can be publicly posted as a "reading sample").  The consequence of this is that many story pages on sites like Royal Road are hollowed-out shells consisting of just a few chapters plus a link to Kindle Unlimited ([example 1](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/9000/digital-me), [example 2](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25461/haven-chronicles-book-one-eldritch-knight))

    I can definitely add that one, but I think it's fairly personal, and harder to just answer with an FAQ. I mean, I can sum up the reasons that people have given, along with pros and cons of the medium, but it would be more by way of telling people what they can expect out of writing, rather than giving them a reason.

    (There are also two different aspects to it, one being "self-publishing online" and the other being "publishing serially", since serial webfic consists of two overlapping categories.)

    edit: added

    > **Why would I write serial fiction?**

    > There are two components here. The first is writing serially, the second is publishing online.

    > The primary argument for writing serially is that you can get feedback as you go, improving the work as you do and avoiding some missteps. This is also one of the big drawbacks: editing is a godly power, allowing you to unmake mistakes, and you have less of that power if you're publishing as you go. Another plus side of serial publishing is that you can abandon things if they're not working out, and rather than investing the time and effort into writing a 100K word novel that no one reads, you can instead write five 2K word chapters that no one reads, then go back to the drawing board without a lot of wasted effort. The initial investment is much lower. (Though note that there's nothing stopping you from writing a full work, then releasing it serially.)

    > Further, you can get more interest and discussion by going serially, something that's very clear to see if you look at discussion for television shows that are released weekly when compared to those that are released one season at a time. A weekly series will have more discussion, theories, and conversations. A full season will have less, because there's less to talk about: the mysteries or conflicts set up at the start of the season will largely have been resolved. Writing a serial allows you to insert yourself into the rhythm of someone's consumption of media, staying in their head for much longer than you otherwise might.

    > Writing online is a different question entirely. The two biggest benefits are 1) the low barrier to entry and 2) immediate response. If you wanted to, you could put your novel up online right now with only a few clicks of some buttons. There would be no querying of agents, no rejection letters from publishers, no waiting for people to get back to you, no process, just the purity of your words being available to read. If that sounds attractive, then I should issue two words of caution. The first is that "immediate response" sometimes isn't: you can put things up online and watch them flounder, with no readers and no feedback. It's a terrible feeling. Second, if you publish online, you're destroying value to some future publisher. It's <em>extremely</em> rare that web fiction makes it to a "real" publisher, and it also kills value for self-published e-book versions of the story. A book that could have been polished and sold to a publisher might instead turn into something that will only ever languish online, without any advertising or marketing that would allow more people to read it. Maybe you don't care about that, but that's something that you should be aware of.

    > Putting those two together mostly amplifies the benefits and the drawbacks of each. Aside from short stories or flash fiction, writing an online serial is the lowest initial investment that you can make, with a disproportionate audience for that effort. If you really wanted to, you could spend the next two hours after reading this FAQ writing a first chapter of a serial, and have people reading it not long after that. You have the ability to increase "production value" just about as much as you have the time or interest, spending more effort on editing, or getting beta readers, or moving to your own website, but the floor of investment is as much time as that first chapter takes you to write and as much technical knowledge as you need to copy and paste text into an input box.

  >This means that as an author, you’re writing “ahead” and not getting any wide feedback until the “free” readers get to it. It also splits the community and risks spoilers.

  While I agree with the first point, some feedback is a double-edged sword. It is very easy to fall into the trap of having the characters refute the naysayers, especially when you find a stupid comment that a vocal minority seems to agree with, and that can hurt a story in the long run.

  On your second point, it very much depends on where your community is centered. In your case for example, you use discord, which is very much stream of thought and is closer to 4chan than reddit/your average forum. I haven't ever seen a spoiler for, say, delve, which is 10 chapters ahead and posted here weekly. Also never seen one in royal road, but that may be because I'm not brave enough to venture too deeply into that site's comment section.

  Still, if a story as big as practical guide to evil did early chapters, I suppose I could see spoilers being an issue even in reddit.

  Good post by the way, since this isn't far from web serial: the subreddit, it should probably be somewhere in the wiki. A lot of us are tempted to write something, I think.

    I posted spoilers for delve a few weeks ago. I spoiler tagged it, and it fit into a discussion. But yeah, spoilers do get posted.

  Ooh great timing! It feels like there's been several new serials in the sub, with the writers being relatively new to serials. This FAQ is probably the most concise one I've come across so far. For anyone interested, other serial authors have also shared their thoughts on writing web serials, and while there are a lot of common threads, there's a bit of YMMV and anthropic principle. Links: Wildbow's [thoughts](https://wildbow.wordpress.com/2017/05/22/thoughts-on-writing-serials/), pirateaba's [writing FAQ](https://wanderinginn.com/writing-faqs/), Rationally Writing [podcast](https://anchor.fm/rationally-writing) (Ep 16+17 Serial Fiction).

  Personally I think the web serial medium is a dark horse in the publishing scene. Many businesses are trending toward B2C (business-to-consumer direct) and to all appearances, the same applies to the serial scene (or self-publishers). However, this serial format is not for all authors. It requires a certain writing temperament and resilience: web serials have a low barrier to entry for writers, but the path to success seems like a very unforgiving grind.

  Good read. I'm not a writer myself, but from the reader side, I agree with all the points you brought up. 

  That said, I guess I never really considered any online author writing serial works aiming for profit. Maybe it's because I always saw any popular free to access content of any kind as starting as a passion project. The idea that a new author releasing online work would be thinking about profit at all seems overly ambitious to me. 

  Also, your thoughts on feedback reminds me of this [recent video from Game Maker's Toolkit about whether game developers should listen to negative feedback.](https://youtu.be/P05ONfLOqmY) I don't envy newcomer authors dealing with this part of writing. The temptation to give in to a strong vocal minority is a hard one to pass up, especially if you don't have a huge reader base to begin with.
