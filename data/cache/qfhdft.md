  Quick thoughts/half-baked review on *Dune*:

  - Everything in this film looks absolutely gorgeous. Set design, framing, cinematography, character design/makeup, is 150% My Aesthetic and scores so, *so* many points for me. I can confidently say it's worth watching just for the eye candy.

  - The soundtrack is okay-to-pretty-good, which means it's on the low end of Hans Zimmer scores. It's no *Interstellar*, that's for sure. There was this recurring [motif](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdtiYwSP9ko&t=288s) that I thought was used a *bit* too much. ...Maybe watching the [videos](https://youtu.be/AjEAnzF8iWU?t=122) about *Justice League*'s [ancient lamentation music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NU2uCJVsYMw) spoiled it for me.

  - I have to commend the pacing of the film; despite the first half being almost pure exposition, it never felt boring or slow, and the 2.5 hours flew by. I guess that's what happens when almost every shot looks like a wallpaper.

  - Having read the book, I was curious to see how Villeneuve would split the plot into two parts, because I thought it would be *very* difficult to pull off well. I think my guess was correct- the film just kind of ends abruptly. There's an 'I walk so you can fly' dynamic going on here with this film and its sequel. Most of the necessary exposition has been gotten out of the way, so fingers crossed that part 2 can come out swinging.

  - *Dune* has always been known as a tough book to adapt, what with its awkwardly sized plot (too big for a movie, not meaty enough for a television show), absolutely massive amounts of backstory and exposition, and reliance on internal monologues. Villeneuve addresses the plot size problem by making this two feature films, and the other two by... jamming the book's square-peg idiosyncrasies into round Hollywood-compliant holes. I understand why he changed the things he changed- they're much the same reasons as why Peter Jackson didn't include Tom Bombadil or the scouring of the Shire, but *Lord of the Rings* was absolutely massive and had lots of other stuff to fall back on. Does *Dune* have enough meat to survive removing the book's quirks that differentiated it from other sci-fi? We'll see.
  - Speaking of that, predictions: both parts (almost definitely going to get at least one more film to finish the first book, possibly a second to adapt *Dune Messiah*) will probably end up being Villeneuve's best-known/most commercially successful work... which isn't saying much. I think, if it's lucky, it'll end up having the same cultural impact 10 years down the road as say, James Cameron's *Avatar* (note cultural impact is different from box office performance). Certainly it won't stick in cultural milieu the same way *Inception* (whose title is now a colloquial suffix meaning meta) or the MCU (this generation's *Star Wars*) do. People hoping for the sci-fi version of *Lord of the Rings* will be disappointed, even if they think the film deserves that level of recognition.

  Summary:

  - Visuals 10/10 *yes*

  - Soundtrack 7.5/10 nothing too memorable

  - Acting 8.5/10 pretty good!

  - Plot: 7/10 actually nothing much happens in this movie

  - Worldbuilding 7/10 a step down from the books for sure

  - Overall 8/10

  - Recommended? Yes
  ```

  - u/Luonnoliehre:
    ```
    Pretty much agree with everything you said. It's a solid film, with surprisingly good pacing and well-adapted for people unfamiliar with the source material. 

    It's also only half a movie, with a lot hinging on how the sequel turns out. You can tell a lot of things were left out to sharpen the focus of the story, but that means that they will need to be addressed in Part 2. For now, Part 1 is an excellent introduction, but with an awkward structure that is a bit difficult to judge without knowing how the second half will be handled.

    > not meaty enough for a television show

    I'm confused by this take. I actually thought the Scifi miniseries adaptation was the best one up until this new movie (which I haven't seen yet). The show is highly regarded; it won several awards and is still ranked in the top three highest rated shows to be broadcast on that channel. Can you expand on why you don't think the show worked?

    To me, 45 minute to hour long episodes seems like the best way to get all the exposition, intrigue, and action in with decent pacing. Condensing things to movie format seems like it would cut at least 75% of the scenes and side-plots that make the book awesome. I'm honestly really confused about why you consider it less 'meaty' than *Lord of the Rings* which has a much more linear heroic journey plot.
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      Well that's the thing, Dune is exactly the right size for a miniseries. But miniseries are a hard thing to pitch in media. 

      The money & scheduling people want something that can run on a weekly basis for a full season, so at least 13 episodes. 

      Each episode has to fit in a 1 hour time slot, because 30 minute time slots are for kids shows and comedies. 

      You can maaaaybe run 20 minutes of ads and fixed content (intro, outro, recap) in a 1 hour slot before people get mad, so that's 13 * 40 minutes = ~8.5+ hours of content. 

      A perfect video adaptation of Dune would be, I dunno, somewhere around 4 - 6 hours? Which is too long for a single movie, but not quite long enough for a TV series. It's exactly miniseries length, but miniseries don't really fit particularly well into any of our monetization models.
      ```

      - u/chiruochiba:
        ```
        I'd understand your argument if we were having this conversation 10 years ago. However, these days Game of Thrones and other hugely successful shows have killed those ideas about runtime and monetization. Game of Thrones had 55 minute - 68 minute average runtimes for episodes from season to season. Episode lengths for well rated dramas seem to be getting longer on average. Furthermore, Netflix and other streaming services aren't constrained by those old advertising models. In fact, Netflix typically gives carte blanche for their shows to have any runtime the director wants.
        ```

        - u/IICVX:
          ```
          That's totally true, but none of those corporate entities own the rights to Dune. It's currently with Warner Brothers, who are not exactly known to be cutting edge.
          ```

          - u/chiruochiba:
            ```
            You make a good point.

        > A perfect video adaptation of Dune would be, I dunno, somewhere around 4 - 6 hours?

        For just *Dune*, maybe. But it seems to me that if you're going to do *Dune*, you want to do at least *Messiah* as well, and maybe some stuff from *Children* or *God-Emperor* to round stuff out. I think if you add a little more exposition and world-building to the first season (for example, I don't think anyone from the Navigators Guild appears in the movie at all), it's easy to get to eight episodes, which is okay for a HBO or Netflix series.

        And honestly that feels like the right way to do it to me. Watching the movie, it really feels like the first three episodes of a TV show (which is not to say I didn't like it, it was great). Episode one is setting the stage on Caladan (ends when they leave). Episode two is the arrival on Arrakis (ends with the first worm). Episode three is the attack and the flight into the desert.

  [Book of the Dead](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/47038/book-of-the-dead)

  Been enjoying this recently, only one update per week though - so its more something to keep on eye on. Standard LitRPG fare really, done with more thought, a grittier feel and an intelligent character. Also the general direction of the plot seems very compelling. Slow paced - mostly cause there is very few updates - but has multiple very good hooks to keep you interested. Also its in the setup stages really, so the pace might increase later on.

  I've been trying to start both The Two Year Emperor and The Perfect Run which I'd seen recommended in previous threads here but the writing quality (at least so far) is an impediment in both cases. Is there a point at which either improves or should I drop them if I'm not enjoying the early chapters?

      If you mean style in terms of tone, that's not what's bothering me. It's stuff like this (all from [Chapter 3](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36735/the-perfect-run/chapter/570503/3-men-of-honor?comments=8)):

      > “Twenty-five throwing knives, two revolvers, including one desert eagle


      The Desert Eagle is not a revolver; it's a gas-operated semi-automatic. Given what the author has previously told us about Quicksave's personal style it's not a gun he would be caught dead carrying either. (Leave that crap to  goobers who wear track suits to church.)
      > 
      > “You keep an A-bomb in your back pocket?” The guard wagged the device at Ryan’s face.
      > 
      > “It’s only for dissuasion!” the courier promised while crossing his fingers. “I Korea swear!”

      Deterrence, not dissuasion. Also, what is "Korea swear"?
      > 
      > “Your supervillain name is Zanbato, but you’re not Japanese?” Goddamn counterfeit.
      > 
      > “I’m not a supervillain,” the man protested, clearly missing the point. “My girlfriend is Korean though.”
      > 

      What does that have to do with being a supervillain? Is she Zainichi? Is it a callback to the "Korea swear" line? I have no idea.

      Anyway, I know the author is French so I was trying to give him a pass on his punctuation and word choice issues but then in the next chapter the main character somehow reaches Naples by traveling *north* from Rome and that's when I closed the tab.

          I think dissuasion actually was the author looking for the word and finding the wrong one. The rest of it stylistic though.
          ```

          - u/tomtan:
            ```
            That's more of a false friend issue, "dissuasion" is the correct word in French. "Dissuasion nucléaire" is the actual expression.

            For French native speakers it's very easy to get trapped into using words that originally come from French and not realise that the meaning is slightly different.
            ```

      - u/Luonnoliehre:
        ```
        "Korea swear" sounds like a North Korea joke, given the discussion of nuclear weapons.

        The Japanese discussion is pretty obvious. He is being called out for appropriating a Japanese name, but "misses the point" by saying he's not a supervillain. And then he defends his name by saying his girlfriend is Korean, which is supposed to be kinda pathetic and funny.

        I'm not sure why he mentions Naples, but having read most of the story I'm fairly certain they are not in Naples at all, they are just in the outskirts of New Rome or whatever.

        Actually, looking back now, the next line of dialogue is "Dynamis is building new docks in the south for freighters," so I think they are looking out into the distance.

        The humor is definitely a mix of weeb/gamer cringe, but the narrative and characters get much deeper than they first appear in the beginning.
        ```

      - u/MagmaDrago:
        ```
        Oh boy, you're most definitely not gonna have much fun with it. It has that sort of humor in spades.

        This type of humor also doesn't work for me (_maybe_ when binging, since I am in the same mindset, but most definitely not a scheduled chapter by chapter basis) although my eyes just glazed over them whenever (mostly) they didn't land. (It did rankle when they were sprinkled in serious moments since it totally took me out of the moment.)

        This type of style might have also been one of the reasons I just... didn't feel much of the emotional bits of the story, which sucked somewhat. 

        Shame though, I really liked and think it delivered pretty well on the plot and the game like feeling of going through multiple (sometimes totally divergent and non-plot necessary, but still somehow turn-out-to-be-helful) routes, collecting information in them to use in other routes, all in the name of getting the best route possible.
        ```

  - u/cthulhusleftnipple:
    ```
    I didn't like The Perfect Run much at the beginning, but pushed through because I was bored and it was recommended. The characters do get a bit more depth as it goes and their motivations get a bit more nuanced, but it never really changed from the story it appeared in the first few chapters. I ended up dropping it after reading a bit over halfway. If you don't like it now, I wouldn't bother pushing through. 

    The handwavey treatment of technical details also turned me off, and that only got worse as the book went on.
    ```

  - u/S_B_B_:
    ```
    Perfect Run gets better in terms of character, concept exploration and interesting conflicts. Not sure about writing quality. 

    It starts off reading very shallow and feeling like realism was sacrificed for wish fulfillment and humor (Which defiantly does happen at points.)

    It’s strength shows as we realize what an incredibly long time as a timer looper has done to the protagonist perspective on life. He is very aware of his odd coping devices and strange frame of reference. 

    Once you know him well enough to feel like you’re in on the joke it’s gets better. It also has some serious gut wrenchers so you viscerally feel the down sides of looping. 

    The author also does a great job having Quicksave’s objectives change so that there’s a reason he sticks around instead of solving the problem in a few loops and walking away.

That's a *shocking* level of quality consistency, so honestly - you give nice recommendations, internet strangers.

  Oh, and to remain on topic and actually make a recommendation, I just re-read The Game of Champions last week (which I also found on this subreddit years ago, probably thanks to u/DaystarEld), and I think it might be my favourite non-rational fanfiction.  It's abandoned, and while the author promised they'd release rough story outlines for the rest, it's been nearly two years since the last.  That said, I *still* think it's worth reading.

    Been off the deep end on Pokémon fics recently. Not sure why, but yeah. Haven’t picked TOoS back up yet, but have read lots of takes on the “realistic” raising of Pokémon. 



    Don’t love Ash fics at ALL. They all suck IMO 🤷🏼‍♂️. Don’t like any of the aura/stuff. Basically just competent Red or SI/OC’s in more realistic takes on Pokémon. Almost all in Kanto for some reason. 



    Really wish Borne of Caution went more “I raise Pokémon better than you because I was a zookeeper on Earth and understand being around dangerous creatures” and less “I raise Pokémon better than you because I can communicate with my vulpix”


    Maybe you can answer this one for me since you mentioned the author, but how does TOoS handle evolution again? It’s gradual? I couldn’t find the chapter where blue’s squirtle evolves into wartortle, or Red’s charmander evolution, but I was admittedly skimming. Are there any stone evolutions shown yet in the origin of species? Interested in how he handled that too.

      What are the best ones you read?  I haven't read a lot of the famous Pokemon fics, but I think my favourites were TGoC and Pokemon: The Line (also discontinued).  I loved parts of TOoS, but I depend a lot on character work, and after a while it started to feel kind of tiring.  I might pick it back up though, since it's been a long time and I might feel different now.

    [All Night Laundry](http://www.all-night-laundry.com/) is basically Homestuck-lite where the most clusterfuck-y 90% was cut out.

  Putting out a request for uplift stories (or failing that just reasonably rational stories) set in the warhammer fantasy setting, ideally using mechanics similar to those from 2nd edition. I've recently been included in a roleplaying game in the setting and while it feels like the setting should be ripe for "I'll drag you kicking and screaming into a better world", I'm just barely failing to see it. It's non trivial to optimize because the magic has a small chance of blowing the caster up on each spell and magic items(generated by exposing them to chaos) are very unpredictable.

      I love Neal Stephenson's stuff! I've had that on my list since it's something he wrote, but haven't made it through enough to read that one (I've got a huge to be read pile). Judging by the brief summary (I didn't want to look to deeply for fear of spoilers), I think it just got bumped up on the list. Thanks!

  The glowfic scholomance RP (https://glowfic.com/boards/203#section-671 ) is shaping up to be an interesting read… but like lots of glowfic it is rather high context, with the world building explained in bits and pieces across dozens of threads.

    >glowfic

    Could you explain what glowfic is? The definitions I've found seem pretty vague; since Alicorn seems to be involved, does it have to do with Twilight (Luminosity) stuff? 

    Also, does this have anything to do with the WoW dungeon, [Scholomance](https://classic.wowhead.com/scholomance)? Going to guess no, as looking it up online [refers to a Romanian school of black magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholomance), which was almost certainly the basis for the WoW version, haha.
    ```

    - u/scruiser:
      ```
      Glowfic are collaborative free form roleplay, typically with two people.  Some common tropes include portal fantasy type plots, because it allows author to describe a setting and role-play side characters while the other author describes and roleplays a main character.  The original classic glowfic was Efflugence, which featured iterations and variations of Isabella Swab with Alicorn role-playing them and another author (Kappa I think?)… I don’t actually like Efflugence that much, it’s a bit too slow paced and the high power level drains the plot of any tension or suspense.  I like the Silmaril settings better… they feature various alts of Bella encountering different variations of Lintamande’s take on the Silmarillion setting (1st age Middle Earth).  For example, a Bella that is also a version of MCU’s Loki lands in the elves right after they cross the ice and helps them in the war against Melkor.  In another set of stories a Bella from a high-magic but anti-science universe, who has trained to be psychic therapist, lands in Valinor prior to the death of Feanor’s mother.

      The latest glowfic setting, Scholomance, is a massive collaboration, with almost every glowfic author writing multiple characters going to a school of magic in a grim dark urban fantasy setting where most magical kids don’t survive to adulthood because centuries of magical experimentation byproducts has led to ultra-hostile and aggressive magical creatures that all eat magical children.  The school is in an isolated pocket dimension to protect the kids, but even that isolation isn’t enough to stop a regular stream of smaller but still lethally dangerous magical predators and parasites from slipping in.  And the teleportation to the pocket dimension has a hard weight limit that leaves all the kids optimizing the supplies they bring.  And the only way of exiting is infested with bigger magical creatures to the point that “graduation” kills about half the students that even survive that long.  So grimdark, but alts of Isabella and other glowfic characters are working to fix… if they can survive the school.

    I feel like the world building is scattered not because it's high-context but because it's fanfiction for [an existing work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Deadly_Education) that everyone involved has read. I assume if you read it, everything will make sense.

    (That being said, I have it from a second source named Sanjoy Mahajan that some characters are going to be *really* disappointed when they find out what Street-Fighting Mathematics is.)

    The Laundry Files.

    Fun little tidbit: magic is incredibly dangerous in this universe since using it opens microscopic wormholes in the user’s brain that lets in microscopic Cthulhu monsters. They eat your brain and cause debilitating magic MS/Dementia. To get around this people either become warlocks or they use computers to perform the spells for them. All magic is basically the act of performing esoteric mathematics so all users are either batshit insane or computer science nerds.

  As always Onwards to Provedence is highly recommended as excellent xenofiction and some of the best sci-fi worldbuilding I've ever read as well as many other works by Nighzmarquls.

  AVAUNT isn't as complex or deep, which isn't saying much but it is fun, cool, disregards normal fantasy tropes and has a very nice portrayal of sufficiently advanced magic without being just retextured sci-fi ideas

    Been a few years since I last caught up on it, but I mostly enjoyed [With This Ring (Young Justice SI)](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-fourteen.8938/). The author courts a lot of drama though, and has moved forums several times. He also holds some anti-trans views, though his forum comments/elaborations are more offensive than what he put in the written material (at least as of a few years ago, when last I read it). If you can overlook that, you'll probably enjoy the series. I knew a lot more of the Marvel universe than the DC universe going in, but it brings in stuff from all over and makes it pretty interesting.

  A while back someone was talking about Superworld, and how there are 3 types of non-magic characters in a magic setting:

  * Hidden talent / later turns out to have magic
  * Anti magic
  * Batman Prep

  There were a lot of examples for the first two, but comparatively fewer for the third. I'm looking for the third category. The only example I can think of is [MHA: World's Finest](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/mha-worlds-finest-bnhaxbatman-complete.868273/), which literally has Batman transported to My Hero Academia world, and he still manages to be a badass with just peak human abilities.
  ```

  - u/gramineous:
    ```
    You missed the fourth one, Bullshitting.

    One example is Superworld, that someone recommended two weeks back, which is apparently about a guy pretending to be clairvoyant in a world where everyone except him has superpowers. I haven't read it though so I don't know if it will flip to the first one or something.

    The other example would be the side character King from One Punch Man. He's widely believed to be the strongest man in the world, because he looks scary and happened to end up standing over the bodies of powerful monsters that were recently defeated, with no one contesting the credit and no survivors or eye witnesses to claim otherwise, and people just assumed he was responsible (and he's too much of a coward to correct them). The closest thing he has to a superpower is an amazing poker face, or arguably a lot of luck to not have been killed yet somehow.
    ```

    - u/TyeJoKing:

      The comment mentions Superworld, so I assume they're aware of it. I think the protagonist comes partially under Batman Prep, with a healthy dose of other people covering for him.

    *Steelheart* (By Brandon Sanderson) and its sequels is set in a world where people with superpowers are universally evil, and follows a (nonpowered) crew of resistance fighters trying to assassinate the worst offenders by using planning, research, and a *tiny* bit of super tech.

    There's a secondary character in [The Dark Wizard of Donkerk](https://alexanderwales.com/darkWizardNaNo2015.html), an inquisitor-type Knight who goes around in magic armor that allows him to go toe-to-toe with people using dark magic.
    ```

    - u/chiruochiba:
      ```
      Does that count as "Batman Prep"? He gets his powers (many of which are personal, not attached to his armor) from maintaining an extremely rigid ascetic code of conduct, following in the footsteps of the countless other members of his faith who have done the same. He doesn't engage in the creative forethought that seems to characterize "Batman Prep".

    * Hidden talent/later turns out to have magic/gains magic through unconventional means
    * Anti-Magic. Sometimes overlap with above.
    * Badass Normal. Usually extremely Smart/Skilled/Sociable. Batman Prep falls under this. Not too many of these stories because it's difficult to write.
    * Any sufficiently advanced power system that is technically not magic. This applies to science taken to the extreme. (Lots of examples of this one.) This applies to strength/muscles taken to the extreme. (Mashle.) This applies to will taken to the extreme. (Gurren fanfics). Most common in cross-over stories.
    * Bullshitting/Lucky Protagonist. Almost exclusively comedic stories. Usually they do end up getting magic anyways.

  I recently discovered Horizon: Zero Dawn and while the game itself is not rational and a-okay at most, I really liked the premise of >!self-replicating machines destroying civilization and making Earth uninhabitable.  An ai being left in charge of brute forcing the shutdown code, terraforming earth and then restarting civilization via cloning. Due to mistakes and bad judgement the humans are stuck pre-industrial level and scavenge the terraforming process. The PC is the clone of the main person behind the project.!<


  Does anyone have recommendations for a rational/adjacent fanfiction or an original work with similar themes? Only one I am aware of which sort of fits is [12 Miles below](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/42367/12-miles-below)(Which I would recommend by the way).

    Hated that game, felt like generic open world busywork. Hate those, maybe if I had played it when that was a new concept.. The lore is kind of cool, but it also makes no sense that the AI would make little animal robots and robot dinos. 

    &#x200B;

    If an AI made terraforming machines they'd be optimal and simple, robot rumbas maybe, not this complex articulated fantasy stuff that serves no purpose other than looking cool.

    &#x200B;

    For post apocalyptic civilization collapsed but recovered up until pre industrial levels I'd recommend Mark Lawrence. Book of ancestor for a more interplanetary alien feel, and the prince of thorns for future earth.

        Yeah, that game really shines in the lore building/plot. Everything else was basically a vehicle to deliver the story in my opinion. I agree that the gameplay was sort of generic (although still fun), but man did I love the story and plot. If you didn't make sure to get all of the old video recordings/clues about the past, you would end up missing a big part of what made the game great.

  Been enjoying [The Weirkey Chronicles](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35660/the-weirkey-chronicles) and the author has just started posting a chapters of the 4th book.  The writing is solid the characters tend to do well following their own motives. It is a cultivation story that puts a new spin on what it means to build your foundations. It takes place across the 9 worlds and they each have their own environment and cultures which helps shapes the characters and colors their interactions. It is also hinted at that the there is a larger overarching plot that would explaining why things seem to happen around the MC all the time but if or how that payoff will happen isn't known yet.
