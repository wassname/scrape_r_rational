  > Jaune sighed. "Well," he said, looking between the three girls. "Which route seems best?"

  Dying
  ```

  - u/ThatDarnSJDoubleW:
    ```
    I think dying's the Salem route, actually. Not unlocked yet.
    ```

  - u/ArisKatsaris:
    ```
    LOL, I hadn't gotten that!
    ```

- u/CoronaPollentia:
  ```
  >!Oh dear. That's one take on Ozpin. His "reincarnation" does look more like bodyjacking from a certain angle, with a side of manipulation to convince the new host that their gradual dissolution and replacement in their own body is a good thing.!<
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I like it because it's pretty safely on the "probably acceptable under the circumstances but fucking terrifying" side of the utilitarian horror spectrum.
    ```

  - u/causalchain:
    ```
    Perhaps a spoiler tag would be appropriate for people who haven't seen original rwby.
    ```

- u/KarlitoHomes:
  ```
  I was going to say "watch out for Shoggoths", but something human is undoubtedly more dangerous.
  ```

- u/ThatDarnSJDoubleW:
  ```
  I've got to wonder...

  With the Grimm so much more dangerous in this world, what does rational Salem look like?
  ```

- u/xamueljones:
  ```
  Whelp! Looks like mystery stranger is dying in the next chapter.

  Speaking up from behind an uneasy hunter-in-training with a twitchy trigger finger and inhuman reflexes in a previously empty room is not very good for your health.
  ```

  - u/GeneralExtension:
    ```
    So here's a question: how close could you be to Ruby and she'd still have time to 1) Shoot you, 2) activate her semblance, and 3) block her shot or move you out of the way in time? And is Ruby far enough away from Pyrrha that she can use her semblance?
    ```

- u/Charlie___:
  ```
  And then they all died of carbon monoxide poisoning.
  ```

- u/GeneralExtension:
  ```
  Does this chapter have spoilers for RWBY?
  ```

  - u/tjhance:
    ```
    It alludes to something which is not revealed until vol 4 of RWBY.

    The allusion is rather cryptic if you don't know what it is, but I'm guessing we'll be learning more about it soon in upcoming chapters.
    ```
