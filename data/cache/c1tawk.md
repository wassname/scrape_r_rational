  Prediction: >!The Tyrant is going to put on the crown and sacrifice himself.  Tyrant arranged all of this, with the Bard's help, to give himself a deathbed redemption arc.  This was his plan all along: to do as much evil as possible, and then end it all with betraying Below by getting redeemed.  After all, he was on borrowed time the whole way, and he gets to dodge being sent to one of the Hells.!<
  ```

    ```
    Love it, except for the fact that in this setting, by my recollection, the Hells don't function as repositories for deceased souls, be they good or evil.
    ```

    - u/greiskul:
      ```
      Yeah, why would there be entire nations devoted to Evil if it guaranted a place in a hell?
      ```

    - u/LordSwedish:
      ```
      When they talk about Triumphant and why they say “may she never return” they mention that it’s a distinct possibility that she would return. This is because she died at the same time as most of her legions and with access to her legions she might have conquered a hell.
      ```

      - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
        ```
        Robber said it, not anyone of particular truth-telling or awareness.

        Also, if the Hells held uncountable souls available as a power source, do you really think Praes wouldn't have tapped it as an infinite power source?
        ```

        - u/Frommerman:
          ```
          It might be really hard to draw energy across the barrier. After all, a Greater Breach is considered such a marvelous achievement that it's only happened twice, and Lesser Breaches appear to cost a ton of energy.
          ```

      - u/SeekingImmortality:
        ```
        Guess I need to reread that section.  I don't remember that she -died- so much as simply ended up in one of the hells for one reason or another.
        ```

  - u/PastafarianGames:
    ```
    Truly the ultimate betrayal!
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Agreed, but with his deathbed redemption allowing for a resurrection

  From the comments:

  > “This thing all things devours: birds, beasts, trees, flowers; Gnaws iron, bites steel; grinds hard stones to meal; Slays king, ruins town, And beats sword-wielding bitch down.”

  >> Rumena?

  Brilliant.
  ```

- u/DaystarEld:
  ```
  Huh. So Cat aged them both by 11 years (12?), or aged everyone in "this broken realm?" Because that would probably come close to killing Pilgrim too, so I'm guessing it's just Saint, but then why would Cat be touched by it too? Maybe it's a required sacrifice for such a powerful prayer.

  Still, very cool solution. Also interesting implications about what she is, now, if she's mortal but still somewhat resistant to aging.
  ```

  - u/BaggyOz:
    ```
    The Night surrounded both of them and its the Night that gave rise to the effect. Plus the self sacrifice bit always helps when it comes to story.
    ```

  - u/anenymouse:
    ```
    I'm not sure there's that much evidence to support her being somewhat resistant to aging. In the first chapter she's noted to be close to 16, i mean as close to any age as an infant put into an orphanage can be said to be with any certainty, and i don't think we get any explicit mentions of her birthday/s but time has passed. I'd say that the very least she's in her late teens and oldest is maybe mid twenties and from there another eleven years puts her in her thirties generously. And while her thirties isn't the most youthful she could be it's by no means completely out of the question for her to be well in fighting shape if nothing else.
    ```

    - u/Baam3211:
      ```
      As some of the comments mentioned the dead king said she would age slowly so 11years feel light to her.
      ```

      - u/anenymouse:
        ```
        I'm unsure that it's actually lighter and that it's just in comparison to her past experiences that aging eleven years just wasn't as painful as say her necromancer-ing her own leg, or losing an aspect, or you know the multiple times she ended up dying?
        ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      I meant resistant to aging *now,* as the Dead King suggested.
      ```

      - u/anenymouse:
        ```
        But narratively speaking there's a lot of difference between say lighting both yourself and your target on fire if you are fireproof, like i'm not sure that it matters completely given it's coming from the Night which isn't likely to have like an equivalent exchange built into it. Or at least any more than any other large expenditure of power.
        ```

        - u/Iconochasm:
          ```
          You get at least partial credit if you genuinely don't know you are fireproof.
          ```

        - u/LordSwedish:
          ```
          But she’s a villain in direct service to immortal gods with immortal servants. While it’s possible that she might age (assuming her past as an immortal doesn't contribute) she won’t ever suffer the consequences of it in the same way as heroes would.
          ```

    - u/Mountebank:
      ```
      Aren't Villlains resistant to aging in general?
      ```

      - u/hayshed:
        ```
        Named villains don't age while Named heroes do, though they tend to age gracefully. Not sure how that rule applies to Cat since she doesn't have a Name.
        ```

      - u/UPBOAT_FORTRESS_2:
        ```
        Most Named don't have to cut their hair, their bodies more or less fixed by their role
        ```

    - u/NZPIEFACE:
      ```
      She's 21 by my last count. Though I'm a shitty counter.

      Congrats, we have christmas cake Cat now.
      ```

      - u/anenymouse:
        ```
        Do we know if she was aging while she was the Squire? I can't recall offhand if we get anything more than the semi-frequent mentions of her being shorter and less impressive than people expect of her, I'm not sure how easily we can gauge her age in uhh not absolute terms but in physical aging if that's close enough to get my point across.
        ```

        - u/Amagineer:
          ```
          There was definitely mention of Name-flavoured aging, i.e. changes driven by self image, while she was the Squire. However, I'm pretty sure she was pretty static when she was a Winter-thing for a while.

          /u/LilietB made [a good post about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/PracticalGuideToEvil/comments/bsz8b6) over on /r/PracticalGuideToEvil

      - u/Schuano:
        ```
        Becoming 32 isn't that bad.
        ```

- u/MultipartiteMind:
  ```
  Right...  it's that Below offers protection against that (which Cat presumably doesn't get right now because she doesn't have a normal Name?) ('live until we're killed'), but Above doesn't?

  &#x200B;

  Incidentally, from earlier:

  &#x200B;

  “Evil clawing at itself,” the Saint bitingly said. “There’s a surprise.”

  &#x200B;

  Good clawing at itself.  There's a surprise.  <laughs>
  ```

  - u/signspace13:
    ```
    Cat's protection against it is just rather different, whether she will naturally age at all while the high priestess of night is in doubt, but a miracle like this would likely hit a villain just as hard, though it might invoke a direct clash between the sisters and the GB so maybe not. Her aging here is likely more of a price than a sign of her actually aging naturally otherwise.
    ```

  - u/ProfessorPhi:
    ```
    The drow don't seem to age either, see rumena and Jindrich. Maybe the Night gives her protection too.
    ```

- u/NZPIEFACE:
  ```
  I realized why we don't like Saint.

  She's trying to dictate the results of lives she has no real right to, both from our point of view, and everyone in the story's. Her voice is an opinion, a pretty valid one from the good guy's PoV, but still, she's been forcing her way with things that she never should have.
  ```

  - u/HPMOR_fan:
    ```
    Mostly/only the Pilgrim has kept her in check, but he lost his right to rule.
    ```

    - u/Flashbunny:
      ```
      > he lost his right to rule.

      I never thought of it that way! There's more than one way to rule...
      ```

    - u/NZPIEFACE:
      ```
      I mean, ever since she was first introduced, she's had opinions of things she probably really shouldn't be influencing.

      The big one I'm talking about is 'letting Northern Procer die so that Good can eventually win'.
      ```

  - u/CaseyAshford:
    ```
    Isn't that basically what everyone with any power tries to do? Disliking someone because they try to use their power to make the world a better place by preventing the rise of a massive threat seems a bit silly. Why would it make sense for her to respect the "right" of villains to forge a terrible new threat that could end up causing harm on a massive scale.

    This perspective seems particularly hypocritical given that Catherine has been trying to do the exact same thing on a vastly greater scale in her self-assigned role as Savior of Callow. What "right" does she have to commit horrific crimes in the pursuit of her vision for Callow?
    ```

    - u/werafdsaew:
      ```
      Let's not forget that she's also gambling with the lives of most people in Iserre.
      ```

  - u/Kaiern9:
    ```
    We dislike her because we know that Cat isn't like all the other villains Saint has encountered. We know she's making a mistake by acting the way she is.
    ```

- u/AStartlingStatement:
  ```
  - prop up Saint's corpse 
  - Archer holds crown over Saint's head
  - Pilgrim casts resurrect 
  - Saint's eyes flutter open 
  - Archer jams kill-crown on head
  ```

  - u/PastafarianGames:
    ```
    Pilgrim can't resurrect Saint. A: there isn't time before the shard collapses all over Iserre, and B: it doesn't work against deaths from old age.
    ```

    - u/Halinn:
      ```
      Counterpoint - it would be funny.
      ```

    - u/AStartlingStatement:
      ```
      I feel like "she died of old age" is kind of stretching it. Like if you cast a spell on someone so time sped up and their heart gave out and then you shake your head sadly and say "His heart just ran out of beats" I mean yes it would literally be true it's also because you made them use up 200 million beats. 

      What I'm saying is if I was an genie forced to settle rules-lawyer disputes in this setting and someone said Saint can't be rezzed because she died of "natural causes" I think I might agree but I'd be making a really exasperated face.
      ```

  - u/Mountebank:
    ```
    Would this count as a natural death? Pilgrim can't reverse those.
    ```

- u/anenymouse:
  ```
  Having seen Saint in her last stand i could believe that she was potentially a threat or at least the closest thing they had to threatening the Dead King. Also loved using time as a weapon with a cost even if she was still mortal eleven years was a price that Cat could pay much more easily than Pilgrim or Saint, and at the same time almost worthless against the Dead King or most of her other potential problems like White Knight. 

  &#x200B;

  But at the same time it's hard to say if that last time play was a realm thing or if everything got shifted forward the latter leaves kind of huge problems with Vivienne and Hakram in charge of Callow for probably too long, but even the former potentially has a lot of backlash it's uncertain that Pilgrim would be able to survive it. Also who the heck is going to wear the crown? My money is Pilgrim cause that's easily the way that screws over Cat the most.
  ```

  - u/ATRDCI:
    ```
    The time passing prayer only affected Cat and Saint, and time didn't pass outside of them.  Like in the Witch/Warlock fight when she used a contained passage of time to gutter out the goblinfire tornado
    ```
