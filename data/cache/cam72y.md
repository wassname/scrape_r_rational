## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I haven't read much manga the last few years, but I need a change of pace. If anyone has any suggestions for manga that started or became popular after 2010 or so, let me know!

  Rational works not required (though always appreciated, of course). I'm posting here 'cause most of y'all seem to appreciate good story telling. Any genre's fine, previous favorites, if it helps, include: HxH, One Piece, Yatsubato!, Bakuman, Oishii Kankei, Holyland, Katsu!, Black Cat, Aishita no Ousama, etc.
  ```

  - u/meterion:
    ```
    Here's a personal top-tier list, things I would absolutely recommend to anyone (can elaborate if needed):

    *Maoyuu Maou Yuusha - Kono Watashi no Mono Tonare, Yuusha yo Kotowaru!*  

    * Realistic exploration of what kind of realistic sociopolitical landscape would arise from a typical "humanity versus demons" JRPG plot, and what both the Hero and Villain try to do to resolve it.

    *Witch Hat Atelier*

    * Renaissance-era Swords n Sorcery semi-apocalyptic world where witches are a secretive tribe, the only known wielders of magic. Follows a young girl who gets mixed up in a plot far beyond her abilities, but very fluffy on the whole.

    *Mahoutsukai no Yome*

    * Urban fantasy involving a young girl with a ~mysterious power~ who gets bought in the underworld slave trade by a demon who isn't all he appears to be. Lots of variety in the mythos inspiring the world.

    *Dungeon Meshi*

    * D&D-inspired world with a bunch of races, magic, and dungeons! When things go terribly wrong for an adventuring party, they must delve deeper than they ever have, and understand the truth behind what dungeons are to rescue their friend.

    *Made in Abyss*

    * In a world not dissimilar from our own, there remains one wonder of the world untouched by man: The Abyss. There, things lurk beyond man's wildest imagination, and the treasures pulled at great cost from it are peerless in value. And for one young girl, the Abyss is where her mother lies, waiting for her. *(Warning: lots of loli/shotabait.)*

    *Helck*

    * The comedic story of a human hero who journeys to the demon world to... destroy all the humans? Experiences extreme genre shift into thriller-tragedy, and worth a read up to that point if the first part isn't so interesting..
    ```

      >  (Warning: lots of loli/shotabait.)

      I always laugh when people give warnings for made in abyss based on the loli/shotabait yet let the capital-s Suffering slide.
      ```

      - u/meterion:
        ```
        lol, I don’t disagree but it remains the biggest barrier to entry for normie-tier manga readers. Plus it’s better when the suffering sneaks up on ya.

    Disclaimer: I just started to read manga this year and use it to learn languages. I haven't read the ones you've listed. I was stuck in bed at the beginning of the year and was forced-read (that should be a word!) by my girlfriend. I now know what isekai or otaku means. A part of me died for this ;)

    Rationalist manga recommended on the sub many times: 

    - [The Promised Neverland](https://myanimelist.net/manga/100128/Yakusoku_no_Neverland)

    - [Battle in 5 seconds after meeting](https://myanimelist.net/manga/102690/Deatte_5-byou_de_Battle)

    Manga I haven't seen recommended here with rationalist elements (all rather slow paced):

    - [Drugstore Soliloquy](https://myanimelist.net/manga/107562/Kusuriya_no_Hitorigoto) - a young woman with knowledge of pharmacy is sold as a servant to the imperial court. She applies her expertise to much more than curing diseases. It's more interesting than I make it sound. 

    - [Accomplishments of the Duke's Daughter](https://myanimelist.net/manga/97579/Koushaku_Reijou_no_Tashinami) - an otome game devotee is reincarnated (overused trope alert) in a game as the antagonist. Yet, the manga doesn't become a trope avoidance type. Instead, the main heroin introduces concepts from her world to improve the lives of the citizens.

    - [Cesare: Hakai no Souzousha](https://myanimelist.net/manga/1067/Cesare__Hakai_no_Souzousha) - best described as: if Mario Puzo wrote manga. It's worth checking out for the art itself. Sometimes I just stare at the [Renaissance scenery](https://i.imgur.com/cbW5F0l.jpg) and marvel. It follows a naive student who befriends Cesare Borgia and learns how the world really works.

    Other favourites: [Liar Game](https://myanimelist.net/manga/1649/Liar_Game) [RST], [Hikaru no Go](https://myanimelist.net/manga/20/Hikaru_no_Go) [RSTish], [Qualia the Purple](https://myanimelist.net/manga/51493/Murasakiiro_no_Qualia), [I sold my life for ten thousand yen per year](https://myanimelist.net/manga/100448/Jumyou_wo_Kaitotte_Moratta_Ichinen_ni_Tsuki_Ichimanen_de), [2001 Nights](https://myanimelist.net/manga/67/2001-ya_Monogatari).

      Thanks for the recommendations :) I have a couple of those on my to-read list as light novels, which probably isn't that surprising.

    "So I'm a spider, so what?" is absolutely amazing, it's actually told from a perspective of a spider, as the title may suggest. And I think it's done very well.

  [Golden Treasure: The Great Green](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1065100/Golden_Treasure_The_Great_Green/)

  One of the better CYOAs I have seen in some time. I just loved it.. From the worldbuilding behind the dragons, to each hand painted scene. Playing as a genuinely nonhuman character.. The mystery of human tribes emerging from the departed advanced civilization and their tech.. And well, being a *dragon*. I wish the death mechanics were less punishing and hunting can get tedious in the beginning.. But other than that I'm in my first playthrough and there is still much to explore. I went the compassion route, and in the next one I'm going full wisdom and focus on the mystery of the tech of the others.

  So I’ve seen [Heretical Edge](https://ceruleanscrawling.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/) recommended here a few times, and a few arcs in it doesn’t look at all rational to me. I’d envision the Heretics to have more interaction with the normal one even if the muggles can’t remember it, maybe disguising those teleportation mirrors as powerful technology or something. I had good feelings about this story when the students were all given magic cockroaches and told to kill them for power, but this is never taken to its logical extent. Why aren’t there super powerful hunters going out and caging powerful Strangers so that you can have the students whack a bunch of them assembly-line style? The story explicitly shows that you only need to get the final hit. Also there’s no shown limit on how often the Heretical Edge can be used, why aren’t they getting as many people shoved in there as possible? More generally, the main character often just ... stands there while her team mates are getting wailed on. She’s supposed to be this experienced reporter who bluffs a drug lord into opening his safe. That opening was cool, and it promised good things; a hero-type who’s motivated to do the right thing and is unflappable in the face of danger. Except no, she then spends her time frozen while analyzing how her friends fight the Strangers for her, and then getting the totally-unearned final blow on a complete technicality. And no one takes issue with this. I mean, I’m glad the author didn’t go into teen drama territory, but someone questioning if that was actually fair and organizing the final blows so everyone gets roughly equal slices of power never happens. And the constant yelping gets annoying.

  Sorry, that was a whole lot of nitpicking. I dropped the story, but it’s not bad, especially if you can put aside the implications of the premise and just go along with the story.
  ```

  - u/Teulisch:
    ```
    I dropped it as well, but more because of the way the writing style was going. too many secrets that the reader is aware of, that dont get explained. too much forced combat-to-the-death too quickly. the pacing was wrong in a lot of ways. 

    why is it so many stories are about teenagers in life-or-death fights that are mandated by the school? "oh, you have powers? great, your conscripted to a military academy fight club!" and then of course they make the adults idiots who no kid is going to talk to. there is an entire genere of this.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      > why is it so many stories are about teenagers in life-or-death fights that are mandated by the school?

      The Watsonian reason is that, if you have a bunch of teenagers developing lethal powers, you absolutely are going to put them in a situation where they have to learn how to use them properly or die trying. It protects everyone else.

      The Doylist reason is because adolescence is the conceptual "hero's journey," and life-or-death struggles make a blatant framework for that. Ritualizing combat is a common metaphor for how kids feel as they're being shoved into a competitive social landscape.
      ```

  - u/Sonderjye:
    ```
    I agree with basically all of your criticism. The premise and setup for the world was really promising but it falls short on most rationality criteria. >!I agree that the lack of providing students carefully chosen monster powers on a regular basis is outright offensive, but the lack of kids from rich/powerful family who were fed choice powers from childhood makes me want to pull my hair out. !<

    >!I also remain unconvinced about the motivation to hide the mother research/Fossor/Ammon from the relevant authorities, as well as the weird denial of human/stranger children and their ability to go underneath the radar.!<

    How would you like to have the story go?
    ```

    - u/Lightwavers:
      ```
      At the least I’d like to see reasons why Heretics aren’t being made for maximum power and efficiency and the human world isn’t being given (even disguised) magic. Preferably though the story would go into full HPMOR territory, where either the school *wants* to uplift the regular world but can’t for some reason, or the school is a relic of the past that doesn’t even exist anymore because the Strangers won and the main character stumbles across the ruins and accidentally uses the Heretical Edge, becoming an instant target from every Stranger out there.
      ```

      - u/dinoseen:
        ```
        There are reasons later on for most of your problems. It would be a huge spoiler to reveal any of them though, since it's basically a huge conspiracy the story is centred around.
        ```

        - u/Lightwavers:
          ```
          Would you say those reasons hold up under scrutiny?
          ```

          - u/dinoseen:
            ```
            Definitely. Obviously not every little thing is going to be addressed, but what I feel are the major gripes definitely are IMO.

  - u/CreationBlues:

    I quit due to a couple reasons, one of them being that the mc is on a super secret, so secret explaining it spoils half the twists up to that point, station with a bunch of kids. MC's attending a class with the kids, and Super Bad Ass General Spy From All The Wars (seriously, explaining her backstory would spoil the other half of the twists up to this point), who's telling the class about some piece of history.

    Proceed MC to have a dialogue with this character, completely ignoring everyone else in this room, with no one batting an eyelash.

  Something I figured I'd ask about here and which is at least tangentially related to this sub's purpose.

        Not for older posts before the threadmark system, since TQ is locked it'll never get updated to use the system either.

        If you're not on mobile I've found then least intrusive way to read things without threadmarks is to open a new browser window and then open each chapter in it's own tab. You can then swap between chapters by using ctrl+page-up and ctl+page-down (assuming you're on Windows with Chrome).

      Or it's just helping with the 1950s vocabulary? My version is bilingual (French/English pages facing one another, with english vocab notes in the footer) and there were some English words in the notes that I didn't understand without reading the footnote!

      What I found unsettling is I was empathising with the "weird future" characters a lot - like the wife who panicked if her husband didn't tell her he was on the way home, that's the sort of thing that I do sometimes, but I think at the time the wife would be considered to be going way too far. Looks like we definitely do live in weirdtopia! 😂

        That’s fair, I just wouldn’t consider any of those words to really be “1950’s” words, if you get my drift. There’s no slang or cultural references (beyond the CRT being an outdated technology), just typical English test vocabulary. And yeah! That panic over not being to connect to everyone reminded me personally of parents who get anxious whenever their kids can’t be found with GPS location apps, either due to signal or deliberately putting it on airplane mode.

  I want to recommend [Magna Graecia: Titanomachia \(A City State Quest\)](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/magna-graecia-titanomachia-a-city-state-quest.55040/).

  It's about an alternative history where the citizens of the greek [polis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polis) of [Eretria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eretria) fled to southern Italy when their city is sacked by Persia. There they found a new city where [Bari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bari) is today. We're currently around 420 BC (so 70 years later).

  The audience in the thread play the citizens of the polis who vote on the policies that should be pursued. This means there is a much better connection between what is happening inside and outside the story than in other quests.

  This quest is not in any way specifically rational, but it is very well researched and very well run. Highly recommended, especially if you've never participated in a quest before. There is a hotly debated issue in almost every vote. (It's still extremely civil *for a quest*.)

  Harry Potter and the Secret of the Patronus.

  &#x200B;

  Why do I want to read it?  I started the story, and in the very first chapter, I see this gem:

  *The world isn't big enough for everyone to be young and immortal forever. Even after exhausting every esoteric and obscure form of magic known to Wizardry, there's simply not enough food and not enough space*

  &#x200B;

  This is utterly retarded and no intelligent character could conclude this.  Young != Reproductively Fertile.  *Obviously* if there was a mechanism to reverse aging and to make everyone presently alive their optimal biological self, anyone who wasn't an utter moron would put some limiters to at least *reduce* fertility temporarily until a longer term system is figured out.  Or, at least, if this was the objection and the alternative was to keep letting millions of people turn into corpses every single year.

  &#x200B;

  Sure, the rest of Harry's reasons make sense, but this one is so utterly stupid that I kind of haven't finished the first chapter.  Why should I keep reading?
  ```

  - u/KilotonDefenestrator:
    ```
    Besides, not enough food & space is solvable, *especially* if you have magic. 

    But even without magic, we could probably have an Earth population in the trillions at the cost of living in 200 story apartment complexes and eating food grown in vats, vertical farms or created from insect protein.  

    I'd rather do that than die though.
    ```

  - u/RedSheepCole:
    ```
    I haven't read the story, but real-world fertility limitation would be difficult to implement.  China had a hell of a time just restricting it to one child, and one child in a population of virtual immortals would increase the population by almost fifty percent every generation (depending on assumptions concerning pair bonding, heterosexuality, murder and accident rates, etc.).  People have kids for a number of reasons.  Poor people who can't find a way to improve their status, and who you'd think would be strongly motivated to live within their means, don't.  It's not, from what I understand, a matter of not knowing about birth control, or lacking access to it; it's just that if you're stuck doing miserable unfulfilling work, living in a dump, and being regarded as a loser, having a kid can seem like your one shot at happiness.

    &#x200B;

    Even if you eliminate that as a consideration thanks to magical post-scarcity and perfect social engineering, the desire to have and raise a family is very deep-rooted, by both tradition and biology.  A population that doesn't suffer natural death would have to have very close to no kids whatever.  As conceiving children is extremely easy for most people, and perpetually young people would have perpetually young libidos, you'd need, I guess, drastic alterations of human nature, or something like a police state.  Actually, just the second one, because you'd need a police state to enforce extreme mods of human physiology and behavior.  Or so I think.
    ```

    - u/Izeinwinter:
      ```
      Try following the math of a one child + absolute immortality policy to the end. 
      Because the result is *not* an infinite population. This is entirely classical Xenos paradox - the total population will end up being twice what you started with minus one (and the unlucky person who makes up the entirety of the final generation never gets to have a child because you cant have half a child)
      ```

    - u/Sonderjye:
      ```
      I got two main counterarguments.

      First, the  world wide birth rate have fallen from around 2.5 to 1.2(per person) over a 50 year period. This downwards trend seems to continue.

      Second, we just need a birth rate of less than 1 per person to never go above a finite maximum. If this is confusing look at geometric series. The birth rate in Europe is just short of 0.8 per person. Assuming that everyone lives forever and every new generation keeps the same birth rate, we will never become more than 5 times the number of people currently in Europe, not counting migration. That is a lot yes but solvable in the long term.
