## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  I'm taking this semester off from school to work on another startup and the difference in my experience this time is astounding. I love/hate it, it's total bullshit.

  As background, I've bootstrapped and operated kind of outside traditional institutions my entire life. 1st gen immigrant, absent but hard-working parents, didn't speak English on my first day of school, moved around every couple years, suspended 7x in middle school as a straight A student, never learned to rely on The Institution, etc etc.

  My first startup was right out of college and it was successful but so, so stifled. I hit 6-fig revenue within the first few months and then the banks hit. Each bank I used thought I was money laundering (I wasn't), because obviously some kid from flyover country could never achieve this legitimately, and closed my commercial *and* personal accounts, not even allowing me to present evidence otherwise. PayPal put an illegal 3-month freeze on my funds. Shit sucked. Took me months and months to find someone that would listen to me and graciously accept my business.

  This time is different though, because now I go to Harvard Law School. All the doors are open and fucking everyone is just throwing opportunities at me because of the institution I'm attached to. VCs want to talk, lawyers are happy to defer their fees indefinitely, everything is fucking great.

  I'm grateful, but I hate it. I'm the same person I was back then. It's infuriating that nobody bothered to give me a chance back then.

  I like that things are easier for me now, but fuck. I feel like I don't deserve this, y'know? I'm still me. Why couldn't you all see that years ago?

  Shit, I'm crying now. I should talk to my therapist about this.

    It's not that you don't deserve it now, it's that you deserved it back then too!

    I remember your post from years ago when you were accepted to Harvard. You explicitly stated there that you wanted the status boost from it. So sounds to me like you magnificiently achieved your goals! Congrats!

    Congratulations and go talk to somebody. I think it helps when dealing with large institutions you can't control but still need to interact with regularly.

      I will.

      Unrelated, but I love your writing.

    Shit's bullshit, definitely talk to someone, but also use those opportunities where they're presented. If you don't take 'em, someone shittier will!

    Free hug for you!

    Hahaha, wow, that's a crazy ride, and congrats! I'd say DGAF about "deserve". You've got it now man, have fun with it! World's not really a sensible place anyway.

    What were you suspended for? Also, congratulations!

      I don't remember every instance. 

      A couple times were for fights. 

      Once because I chugged a 2 liter of Coke at a school picnic for attention, couldn't keep it down, and threw up into a garbage can. 

      Once when my group in Art class was accused of drawing something offensive on the table. We hadn't done it, we supported each other's alibis, but I ended up getting singled out for personal questioning. During questioning I ended up saying something like, "I wanna die." Boom, 2-day suspension.

      The school admin in charge of discipline had it in for me and enjoyed making me cry, I think.

    Based on entirely fictional evidence (so take it all with a grain of salt), there are two ways that this storyline tends to go; at least so far as I can think of.

    (a) The first option is where the Hero sees the doors being opened and the hands outstretched to help him out - and he turns away from all the institutions that rejected him the first time around. "I've seen what lies behind those empty smiles of yours," he says, "and I didn't like it." And then he finds some small out-of-the way institution which he's never interacted with before, and uses them instead.

    (b) "I have my chance," says the Hero, "and I will take it. But I remember when I almost lost it." He becomes a venture capitalist on his own, in the fullness of time (using the same institutions that wouldn't take him the first time around). And he takes on the cases that others would reject - he gives the chance he didn't get to other people in the same situation.
