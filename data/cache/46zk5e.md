## [D][Q][BST] So what do you like in your deconstruction?

### Post:

I've concluded there are parts of deconstruction I just can't do, or at least approaches that I fail pretty hard at. I'm much better at the whole "let's take this premise seriously and run with it" and much less at "lets do the opposite of these tropes/expectations".

What's other people's experiences or preferences?

  Deconstruction doesn't have to completely defy all of the  tropes, it can simply take the premise seriously and run it straight into a wall.

  "Take this premise seriously" is the important part of deconstruction. What matters is that logic, rather than narrative expediency, rules the day. This makes a lot of standard stories fall apart. Sometimes to the munchkin protagonist's advantage, but generally to everybody's dismay.

  My favorite deconstructions find the richer premise that had been hiding underneath the existing rules once the conventional premise has collapsed. That's a lot of the enjoyment in Watchmen and Game of Thrones. The adapted genre is so much more fun than the one it deconstructs that other authors become imitators in order to explore it further.

  I am trying to deconstruct Star Wars, and specifically play the scale of a galactic society with a million inhabited worlds or so, straight.

  That's a world that can fit any narrative. It's effectively an infinite setting. And that's cool.

    infinite settings are tricky, it effectively means all stories that can be said to occur within your world's confines will either be occurring, or have occurred or will occur with inevitability.

    Honestly even a fairly minor scale interstellar civ will do that let alone a whole galaxy.

      Don't forget how radically different governments need to be (and way more competent) to function over multiple worlds compared to our governments who control a minuscule amount of territory on a single planet in comparison.

  I think a key factor you're touching on is how much is added to the story- your first suggestion is the technique of not removing anything from the concept/setting (simply filling in the details, just different ones from what is normal), whereas the second often radically changes things for its purposes (making blatant alterations to the core setting/concept in order to highlight the original's flaws). 

  To enhance your initial comment, I think it may be better to say "let's take this premise and fill in details that are a. reasonable factors of the premise and b. highlight the errors that more standard interpretations sorely miss." Neon Genesis Evangelion is (not surprisingly) a great example- it has all the important aspects of Super Robot series (teenagers piloting giant robots in a war against an overwhelming enemy), yet where other stories fill in the background with details aimed at legitimizing these teenagers are valid soldiers, NGE tackles how screwed up a setting that can be with different details- ones that emphasize the horrible conditions that can lead to that being deemed 'necessary', and certainly not highlighted as being a 'good' thing. 

  An example of your latter suggestion is something more akin to HPMOR, wherein Y completely changes the core character concept of Harry, and has him immediately begin flying in the face of whatever Canon!Harry did in the same situation. 


  All that said, I usually prefer the former, probably because it's more consistent in the works I've found. The latter often tends to be the domain of bad fanfiction (.net and 'official' both). HPMOR is a great example of that approach done well. 
  I think a lot of works fall into that second category even when they think they're in the former.

  Back when Usenet was a thing, one of my signatures was "In a superhero story, Superman jumps off buildings and flies. In a realistic story, Superman doesn't jump off buildings and can't fly. Deconstruction is writing a story where Superman can't fly but he still jumps off of buildings."

  Characters do things because they work.  If you're going to change the genre convention so that they don't work, it's stupid to still have the characters do them anyway.

    A deconstruction can be a lot of things.  One thing it could be, here, would be a story where Superman establishes a new, Superman-based airline, and donates the proceeds to an effective charity, in lieu of constant direct hero work.

      That would dumb. Space services would be much more lucrative and useful -- vehicle launch and recovery, soft landing mineral rich asteroids on Earth, transforming Mars and Venus, carving living quarters on Mars and the Moon, mass transport of colonists and supplies to Mars and the Moon in life support shells.

      Has anyone done that well before?

  I like snark. Sarcasm, subtle nods to the holes in the original setting, jokes that the characters won't get but the readers will. It pleases me when done well. When done badly it's obnoxious.
  ```

- u/360Saturn:
  ```
  Taking a good hard look at the premise and not looking at the most optimistic view of it, I think. It's the case in one of my fave fanfics, [X-Manson (X-Men)](http://www.comicfic.net/fic/benway/xmanson01.htm) (very dark) which explores the fact that Charles Xavier's 'school for the gifted', which takes in children under false pretenses and trains them according to the beliefs of one man, is effectively a cult. It only gets worse from then on.
