## [Biweekly Challenge] Power Failure

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4jzc06/biweekly_challenge_plane_of_garbage/?sort=confidence) the prompt was "Plane of Garbage". The winner was /u/FlaskBear with their story, [Property of Professor Pock](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4jzc06/biweekly_challenge_plane_of_garbage/d3bax9f). Go read it now! Congratulations to /u/FlaskBear!

##### This Time

This time, we'll be doing /u/ZeroNihilist's choice, "Power Failure". The [phlebotinum stops working](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhlebotinumBreakdown), [the lights go out](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBlackout), or [the magic fades away](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicGoesAway). You're welcome to go large-scale (an entire society is threatened by the failure of a previously reliable technology) or small-scale (a street-level superhero loses her power). I think this is a great chance to explore worst case scenario planning. It's also pretty great for fanfiction, given how many fictional worlds heavily depend on their magic. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, June 15th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Next time, we'll be doing [Space Battles](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceBattle)! Battles! In Spaaaaaace! This is a great time to break out that humongous mecha story you've been thinking about, or a hard sci-fi tale of ships shooting lasers at each other from hundreds of kilometers away. The only requirement is that there needs to be battle, and it needs to be in space.

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 6/15.** Please private message me with any questions or comments, as the beloved meta thread is now archived. The companion thread [is available here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4m44wg/challenge_companion_power_failure/).

  [Europe Down](https://medium.com/@spacefountains/europe-down-c83215407e75) 3,473 Words. (edited the link, should still be the same content, but as I dropped out of hosting for a bit not completely sure)
  Why does magic always need to be the thing going wrong?

  Still rough, but I think better than what I had last time and I would rather get something out than nothing. Please tell me what you think if you read it.

  I think I had to have deleted more text than I ended up using on this one. First I tried writing an entirely different story in response to the prompt, realized I was being way too broad and started this instead. Then I had trouble coming up with a plot and indeed had something quite different until I realized that while there was once an air force base in Amesbury there now isn't.

    ```
    Get out their coming -> get out they're coming / get out, they're coming

    Who brings a toddler on a an early morning tour? -> on an early morning

    Rank after rank of soldiers dominated the scene their uniforms a alien garish mix of purples and greens -> ... scene, their uniforms an alien ...

    All our sympathy are for those affected -> sympathy is, sympathies are (? not entirely sure)

    Old planes probably should work now anything with physical linkages to the control surfaces should be safe to test at least -> you probably want a comma somewhere here, "Our planes should probably work now, anything ..."

    The police had position themselves -> positioned themselves

    The story doesn't describe the soldiers other than their uniform colour. At first I thought it was medieval soldiers (didn't pay enough attention to the colour), and then I didn't know or suspect they were aliens.

    Why are they really surprised in the end? They already determined that only aliens made sense. Also technology not working isn't really "good" news, maybe "less bad".

    It's all fine that you use the Angular logo (and angular presumably) but I can't hit the back button in your page.

    Nice story though, I enjoyed reading it :)
