  Pretty good chapter. My only concern is that with not much happening this chapter (though we do find out that roofies are still a thing. Watch your drink, girl!), and the next one being interlude, the pacing might suffer a bit. It kinda feels like this arc didn't have a real conclusion - rather it's just setting a couple threads up, but doesn't close anything.

  One'd think the fight vs the Uchicha would be a better closing scene in the act, but that might or might not fit your plans.

  In general, I remain optimistic towards this story. Keep up the good work!

  (I'd post a review but can't log in to ff since they stopped supporting + in emails ;_;)

    I'm hoping the interlude won't be seen as slow - certainly, I think it should prove very interesting for people. It's true that this arc doesn't close anything off, and it was honestly never meant to; it's an opening, and that's basically it.

    It may seem long now, but the beginning is very short in comparison to the rest of the story - we're only *just* barely getting started. When I initially thought out the story structure, it didn't feel like an issue to me because the beginning was so "short". Maybe that was a mistake on my part, but that is as it is, now.

    Hopefully, though, you'll soon start seeing the payoff that I've been anticipating and planning (and sense the reasoning behind it), as all this setup begins to play out throughout the volume and later the entire trilogy as a whole. I've been aching to write the next arc in particular for a very long time, now! :D

      Right. I think you're hitting one of difficulties while writing serial fiction. Compared to the entire thing as you currently envision it, and for the reader that comes later when more of the story is written, the opening might in fact be just fine.

      The live reader, getting a chapter every two weeks, has a significantly different perspective.

      I think a good comparison here would be the first act of [worm](http://parahumans.wordpress.com/). It has a similar number of chapters (6), and is the opening to a larger story, but within itself it also has a clear opening - build up - climax - resolution progression. We are introduced to the MC, see her take the first steps in the parahumans world, and wrap up with a big fight that resolves the most immediate problems (and creates twice as many new ones, of course).


      Now, don't let this discourage you. I'm still enjoying the show! Just think this might be worth keeping in mind.

      Edit: I suppose the other perspective is - if you didn't call it an 'act', I'd be totally fine :P An act with no resolution at all seems misnamed.

  Just so you know, "In Fire Forged" is also the name of a fantasy trilogy by Laura Resnick, published in 2003.

    It's also the name of an anthology by David Weber (and others) set in the Honorverse. I've googled the title and winced a bit, but back when I thought of it, it seemed very appropriate, and it still does, so I've stuck with it - titles, I suppose, aren't my strongest area.

  Very enjoyable chapter. Not much happening, but it's still good background info.

  Very nice chapter, I liked it a lot. I liked her interaction with her father. I liked the talk about seals of course, though it does slow down the chapter a bit, especially in combination with the training and the talk with dad, all of which was slow. I think the chapter would be improved hugely by having something action-y or tense-y happen in between the training with Ino and the dinner. Now it's "first we have a scene where Sakura talks to Ino while training. Next, we have a scene where Sakura talks to Ino... while having supper!" :P

  (I would have liked some description of how Sakura actually goes about earth chakra molding -even just one line explaining how she chooses to mold earth rather than regular chakra- but this is more my personal preference than something crucial to the story.)

  I think you might get some use out of [this discussion](https://pay.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/2b7epq/the_various_technologies_of_narutoverse/) on [/r/Naruto](https://pay.reddit.com/r/Naruto). It lists and and talks about the various technologies in the verse.

  Admittedly, I opened that discussion since I needed the information for a story of my own, but that hardly precludes you from using its findings and results as well.
