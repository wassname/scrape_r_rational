  Honestly, I think interest might ramp back now.

  Scar is back! YESSSS

  I didn't post a link on fanfiction.net for the last update as I noticed there isn't as much enthusiasm for this story, so there are two new chapters up this time around. Just follow the link and it'll take you right to the first one.

  Btw, I realize there's probably quite a few people who'd rather I update NTBS, so I'll be doing my best to get back into the flow of that as well. Writing/editing two stories at once proved to be a little trickier than I had hoped...

    I have no interest in the source material and love your story to pieces, if that helps to reinforce in your mind the idea that people can separate the source from the fanfic. I enjoy reading this story quite a lot. I believe the sequel’s ‘growing pains’ in terms of readership would not have been so apparent if Scar continued to be the protagonist throughout but then we’d miss this reveal that he’s been working behind the scenes the entire time. Thank you for the time and effort you put into this story.

    What

    You mean I could have been reading this earlier? 

    It's a good story. And a small subreddit, which suffers from too little content. There's no reason not to post updates when they come!
