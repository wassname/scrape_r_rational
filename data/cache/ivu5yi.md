## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

      There wasn't that much inquisition going on by the 18th century generally speaking and when it comes to inquisitions throughout history they mostly took place in areas of contested religious entrenchment. 

      That's why the Spanish and Polish inquisitions are some of the most well known and bloody. The purpose of inquisition is to root out heretics and heathens and inquisitors not only cost the church money they also often cost the church popularity, which doesn't often matter until the aristocracy start feeling the heat.

  [You are in the last scheme of the Joker in The Dark Knight.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D4qvaLpHfw)

  It's night. Just past the moment where it was "getting dark" to "is dark". You are in a ferry boat going out of the city after threats from the Joker. It is filled with civilians - you and your family among them - and a few military personnel, as well, of course as the ferry operators. Nearby, there is another ferry boat filled with prisoners, also taking them out of the city. The boats are moving  when suddenly, the engines stop. Radio is down. In the engine room, there are \~100 barrels filled with some unknown explosive substance, ready to detonate and also a box. In the box, a detonator.

  Joker's voice then comes out of the speakers. He tells you that if anyone tries to leave he will blow everyone up. He tells you that at midnight he will blow everyone up. However, each boat, he says, has the detonator to the other boat, and if one of the boats blows the other boats he will let that boat live. A Prisoner's Dilemma, except there is no option that benefits you both.

  However, there are a few caveats:

  * You have no reason to believe the Joker that the detonator you carry blows the other boat and not the one you're in.
  * You have no reason to believe the Joker will be true to his words and spare the remaining boat.
  * It is dark. Although the Joker says that if someone leaves he will blow up everyone, someone might be able to escape without been seeing by anyone observing, if they are careful. But then again, maybe he has made some sort of mechanism that will blow up the boat if some one tries to go outside. You don't know.
  * You have no reason to believe Batman will stop the Joker.
  * You have no reason to believe that someone on the other boat will not push the button.

  You can try play the Joker's prisoner game, or you can try to get creative.

  There are hundreds of people in your boat. More than 100, but less than 500, probably in the lower half of that range. Some of them might have useful knowledge for certain situations, but you shouldn't expect anything exceptional. Likewise, many of the people there have brought their stuff with them in the boat, after all, they were fleeing the city -- same things applies, there might be useful things there, but you shouldn't count on anything exceptional.

  Your primary goal is simple: Ensure you and your family survives. Your secondary goal is to ensure everyone else, or, at least, the most people possible, survives.
  ```

  - u/LeifCarrotson:
    ```
    That primary/secondary goal seems a bit weird. 

    Imagine your family were strong swimmers and you had some knowledge about the expected power of the explosives. You might fulfill the primary goal but to fail the secondary by having your family dive into the water and start swimming away. By the time Joker's mics and video cameras picked up the splashes and he pushed the detonator to kill everyone still on boat, your family would be 10 meters away and underwater and survive. 

    Yay! Per the prompt's goals, you'd have succeeded. But you've caused the deaths of 197 people! 

    Why isn't the goal to save as many people as possible, regardless of their relationship to you?
    ```

    - u/TheShadowMuffin:
      ```
      Shockwaves are actually more deadly through liquid so you'd have to be further away than you'd think. Check out Mark Rober's video on the topic of surviving a grenade in air vs in liquid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4DnuQOtA8E

      Also depending on the time of the year the water might be cold enough to give you all hypothermia which'll kill you if you don't reach land fast enough. From the coats people are wearing in the clip I'd say it's probably gonna be pretty cold.
      ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    If I were an expert electrical engineer, I would do the following:

    1. Locate the detonator on the bomb. DO NOT TOUCH IT.

    2. Figure out how it's supposed to get the signal to blow. Judging by the Joker's previous devices, it's probably a jury-rigged cellphone. 

    3. Tell everyone on the ship to collect every single scrap of thin wire on the boat. Wire jewelry, bra underwires, unspooled cables from non-critical systems on the ship, anything at all.

    4. Wrap the wire into a Faraday cage around the detonator. If possible, test that it works on someone else's cellphone before covering it.

    5. Hope we found all the detonators.

    However, the situation as you described does not guarantee anything I could do would work. There is too much uncertainty to make a solid plan.
    ```

    - u/fish312:
      ```
      Seems unnecessarily complicated. What if the detonator is fail deadly? You cut the keep-alive signal with the cage and everything explodes. Also I have doubts most people will be able to macgyver an effective faraday cage using scrap in such a short time.

      I think more effective would be to try to locate and disconnect the detonator's power source. Locate  battery, cross your fingers and rip out anything connected to the terminals in one go.
      ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        I considered fail-deadly detonators, but  that is unlikely if the reciever is a jury-rigged cellphone. It certainly could be modified to explode on hanging up, but given that cellphone reception on a ferry might be patchy, assuming the Joker wants his game to actually play out and not end in equipment failure, and assuming that the device is similar to the one implanted in the dude in the drunk tank earlier in the movie, it is likely to work by detecting an incoming call instead, with tamper resistance working locally.

        Any bomb removal tech will tell you that any bomb designer will have planned for the "rip out the wires and pray" strat. That's pretty much guaranteed to kill everyone on the ship assuming the Joker continued to display even a fraction of the competence he did earlier in the film.
        ```

        - u/Norseman2:
          ```
          A more reliable approach for shutting down cellphone-based detonators would be to have the police chief and/or mayor order the local telecom companies to turn off their cellphone towers ASAP. As long as the ferries are far from the shore, there's a good chance that other commercially-available items that could be jerry-rigged into detonators would be out of range. Things like garage door openers, RC cars or planes, key fobs and wifi over parabolic antennas are all relatively limited in effective range, especially below the deck of a ferry. A viable long-range detonator would still be possible, but it would probably require a bit more skill and knowledge than the Joker demonstrated up to that point. A fail-deadly arrangement is also still possible, though, as you've said, unlikely since it would probably be unreliable. As such, disabling cell phones is your safest initial move.

          Even so, the Joker stated the ships would both be destroyed at midnight if nobody pressed their button, so it's possible that there are timers on both ships which have to be disabled. Nonetheless, if the ships don't blow up shortly after the cellphone network is shut down, it's a good sign that you're probably safe to move in and cautiously try to evacuate everyone, possibly while also towing the ferries further from the shore to reduce signal strength.
          ```

  - u/TheShadowMuffin:
    ```
    Get 20 people down in the engine room and pull all the detonators out of the barrels. Gather everything together and have 5 man slowly carry it up and throw the detonators and car batteries overboard.

    Find someway to drain the power out of the car batteries in a quick but steady manner. Find a way to connect the batteries to the ships power system and turn on every single device that uses electricity.

    I'm guessing ships probably have pumps for clearing out water in case it get's flooded, you might also be able to pump all the explosive liquid off the ship. Edit: I think the explosive might be something along the kinds of ANFO, so it's probably not liquid which can't be pumped

  You have the ability to imbue weapons with magical elemental powers, however you are also stuck in a medieval society.  Your goal is to make life better for yourself and those you care about.  You *can* uplift society, but only care inasmuch as it'll benefit you personally; getting rich isn't a concern, but freeing up village labor so they can go mine aluminum to enable you to build airplane or something might be.

  'Elemental weapons' has fairly strong conceptual leeway.  Viable options could be a sword that is on fire, or that shoots fire when swung by a swordsman, or strikes with the fury of fire.  Focus is defined at creation, so when you forge it you need to decide if an air sword will literally shoot a blade of air or just give you the speed and agility of air, but there will always be some bleed-over between effects (eg any type of fire sword will never be cold, even if you use non-flaming effects).  Quality of the weapons impacts the amount and reliability of the elemental effect; so a masterwork trident you made from start to finish to solely generate water might pump out a steady 20 gal/minute +-5% flow rate at any given time, while a shoddy trident you modified afterwards might only give 1 gal/minute that releases water in fits and starts.

  Assume you've got access to modern knowledge of how to make anything you'd want, but you're still stuck with the tools available.  So you can make a lightning sword to power your house, but you'll need to forge copper and spin wires yourself in a medieval blacksmithery (and something to regulate voltage).  

  I can already think of some obvious uses to copy modern life - 

  * Fire to handle the heating and cooking  
  * Ice to store food
  * Water for... well, water needs.  
  * Elemental Light for lights
  * Lightning as a power source, once you can start producing motors  

  But what can help you short circuit the tech tree if you've got unlimited (in amount, if not flow rate) supply?  

  * Does unlimited electricity let you skip to aluminum immediately?  
  * How much does having <x> amount of guaranteed free water impact agriculture?  
  * Are there any clever ways to leverage things for travel or QoL?
  ```

  - u/ricree:
    ```
    > but you'll need to forge copper and spin wires yourself in a medieval blacksmithery

    The obvious starting point is that you don't have to, except for the parts necessary to make the elemental "weapons". Charcoal/coal were a significant portion of the cost to produce metal goods during that time period. As soon as you reach a point where your "weapons" can substitute for forges and smelters, you should have no problems at all recruiting craftsmen or paying for their service. From there it's a matter of teaching as quickly as you can so that they can make everything you personally aren't required to.

    >Does unlimited electricity let you skip to aluminum immediately?

    Not immediately, since even unlimited electricity requires a lot of capital to get going. In practice, even if you could you'd still be better off aiming for modern steel. It's also extremely common once you have the tools to create it, and for most things is a superior "general purpose" metal. If you have unlimited access to medieval craftsmen, modern knowledge, and energy, it should be very simple to get something like the Bessemer process running, which lets you bootstrap to modern steel relatively quickly. Mass affordability of metal is a massive gamechanger, on par with the engine or electricity.

    >How much does having <x> amount of guaranteed free water impact agriculture?

    Depends on where you are. Anywhere arid, then it's obviously a massive change. For most places, though, I'd bet it would be more along the lines of "nice, but your time is better spent elsewhere". In practice, the most immediate use of generating pure water is to guarantee clean water supplies during sieges. Also, a shipment during certain plague outbreaks would be a huge lifesaver before modern medicine was available.

    I'm assuming this is *pure* water, right? If not there's all sorts of potential for chemistry if you're able to get things in solution, even if it's only things that might believably found in water supplies.

    >Are there any clever ways to leverage things for travel or QoL?

    What "elements" are available. Is "force" a valid element? That could give you what is basically a single component airplane engine. Heck, depending on how generous the system is you could combine that with an air generating weapon for basically a reactionless spaceship.

    Actually, even the elements you already mentioned give you that. Water+electricity means you've got the important parts for a perpetual hydrogen rocket. Heck, once you've gotten metallurgy and whatnot going, it's probably a lot more feasible to terraform Mars with these than it would be with modern society alone. Though even with all these advantages, it would be tough to accomplish in a single human lifetime.

      Good stuff.  Thanks for the ideas

      -----

      I realized I should have clarified the wording I was trying to munchkin and my goals a little better.  

      >Magic: Enchanting  
      >You can grant magical properties to weapons by marking them with ancient runes. Right now you only know how to give weapons elemental properties but you can learn more enchantments by studying other enchanted and magical weapons.

      A better way to put my original question is this:  "The main character can make elemental weapons and has had this power for a couple of years.  When the story comes back to them, what's some believable (and clever) things you might expect to see them having munchkinned?"  

      --------

      >What "elements" are available. Is "force" a valid element?

      Force is probably not valid.

      In general, I'm interpreting it to mean that you start with the ability to enchant anything is a 'conceptually central' element according to pop culture.  That is, whatever TV shows or videogames consider as elemental:  Earth, Fire, Wind, Water, Ice, and Lightning.  

      Research into stuff that is sometimes considered an element is fast enough to be within the scope of the story (Light, Dark, Gravity, Vacuum), but would take long enough the main character wouldn't have enough time to munchkin them.  Esoteric magical stuff is *eventually* possible (infinite hardness, time magic, zero width weapons), but is outside the scope of the story.

      --------

      >I'm assuming this is pure water, right? If not there's all sorts of potential for chemistry if you're able to get things in solution, even if it's only things that might believably found in water supplies.

      It's 'pure' water, but not molecularly pure.  It should contain whatever you'd expect from a pure mountain spring or a snow melt.

      -------

      >Water+electricity means you've got the important parts for a perpetual hydrogen rocket.

      That's electrolysis, right?  Looking more into it, it seems like a lightning sword underwater would create a lot of hydrogen and oxygen gas from that effect.  That seems like it solves a lot of the problem with the weapons being always on but having no way to store that energy.

      ------

      The more I think about it, "Steel -> More Steel -> ALL THE STEEL" seems like a viable tech path.  I guess I discounted how much completely ignoring input energy matters for that project.
      ```

      - u/grekhaus:
        ```
        In that case, I think you might be overlooking Cold, Acid and Wind as important options.

        Cold gives you the obvious creature comforts you've noticed - cold food storage, air conditioning, fresh ice in the summer - but it's also essential to a variety of chemical and culinary processes that you'll want to take advantage of. Cold distilled cider and ice cream is all well and good, but storing strong acids and volatile chemicals in a refrigerated environment is also quite important. There's also applications for more efficient turbines (making the cold end colder is just as good as making the hot end hotter) and when trying to build something across or in a body of water - freezing the water and excavating the resultant ice is a viable alternative to sinking caissons.

        Acid provides a much less explosive way way to store energy than water splitting for hydrogen. The [Daniell cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniell_cell) for example can easily be manufactured using zinc, copper and sulfuric acid, and an analogous preparation can be done with hydrochloric or other acids. A battery pile made using these principles would be sufficient to provide the sort of steady low voltage charge required to safely operate a telegraph machine, basic electric lighting and/or a toaster oven.

        Wind is your answer for transportation, naturally. Land sailing dates back as far as the sixth century in China, and if you have a magic club that can make wind happen in a direction and speed of your choosing, much of the technical difficulties involved in learning to sail on land are removed - just point the wind stick at the sail and the wagon goes forward. It's also a good way to kick off one part of the industrial revolution quite early - wind driven looms are considerably more practical when one can be certain that there will always be a steady and sufficient supply of wind whenever you want the workers to do some work.

        E: It also occurs to me that fire would actually have some considerable applications in construction and (especially) in the mining of ore. It was a common practice in iron mines to deal with particularly hard rocks by building a bonfire on or near them, as to cause the rock to be softened by the heat as part of what we now know to be a chemical reaction. A hammer which does this automatically when it hits something would be a very valuable tool in the mine worker's arsenal.
        ```

      - u/ricree:
        ```
        >  When the story comes back to them, what's some believable (and clever) things you might expect to see them having munchkinned?" 

        I actually might have discounted water too much the first time around. True it's only of limited use in temperate climate, but it might have enough strategic value to justify picking up and moving elsewhere.

        On Earth, for instance, it might be a good idea to pick up and resettle somewhere in or around the Sahara. With copious water you could revitalize marginal land, allowing you to build up your power base in a sparse and inaccessible area that can be defended easily so long as you control the water supply. This takes a certain amount of initial resources and followers to pull off, but once you hit that critical number it lets you go a long way towards sidestepping continental politics in the settled countries.

        Best bet, I think, would be to find some dry and inhospitable part of the Atlas mountains, since they would contain many of the resources you need, with much fewer human entanglements than the more settled lands would have.
        ```

        - u/sicutumbo:
          ```
          Trading sources of infinite pure water for labor seems like a viable method of bootstrapping. Even if a town or city has a reliable source of water, making a portable water generator would save a crazy amount of labor in getting the water from point A to B. And then if you make enough of those water generator items, it can protect against droughts that would otherwise cripple a village. Plus, you can spray water on plants to protect against hard freezes that would otherwise cripple a harvest.

          And if you're in a less advanced setting but with your modern knowledge, you could sell them as wards against disease, because they basically are. A large number of diseases are transmitted through water, and you could basically eliminate those diseases wherever you sell your water makers.
          ```

      - u/ArmokGoB:
        ```
        What counts as a weapon? Is that a huge limitations on the shapes you can make, or is anything you could use to bash someones skull in valid?

        How does size of the weapon matter? If it scales with size, then you could make gigantic artillery pieces to produce huge amounts of energy for forges and the like for relatively little personal labor. If it doesn't matter you can make needle-sized mini swords and pile a huge amount of them in a tiny space for extremely concentrated energy. 

        It's worth mentioning that just the stuff mentioned so far, knowing about guns, and using the power in the *obvious* and non-munchkin way would let you generate obscene amounts of money by selling it to the king making his armies dominate all neighbours and loot them.
        ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    > You *can* uplift society, but only care inasmuch as it'll benefit you personally; 

    The thing is, whether you are selfish or selfless, uplifting society is one of the best ways to benefit yourself. Because even if you hoard your knowledge and use it to become the God-King of Humanity, your living standards will still be worse than a middle income family in the modern era. You won't have proper medicine, working toilets, video games, internet, phones, cars, etc.

    The existence of magic helps quite a bit, in that you could probably fake up a working water system using water swords, but you will still be missing a whole ton of items on the above list. And there is definitely no way to get video games or webnovels unless you uplift.

    &#x200B;

    So, some questions to make sure we don't accidentally kill off the planet. Is "Void" an element? Otherwise if you go around making water-producing weapons everywhere, we will risk drowning the planet and increasing gravity until humanity can't live on it. So let's hope Void element exists, and can be used to just delete mass. 

    Toilets, sinks, showers and baths are now easy: Water weapon above to wash, Void weapon below to disintegrate the water and everything it washed off. No Sewer systems necessary, which is an amazing benefit when you consider how many problems Sewers cause, from disease to pollution to hiding criminals to lots of work and money saved by not needing them.

    If you have extremely precise control over the magic, then maybe you can even do things like enchant a weapon (a net, or whip? or bolas? ideally a blanket if that counts) with Void element such that it disintegrates anything it touches when wielded, but only non-living mass. Then you can use it to wipe yourself.

    With more control, you can even use it to reduce pollution: just hang large nets in the air or the river, and enchant them with Void to delete anything that isn't pure air or pure water. 

    &#x200B;

    But mundane utilities aside, let's focus on insanely overpowered magics. Is "Time" an element? There are plenty of fiction where time magic exists, so can you enchant your weapons with Time? Specifically, you could de-age yourself and others, or send yourself back in time to fix a mistake, or just send yourself forward hundreds of years so you get back to the modern era without doing any uplifting yourself? 

    Or if time travel isn't possible, what about Stasis? There's plenty of stories where some demon king or other is sealed for long periods of time only to awaken much later. Can you use Stasis enchantments on a weapon to seal yourself, effectively creating a magical equivalent of a cryogenic pod?

    If not, then what about "Life" as an element? Can you make weapons that heal their user or their target? Because healing is crazy overpowered, no need for any more medical systems, just Heal and Detoxify and you are back in perfect health.

    Would wood and metal be considered elements? They're both considered elements in Chinese philosophy, and an infinite metal generator has some pretty obvious uses in a low tech society.

    - u/xachariah:
      ```
      I clarified a bit more on the definition I was using in one of my other responses.  I think the elements could work but I'm not sure about the specific application.

      I'm trying to stick with munchkinning what you'd expect from a layman's idea of what an enchanted weapon can do.  

      I have a cultural reference to an enchanted staff with the element of wood, being like Sun Wukong's extending staff because it can grow longer or regrow if a part is chopped off.  Maybe the growth could be munchkinned for leverage?  

      But I can't think of any cultural references to a sword that drips out metal all the time, compared to how mythology has lots of swords that are eternally on fire or Poseidon's Trident making freshwater sources all over Greece.

              ```
              I think that answer requires a look at the criteria for a "normal life."

              That's a question that gets asked a lot in medicine. Is a normal life one with no obvious disabilities? One where you have total independence?

              The answer isn't a static one. For a kid with high functioning autism, achieving a "normal life" might mean personal and financial independence, gainful employment, a wife, drivers license, etc. For a guy with a severe traumatic brain injury, achieving a return to a "normal life" might just mean being able to speak and leave the hospital.

              I think, with a lot of backing resources, you could incapacitate yourself for 10 minutes every hour and still approximate a normal life, especially in modern times. You'd need to be heavily web-based, you'd need an assistant, and you probably wouldn't get to do a lot of out-and-about stuff. But there's plenty of "normal" people living that way.
              ```

                ```
                Strong disagree. If your disability is one that is understood and accepted, you can live a "normal" life in the way that you mentioned, with assistance. 

                Absolutely not in this case. Nobody is going to believe you have the possibility of being possessed by actual demons at the entirely arbitrary time frame of 10 minutes out of the hour at a chance of exactly 1%. 

                You will find zero resources to help you.
                ```

                  You don't have to present it to the world like that. I'd just say I have destructive seizures which require restraint. Sure the time thing is weird but it's plausible enough that I wouldn't consider a real-world bout of periodic siezures to be strictly impossible.

                  All of this requires you to have a baseline level of resources. A broke kid would probably be screwed. A trust fund baby or a guy who can bring in significant income freelancing (like a highly successful day trader?) would be able to bring the required resources to fight the issue. I mean, if I told you I'd double your salary to follow me around 12 hours a day to oversee my restraint, wouldn't you agree to it? Night time is even easier, you'd just restrain yourself until morning.

                  It would be weird, but I think it would be possible to make it work. I'd rather deal with this situation than, say, be a quadriplegic.
                  ```

  - u/AndHisHorse:
    ```
    Is the possession, or the period of transition, instantaneous? Or is the demon as unprepared as you are (that is, aware of the possibility, but not forewarned of the specific occasion), and as such likely disoriented upon finding itself in a new body? If for that or whatever reason its access to your memory is reliably slower than yours you might be able to use any of the other restraining methods with a release option that works only in the first N milliseconds after the hour, and will require a one-time code generated just before the end of the previous hour.
    ```

  - u/Izeinwinter:
    ```
    On the hour? This just needs restraints with a timer. Normal life might be pushing it, but it is a manageable condition, though the restraint level required is.. high. Pretty high odds I do not live past the first possession, however, since, well, not really seeing a reasonable way to prevent suicide by swallowing my tounge or the like.
    ```

  - u/chillanous:
    ```
    I take a short acting sedative prior to the posession window each time.

    Without access to a pharmacy, a high dose of IV opioids (looking at you, heroin) at minute 58 followed by narcan administration at minute 11 would give you a decent functional window and the demon would be way too high to get anything done. All you'd need is a dealer and a dedicated friend to administer the narcan.

    I'm not an anethesiologist but google says [succinylcholine](https://www.amboss.com/us/knowledge/Skeletal_muscle_relaxants) is a skeletal muscle relaxant with an onset of 1 minute and a duration of 5-10 minutes. If you had a trained assistant and the appropriate resources this seems perfect as you could be sedated during each potential possession with 50 minutes of uptime on the hour.
    ```
