## help finding a story

### Post:

I've got to start bookmarking these things. I think it was posted here, and literally the only thing I can remember is sex-based magic. The first scene involves a murder.

Edit: a mage was looking for some giant temple-ship-relic thing, and had her hired muscle bring a random guy along as a sacrifice. If that helps at all.

I think it was probably a blog? I realize that's like saying I think it was a particular puddle in a rainstorm.
