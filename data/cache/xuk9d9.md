## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  reiterating my request:
  > Any recs for fiction that has a magic system but does not feel a need to lay it all out for the reader? While characters trying to understand their universe is interesting to me, it's only interesting so long as there is an actual struggle to it. I want experiments. I want many competing theories. I want replication crisis. I don't want engineering.

    Closest I can give you offhand is [Fairy Dance of Death](https://archiveofourown.org/works/2393225/chapters/5288507). Sword Art Online, but completely redesigned: it's a Norse fairy faction bloodbath instead of medieval pastiche. I think it fits your criteria because the players are all trying to learn the mechanics of this game instead of just doing sword stuff. Spellcasting in particular is a complicated (player) skillset that has yet to be fully exploited. Of course, given that it's a death game, there's not so much formal science, no replication crisis...just political and interpersonal and military ones as people find weird new exploits or access options that they never expected.

    I think Greg Egan's Orthogonal Universe is a fantasy with an extreme rigorous magic system. I've seen other people call it "speculative physics" - in a universe with different physical laws, the characters (not humans) go through their equivalent of the transition from Newton to Einstein. There are a ton of experiments and arguments and trying out theories one by one as they develop a more sophisticated understanding of how their version of physics works (with cool technological applications). There are even characters and a plot, to some extent :)

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    Have you read Ar'Kendrythist? While in the beginning the protagonist is retreading a lot of magical ground, the latter half has a lot of joint magic research. Protagonist teams up with the top magical researchers to conjecture new spells and experiment to get them. It also delivers very strongly on the competing theories. Magic is infinite, and there are many ways to get similar results. The protagonist visits the large civilization centres of the world to understand their ways of doing magic, and recontextualize how different upbringings resulted in developing different types of magic.

    [The Wheel Unbroken](https://archiveofourown.org/works/19003756/), a Game of Thrones fic where Jon, exiled to beyond the wall after Bran takes the throne, is sent back in time to just before the events of the story start happening. That's right, this story follows the continuity of the show, GoT, rather than that of the books, ASoIaF. For that reason I almost didn't read it, but I'm glad I did as the show's dumpster fire ending is acknowledged and plays a huge part in the plot. My advice is read it at least until chapter 6, which is where things start to make sense. 

    Up to chapter 17 the story is decent but a bit frustrating as IMO Jon's not really taking advantage of his situation to properly grow and improve, but after chapter 18 it really improved and addressed a lot of my criticisms. I'm actually looking forward to updates now.

    Fair warning: this is self promotion, but it also fits what you're looking for pretty well.

    [Incidence](https://archiveofourown.org/works/34531036/chapters/85950535) is a Deltarune fanfiction in which the protagonist, Kris, wakes up with a voice in their head trying to help them achieve their goals. There are many time loops here (structured akin to save points in a game), to the point I'd feel safe calling it a primary theme.

    You don't need to understand Deltarune (I know multiple readers who've enjoyed the fic and never played it), but it can enhance the experience if you have. Hopefully you enjoy!

    This has probably not been recommended for a long time,  although it should be known on this sub: [Hermione Granger and the perfectly reasonable explanation](https://archiveofourown.org/works/7441657/chapters/16906423). It’s just one of my favorite stories. Inspired by HPMOR, but Hermione and not as “annoying” as HPEV. Also unfinished, and on a long hiatus.

  Any kingdom building/tech uplift recs? I'm here desperately jonesing for more. 

  I've just finished reading [A Farmer's Tale](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-farmers-tale-asoiaf.608353/), a transmigration of a modern farmer into ASoIaF about 80 years before the events of the books. Fair warning: The writing, particularly the dialogue, is pretty bad, the plot is pretty thin and implausible given what we know of attitudes towards both peasants and anyone given to non-martial pursuits, and the feasibility of a lot of the tech uplift is pretty bad. 

  And yet despite all that I binged the entire 400k novel and hundreds of pages of comments on 2 different sites and was hungry for more. I'm usually pretty selective about what I read(though I'll try just about anything), which just goes to show how keen I am for this kind of story. The highlights for me wasn't even the story itself to be honest, but more the idea of having a measurable impact on the world through realistic actions and technology. Much of what I liked was even done by third parties rather than the author, e.g. the excellent [geologic map](https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/a-farmers-tale-asoiaf.435484/page-269#post-19168504) and [castle model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DKFk8dKcG0), as well as the discussions by all the history nerds(better on [alternatehistory thread](https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/a-farmers-tale-asoiaf.435484/) than the SB one, imo) on stuff like medieval practices, feudal structure, farming practices, economics, tools, technology, etc. 

  So yeah, tech uplift and kingdom building, that shit is definitely my jam. I would appreciate some more of it.

  edit: to preempt a common rec here that fits my request, I recommend [A Young Woman's Political Record](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-political-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.660569/). It's not only great at the kingdom building part, but also a genuinely good story with great writing. My only knock on it is that forum format and the SB moderation combined contribute to making the comments in that thread almost completely worthless. It's like a system designed to keep the level of discussion from ever rising too far above trivial asininity. Pfeh!

  edit2: another decent kingdom building ASOIAF fic is [Never Cut Twice](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/never-cut-twice-asoiaf-si-book-one-butterfly-effect.921929/). The MC is definitely a marty stu and there's a lot of implausible shit going on, but at least there's a plot running.

    It's not fully this, but I quite liked Planck's Sword of the Bright Lady. When people ask this, Release That Witch  is always recommended, though personally I wasn't a fan. There's also Summoned, To an RPG World, which is largely RPG kingdom building (not so much uplift), which has some major issues but might scratch the itch.

      > Release That Witch 

      Tried and failed to read this. I can't stand the prose, it's impossible for me to read it. It feels like I'm reading a 5th grader's book report.

        Sorry I don't know more good uplift. A Connitticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court, if you haven't read it, and I think Heinlein might have some uplift stuff (Farnam's Freehold?) I also remembered about the Destiny's Crucible series, which has some weaknesses, but is more or less what you're asking for:

    Charles Stross's Merchant Prince series might be up your alley. A reporter in Boston finds out she can "world-walk" to the Gruinmarkt, in a medieval-tech timeline where there are no Abrahamic religions, the Great Khan rules from Rome, and the east coast of North America was colonized by alt-Vikings. The series has a lot of technological uplift, as well as political intrigue, terrorism, and espionage. Because the main character isn't the only person who can world-walk.

  I've recently found a new RR author that I've been totally and completely engaged by.

  His recent and imo best fic would be [Demon Core](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/57837/demon-core-a-demon-king-dungeon-core-litrpg), although I wouldn't say it's indicative of his works in general, apart from the quality. He occupies a unique niche from what I've seen, and backs it up with surprisingly good writing. The fic that I think best shows that off would be this one.

  [Sunflower](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/52626/sunflower-a-sunflower-based-litrpg). Which brings me to my thoughts and initial experience with the author. At first glance, these fics seem like Light Novel imitation swill, especially with what the concepts and synopses look like: [I originally wanted to become a poet, but I decided to become the terrible Demon-King in order to end the life of every living creature in my search for true beauty instead!]

  But that brings me to what I love so much about this guy's fics. The concepts are silly, crazy, and obscure, and yet the execution is surprisingly well-written and engaging. Take Sunflower for example. It starts off as a seemingly silly premise following a sunflower MC, but as you get further in, the character writing and growth is chilling and absorbing. And Demon Core is honestly my favorite fic on the site now, solely in terms of the writing quality.

  Razzmatazz primarily writes at the intersection of "sad-spooky-wholesome", and I'm impressed at how he can write what's seemingly initially a joke and then turn it into a serious and well-done character arc, or an intensely tragic plot. *HONK* He's as sadistic as wildbow, I swear.

  What brought this upon was my thoughts about two of his most recent fics, and how they relate to a previous fixation of mine, dungeon building. The previously mentioned Demon Core, and [FINAL Core](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/54046/final-core-a-holy-dungeon-core-litrpg).

  FINAL Core doesn't seem like much at first, but it's definitely one of my new favorites along with Demon Core. I've read a lot of dungeon core novels, and I have to say...most are terribly written. Just look at one of the most well-known series in the genre, The Divine Dungeon. It's a real mess, and most of them are basically absent of a competent story and an engaging world and cast of characters.

  Demon Core and FINAL Core aren't really about the dungeon building, so fans of that might be disappointed, but what they excel at, like all of the author's other works, are story and writing. The story, characters, action(good lord, that Second Inspection Team arc), and worldbuilding are phenomenally done, especially with the worldbuilding snippets at the start of every FINAL Core chapter. There's some really neat ones like the one about True Heroes mentioning the chicken lady from a previous fiction.

  Another aspect I really enjoy about the author is how he uses litrpg. He's light with the numbers, and interweaves them into the story and plot to great effect, particularly in Sunflower and the latest chapters of FINAL Core. He doesn't fall into what I consider a pitfall of the genre, which is getting lost in the numbers-go-up sauce, which I see a lot of fics devolve into, like the Azarinth-likes. I've also noticed that Razzmatazz does the exceptionally rare thing of making mental stats actually affect character intelligence, and does it really well.

  It's not showcased in his 3 current fics, but I see it used it Planetary Orbital Weapon, where you noticeably see the MC become less stupid, and in Dungeon Item Shop, where the MC, Fresh, getting reincarnated into a body with low stats and thus incredibly stupid is used simultaneously as a joke and as a believable way to explain her outgoing second life as opposed to her previous antisocial one crippled by depression. The mental stats affecting intelligence isn't a main part or draw of his works, used in even less, but it's utilized and shown incredibly well, if subtly.

  What do others think about this author? His fics are as high as first page on Best Rated, with multiple more in later pages. Several of his fics are #1 or 2 in Writathon contests, with Dungeon Item Shop even winning two of them. His novels are both wholesome and traumatizing, and well written yet silly, and I've found myself recently going through all his novels. His first novel...I'd recommend avoiding, but even that is exceptionally interesting in its own right. It takes a mad man to write a 300 chapter novel that is basically just the concept of Purple Prose.

  Sorry for the rant, I've become so engrossed in these fics recently and just had to talk about them somewhere. Any thoughts on any of this?
  ```

  - u/MarkArrows:
    ```
    Razzmatazz fics are unique. The guy is excellent at writing a particular feel/style that you won't read anywhere else. I got started on reading his stuff when he posted Trash Mob, and that was great fun. 

    I think the closest to that kind of insane/sane/manic feel would be [Kitty Cat Killer Sat.](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46113/kitty-cat-kill-sat)
    ```

    - u/Dragongeek:
      ```
      Another great contender for this category is [Super Science and Fast Romance](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23539/super-science-fast-romance) which is also crazy and fantastic
      ```

    - u/TheTruthVeritas:
      ```
      Definitely. As much as I would not recommend Trash Mob to the average person due to the craziness, but there’s just something delicious about the author’s unhinged insanity. The prose in addition to that is excellent, and there’s substance to the madness, which really elevates the experience.

      Nowhere else will you get a well written motivational speech about stealing someone’s eyes while whispering frog noises to them. His fics, while being crazy and ridiculous, are just so well written and enjoyable. He really has that mix of creativity, LOVE, quality, tragedy, and CONVICTION! …ahem. There’s a method to the madness. 🐸

      It’s really what sets him apart from basically every other litrpg writer on RR and in general honestly, apart from maybe Matt with Dungeon Crawler Carl, who is obviously also excellent and renowned.

      It’s pretty crazy too, he doesn’t have any backlogs to ensure that he doesn’t procrastinate. Some of those fics are beefy and incredibly artistic, I don’t know how he does those beautiful 10k+ words Demon Core updates every week. Another fic updates 3x a week too. He might just give even wildbow a run for his money.

  I recently read [Feast or Famine](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/51368/feast-or-famine), previously discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/u18fez/comment/i4ay6er/), and was enthralled by our protagonist-of-many-names' plight. I doubt I could put it better, so I'll quote u/NTaya from the previous time it was mentioned: "The main character is intelligent, rational, and interested in learning/munchkining everything. But at the same time, she is insane—both due to a very strong side-effect from transportation and in a realistic clinical sense." Her mental illnesses is portrayed in such a *real* way while still allowing her to be a mostly rational character. I'd recommend reading the reviews or the previous discussion, the story certainly won't be for everyone. Even if I don't agree with them, I can understand why some would dislike the story because of how the protagonist behaves. 

  Can anyone recommend other stories you've enjoyed where the protagonist is deeply unwell? Not necessarily stories solely *about* mental illness, but rather ones which *involve* it, where the protagonist's mental illness is a significant part of their character but not the entirety of their character, if that makes sense.
  ```

  - u/elysian_field_day:
    ```
    [https://katalepsis.net/](https://katalepsis.net/) is a wonderful queer Cthulhu relationship drama that deals with a lot of mental illness-adjacent themes. Give it a chance, it starts relatively bleak but picks up nicely while never becoming stale. Definite rec.
    ```

    - u/ThePhrastusBombastus:
      ```
      I bounced off this story a few chapters in, due to all the angst. Are you saying that goes away? The setting itself seemed interesting.

      - u/elysian_field_day:
        ```
        I'd say the fairly dark general situation in the early chapter goes away >!as Heather becomes less isolated, forms a social circle and becomes much more active as a powerful player. To me, it changed the narrative from a desperate struggle to more of an establishing a powerbase, finding allies kind of story. !<  
        That being said, some issues around mental illness and a lot of relationship drama certainly remains throughout the narrative so far, especially if the latter (even if plausible and well-written) is not your thing, this fic is probably not for you.
        ```

  - u/BavarianBarbarian_:

    Sylvester, the main character of [Twig](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/) is probably one of my favourite characters in literature. He's... definitely off. At the story's start, it isn't really apparent, but his brain is just fundamentally broken by what the Academy did to him.
    ```

  - u/NTaya:
    ```
    > Can anyone recommend other stories you've enjoyed where the protagonist is deeply unwell?

    *BoJack Horseman* is the best TV series I've seen, and the main character very realistically has mental issues that very realistically fuck up his life. Fair warning, the first season is weak, but it picks up stream quickly after that.

    [Ruby Quest](http://evilcorporation.com.br/rubyquest/) might be of interest to you. It's old and the format isn't the most accessible, but the plot is pretty heartwarming and the characters very likable.

  ```

  - u/TheTruthVeritas:
    ```
    I mean, isn’t that all dungeon core stories? They’re the dungeon or stuck in it.

    My 3 recent favorites among those are:

    https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/48893/the-dungeon-without-a-system

    https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/54046/final-core-a-holy-dungeon-core-litrpg

    https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/57837/demon-core-a-demon-king-dungeon-core-litrpg

    FINAL Core and Demon Core both have MCs that can move around, but they’re limited to only their territory, and they don’t move around much anyways. I especially enjoy these two since the author actually creates a real engaging story and cast of characters.

    Dungeon Without a System does some real neat System-less creating and designing that I enjoy, and he’s quite…murdery.
    ```

    - u/ansible:
      ```
      Is anyone besides me surprised that "dungeon core" became its own genre?

      Perhaps it was an unexplored aspect of D&D over the decades. We (the collective "we") have had all these adventures in various dungeons and other locations. And only recently started asking why they exist at all.  In some cases, a mad wizard was guarding their secrets, in other cases a desecrated temple becomes home to ghoulish undead. But that doesn't explain everything...

    There's a recent story on RoyalRoad that popped up on the top of the 'rising stars' list:

    [Dungeon Tour Guide: A Healer Dungeon Core LitRPG][0]

    It's nothing groundbreaking (yet?), but I'm enjoying the read. It satisfies the inclusive-or of your request.
