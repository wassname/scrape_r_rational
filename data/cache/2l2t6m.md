  Read this in high school and felt like revisiting it given I am currently taking University Physics had started reading through Yudkowsky's 'Quantum Physics' sequence recently.

  The article presents the reader a uniquely imaginative and straightforward sense of why the theory of relativity (or the theory of the constancy of light) came to be and actually makes sense within the context of our real world through various thought experiments.

  Hope you guys enjoy.  Laters.

  Oh, excellent! Very relevant to the discussion we're having in [this thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2l13p1/d_request_important_laws_of_physics_and_what/) Thanks for sharing!

  This explains why a world with finite c has to use SR, but I wonder - what would a world with infinite c be like? Since Classical mechanics is a good approximation to SR when v<<<c, which is always the case for infinite c, how would physics in that world break down?

  Similarly, if h_bar were zero, how would physics break down?

  Edit: apparently, [this](http://gregegan.customer.netspace.net.au/ORTHOGONAL/ORTHOGONAL.html) is supposed to be a good answer for the c -> inf case.
