  You must have skipped over a line, Grak agreed not to leave the gold there. As wren says, probably already used up.

  are we sure this wasn't part of the first lump?

  if not, then maybe because the gold knows he'd refuse.

    ```
    I don't think the Call takes potential refusal into account with its requests, or it wouldn't have the reputation that it does. It has some form of optimisation of short/long term goals, but it assumes it will be obeyed at every step along the path it chooses.
