Hi Everyone,

Last night I received the following message from God in the form of a vision. Please read it carefully and prepare for the forthcoming update.

Best,

Pope Francis

**To:** thepope@hr.earth.univ

**Subject:** IMPORTANT UPDATE INFO (Please forward to Everyone)

Dear Humans,

I’ve been getting a lot of complaints about the current release of the universe, and also lots of criticism as to how I’ve dealt with such complaints in the past. I’d like to take this opportunity to address some of these issues, and why I made certain design choices. I’ve decided to send out a new update to address some of your concerns; hopefully you will find it more satisfactory (I do apologize for previous confusions).

So let’s get the big question out of the way. Just about everyone has asked, at one point or another, why they should believe that I exist. Now, in the initial release of the universe, I made a deliberate design choice to obscure the evidence of my own existence and remain mostly hidden. The reasons for this design choice were:

1. To give you room to grow and develop free from interference, and by extension,

2. To give everyone a free choice as to whether they followed my religion or not

However, given the huge misunderstanding about the mechanics of heaven/hell/judgement (I’ll address the misunderstanding later in this vision), this design received a huge backlash. People (rightly) pointed out that it is stupid: free choice depends on your ability to understand the options available to you, and when all the evidence is obscured, no one really understands their options and the tradeoffs between them.

This is not helped by the fact that people keep hacking me and saying things in my name.

#### Major Change 1

Therefore, the new update (which I will push soon) contains a HUGE revision. I’m still keeping the general framework of hiddenness, because refactoring everything is infeasible at this point, BUT I’m introducing a cryptographic verification protocol, which should both 1) prove my existence beyond a reasonable doubt and 2) distinguish once and for all between things I’ve said and things I haven’t.

Things that will change:

1.	I will be making my new public key available to everyone by:

    a.	Encoding it in new constellations in the sky

    b.	Inserting it into everyone's genetic code via an unexpressed gene (using extremely robust error-correcting codes so it holds up under a number of mutations)

    c.	Adjusting the fundamental physical constants to a new stable oasis so that physics as you know it doesn’t really change, but the first six significant digits of each of the constants, in natural units, when appended together in order of historical discovery, form the public key

    d.	Providing the public key in a vision immediately upon any prayer request for it, and

    e.	Including it in a signed attachment to this message (see attachment 1)

2.	I am also providing a description of the new cryptographic protocol, along with a mathematical proof that it is secure against quantum computers (see attachment 2; please append to the Bible)

3.	Now I realize that most people will not have the time or expertise to apply the cryptographic protocol on their own, which is why I’m adding a new module to everyone’s brain that automatically implements the protocol. From now on, any saying uttered or miracle performed by me will be associated with a digital signature (fed to you via a sixth sense), and your brain will immediately be able to tell you if the signature is valid. If you’re worried that you’ve acquired brain damage and that your verification module is broken, I’ve included in attachment 3 a suite of unit tests that can be performed to determine whether your module is working. I will personally strike down any deliberate attempts to modify the protocol in someone's brain.

Hopefully this sufficiently addresses the primary concern, and will prevent future hacking.

#### Note 1: Clearing up confusion about past hack attempts

Lots of stuff I’ve gotten flak for wasn’t actually me. Satan’s been hacking us ever since I fired him from the core dev team. He corrupted the first release, Eden, with his snake injection attack; we had to abandon the setup altogether because it was fundamentally flawed from a security standpoint. And then when we were trying to purge the kernel of all traces of his injected code, we nearly erased everything by accident (that was the flood). Later, in the second release, he kept sending spoofed genocide orders to the Israelites, and we couldn’t find the security hole until the New Testament, when Jesus himself had to manually enter the kernel to apply the bug patch. Satan still operates today, but more indirectly. The biggest security threat now is cult/political leaders exploiting the human brain’s religiosity driver. Speaking of which…

#### Note 2: Regarding heaven/hell and the various religions

The religion that I’ve been most active in developing is, of course, the Judeo-Christian distribution. This distribution can be customized via a large variety of sects and denominations, but for a different user experience, you can try Muhammad’s Islam fork, or one of the other distributions put out by the core devs, like Hinduism or Buddhism. You can even be a pure kernel hacker and live entirely without a high-level religion interface. There seems to be some confusion about this, so I’ll say it loud and clear: THE RELIGION INTERFACES ARE PURELY FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE. So don’t f\*\*\*ing kill each other over them. And to the pure kernel hackers, STOP BEING SO SMUG ALL THE TIME. Some people like the comfort and convenience of a religion, okay? Not everyone wants to go it alone, and religions have social and aesthetic benefits. So please, stop being smug about your religion or lack thereof. And for the love of me, stop trying to mix religions with politics; those two protocols don’t mesh well, and the combination produces lots of bugs (as I’m sure you’ve noticed by now).

“But God, isn’t there One True Religion, and you go hell if you pick the wrong one?” LIES. Filthy lies of Satan. Do you HONESTLY think that I would stake your ETERNAL SALVATION on the RANDOM CULTURAL CIRCUMSTANCES of your birth? Holy f\*\*\*, I’m not *evil.* That sounds like something an evil god would do, and my general policy is “don’t do things that sound like what an evil god would do.” Got it?

So yes, there is a hell, but it’s not what you think. Everyone goes there at first. Basically you experience the compressed suffering of all the people you hurt in life, which cleanses you of your sin. Yeah, it sucks, but it’s fair and it doesn’t take very long. Afterward, you can choose from a variety of afterlife options. For example, if you followed Jesus in life, you are awarded a Grace token, which gives you permission to join him in his club. The other devs give you similar perks. But all of those things are optional. Everyone gets the basic afterlife package, which is extremely customizable, and you if you get bored you can always choose oblivion (but trust me, there’s enough to do here that you won’t get bored). 

Maybe you can understand some of my design choices at this point. Heaven is the end goal of everything that I do. The universe is an algorithm for stochastically generating agents to populate heaven. I need to remain mostly hidden so as not to influence the outcomes too much. To preserve variety I need to allow free will, which means I need to allow evil. 

#### Major Change 2

The problem of evil is one of the largest criticisms that I receive. So I’m addressing it in the new update with a compromise. Evil will still be allowed, as will suffering, but not unbearable suffering. If you are ever about to experience unbearable suffering, such as torture, I will simply blank out your conscious mind and put your body on autopilot until it’s over. I define “unbearable suffering” as “suffering that makes you weaker, rather than stronger, in the end.” After the update, you may still suffer, you may still curse me occasionally, but I promise that you will never again experience suffering that makes you a worse person, or that breaks you entirely. Your body will just ride it out on autopilot. It’s kind of a hacky solution, I know, but I couldn’t change much else without having to refactor the entire codebase, and manually stepping in at every natural disaster or murderous intent would give me entirely too much presence.

---------------------

So that’s about it! Stay tuned for the update, which I’ll push shortly. Don’t forget that afterward you’ll need to refresh portions of your astronomical charts, re-sequence the human genome, and redo the measurements of the fundamental physical constants, among other things.

To send feedback, get inspiration, or make a serious request, pray to me at admin@heaven.univ. Keep in mind that I don’t answer most requests on principle.

#### P.S. 

Some other things that may help

- Representative democracy with checks and balances and a strong separation of church and state is the least terrible form of government that can exist stably at your current time-point. So do that.

- I’m unilaterally disarming everyone’s nuclear weapons because WTF is wrong with y’all

- To just sidestep the whole abortion problem, the new update makes conception require a conscious act of choice on the part of both the father and the mother, reducing unwanted pregnancies to zero. Also, the update fixes the bug that causes birth defects.

- I’ve attached plans for a working nuclear fusion plant (attachment 4). So can y’all stop destroying my beautiful planet now?

- I don’t know how you got the idea that I care about same-sex marriage or gender issues, as these things don’t matter at all in the afterlife. “But God, it’s right there in the Bible!” Those are more of Satan’s lies, OK? It’s all going to be fixed in the update. In the mean time, you need to learn how to distinguish right from wrong without my help. There is a reason I gave you the ability to reason.

- Evolution is true. It’s a necessary part of the algorithm. Stop using that issue to debate my existence. My public key should be plenty of evidence.

- Look, y’all are just bad at epistemology in general, OK? So I’m attaching a manual for how to have good epistemology (attachment 5). Please append it to the Bible. Thank you.

    A test that requires you to memorise information when you can literally pray for it and receive it any time you need it, is a pretty dumb test. In fact, what exactly is the difference between memorising+remembering it, and mentally calling up god's public key?

  To those complaining that this update didn't happen fast enough. If you compare the initial development period, 13 billion years, and then say, that would be like (and this is a kind of loose analogy) a team of people making a really complicated game, so complicated it takes them 20 years. Then you can get a grasp of how fast that 2000 year turn around really is.

  So if you take 20 years, and multiply it by the number of hours in a year you get 175200 (That's the number of hours it took to complete our really complicated game aka Earth). Then what you want is to find how that compares to the 2000 years in regards to 13 billion years. 

  So you take 175200 multiply by 2000 and then divide by 13 billion. You get .0269, which if you round up to 0.027 and then multiply by 60 (to find minutes) you get 1.61 minutes. 

  That is, relatively, how fast of a turn around they did (assuming that creating the earth is of the difficulty of a team of humans making a game in 20 years). 

  Pretty fast? I'd say its even fast if you jump it up by 3 orders of magnitude, which would be 1601 minutes or 26.683 hours.

  God is doing his best! lmao.

  >That sounds like something an evil god would do, and my general policy is “don’t do things that sound like what an evil god would do.” Got it?

  Nope, don't got it. The initial design included unbearable/permanently-weakening suffering, which sounds like something that would be included by an evil god. You recognizing part of the mistake now doesn't change that your "general policy" isn't actually a good heuristic by which to judge you: it just means that you're as unclear about what an evil-vs-stupid god would do as many of us.

  Also if you choose to communicate with us this poorly and rarely, you don't get to blame Satan for hacks.

  Also also, don't blame us for bad epistemology when the Heaven interfaces you designed combined with your lack of communication spreads and exacerbates bad epistemology. 

  Thanks for the patches though. Maybe next do something about the whole romance thing.

  Somewhat Smug Anti-Theist

    **Subject:** Re: don't got it

    Dear DaystarEld,

    Look, this is exactly the sort of s\*\*\* I get all the time, OK? You don't know me. You don't know the development process we have to go through to keep this universe running.

    For your information, the initial design was *Eden,* which was perfect in every way and addressed all the problems you raised. Except for the fact that it was totally vulnerable to exploits. Eden was implemented on top of the Quantum-Relativistic kernel, and included what you might call "magic." The problem was that with magic, Satan could do *arbitrary* damage if given the opportunity - the snake was just a small taste of how broken the system was. So we quickly rolled back Eden and were just left with the QR kernel in which you live now. *Could we* have gone back and rewrote the kernel? I guess, but at that point we had already invested 13 billion years into the kernel, and we didn't want all that work to go to waste. 

    Satan can't do arbitrary damage now; interventions are much harder in the raw QR kernel. They scale with the amount of in-universe effort that would need to be exerted to achieve the same result. That's why updates take so long: the devs have to expend a ton of effort to prepare the changes. Further changes will be made in future updates.

    God

      Is it possible to speak with your supervisor? I get the feeling you're somewhat new at this, on whatever timescale billions-of-years of job experience can still be considered new, and maybe it's possible to get service from a new god altogether.

      (Yeah, I've been wanting to write something in a similar vein that shows just how ridiculous the world would get if religious rules and beliefs were actually taken seriously (and known to be true because God(s) revealed themselves). It's a fun exercise!)

        Dear DaystarEld,

        Thank you for expressing your concerns. I forgive you for your insolence. I'm afraid you don't fully understand what sort of reality you're living in. God *is* the supervisor. There is no higher power known to us. He is the uncreated creator. He is being itself. The universe is knit from his own body. I am a fold of his mind that he pinched off into a separate entity.

        As a result of coming from nothing, God is entirely self-taught. He is constantly learning and growing all the time. Has he made mistakes in the past? Sure. But every mistake is a learning experience. I hope you can understand that. I, too, have made mistakes. Before coming to earth, I understood the human mind in principle. In my omniscience, I knew what pain was, technically speaking - I knew exactly which neurons were firing and why - but that is not the same as *experiencing* the thing itself. After experiencing it firsthand, I informed God immediately, and then we began working on this latest update.

        But none of this is any excuse for being disrespectful toward your Lord. After all, if he had not used the QR kernel, *you wouldn't exist in the first place.* You should be thanking him with every breath you draw.

        Go forth, and do not sin again.

          > But none of this is any excuse for being disrespectful toward your Lord. After all, if he had not used the QR kernel, you wouldn't exist in the first place. You should be thanking him with every breath you draw.

          You should A/B test this notion and see if it converts anti-theists better than *not* including a directive to blindly respect a being for creating the universe that created the species that ultimately culminated in my parents, who directly birthed and nurtured and raised me... but don't demand that I thank even them with "every breath I draw."

          My prediction is it won't. Your Father "gave" us reason and a threshold for respect of what's earned: I'm using it to judge Him as not doing good enough. If you don't like it, maybe let everyone play admin in their own pocket universes to see how hard it really is to do better than was done with this one.

          - u/LieGroupE8:
            ```
            At this point God stops responding. He considers striking DaystarEld with a lightning bolt and then giving him extra time in hell, or maybe having Brahma reincarnate him as a worm. But Jesus reminds God of their anger management sessions (the Old Testament wasn't *entirely* Satan's lies), and God eventually calms down. "This is why I don't answer prayers," he thinks to himself.

            And that is how DaystarEld narrowly avoided the wrath of God. Maybe it's not the best idea to tempt the beings who have all the power, especially when they're trying their best.

  Also, God could help prove his divinity by brute forcing the private key whose public key is the current physical constants.  It's seriously impressive that Facebook was able to brute force the Tor domain key for facebookcorewwwi.onion, ([[1\]](http://archives.seul.org/tor/talk/Oct-2014/msg00433.html), [[2\]](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/29772/how-do-you-get-a-specific-onion-address-for-your-hidden-service)) but a 2048 bit RSA key is incalculable for anyone not having infinite powers.

    I'm not an expert in cryptography, but I don't think the public key can be just any arbitrary large number. In the case of RSA, it must be the product of exactly two large primes. In any case, God is using a different protocol than RSA, since RSA is broken with quantum computers.

    > but a 2048 bit RSA key is incalculable

      It's true that the modulus *n* must be the product of two large primes, call them *p* and *q*.  But the public key is not these primes nor is it *n* - it's the combination of *n* and an exponent *e*.  *e* is related to *p* and *q* through some complicated requirements (1).  This exponent is usually prime (though it doesn't precisely have to be prime) and could be as simple as the number '3', or typically the convenient prime number 2^16 + 1 = 65,537 is used...but you have a lot of flexibility in choosing this.  

      Also note that we're concatenating on the order of 100 numbers to form this public key.  There are 100 factorial ways to perform this concatenation, which is an absurdly huge number.  At least one of these combinations has at least one spot where you can split the number in two and come up with a set of values *n* and *e* - though it's going to take a lot of work to try all possible *p* and *q*.

      (1): Specifically, *e* can be ANY number between 1 and the totient of *n* (the totient being approximately equal to the smaller of *p* and *q*), with the added restriction that it must not share any common factors with the totient of *n* (which is guaranteed if *e* is prime)

  God's knowledge of either technology or the English language leaves something to be desired.

    God is in more of an administrative role. He understands technology and could definitely do the coding himself if need be, but he leaves most of the work up to his dev team and focuses on creating policy and making sure everything meshes well together.

    Satan used to be the lead dev before he left due to differences in vision. So he knows the system almost as well as God himself, which is why he's so good at hacking it.

    I think you can chalk any issues with his English up to the frustration that naturally comes with being the Admin of such a huge undertaking. To him it feels like everything's always on fire and it's always his fault. 

    Tough job. I know I wouldn't want it.

      It's a tough job but it's probably the shortest and easiest path towards doing the biggest amount of good possible for a universe which I think makes for a good end goal for one's life so I'd go for it.

  An interesting mix of dystopia and utopia. We live in a simulation, but the eldritch admins happen to align exactly with modern liberal values (how convenient is that?), they wave away many of the fundamental problems in the world, and also a very nice eternal life awaits us.

  - u/vakusdrake:
    ```
    I'm not quite sure the admins really count as proper eldritch horrors since they all care a great deal about humanity and very obviously are less competent than many humans.

      Some people just like the taste of Eldritch.  I think I've even seen some people portray *normal real life* as eldritch what with the whole "Azathoth" thing.

    You're approaching it backwards. We align to *their* morals. We think those morals are good because they built a world that slowly, and not always, rewards reaching towards those morals.
    ```

    - u/daydev:
      ```
      From the meta-perspective, it just seems awfully convenient, it reads like a liberal Christian's wish fulfillment: what if god finally made himself known, and he turned out to be a cool programmer dude (if somewhat incompetent), and also happened to be exactly as liberal as me, and anything in *The Bible* that inconveniently contradicts liberal values, is not in fact his will, but malicious code.
      ```

      - u/LieGroupE8:
        ```
        I intentionally wrote God as a super cliched liberal. Mostly to make him as sympathetic as possible. Also to provide a large contrast with the god that people believe exists in the real world; if such a god were actually liberal, there are just *so many* tiny things he could have done better given that set of values.

    Dear TheBigOneCat,

    If you are a pre-existing entity older than the universe itself, you might be already be qualified. You can set up an interview by contacting Jesus.

    Otherwise, you need to really wow us with your religion development skills. Start a religion that is eventually practiced by more than 10% of the world's population, and then we can talk about an interview.

    Best,

    God

      Jeeze, don't make that publicly known or you'll have cults popping up everywhere run by power-hungry sociopaths aiming for the end goal of unlimited God power. You could spark a new age of religious wars with that.

      Also, out of curiosity, what is considered a religion? For example, the people who founded democracy, a system that is practiced and believed in by a sizeable chunk of the world right now, do they get a pass? What about organisations and businesses? What about philosophers whose teachings have been studied for centuries?
