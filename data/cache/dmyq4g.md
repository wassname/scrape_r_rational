## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

    I read the article, and the author's position is also that all the other forms of cell phone radiation cause cancer as well. Given that the consensus is that exposure to other types of wireless transmission doesn't cause cancer (or at least, increase risk only extremely marginally), I'm inclined to believe the author ia misrepresenting the science and the consensus about cancer caused by 5g use. Not for malicious reasons, just out of motivated reasoning. He's been trying to prove cell phones cause cancer for a while now.

        I don't think thise scientists actually represent the majority opinion, given a quick browse through this wiki page: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone_radiation_and_health#Cancer

  It's surprisingly difficult to translate a godlike character's abilities into a powerset while still remaining true to who they are. I've been imagining how Nightmare Moon would fit into the Wormverse if she were just teleported there because it seems like an interesting scenario, but there's so little information on what she can actually *do*. Illusions, dreams, creation of sentient life, solar system level telekinesis—all these things are canon, but then she's also not the best combatant in canon, especially if we take her sister as a model. So she's either incredibly weak as a Worm cape, or on the level of Scion. So far I've decided that if I were going to go with this idea, I'd have her theoretically able to perfom Scion-level feats, but be limited by a supply of magic that she can sap away in small amounts from capes to keep herself sustained and perform bits of magic, and then have her overarching goal be to touch the moon, which will generate her a supply of magic from then on. If I wanted to go further I'd make her individually claim every star after that for an incremental increase in power. That way the story naturally scales up as events progress, from street level to Scion level.

    If I were to put Nightmare Moon into the Wormverse...

    --------------

    It's easy to put the dreamwalking in. The illusions. The usual pegasus flight, cloudwalking. Low-level telekinesis. Beams powerful enough to knock down buildings. All of that fits in quite neatly (especially if there's a mana limit, or if her powers are somehow weakened under sunlight).

    But there's another side to Nightmare Moon; she's two personalities. Princess Luna, hiding deep inside, filled with anger at the world for ignoring her and remorse at what she did to the world in the grip of that anger. And, on the outside, surrounding and encasing Luna... the Nightmare. A psychic parasite that feeds on Luna's anger and self-loathing, encouraging both, transforming some of that emotion into extra power and subsisting off the rest. Controlling the body.

    And... who says that the Nightmare isn't ready to give birth? The Wormverse is, by its very nature, *full* of the sort of personality that would fall swiftly victim to some new Nightmares...

      My headcanon was always that Luna and Nightmare Moon were the same person. She’s just a generally depressed or unstable person. Perhaps she has manic depressive disorder? A nightmare is just another kind of dream, after all.
      ```

      - u/CCC_037:

        Here's an alternative headcanon to consider, then - think of the Tantabus, a dream creature born of Luna's guilt, designed and created to give her nightmares and bad dreams. Perhaps this was not the *first* dream creature to be born out of Luna's dream-walking magic. Perhaps the Nightmare was a dream-creature that Princess Luna created herself, out of depression and anger and (literal) nightmares, and willingly subjected herself to - perhaps thinking it would only be a temporary power boost, or perhaps as a complicated way of trying to make *very* sure that she wasn't forgotten.
        ```

          I could see that happening, apart from the power boost. My objection isn’t that it’s implausible, but that a lot of cartoons go out of their way to shield characters from responsibility. It would be more interesting in my opinion if Luna is just ... like that. One day she’s depressed, another day taking over the world and overthrowing her sister seems like a wonderful idea. And then she’s depressed again but letting her sister out of the sun would just be awkward so she becomes this sort of accidental evil overlord desperately in need of a therapist with no real plans.

            If Luna made the Nightmare - as I am suggesting - then that in no way shields her from the responsibility. She made it, and it's only in control because she *gave* it that control; all of the lines of responsibility do end at Luna, either way.

            The advantage (from a storytelling sense) of having the Nightmare as a separate entity, though, is that it can then go ahead and infest *other people* - possibly through Luna's dreamwalking abilities.
            ```

            - u/Lightwavers:
              ```
              Oh she does have a certain amount of responsibility either way, but I’m just saying it’s more interesting to have Luna just be kind of crazy and evil at times. She can just make more Nightmares if the original is destroyed, and becomes a threat you can’t just kill because if she dies the moon might explode or something.
              ```
