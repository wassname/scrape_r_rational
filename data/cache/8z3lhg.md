## Review of Deathworlders

### Post:

I have completed around 25 chapters in the book, I initially liked the premise of first contact and humans response to it, but in the later chapters the aliens started behaving more human like and somehow the feeling of exploration has been replaced by drama, action .

What do you guys say

  Minus a couple of small arcs in other stories and the Sanctuary/Misift plot, the series has never been about exploration. The early chapters have a lot of worldbuilding but the main plot has always been about stepping onto the galactic stage and surviving/defeating Big Hotel.

    Hmm, I  don't dislike that part , but my problem is that aliens also are becoming too human like , yes the author points out the physiological differences a lot, but the thinking process is starting to feel human like, I guess this could be the effect of reading Blindsight by Peter Watts recently, it has introduced me to the alien nature of well ... aliens and I expect it.to pop up everywhere

      I believe Hambone acknowledged this at some point with a line that talked about how Deathworlders affected how the rest of the galaxy thought about things. Plus you're seeing the cream of the crop as far as ET's are concerned so it's not surprising that their competency has risen. It's also been established that the Human mindset is less of a Human mindset and more of a Deathworlder mindset.

  I haven't read it but if its the story i'm thinking of, prominently listed in r/HFY I've thought about getting around to it more than once, and for one am thankful to see a review and hope to see a discussion.

  It is a series I enjoyed but it needs a good editing.
