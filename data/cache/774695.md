  ```
  Catherine/Malicia OTP?

  On a more serious note, I really *really* like Malicia, she's terrifying enough that you know she's a villain, but she's much like Wekesa in that she has a likability, you could sit down and have a beer with her or something.
  ```

    >Catherine/Malicia OTP?

    Please write that.  I didn't even know I needed it but I do.
    ```

    - u/M3mentoMori:
      ```
      Seconded. 

      Edit: I wish I could write. I just had the idea of a Cat/Malicia snippet where they pull a psuedo-Traitorous every few decades and depose each other for shiggles.
      ```

  - u/melmonella:
    ```
    She is making a villaneous mistake here, which is unfortunate. Making herself seem likable and mentor-like to another villain while hiding a thing from them that could be considered as betrayal.
    ```

    - u/Teal_Thanatos:
      ```
      which thing??
      ```

      - u/AurelianoTampa:
        ```
        Just taking a guess, but that Malicia intends to have Akua complete her doomsday weapon and use it against Cat's army. Akua will still eventually be beaten, and Cat hopefully not killed, but it's more important to Malicia that Procer sees she has a WMD than that her armies/peoples aren't nuked in the display.

        Edit: From the extra chapter "Closure" - 

        >“Talent must be fostered,” Tasia waved away, managing to inject grace to the gesture even shackled. “A weapon, is it?”
        >
        >“The likes of which have not been seen since the birth of the Kingdom of the Dead,” Malicia said.
        >
        >“Yet you do not intend to make use it, after taking it from her,” the High Lady of Wolof said.
        >
        >“I imagine she will unleash it at least once, when dear Catherine comes for her,” the Empress replied. “It will be demonstration enough. A deterrent, Tasia. It will be the deterrent we have always needed. A weapon even Cordelia Hasenbach fears.”

    What's an OTP?
    ```

    - u/nick012000:
      ```
      One True Pairing.
      ```

      - u/chloeia:
        ```
        Okay, and that involves what, exactly?
        ```

        - u/Oaden:
          ```
          Its a fan thing, were people watch/read a show/book/whatever, and like the idea of two characters ending up together. Generally referred to as "shipping" (from relationship) 

          a work like the guide has many characters, and thus many possible combinations of pairings (Cat/Killain, Cat/Malicia, Cat/Akua, Cat/Ratface and dozens more) and so you denote you can denote that one is your favorite, and that all other possibilities are worse by stating that one is your OTP. 

          Its just silly internet culture, and most people don't take it to seriously (/r/rwby has made a game out of it by thinking up names for every single possible character combination and putting it in a [chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JpinKp5XW6htsPAri0kRMGKrxQwi458YU6HY734wuwE/edit#gid=0).)

- u/um_m:
  ```
  It is this kind of analysis and rational approach to strategy that make this story a good rational one.
  ```

- u/um_m:
  ```
  The gentle and kind mannerism of Malicia towards Cat and the whole teacher & student routine reminded me of Dumbledore's conversations with Harry. I think the key difference is that Malicia and Cat are rational creatures with very little moral limitations (especially the former).
  ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  I liked this chapter. Malicia's not my favorite character, but she's interesting.

  And the parts of the story that deal with logistics, grand strategy and sociology are always my favorite.
  ```

- u/JdubCT:
  ```
  Catherine already has a good Daddy. Now it's time for Mommy to put her two cents in.

  Raised by two monsters while already being a monster? SUPER MONSTER!
  ```

- u/sitsthewind:
  ```
  If Black counts as her first mentor, and Malicia counts as her second, I wonder if there'll be a Rule of Thirds and we'll see a third one coming along later.
  ```

  - u/JdubCT:
    ```
    Maybe Cordelia? Mentors come in friendly and unfriendly packages. Cordelia has outwitted Malicia before, Cat seems to want to do the same.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Also will funnel the neutrality of cat I would love it.
      ```

- u/nick012000:
  ```
  Malicia's advice in this chapter seems sound, but I'm not sure if considering your goals before you begin building a strategy is the very first thing you should do. It's also important to understand yourself and your resources, as well as those of your opponent. While it's important to keep you end goal in mind, I'm not sure if it's the optimal place to start the process of making your plans at.
