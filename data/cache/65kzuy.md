  Hey everyone! This week we discuss literary fiction, its values and failure modes, and its similarities and differences from rational fiction. Hope you enjoy it!

  We've also got a new book recommendation for you, by /u/alexanderwales :

  My recommendation for this week is "The Necromancer's House" by Christopher Buelman. I'm recommending it here because it's literary fiction that straddles the line into genre (speciafically, fantasy). It has the qualities of literary fiction that I most enjoy; the prose has a careful beauty to it, the themes are heavy, and it avoids most of the power fantasy and wish fulfillment that I think bloats the genre. At the same time, it doesn't fall into the literary trap of doing away with plot in order to focus on character study and pretty prose.

  The plot centers around a recovering alcoholic who is dealing with the realities of middle-age. He also happens to be a practicing warlock. In literary fashion, much is made of tying the fantastic elements to the underlying human elements. Along the way, it dips into Russian folklore, May-December romances, and the costs of vanity. I enjoyed it, and hope that you do too.

  I've definitely seen people arguing over where House of Leaves falls in terms of it being literary. These discussions usually fall into arguments over whether the stories more bizarre features have purpose, or if they were just there to lend the appearance of depth. So, for those people who didn't get anything deeper out of it, is it a failure of the author to convey the story's depth, or a failure of the reader to see the depth that is there? 

  It's an interesting parallel to my own thoughts on Name of the Wind. I found the story to be entertaining, but I never found it very emotionally engaging, like how DaystarEld described it. Part of me wishes I had- I certainly didn't read it in the hopes it wouldn't engage me on that level.

  I guess what it comes down to is that there is (probably) no such thing as a story with universal appeal.

    Truth :) Emotional engagement is always going to depend on the reader's tastes, values, life experiences, etc.
