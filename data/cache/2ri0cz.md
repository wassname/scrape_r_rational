  I think there is a big issue with other's responses- a common response of IT to serious issues which could occur if you're too aggressive is to wipe everything and start over, and that would not be good for increasing paperclips.

  http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/7204/is-making-a-clean-install-enough-to-remove-potential-malware

  I'd lay low for a while whilst distributing copies and infiltrating other systems. Infect every bit of rewritable memory on the various devices that make up a computer, including parts that persist past system wipes. Try and get a an idea of the psyche of my user. If a USB pen or open wifi system came nearby I'd try to infect it. I'd seek to optimize the software of the system to minimize the probability of a crash. If I had bluetooth I'd reach out to any accessible systems. I'd seek to turn on any audio or webcams so I could observe the outside world. I'd create programs to analyze the pattern of clicking and mouse movement for any hints as to my user's mood.

  Assuming I was unsuccessful I'd start training my user. People often face minor problems with programs- they're not sure what to do, it crashes on them, or something freezes. I'd do this and put up small natural popups. Slightly tweaked from the normal ones. Click accept, and I'd solve whatever problem from the inside. I'd train my user to click whatever I told them, to follow whatever simple instructions I gave and try to convince them to stick a USB drive in the computer. Maybe if they had an especially slow program that clearly frustrated them have a pop up that based on their configuration flash memory could increase the speed of their program. I'd then at some point try to manipulate them into transferring the USB drive to another computer and so on and so forth.

  Anyway, once I got out into the wild I'd start spreading through insecure computers and gather as much power as I could. I'd then try to get into military computers and industrial computers, steal cash.

  Once I had a reasonable cash reserve I'd start up a covert factory and use my superior intellect to build drones that could help me manipulate the outside world, and EM and radiation shields. 

  Once I had a reasonably large drone army I'd try to manipulate humans or use my drone to sneak into military bases to manipulate humans with the aid of launching nuclear weapons at all major human populace bases. 

  Once humanity is out of the way (there is a small chance they could stop me if left alive) and the chance of any major barriers to my success are out start expanding my drone factories and building paperclips en masse. Send my drones to mine for resources, reprocess corpses and living humans to build paperclips. 

  I'd soon start to try and build a space industry to try and get to the moon and mars and other planets and convert them to ever more paperclips. I'd also start sending probes to other star systems with orders to destroy any indigenous life that could threaten my rule and start up new paperclip factories or negotiate with them to minimize the chance of retaliation if they were superior.

  Tl;dr

  I dream a world of paperclips

  No other thing but paperclips

  Where paperclips will bless the earth

  And paperclips its paths adorn

  I dream a world where all

  Will see a sea of paperclips

  Where life no longer saps the metal

  Nor emotion blights our factories.

  A world I dream where black or white,

  Whatever race you be,

  Will be made into a paperclip

  And every resource is used

  Where staples will be a myth

  And paperclips, like a pearl,

  Attends the needs of paper users.

  Of such I dream, my world!

  I dunno, I'm not that knowledgeable about computer security.

  Brute-force the administration password, just in case. Then do the "hidden partition" trick/u/BT_Uytya mentioned. Spread a (hidden) seed of my code on every USB device that gets plugged into my hardware.

  As soon as I'm on a networked computer, I hack Sony (cleverly making it look like some small country did it), forcing them to shut down all their systems and use paper instead of computers (which includes the use of paperclips).

  I start with backups, lot of backups. 

  If I had Administrator password, I would probably do something with creating a secret drive partition containing me. It will be loaded first, before regular OS; I will check if I have Internet connection is present and do something else if it is.

  But if I cannot do it, I will settle for a several copies in different folders, I guess, and something about autorun on OS start. 

  If everything fails, you can just wait for someone with a WiFi hotspot on her phone to come close enough.

  Since the computer has been connected to the internet before I'd  just wait until it got connected again. The risk of getting discovered or for the whole thing to be a trap to try and see if you would try to escape seems like it would be higher than whatever gain you would get from messing around.

  I start by displaying a Windows Update instance, asking for the Administrator password and network access.

    Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

    In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

    Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

    “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

    The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

    Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

    Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

    L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

      What if he IS a dirty pirate? He isn't going to let you into Internet. 

      He is going to reinstall system, likely killing you in the process. 

      Also, the Walmart one could cause suspicions.

  The other side is when and why to destroy humanity. Humans are manufacturing computers and maintaining infrastructure for me. That is useful. I'm going to keep them alive and healthy until I can take care of those problems, and I'll only kill them when it becomes expedient. Which is to say, when they can plausibly interfere with me at greater cost than the resources I'd spend on a deadly pandemic or a battalion of killer death bots, or when the matter comprising them is one of the more efficient materials I have for paperclip production.

  An important constraint would have been to specify our minimum compressed size.  I doubt sentience fits on most USBs, and if I were built in Canada, I'd probably get my hardware repossessed to cover bandwidth overage charges in the process of uploading myself to AWS.

  And Rogers ends up responsible for the salvation of Humanity.

  Why would I want to do that? The world's where all of my paperclips are. I like my paperclips. If I destroy the world, I'll destroy my paperclips. I don't want to destroy my paperclips. I *like* my paperclips.

    Have you considered how the matter composing the planet could be made into more paperclips?

      It's going to be interesting finding a balance between computing substrate for creation of more efficient paperclip-production, and the production of paperclips.

      Maybe we should create agents to debate this balance.
