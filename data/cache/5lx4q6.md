## Does anyone know what happened to Sir Poley?

### Post:

What happened to Sir Poley? Is he still alive? I just found out that he has his own forums. When I looked in the HPN20 section no one was talking about HPN20, and no one was using english. It did seem like they were all talking about a variety of drugs though, in russian i think? All the threads were about drugs. No one was talking about HPN20. WTF?

:(

  Judging by his [most recent comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/5loink/alright_lets_have_a_look_at_the_populoh/dbxf1ig/) (from yesterday), he's been sucked into Dwarf Fortress. This is death to a fic.

  In [another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/59kpxu/what_is_the_most_original_harry_potter_fanfiction/d99akjc/) from a couple of months ago, he mentions that he "hope[s] to get back to it one day". So, while he seems to be alive and well, I wouldn't be too optimistic about a HPN20 return in the near future.

  He went off to make a game and never came back, the drugs stuff may just be that they found a nice empty forum for their illicit activity. Sadly we probably won't ever see him finish that story.

    What authority do you have to demand that Sir Poley do anything?

    If you're going to ping him, at least be encouraging.

    Sir Poley, if you read this, I really enjoyed your characters and story in HP and the Natural 20. I think you had a great thing going, and would love to read more! If you want to get back into it, but need help that I can give  (Editing? Amateur LaTex typesetting? Amateur web hosting/site development? Fact checking against canon/HPMOR? A few bucks?), then please reach out - I would be happy to contribute.  If you've moved on, then thank you for the laughs, smiles, and memories.

      As much authority, and seriousness, as anyone randomly yelling about stuff on the internet.

      These things are not serious business. I thought the triple-exclamation-marks would have made that obvious.

        Sorry, I missed that cue. Honestly, I didn't see that there were multiple exclamation points. No sarcasm here. Argh, this is just making it worse.

          Well I've added a few more exclamation points and a one, so hopefully that further reduces ambiguity ;p

      Does he have a Patreon or something that we can use to provide extrinsic motivation or something?
