  Worm obviously has one in the Endbringer Leviathan, but I'm not sure if 30ft superpowered citykilling kaiju is what you are looking for as he's more superpower-themed natural disaster than he is giant.

  Girl Genius is reasonably rational and recently introduced [The Great Cetaceans](http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php?date=20200210#.XkgsOqYo9Tc) who are so far portrayed as borderline Lovecraftian Old One seamonsterwhales.

    There are some Worm fanfics which feature at least somewhat rational sea monsters:

    * [Queen of Monsters](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/queen-of-monsters-worm-x-godzilla-crossover.28934/reader/) -- a giant sea-going turtle from the Godzilla universe which makes the Endbringers look tiny. Died early. ([All Hail the Queen](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/consolidated-snippets-thread-worm-and-other-things.670087/page-5#post-53479087) is another, more complete, Worm x Godzilla crossover, but the monster isn't exactly a sea monster.)
    * [Water Worm](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/water-worm.38093/threadmarks) -- Taylor's mind takes over Leviathan's body. Amusing at first, but eventually runs out of steam.
    * [Taylor Varga](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/taylor-varga-worm-luna-varga.32119/threadmarks) -- a few of Taylor's forms are those of sea monsters. An acquired taste. Also, longer than *Worm*.

      Wormfics that hang on for a long time are my favorite.

      The premise of the Leviathan one also sounds fun for a while. I'll check them out, thank you.

      Gave *Water Worm* a try. I'd say it's more fan-service than rational. Characters doing whatever would be fun to read rather than thinking things through.

        I suppose my "rationality threshold" for sea monsters is pretty low :-)

  I don't know if I'd classify China Mieville's works as rational in the strict sense, but I've read Perdido Street Station and The Scar, and they both feature  interesting, thought-out characters inhabiting an intricate, carefully constructed world. The characters have definite motivations and pursue them reasonably well. Important characters sometimes get plot armor (but sometimes don't...) and the focus is often more on showcasing cool monsters and places than worrying about their feasibility, but the plot never relies on someone holding the idiot ball and even the most villainous characters have perfectly understandable, albeit immoral, goals. I'd say the stories are rational-adjacent, essentially. 

  In your case, you'll want to check out The Scar, a story replete with sea monsters, some of which are enormous. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll keep this sufficiently vague, but the sea monsters play more interesting roles than just, e.g., as a final boss or background prop. They're involved in the plot.

  Minor heads up: The Scar occurs in the same world and chronologically after Perdido Street Station but can definitely be read independently (the two plots are remotely connected in ways you'll appreciate if you've read both but are in no way essential to understand).

    Also by China Mieville, *Kraken*.  As the name suggests, there is a Kraken.

    Anti-rational, perhaps? I love the way he plays with words but I can't read it any more.

      I think of it as rational-adjacent. The same goes for Harry Potter and the Natural 20. It's something that most of the same people like, but the lessons you'd learn from it are very much not applicable in real life.

      I suppose what it comes down to is that they have consistent internal logic that the main characters rationally respond to, but said logic is so far from real life that it would better serve as examples of what not to do.
      ```

      - u/ArgentStonecutter:
        ```
        Milo follows a consistent logic you can follow.

        I havenâ€™t found Unsong to do that... it delights in breaking the threads of logic it suggests.
        ```

        Doesn't that simply mean it's rational, but not rationalist?
        ```

- u/royishere:
  ```
  I'm not sure how rational you'll find it, but it holds up to logic pretty well - Brandon Sanderson's Sixth of the Dusk.

  Granted, the sea monster plays the tiniest part in the story, so probably not what you're looking for, but it's there! And it's good, and very short.

  ```
  Not any specific examples but one way to still have giant sea monsters in a more realistic setting is to base them off of real life marine giants. Have them be primarily jellyfish or plankton feeders.
  ```

  - u/Roneitis:
    ```
    I would argue that you'd be hard pressed to label any size of jellyfish a sea monster. It doesn't /do/ anything.  


    The closest things we have to sea monsters are Orcas. They're just terrifyingly smart enough to know we're not worth fighting.
    ```

    - u/Gulopithecus:
      ```
      Sorry about that. I should have clarified that what I meant by "jellyfish", I meant animals that primarily eat sea jellies (leatherback sea turtles for example).
      ```

      - u/Roneitis:
        ```
        Ahhh, gotcha.
        ```

- u/archpawn:
  ```
  Pokemon: The Origin of Species presumably does, though I don't remember any being mentioned.

  Doc Future does have them, but they're very minor in the story.
  ```

- u/Roneitis:
  ```
  The Face of the Waters is a pretty fucking excellent sci-fi book set on an alien planet by Robert Silverberg that's (almost) entirely ocean. It stars a group of humans stuck there because the natives won't allow them to build a space port, scratching out a barebones living extracting necessary elements like metal and iodine arduously out of sea water and kelp.  


  It's not so explicitly designed to be rational, but it features great world building, and the sea monsters are fucking spectacular, and although they're fairly mystical, they all make a good deal of sense.  


  I will point out that the philosophical end left me pretty fucked for a bit, but I consider that a plus.
  ```

- u/SimoneNonvelodico:
  ```
  Which leads to the related question - why is there no rational One Piece fanfiction?

  I guess because it's hard enough to juggle such a crazy world without also trying to somehow rationalise its insane superpowers, but still.
  ```
