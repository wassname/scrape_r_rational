    Also loved how we move between different layers of reality, how the big fantasies distract from the small lies that change the "truth", or how we can see and expect different "true stories".
    Maybe that's what this is about, the lack of an objective truth. Another interpretation I gu - BOOOOOOM!!!!

      Spoilers inside: >!I viewed it more as a critique of people's suspension of disbelief. The boy's film was well-received until the explosion, because the explosion was obviously not real (in context of the story). But as later revealed, the mother was wearing make-up and acting during her scenes—she was actually mentally abusive towards her son. Then we have the vampire reveal and explosion at the end which calls into question how much of the story was meant to be real. Was it about a boy making movies about the death of his mother and friend? Was it about a boy making an entirely-fictionalized movie? Does it even matter what's real or not, since by default, movies are not true stories?!<

  I'm surprised *[Feast or Famine](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/51368/feast-or-famine)* has never been recommended here! From the blurb, I expected a murderhobo isekai story, but it's so, *so* much better than that.  

  The main character is intelligent, rational, and interested in learning/munchkining everything. But at the same time, she is insane—both due to a very strong side-effect from transportation and in a realistic clinical sense. (In fact, if you have anxiety, trauma, and self-harm tendencies, this story might unfortunately hit too close to home; I actually had to take a few breaks. Still, the effect is really telling—the author writes such things excellently.)

  The worldbuilding appears to be very complex and competently done, and the characters and their interactions are quite fascinating.

  The prose is magnificent, especially by RR standards, and there are plenty of fun references. In general, aside from, uh, triggering content, it's a joy to read.  Everything flows very well. 

  I can't recommend this hard enough. Please go check it out.

    I'm a tad confused about your description of the MC as rational, intelligent, *and insane*. That's quite the contradiction in terms. 

    Skimming a few chapters the insane descriptor is highly apt. As for rational and intelligent, I really can't see how.

    ---

    Edit: to elaborate on this a little, it wouldn't be normally be too contradictory for a character to have insane goals, but to go about those goals in a highly rational and intelligent way, a'la the Joker. That's not what's happening here. The MC has mostly normal goals, but it's her behavior that's quite often considered insane in the randomly acts highly irrational sense, a'la holds up spork. 

    To wit: in the first chapter, upon being isekai'd her first instinct is to look for a weapon, that's rational. Then she immediately encounters a horror movie ghost monster, and our MC chooses to *wave at the ghost and ask it if it were really a ghost*. Even given that MC is no longer afraid of ghosts, that demonstrates a complete lack of survival instinct, chalk one up for insanity. 

    Two chapters in, she meets her first sentient being, a fey. And she chooses to immediately antagonize it. That it found her amusing enough not to kill her instead of killing her for mouthing off is purely luck. Chalk up two for insanity. And then she immediately, with no knowledge of the consequences, offers to sells her name to the fey. It's pure plot armor that she wasn't enslaved immediately afterwards. Chalk three up for insanity. 

    This modus operandi doesn't really change much as the story continues; the MC is someone who's first instinct upon conflict is to mouth-off and bluff. That's hardly a shining example of rational, intelligent problem solving, and succeeds only because of what seems like copious amounts of plot armor.
    ```

    - u/NTaya:
      ```
      She analyzes and evaluates her environment, and she's introspective and erudite. Both of those traits are untouched by insanity, and she attempts to consistently make the best decisions, which is a rational trait. She's by no means a *rationalist* character, but she's definitely one of the most intelligent characters I've seen on RR, despite insanity sometimes getting better of her.
      ```

      - u/gramineous:
        ```
        Yeah, first arc is basic set up stuff, then she meets the exposition fairy(/catgirl) and they explore and debate a metaphysical reality and the magic system tied to it.

        Like the whole story so far, all 22 brief chapters, feels self-indulgent, self insert-y, and wish fulfilment-adjacent, but that's an intentional writing choice to get into the meat and bones of the story the author wants to tell, and I think the story they want to tell is shaping up as a Worth The Candle-esque endeavour in the way it feels to read. 

        Especially when the first real journey into the world is in a city populated almost entirely by P-zombies that respond to the wishes of those they interact with, and the main character immediately wants to talk to one to both confirm that they are a P-zombie, and to work out what they "think" about that, which means it needs to be able to emulate some higher level of awareness to react correctly to the protagonist's wishes. So yeah, promising story so far.
        ```

    - u/grekhaus:
      ```
      You can be rational, intelligent and distressingly mentally ill. It's actually quite rude of you to write people off like that.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        I've described it as a contradiction simply because mental illness is characterized by irrational thoughts and actions and self-sabotaging or stupid behavior. I am not making the claim that people suffering from mental illnesses cannot be intelligent and rational, just that they often don't act that way because of said mental illness. 

        I've elaborated a bit more in the previous comment on this MC specifically, but the gist is that it's strange to me to characterize an MC who acts as irrationally as this one does to be intelligent and rational.
        ```

  - u/Flashbunny:
    ```
    It's well-written, but the main character is infuriatingly impulsive to the point of extraordinary stupidity. My main take-away has been to avoid stories with explicitly insane protagonists in the future, because it definitely feels like something I would have enjoyed were it not for this.

  - u/Judah77:

    Tried it, and dropped it in chapter 4 when the MC is really, really stupid.

  - u/-main:
    ```
    Finished what's published so far, and I second this rec. It has a little bit of that Erogamer or Companion Chronicles nature, where a premise that could otherwise be atrocious is salvaged by a self-aware and intelligent protagonist, and an author interested in exploring what that premise means for the worldbuilding.

    I feel like it's still very early days, still doing setup, but I think it's clear where it's going now. I'm going to follow it closely, and more because it's good than because it's, uh, somewhat relatable.
    ```

    - u/NTaya:
      ```
      Agreed; it gave me the Erogamer/Worth the Candle vibes (to the point where I was surprised that the author hasn't heard of WtC), though FoF's character writing, while quite good, is not nearly as strong as in either of those two works.
      ```

  Anything else like Paranoid Mage? Had a great time binging it overnight. What I liked about it was how the protagonist was careful about social interactions and social presence to maximize his anonymity. I also liked how he stays apart from society with the fake identities and whatnot. I'm looking for that sort of independent, solo exploration style story. 

  Some stuff that is similar: 

  * Evil Eyes and Man Off the Moon by FiendLurcher. MotM is a mass effect / fate stay night (ish) crossover where Archer becomes an independent agent inserting himself into the mass effect plot, working totally independently of all the other big factions. Evil Eyes is a Naruto SI where the protagonist defects from the ninja villages and goes his own way, exploring chakra and inserting himself into disparate plot threads depending on his whims. Somewhat insane protagonist, but a fun read. Both are unfinished, unfortunately, and possibly slowly updating?
  ```

  - u/ThePhrastusBombastus:
    ```
    I haven't read Paranoid Mage, but I *have* read the other two fics you listed, so I think I have an idea about what you're looking for (independentish MCs that go/explore where they like while following their own agendas). Paranoid Mage *is* going on my to-read list though, so thanks for that!

    **[Bootstrapping](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/bootstrapping-multi-cross-book-2-now-in-naruto.770733/)** probably fits with what you're looking for. The SI is reborn and soon realizes they're in the High School DxD setting (albiet in California). She immediately decides to make it her goal to *leave*, despite starting as a baseline human. The problem is, growing powerful enough to jump worlds will put a target on her back, so she has to be careful not to get forcibly recruited into one faction or another... The story sees her operating in a lot in corners of the world not explored in canon. 

    **[A Gamer in South Blue](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13260401/1/)** is a One Piece fic with the SI operating in the South Blue Sea, which is mostly unexplored in canon. He takes up bounty hunting as an independent. One of the few stories that uses The Gamer concept well. 

    **[Azarinth Healer](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/16946/azarinth-healer/chapter/198097/chapter-1-boring-introduction-where-is-the-magic)** is a LitRPG that has some of what you're looking for. The MC doesn't really try to stay under the radar, but she does explore a lot of dangerous locals on her lonesome, which keeps her somewhat out of sight. The setting is interesting, in there's a map of the known world (to humans), but the edges of the map are quite literally "here be monsters." Humans are very much penned in, in this setting, and seeing the MC push those boundaries is what keeps me coming back to the story despite it being more or less a popcorn-read. 

    **[Thread Plague](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13529853/1/Thread-Plague)** is a Naruto fic that has the SI start in Takigakure. He makes it a priority to rediscover, then develop, the Jiongu jutsu that Kakuzu used in canon. It's extremely powerful, but if it becomes known he's using it, some very powerful people will surely hunt him down... The SI is pretty paranoid about it, and mostly follows his own agenda. I'd rate this higher, but the SI can get pretty insufferable, and the story is very liberal with what the Jiongu are capable of. It also treats the anime filler arcs as canon, so... yeah. Lots of bullshit there. I was able to look past those flaws and enjoy the story, but even I wanted to give the SI a solid punch to the face at times.

      Was there ever a copyedit or grammar pass done to this? I binged up to chapter 519 a year or two ago and I don't remember much, but I remember the SPAG being subpar.

  Season 1 for *From* and *Severance* both ended this past week. I'd say the finale for *Severance* was better since it did a better job of wrapping  up the season while *From* felt like it could use an extra episode, but both are really great shows, and definitely worth a watch. 

  *Tokyo Vice* (no relation to Miami) started last week, and it looks pretty interesting. It's about an American who gets a job at a Japanese newspaper, and is assigned to covering police cases. It's as much about the reporter playing cop as it is about the culture clash that occurs while the reporter tries to uncover the truth in a society that doesn't like it when members stick out too much.

  I've got a new story that I have mixed feelings about:

  *[Collective Thinking](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/51827/collective-thinking)* is a story currently being written by TCurator (who also wrote *Vacant Throne*) and quick summary is that it takes place in a CONTROL / SCP world and follows a protagonist who is at "magic high" and discovering her psychic powers. 

  Overall, I like the idea. I really like the SCP style world, and seeing a more traditional narrative interact with it is nice compared to the usual format of SCP fiction that frequently ends up being epistolary. Also, and while not about this story specifically, TCurator has a long history of regular updates and bringing their projects to completion--which is a huge plus in the webfiction world. 

  That said, right now the story is frustrating me. I've read the first 17 chapters and to me the main big "Plot Twist" has been being teased by the author for at least half of those chapters and it's not even that big a twist. Basically (and minor spoilers), I feel almost certain that the protagonist's power is subconscious reality manipulation, and them being unaware of this makes for infuriating storytelling. The clues are all there:

  - She fails all the psychic ability tests fantastically by getting every coin-toss guess wrong: *This is obviously her own insecurity manipulating reality to support her conviction that she's a terrible psychic*

  - She makes a completely non-magical object exhibit magical behavior by being desperate enough after it's presented as her last chance at being special by a scientist

  - She literally summons evil secret agents into existence out of whole cloth because she was thinking about spy movies and how things could be a bit more dramatic around here

  - Because she does not know that the friendly agent who is helping her out is capable of *literally stopping time at a whim* and thinks she's weak, she manipulates reality into making the completely non-magical mooks pin the agent down so she can dramatically save the day to fulfill the internal narrative she's got going on

  - When she's desperate for validation that she's special, she literally meets an entity which calls itself her "ID" and they argue about Freud. She convinces herself that this is some evil agent from afar trying to manipulate her somehow and that she's suddenly at the center of a globe-spanning plot 

  It just makes me want to pull my hair out. Maybe it's just insecure protagonists that draw my ire specifically, but with how the blindingly obvious these "subtle" hints are, it leads me to believe that all the smart scientists whose literal career it is to analyses and decode esoteric magic phenomena are dense enough to start having a gravitational pull or that plot armor/protagonist authorial fiat is going to be a recurring theme in the story which I don't like one bit. 

  Now, of course, I could be wrong about all this. TCurator could just be playing 4D chess and bamboozling everyone in some masterful manner that I don't get, or maybe I'm just good enough at deconstructing narrative tropes that the stuff that bothers me so much just flies above most readers heads and is going to be a fantastic reveal later, but I'm just not sure about that.

  - u/meangreenking:
    ```
    I remember reading an essay somewhere talking about how terrible the average reader is at picking up hints and foreshadowing simply because what you spend months putting together they just read through in an hour or two and never do any analysis of it at all after or even during.

    According to the article the solution to this is that if you want to foreshadow properly just make stuff obvious, and when you look at it and go "surely they will 100% get that no problem" you then double down and make it even more blindingly obvious. Presumably the author is following this school of thought.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      For webfiction especially, there is less incentives do deep analysis because there is less trust for the author. Sometimes the plot threads get abandoned, sometimes the author themselves forget the ideas, and a lot of the time there literally isn't anything deeper because the writing was shallow in the first place.

      So a lot of analysis just turns into WMG or fanwank, and WMG for its own sake was never interesting to me unless its in the purpose of writing fanfiction.
      ```

    - u/Saffrin-chan:

      The essay you're thinking of is probably [Solvable Mysteries](https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/solvable-mysteries), one of the pages in EY's [How To Write Intelligent Characters](https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing) collection.
      ```

  - u/grekhaus:
    ```
    Surely if the character is a subconscious reality manipulator, her 'true power' will only be revealed when it is emotionally satisfying for her to have it reveal itself?

    Goodness, but having a power isomorphic to being a Mary Sue is difficult to write in a satisfying fashion.
    ```

  - u/ansible:
    ```
    > She fails all the psychic ability tests fantastically by getting every coin-toss guess wrong

    Exactly wrong every time? That's a 100% validation of psychic ability, just with a quirk. If she got 50% wrong, and it was random for a given coin toss, that is true failure of psychic ability.
    ```

  - u/TyeJoKing:
    ```
    Getting every coin flip wrong is just as impressive as getting them all correct, surely? You're just calibrated incorrectly
    ```

    - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
      ```
      That is brought up in the story. Scientists say it's evidence she has some ability, but the MC remains insecure because everyone else has better abilities
      ```

      - u/ricree:
        ```
        It's also pointed out as being hard to use because it seems to account for workarounds. Like, there's one point in the story where someone asks about trying to call the opposite of whatever you think you "should" be answering, only to have that give a 0% success rate as well.

        Of course, there's still plenty of tests to try, but in-story we're told that there are enough conventional psychics that researchers prefer to focus on them as low hanging fruit. It's... plausible, at least.

        That said, I actually would like to read a short story about trying to design useful experiments on someone with a psychic powers that delivers consistent results, but is nonetheless determined to be wrong even when you try to account for it being wrong.

    My favorite quest by far is Polyhistor Academy: [Year 1](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/polyhistor-academy-original-setting-survival-quest.614/), [Year 2](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/polyhistor-academy-year-two.6716/) (currently updating).

    It takes place in a death academy with a really interesting magic system, and has very in-depth mechanics (maybe to a fault).  Lots of fun characters and high-stakes decisions about how to develop the build and what objectives to pursue.  It can be pretty punishing, and we've made plenty of bad decisions since it began in 2014, but it's also extremely compelling and rewarding.

    Year 1 is a bit annoying to read because it was posted before QQ had threadmarks.  Still, I highly recommend it to anyone who isn't reading, and I'd love to see more voters from r/rational.

      This always irks me a little bit as well because the magic instruction is the one of best parts, but it's also good character-building and in particular for this story it fits.

      The players for this quest decided to go for a social build, to the point where in the comments the quest author notes that one offered option that would basically quadruple social action would be fitting for this HP character to "optimize" social contact.

  Wen Spencer's "Tinker" series is about a genius physicist and engineer in a Pittsburgh that spends more than 90% of its time in Elfhome. It's great if you want something kinda pulpy but also well thought through and which has a main character who tends to get stuck wearing dresses, which she hates, and then puts on her boots and stomps around a bit to feel better before she starts kicking ass. (Also, she's *tiny*, so she mostly kicks ass with proper planning and the use of allies.)

  The latest book just came out, so I'm re-reading the first four and continuing to find them delightful.

  The antagonists are consistently fascinating; they have plans, they go to execute on those plans with appropriate levels of competence and awareness of unintended consequences, and everything ties together into the broader worldbuilding and the societies in question.

  Also, there are some neat linguistic bits, like the fact that elves have a word that means "a while" that is basically "I dunno, less than a thousand years?" and another that's basically "more than a thousand years lol". Because obviously they would.

          100%, I'd gotten kinda tired of the genre's "core loop" of meditate/train -> fight supernatural monster or other cultivator -> take the metaphysical ingredients to prep your power level boost medicine -> repeat. Here the philosophies just add a really refreshing spin to things

          Remind me how Greek vs Roman cultivation diverges (individual vs. group-martial prowess linked)? I'd paused reading after a certain major setting change

            >! Maybe it's more implied than explicitly stated but Roman cultivation is tied to military service and the ranks are like the ranks of the army and how many people you command. While the greek version is more based on philosophy and rhetoric and a lot more individual philosophy. The pankration intent is always fun but it's a reflection of a very different starting point <

            >! Which results in non obvious results such as Socrates being able to slap around most Heroes and prevent Tyrants  despite being two ranks below as a result. We also have the situation where how does Sol's cultivation work without a Rome. <

            I really like the idea of cultivation being specific to a culture. I'd personally love to see a modern day xianxia written with this same idea - an example of America vs Russian xianxia, or even how modern day Chinese xianxia might have changed as a consequence of the CCP's rise to power.

            Arguably the closest example to Virtuous Sons is the Matrix - Neo learns about the world and is able to achieve great power after facing tribulations and learning the truth about himself. 

            I legit can't go back to normal xianxia which uses the powerup as a deus ex machina or more boringly a level up which doesn't matter since everyone else has levelled up rather than a well reasoned and dramatic insight in itself.

    I liked Sarah Lin’s street cultivation series, it’s set in a modern world where cultivation is both power and currency.

    Ava xia rem y (a very cliche xianxia story) is good, as is When Immortal Ascension Fails Time Travel to Try Again. Both are riffs on bad xianxia. Ava basically takes generic xianxia cliches and story beats and takes them seriously, with a focus on characters and politics and the seriousness of life and death in a xianxia world. WIAFTTTA features an overpowered comedy protagonist trying to make her second time around be Not Shit despite her first time through the bad stallion (harem) novel being miserable.

      +1 to ave xia. The characters really shine in this novel. Other English cultivation novels are surprisingly subpar to this(not including cradle).

    Fates Parallel and Forge of Destiny are the other two I recommend for Western-style Xianxia.

    [Arrogant Young Master Template A Variation 4](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28601/arrogant-young-master-template-a-variation-4) is the only western xianxia that holds up imo, but it's somewhat of a satire so at least some understanding of the genre's tropes is best for full appreciation. Highly recommended.

    The Essence of Cultivation on RR has a bit of an on-and-off-again release schedule but has easily one of the most imaginative, hard-magic style cultivation systems. The MC is an isekai'ed spellcaster who uncovers how both his magic and cultivation magic are built on the same fundamental theory.

    [The Victors Project](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9966888/1/The-Victors-Project). A series of one-shots for every single victor, with a small overarching storyline. The author has three full-length fics that go more depth in individual games, featuring canon-mentioned side characters with lots of rat-adjacent tropes. Everything the author has wrote is excellent, and they add depth to the original canon. 

    [We Must Be Killers](https://archiveofourown.org/series/70454): a series of fics that focus on District Two + other career Victors. Thoughtful worldbuilding and exploration of (mostly original) characters. It's recommended to start with [Fixed to a Star.](https://archiveofourown.org/works/655081/chapters/1193523)

      Seconding Victors Project, by far the best HG fic out there.
