  Needs to do some work on the anachronisms. Like, the ball point pen was technically invented in 1888 but there were a lot of false starts, and the Biro wasn't sold under that name until World War II.

  I just got to the chapter where it's revealed that the munchkin, Jerry, taught Tom to do maths with octal numbers and postfix notation. "Think about how far ahead you'll be once computers are actually invented!"
