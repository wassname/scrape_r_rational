  Without wading too deep into the political waters of what Donald Trump **should or should not** be doing, I'd like to get people's take on what he actually **is** doing and what level people think he's operating on. Specifically, or as an example, the Sean Spicer/Inauguration Crowd incident.

  I've heard at least three different theories as to how/why it happened. From most to least cunning, I'll call them 5D Chess, Dead Cat, and PR Dominance.

  ***

  **5D Chess:** 

  This theory posits, as basically they all do that Donald Trump directly ordered Sean Spicer to lie about the inauguration crowds, and did so with a deliberate intention of having it be recognized as a lie in at attempt to signal different things to different groups.

  To all executive branch staff, it signals that they'll be expected to lie on behalf of the administration, and that such orders can and will come down from the very top.

  To the press it makes it clear that the administration will be presenting its own set of facts regarding *everything* and that access/information, etc. will depend on reporting of those facts either as accurate or at least as credible alternatives to other sources.

  To Trump supporters it puts them in the bind of either having to either internalize and go along with the administration's narrative, recognize it as a lie but defend it to opponents, or else remove themselves from the political discourse.

  To Trump opponents, it signals that the administration is completely willing to disregard facts, and so disarms much of their plans to lobby and conduct PR campaigns based on evidence, knowing they'll get no concessions, and forcing them to play Trump's game of emotional populist appeal which he prefers.

  To those in the middle or disinterested in politics, it just makes everyone look like they're arguing about nothing, and pushes them further away from the  "negotiating table".

  **Dead Cat:**

  "If you don't like the conversation, throw a dead cat on the table, and suddenly the conversation becomes about a dead cat."

  This theory is that the order was given with the intention of it being recognized as a lie, but rather than for signalling purposes, it was merely with the intent of distracting the media from reporting something else. Specifically *what* it's supposed to distract from people differ on, from simply minimizing reporting and scrutiny on cabinet appointments and executive orders, to the more conspiratorial theory that Russia's sale of ~20% of one of the state owned oil companies to a mix of disclosed and undisclosed buyers was a payoff to Trump or one of his inner circle, and which Reuters published a story about around the same time.

  **PR Dominance**

  This theory is similar to 5D Chess, but lacking any intention to signal to the press, Trump's opponents, or the in-betweeners, just Trump's supporters and staff.

  This theory is that the statement was ordered as part of a continuing populist PR campaign by Trump, expecting that his supporters would take the statements and use them as ammunition to gainsay or "refute" negative press about the event, even if only to themselves.

  To his staff it again signals that he can and will issue direct orders requires lying or compromising their positions and relationships, and that these are expected to be followed.

  ***

  Of the 3, PR Dominance reflects the lowest level of savvy on Trump's part, and I think is mostly put forth as an attempt to portray him as vain and desperate for a measure of popular support and respect, even if only from a dedicated cohort, and liken him to the kind of bad boss that most people have or think they have experience with at work.

  I'll note, however, that a desire to pursue and maintain that kind of populist support is about the only thing that seems to explain the nature of his inauguration speech, and maintaining his own narrative of "facts" was a significant part of his campaign strategy.

  Dead Cat to me feels most likely in terms of savvy, and I get the impression that while much of Trump's own campaign speeches and rhetoric were based on creating a narrative of "facts", he's proved time and time again that he'll reach for some kind of big, headline grabbing outburst to drive media coverage whenever his opponents were beginning to gain traction.

  My objection to this theory is that while it probably has done some to muddy the waters, the fact that is was so easily disprovable has raised a lot of suspicion and caused a lot of scrutiny, so if it was meant to distract from some of the recent executive orders, it may have backfired.

  5D Chess was based on a discussion I heard on NPR last week with a Poli. Sci. professor IIRC, but frankly it seems like an overreach to me. Every press outlet in the WHPC jumped on how easily disprovable the administration's numbers were, so they seem to have had the exact opposite reaction intended if there was an intention. Conway's "alternative facts" line gave Trump's opponents all the ammo they needed to discredit the administration's narrative rather than having to pivot towards emotional appeals, and Trump's supporters haven't been pushing the view that the administration's narrative was actually correct AFAIK (though I don't get nearly as much exposure to his supporters, so that may be a sampling or availability bias issue)

  **tl;dr:** Is Trump a populist still trying to drum up support and a CEO trying to get his employees in line, a media manipulator deflecting attention and scrutiny, or a signalling mastermind who overplayed his hand? Something else?

    You forgot another model that is in some ways scarier.  Trump refused to accept reality and then pressured everyone under him to push his alternate reality.  Trump's narcissistic tendency to lie to himself and then communicate his false belief as absolute fact enabled him to succeed at building his brand despite setbacks and failures, and it even got him elected, but it makes him a serious liability in terms of ability to actually make rational decisions.

    So in the case of crowd size, Trump refused to accept that Obama did better than him, to the point of positing a conspiracy by the media and making everyone underneath him agree with him.

      I dunno. That one seems to posit a level of mental impairment or personality disorder that seems unlikely. I don't know what specific disorders could cause such behavior or what their incidence is among the general population, but I would guess that it's small enough to require strong and specific evidence to make that a competing or reasonably likely theory. Trump has certainly shown a bullying, egotistical, narcissistic personality in the past but *actual* internal denial of reality in the face of this level of evidence I would think would indicate sever paranoia at the least in the case that he thinks everyone is saying all these things just to sabotage him, or else outright schizoaffective disorder if there's some other rationalization at work.

      IIRC, there's some metadata associated with Trump's tweets showing the angrier, more negative, more personal tweets are actually coming from him, and with apparently little filter through his staff. If he were actually suffering from some paranoid delusions, I'd have expected some specific element of those delusions to have made it out through that avenue if no where else.

      It might be that his focus on China as a global bully attacking the US, Mexicans as a horde of rapists and thieves flooding across the border, and Muslims as nightmare boogeymen out to kill us all *are* indicative of paranoid delusion, but if so they're curiously well timed and politically salient for a guy who was running for office, and I lack the psychological expertise to judge if they actually hint at disorder.

        Narcissism is actually all that's needed, really. Narcissists aren't pretending to think they're better than everyone, or pretending to be upset when others are getting more attention than them, or pretending to be insulted when they aren't considered better than others. They just are. That's how they feel. Paranoia kind of just goes along for the ride at that point, because a narcissist has to explain the contradictions in reality and their worldview somehow.

        I try not to diagnose people I've never met as a matter of professionalism, but he really does fit the diagnosis to a T. If he was always a politician I would be more likely to think he just does it as a cover, but he was like this as a private citizen for decades. 

        I usually appreciate discussions that try to make people seem more 3 dimensional and nuanced, but it takes a huge amount of benefit-of-the-doubt to think that Trump is not exactly what he presents as, especially when so many people have come forward and said "This is who Trump is, in private and in public."

        There are people that use Breitbart for their news and believe it seriously.  There are the slightly prejudiced, but not bad enough for you to call out over Christmas dinner, grandpas that that hold view along the lines of Trump.  A lot of those grandpas, and probably plenty of edgy teenagers, have ideas for government policy that would be unworkable to implement and would really suck if they were actually implemented.  There are plenty of people with inflated egos.  If Trump really is delusional, it isn't that unusual, what is unusual is that he got elected in spite of, or perhaps because of, his delusions.

        > I'd have expected some specific element of those delusions to have made it out through that avenue if no where else.

        The Media has already been accused of crying wolf and/or being unfair to Trump just for reporting real, verified stuff that he actually did.  He has done enough verifiable stuff that can be easily reported on to make speculation about mental illness like dementia not worth reporting.

        >  if so they're curiously well timed and politically salient for a guy who was running for office

        And now I have started to get irritated that I have to explain this... the media has reported on the fact that he has hard these crazy views for a while now... He tweeted in 2012 that Global Warming was a Chinese hoax.  He was one of the driving voices involved in the Birtherism Movement in 2012, where he also tried to get elected.  A few of Donald Trump's "views" are obvious fabrications, yes, his Christianity for example. But a lot of his vies are just racist old man stuff that happened to gain traction because a decent portion of the population is actually way more tolerant of racism (yes I will use the r word and defend its usage as valid in this case) and rudeness than politicians previously suspected.

        > well timed and politically salient

        Donald Trump has tried to run in both 2000 and 2012, he just got lucky this time around with getting the snowball going on a never ending cycle of publicity and controversy to take down a divided Republican field.  Its not that he chose his views, circumstances lined up for his views to get him attention, and then he tweaked a few views he didn't care about (Christianity, abortion, etc.).

        > I lack the psychological expertise to judge if they actually hint at disorder.

        The media has occasionally published speculation about him having some type of narcissistic disorder.  The metadata about his tweets you mentioned, for example.  Tweeting at 3am in the morning to strike back at a beauty pageant winner is probably not indicative of healthy sleep patterns at least.

          Huh. You're right. I forgot the climate change is a Chinese hoax and the Alicia Machado incident. The birtherism I chalked up to riding a wave of controvery to front page news. Shame on me for a short memory and not updating my evaluations continuously, only evaluating each incident individually against more conventional theories.

          That's definitely moved the needle on the "mental disorder" theory.

            He also [believes](http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-vaccines-autism-wrong-2017-1) in the vaccines-cause-autism conspiracy theory.  He believes, without evidence, that he only lost the popular vote because of millions of illegal immigrants voting for Clinton.  He frequently cites [absurdly false](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/23/donald-trump/trump-tweet-blacks-white-homicide-victims/) statistics.  He still maintains that the polls predicting his loss were rigged against him by a media conspiracy.  He [believes](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/03/donald-trump/donald-trumps-ridiculous-claim-linking-ted-cruzs-f/) that Ted Cruz's father participated in the JFK assassination... It goes on.

            The man is, in my opinion, very clearly prone to delusion.

          I think, in the case of politicians, it is okay to speculate about complex stuff going on in the background.  Taking the outside view even, Trump did manage to get elected.  However, a lot of the complex speculation falls apart when looking at the details of Trump's actions... 3am tweets attacking a Gold Star Family or a beauty pageant winner seem pointless by even the standard of raising media attention.

          So yeah, I agree with you, although much, much, earlier (like during the primaries) I was considering the 5D chess type hypotheses.

            >  Taking the outside view even, Trump did manage to get elected.

            I think we can add to this model.  Taking the outside view, *Steve Bannon* got someone with a narcissistic personality disorder elected, based on the candidate's own previous fame and media savvy.

            The new president himself doesn't necessarily *care* about the details of public policy, but Bannon cares very deeply.  This explains many of their moves: make some big noise in the media sphere, while Bannon quietly gets into seats of greater and greater actual power in the background.

            Even then, I think Bannon has to be either totalitarian-level evil (my top pick right now) or a complete idiot to start throwing experienced intelligence and security officials *off* the National Security Council.  Like, how the *fuck* are you supposed to implement a successful fascist dictatorship if you don't have your own paramilitary, the security state doesn't want to cooperate with you (largely because you've called an enemy in view of the public), and you start *throwing away expertise* in how to *run* the security state yourself?

            If we want to go full 5D Space Chess on it, Bannon is trying to *disable* the security state so that Russians or terrorists or *someone* can attack the USA, which he thinks will be his Reichstag Fire.  Then he and his team get dictatorial emergency powers, and he can move on to what he really wants.

            Mind, I haven't read any news yet today (Tuesday), so let's go see how well these predictions have been born out.

  Weekly Monday Post

  Nothing super special to report.

  My !Pokemon fic is coming along nicely. I need to plan out the story in more detail and whatnot, but I have been plugging away on a few scenes which interested me as the author. 

  I'm also writing modestly out of order. It lets me understand characters and who they are as they progress in the story, and keep people from being completely static, unchanging cardboards. 

  ----

  We as a community, I have found, are as prone to irrationality as anyone else. We're /only human/, and so I think that for those who are actively promoting rationality for raising the waterline, should be seeking at applying rational methods in more cases than they currently are.

  I have seen a massive amount of unqualified irrationality lately from a community that espouses it, and it makes me sad. That said, I still stand by my original heartless point that I personally don't care about raising the sanity waterline. I'm just here for the fiction, and the people.

      Personal anecdotes mostly, and I'm far too lazy to link to them, but to name a few. Note: All of these have relations with the current political climate. 

      A number of attacks against Scott Alexander, people predicting the country's going to be in civil war, EY theorizing he'd be labelled a terrorist, and a few other bits of ridiculousness.

  Hyporhetically speaking, would there be any way to get someone here to write an story based on my world building and ideas? 

  I ask because I am a bit lazy and don't have plenty of free time. I do have lots of ideas and general direction the story should go, since every spare time i get my mind pops something out, and I do have some research to back the ideas and plans.

  Not sure how the communication would go between writer and me though.
  ```

  - u/MagicWeasel:
    ```
    I think in general people prefer world-building to writing, which is why there's a limit on the amount of brainstorming posts you're allowed to make unless you are regularly writing. So I think it's going to be hard to find someone who wants to essentially do all the *hard parts* of writing a story (characters, plot, making the words flow, proofreading, etc), would be good at it, and doesn't already have an idea they want to pursue. As we've seen on the worldbuilding wednesday threads, people love to come up with ideas for worlds, but much fewer of them actually post chapters, because daydreaming about how magic would work is *fun*, but sitting down and figuring out how to describe the taste of coffee when you don't drink the stuff (what I did last night: turns out there's like coffee taste wheels so it isn't that hard), or trying to work out logistically how civillians could travel between cities during WW2, or any number of "chores" that comes with *actual writing*, is not fun in the same way.

    Basically, you'd need to be a popular person (e.g. webcomic artist) who could give people *actual Exposure*/who people would be happy just getting attention from because you're a celebrity, or your setting would have to be *astronomically good* so actual accomplished writers would be intrigued by it, and probably you'd need to only want a short story rather than a full novel since novels take *forever*. 

    Not sure what your setting's like, or how famous you are, or what exactly you want in terms of length and style. But to be honest I think your best hope would be to commission it from a ghostwriter, but I'm sure that wouldn't be cheap. Alternatively, if you have some other skill, you might be able to trade that for writing (e.g. I might trade time writing for time someone else spends doing art of my characters).

  ***Altruism is Rational?***

  &nbsp;

  This is a discussion prompt.


  You may argue whatever side you please. I personally, believe that selfishness is rational, and altruism is irrational(There are certain scenarios in which altruism is rational, for example when assisting someone costs you nothing or a negligible cost, and there is a possibility to gain a significant favour from the person assisted. The Bayesian decision in that scenario, will be to help).
  ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    Rationality (at least as the word is [used on LessWrong](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationality) and thus here) does not tell you what goals to pursue. It tells you how to hold true beliefs about the world (epistemic rationality) and how to achieve whatever goals you happen to have (instrumental rationality). Doesn't matter if the goal is to save the planet or get rich or sort pebble into prime-numbered heaps.

    (Arguably, part of epistemic rationality is figuring out one's own goals, because the human motivation system is so hopelessly tangled up that they may not be obvious even to oneself. But that still puts all goals identified in this way on an equal footing.)

    You're probably using the word in a different way, but I don't know what it is.
