  Oh no. Is that what I think it is?

    It probably is.

      Majin symbol. The thing that appears in the head of anyone controlled by Babidi
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        Even before Babidi. It's Majin Buu's own symbol, Babidi only adopted it. It was on Bibidi as well, and Majin Buu has it on his belt - and we know his clothes are basically part of his body, so it's not like that could have been put there by his masters (especially if you take the now canonical explanation that Buu was really more *summoned* than *created* by Bibidi. No disclosure on the OWP canon about that yet though).

  Wooo! I'm happy that this updated. Thank you for another chapter.

  I'm sad that Goku lost his tail, hope that this doesn't go the way of Z where all the Saiyans remove their tails and pretend to be just better-humans.

  Love what you did with Puar, he might just become the first earthling to meet an Alien in person depending on what he encounters though I'm not sure what his plan is on how he's suppose to know when/if he encounters something. And seeing how if he runs out of magical stamina he gets stuck in that form, it seems Bulma's plan worked out anyway.

  I wonder if there's going to be a **TOURNAMENT ARC** or if the next saga will be Red Ribbon/ the return of Piccolo Arc.

    ...yes.

    Isn't Gohan the first Earthling to meet an Alien since Goku is a Sayian?

  Here's the arc finale! I'll take a slightly longer pause than usual before the next chapter; I hope it can be up before the end of 2018 anyway. This one too took a lot because it is very long (more than 14,000 words, which is double the usual length).

  Chapter title reference for anyone who doesn't get it: >!King Kong, obviously, mixed with Sun Wukong, the Chinese name of the Monkey King, protagonist of Journey to the West and inspiration for the character of Son Goku in the original Dragon Ball!<

  Don't feel too bad for Puar - he's moving at near-light relativistic speeds, so barely any time will be passing for him.
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    Eh, as I've said elsewhere, I'm considering the DBZ universe non-relativistic. This mainly due to the fact that space travel at speeds that would obviously be FTL for us (such as Earth-Namek in one week) is achieved without much fuss, and does not come with any time distortion; not only that, Earth-Namek communication even appears to be almost instantaneous.

    And anyway, infinity divided by any real number still is infinity, so...
    ```

  - u/FenrirW0lf:
    ```
    In one of the threads for a previous chapter it was determined that the world in this fic probably isn't relativistic, so he might not even have that going for him.
    ```

- u/FenrirW0lf:
  ```
  Once Bulma does decide to investigate the town where the "Witched" come from, hopefully she remembers to find a certain bedside table and either find a way to transform it back to normal, or burn it to put the trapped soul out of its misery.
  ```

- u/kreschnav:
  ```
  Looking forward to seeing how Bulma develops her ki. It seems like such an obvious development in hindsight, considering all the changes you've made to the character. Still can't see her being a fighter, but since ki and magic are part of the same system in this story, maybe she'll come up with more magic-like applications?

    Won't say a thing yet :). But next chapter already will actually touch on this!

  I was waiting for this. Well played.

  Kinda suprised with whole "Puar is evil" arc, I tought he was a bit important for later arcs

  I'd love to see the Frieza in this fic in the distant future. Now I am curious about the Red Ribbon Army Saga, but I think you'll go with tournament first. But that tournament will surely feel as a filler.

  Can Puatrino reach some planet (event of very low probability) and transform back?

    Reaching a planet wouldn't help. He's locked in his current form because he expended too much magic, and his regeneration rate is linked to his mass, but there's also a consumption. Basically, if your consumption exceeds your regeneration, and you don't have enough reserves, you're fucked. Like the bedside table fox Oolong mentions.

    Puar's problem was that he was overconfident. His regeneration rate and base reserves were so huge, he never really got a sense of when he was hitting his limits. This battle pushed him further than anything he'd ever done before, and as a result he expended more energy than ever (more is also spent to heal damage when going back to a different form, Oolong mentions this too). But even if you take a very big number, multiply it by an even smaller number, such as the mass of the neutrino, and it'll get very small. This balancing between orders of magnitudes so staggeringly different is what screwed Puar, as he had no hard numbers on his limits, no instinctive sense for them (as he never reached that point), and his mind was basically already damaged by the loss of Caroline by that point.

    So no, he's screwed, forever and ever.
