  Sounds intriguing if done right, but the premise could easily devolve into a badly written morality play about how one's own faction is right about everything and everyone else's is wrong. I've tried to make a story with a somewhat similar premise to this one myself (although without the aliens), and it failed abysmally.  


  It's HARD to write a coherent, socially and psychologically realistic story that takes place "in the real world", especially if the scope is too big. Most writers don't have a sufficiently balanced perspective on life to steelman the general perspectives of all human factions. Certainly not enough to guarantee that their characters \*\*pass the ideological turing test regardless of cultural or political background\*\*.  


  A major problem with a large number of rationalist fics is the failure to steelman non-rationalist characters so that they pass the ideological turing test. It's not enough for the heroes and villains to pass the test, all characters ought to pass it.
