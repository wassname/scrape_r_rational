  I'd like to recommend this here. 40 Millenniums starts out as a fairly typical xianxia story, but it turns into a deconstruction of pretty much every typical trope ever seen in the genre. Story focuses fairly heavily (compared to the genre, anyways) on transhumanism, morality, nature of humanity and other topics which seem interesting to this sub. 

  It also has flying swords used as amazon delivery drones and arguments on magical reddit.

  It is also long for the fans of binging webserials. Like, very long. Currently the translation has 1190 chapters, which, even after you account for their smaller size compared to typical webfiction, still places it among the longest stories ever posted here, I think. Original has well over 3300 chapters, and translators are going at a sedate pace of just about 2 new translated chapters a day.
