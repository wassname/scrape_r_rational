## [RT] Star Wars, Except Smart

### Post:

I'm finding Tinker's Daughter extremely uncooperative, so I'm setting it aside for a while, but I've published a [Star Wars parody](https://www.patreon.com/posts/general-public-5761378) over on Patreon for this week's update.

Having trouble writing Tinker's Daughter is a very strange feeling for me.  Writer's block isn't really a thing I get, so this is weird.  It's not so much that I *can't* write it, but that I have a real ugh field around doing so.  I think the problem is that in the past I've simply sat down and written, with a loose outline or some bullet points as my guide, but it's effectively been me transcribing a book that I'm getting to read before anyone else.  This time around I've tried to outline much more closely, because it seems like that should result in tighter writing.  For me at least, it apparently results in *no* writing, so I'll keep that in mind in the future.

Has anyone else had this experience?  For those of you who write, do you outline or write by the seat of your pants?

EDIT:  Apologies, I had the wrong link on my clipboard.  Fixed now.

  I'm very familiar with the ugh field. It's not writer's block, since you know what comes next and are perfectly capable of putting words in front of each other, it's just a lack of enthusiasm that slows the flow of words to a trickle. I usually step back and try to work out what it is that I'm not enjoying, but you can't really do that when writing serially since it's so important to stick to a regular schedule. (I write by the seat of my pants by nature, but think it's not a great way to produce quality work unless you're also committed to editing, which I generally am not. I use a variant on Dan Harmon's story circles method and drill down to at least the scene level in order to keep myself structured.)

    Good to know it's not just me.

    I tried using the [Snowflake Method](http://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/) this time, and that's where I hit the ugh.  I'll leave Tinker's Daughter fallow for a while, maybe come back to it later.  In the meantime I've got plenty of other things to write.

  There's definitely a middle ground.  If I outline the flow, then I get stuck if something emerges and it messes with the outline.  If I outline the general bullet points of the piece's trajectory, I get stuck if I run out of bullet points or don't know how to transition from one to the other.

  I found a semi-solution I've had difficulty implementing but has definitely assisted in approaching that middle ground: I ask why something happens.  Here's a story outline - ignore the spoiler tags for now.

  * Marcie goes to supermarket [](#s "for more food-printer cartridges.")
  * Marcie hears a robbery taking place[](#s ", and the month just began; the last robbery was just two weeks ago.  If they succeed, the entire village will have to ration for another four weeks, and she doubts it will last that long. [Why not get the resupply to come earlier?]  The terraforming company isn't willing to devote extra resources to a planet in strife.")
  * Marcie attacks [](#s " by miming for a coordinated attack in the hostages' line of sight.")
  * Leader hears minion's complaint - says she must back off or die [](#s " which Marcie figures is a win-win -  a death will rally all villages against the planetary threat of the gang.  Or, the numbers might just overwhelm the gang.")
  * Marcie doesn't hear [](#s ", or rather, she hears but yells out so no one else can.")
  * Leader says to get money and go [](#s ", silently giddy that his plan to infiltrate and provoke the gang to reckless action in the hope of rallying the villages against the gang might succeed on his first major mission in a leadership role.")
  * Leader passes Marcie's corpse on way out [](#s ", her body one amongst a score of others.  Ha.  He did succeed.")
  * Leader collapses - Marcie is little sister [](#s ".  He said he'd pick up the cartridges today.  He told her she didn't need to.  Said it would be a prime day for the gang to launch another attack.  That she shouldn't go out.  And she went out.")

  Tons of flaws there and I'd stop writing because I couldn't make any sense of it.  A supermarket so vast as to need to communicate via radio or shouting is robbed by a gang with an organized hierarchy?  How much money is there?  What sort of supermarket is this?  Why does Marcie attack - is she the lone attacker?  Is she the only one shot?  Why doesn't she hear - or does she, and back off?  Why is the leader willing to kill?  How could Marcie's brother be the leader?  Why does he collapse and not keep it together after just ordering a murder?

  Now check the spoiler tags.

  I think it's a bit stupid he never told his sister his plan, but I think it's consistent he'd feel shame for planning a tragedy in order to create a rallying point for the villages to fight against the gang.

  While this would be a very short story, expand the scale of the events, and you still have the reasons behind the main characters' actions.  You understand their thinking, their emotions, their values.  If events effect a change in those three things, you can keep asking why; unfortunately it may change your outline as a result.

  Major caveat: I haven't attempted applying this to anything longer than book-length.  I imagine in that long of a work you'll need to plan growth of character in the outline, or you'll be surprised when suddenly your character's values or ideas change and now you have to replan everything.

  This is related to writing a short, unpublished character piece for each major character, as I believe GRRM does.  I think once you know how everyone thinks, you know what will happen if someone has an idea you didn't think up when outlining.  If you don't allow for spontaneity like that, then your characters are pretty boring people and you'd probably rather hang out with more interesting folk.

    Interesting.  I like how you built out the frame and then expanded on it.  And yes, you're right -- getting the characters' thought patterns down is a key element.

    Two things I've noticed I need to take care with:

    1) Put the camera inside the characters' heads.  I visualize my scenes as I go and write that, but the result is that I end up writing what happens but not how it affects the characters.  Now I try to write in 3PL POV, but still imagine the scene as though I were behind the eyes of the POV character. When I remember to do it, it produces much better work.

    2) Do character sketches on each character before that character's first scene.  Otherwise they tend to end up sounding much the same.

  I can't comment on your writing skills, but it sucks that you're promo-ing your pay-only writing on /r/rational. 

  You should mention it as such in the title, or something.
  ```

  - u/TennisMaster2:

    It's not "pay-only."  It's a web-serial you can get in more sophisticated formats if you support the author monthly, and in html if you don't.  He just mixed his links up - [here's](https://www.patreon.com/davidstorrs?ty=h) the Star Wars bit.

    This may be slightly unrelated, but I think it needs to be said.  If the genre is to become more widely adopted then shaming authors for seeking remuneration for their works is counterproductive in the extreme.  While I understand it would be rude to regularly promote a web-serial only available to paid subscribers, this is not that, nor do I believe such a web-serial exists anywhere online (except perhaps in SF&F magazines or the *New Yorker*).

    Your feedback is valuable in that it tells eaglejarl some people may have difficulty learning by what means they may access his stories, and for pointing out a mistake.  In the future, please phrase your feedback more charitably.

      Hmm. Thanks for clarifying, and I'm glad it's available (and quite good)!

      My beef was with someone who I assumed made semi-frequent posts linking to a patreon account on a sub full of works that are generally assumed to be readily available to everyone. Now that I see that OP was definitely *not* such a person, I'll take it back. 

      It does seem that I'm not alone in this confusion, given the current voting on the post.
      ```

      - u/TennisMaster2:
        ```
        Aye - I think he was just a tad hasty out the door.

        > [A] sub full of works that are generally assumed to be readily available to everyone.

        This assumption I think limits the scope of the thread.  I honestly hope that in the future more and more pay-only works will be shared here, as more authors choose to write rational fiction for a living or to otherwise profit.
