  Wonderful chapter: I was definitely satisfied by the pace of things.  I'm not sure what the ratio should be, but this sort of chapter will do well to keep things moving, even if a lot of the chapters focus almost entirely on things that take only a small amount of time, like a conversation with Bill or the execution of the Abra-catching plan.

  I'm especially glad to see Red getting serious.  It's nice to see him take off the handicaps, and the practice he does in this chapter demonstrates the determination and capability I've been wanting from him without seeming like an unnatural  shift in his characterization.  I was never really convinced by his mother's argument against buying and selling clefairy, but his conversations with her and the line about disappointing her really sold the mental shift that the decision reveals, and the price he's paying to move towards his goals.

  Finally he's putting real time and effort into his psychic training, and it is very satisfying to see that pay off.  His progress is fast but doesn't seem too magical or game-breaking, and it's a natural extrapolation of what we already know about him.
  It shouldn't be too hard to quickly level him up with respect to his psychic abilities enough to open up new areas of scientific inquiry without making it seem too easy or making him powerful in the short-term relative to experienced psychics.  I'd love to see him do novel things with his powers, but it would seem fairly cheep for him to end up overpowered as a result of having held a weird mental partition for years, but insofar as he is particularly skilled it seems to come from his work-ethic, introspective skill, and knowledge pool, which is awesome.

  Still, I am a bit unhappy with what looks a lot like a complete dismissal of everything he learned from Bill.  He leveraged it into renewed focus and grit, but is he really going to just continue as he has been just because he's passionate about the field?  I'm not really clear on where he ended up at the end of his conversation with Leaf, but is he not going to even *try* learning about computers (or minds maybe, as a psychic) and seeing whether he has an aptitude?  It makes sense for Leaf to continue along her current path as she is building a skill and a platform that are applicable to any cause, but this isn't true for Red, so it'll be kind of bizarre if he learns a bunch of stuff about how the world might end and it doesn't really change his priorities at all.

  As for Leaf, I'm becoming more and more of a fan (like Red!).  She is great in her conversation with Red, and then great with her lead-finding strategy, and then great in her conversations with Zoey Palmer.  I'm really looking forward to whatever happens once she starts looking into the execution of the Renegade.

  In a sense not much happened with Blue this chapter, but what we did see struck me as kind of ominous.  He manages to act kindly and take the desires/perceptions of strangers into consideration, but it seems rather calculated, and he doesn't seem worried at all about having hurt her pokemon, to the extent that I'm unsure as a reader whether what happened was normal.  This is super great!  And it's cool to have the added uncertainty about whether some of his personality might be rubbing off on his pokemon, and whether they may end up as more vicious than those of others.  If so, I wonder whether Red and Leaf will notice, and how they'll react.

  I'm curious to hear what others think of Blue's darkness.  Does it seem to you all that he can just continue down the path he's walking without anything happening?  My reading, is that he'll come to some sort of real conflict with Red or especially Leaf, or that he'll do something that gets him awful PR (or even a Renegade branding eventually?) but I may be overestimating his "darkness" relative to the world he's in.

  Oh, and this chapter was super inspiring so I'm going to go meditate :)

    Yay to all the positive feedback! Glad you enjoyed it so much :)

    For the issue of Red's priorities, he's not completely convinced by Bill's cynicism of the importance of figuring out where pokemon come from and how they work the way they do. I'll see if I can communicate that a bit better, but basically while he does find Bill's work important, "learning things about how the world works" is still his main interest, "learning things about how pokemon work" is still his main focus, and "learning things about how psychic powers work" is still his current stepping stone to the above.  If he can leverage any of that knowledge into positive benefits to the other stuff Bill has been working on he will, but for now at the very least learning about how psychic powers work is something Bill and he both agree on, Bill because it could potentially help with AI alignment.

    Enjoy the meditation!

    As someone who disagrees with the majority view of the Rational community about the nature and implications of AI, I like how he's continuing to do what he's doing, and was kind of annoyed that he was led to believe that computers would make nothing else matter.

    The whole 'AGI is a huge threat' thing bugs me too but that's a more general bone I have to pick with the rational community.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Out of curiosity, have you read Superintelligence and found it unconvincing? Or do you find concerns on the nature and implications of AI unconvincing for other reasons?
      ```

      - u/Galap:
        ```
        Probably the best way to explain my viewpoint is to explain what it would take to convince me that the whole intelligence explosion/AI risk is valid.

        Humans have been at about the same level of intelligence for approximately 50000 years. That intelligence itself was not sufficient to directly lead to our increased capabilities. It indirectly led to it through development of knowledge and understanding, and it took humanity 50000 years to get to that point. But while it took milennia the first time, it only takes someone a few years of learning to get up to speed. That means the gap in humans' ability to understand things and their ability to *figure them out the first time* is very large. And I think that you can't get away from this problem, that this fact is based on deep aspects of the nature of reality and information theory, rather than being a shortcoming of just humans. 

        In addition it’s pretty obvious to me that humans’ capability of understanding things is far above the extent to which we actually understand anything, i.e. anatomically modern humans can attain a vastly greater technological and scientific level than we currently are at. So I think the window of ideas that a superintelligence could come up with that humans would not, but that humans could understand once presented to them, is actually quite large as well, contrary to what seems to be the main view.

        So that means that humans 'could' have theoretically performed actions that took them from the stone age to our current level in a single lifetime, right? Well yes and no, like so many things. You can't build the LHC in a day with 21st century technology, which is all it would have to work with to start out. We tend to make basic discoveries out-of-sequence, we uncover something that seems to be useless because we don’t yet have the other discoveries or the advances in the tools we need to put it to use. But if we hadn’t discovered it earlier, when we did get to the point we could make use of it we wouldn’t know to go looking for it because it doesn’t itself follow from that point. And those advances in tools take a lot of long iterative refinements to come into being.

        The second part is somehwat related. People seem to think that a superintelligence would immediately be able to make things that work without having to go through the long process of testing them, or that it will kind of inherently have ideas that are *correct*, by virture of its intelligence. I don't think that this is how it works. It won't start out knowing any more than we do, and the only way it can learn more is to perform actual experiments, and try to build things, fail for various reasons, and revise its designs based on those results. There's no free way to expand your models to include the cases where they break down: you have to do it the hard way, which is to actually perform those actions and see what happens. Sure it would be *better* at doing all these things than we are, but I don't think it could get to be so earth-shatteringly better so quickly, and here's why:

        As someone who works in experimental science, I can say that the rate limiting factor of progress is not in understanding the results of our experiments, but rather in imagining the correct experiments to perform which will reveal phenomena that we did not anticipate (which I think for the reasons above is a HARD problem) and in the time it takes to actually perform the experiments, and perform them with the rigor required to be confident of the resutlts.

        In other words, the way to convince me that AI risk is real is to demonstrate to me that the following two things are not inherent to the information-theoretic nature of reality but rather human-specific failings:

        1: the fact that it is MUCH easier to understand something after the fact or with an already existing example or proof than it is to devise it from nothing. (examples: it’s much easier to learn the concepts of relativity than it was for Einstein to devise them. We can understand the process of technological process and see how the changes in our society came from the technological changes we’ve experienced, but no one could predict this in advance.)

        2: theoretical models can only work well when combined with actual experimentation. You can’t design something and have it work the first time without testing it and modifying it based on what happens in the tests.

  Red, no! That's the path to the dark side! Trust other intelligent people to be swayed by the evidence that swayed you, or else to have objections worth hearing!

  Blue, no! That's another path to the dark side! Mary's and the instructor's concerns are completely reasonable, even if they portray you negatively! Also, it's good to have empathy more than just for show!

  Leaf- okay, that's sort of Slytherin, but not really dark. Carry on.

  I think the pace of the chapter worked well for a chapter like this, but I wouldn't want it all the time. It felt like it was getting the peices into place for future events. Not to say that it's unimportant, since significant things did happen, but it was a good montage between the bigger, slower story beats before and, presumably, after.
  ```

  - u/Cariyaga:
    ```
    Pffahahah, I've gotta say, your analysis of their actions really made me laugh.

    TBH I was pretty impressed with Blue for feigning empathy, even self-interestedly. That's one thing that I don't ever begrudge people lying on. :P
    ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Too bad there's no Star Wars in their world to teach valuable moral heuristics on quick-and-easy paths to power :) Or maybe there was an episode of PokeForce on it or something and they're too caught up in their own heads now. If Red starts telekinetically choking people for not giving him research funding, the others will probably stage an intervention.

    Hmm. I should probably do an omake chapter at some point...
    ```

- u/DaystarEld:

  Hey all, welcome back! A few things of note:

  First, I got a lot of great feedback for last chapter, so thank you everyone who commented! Overall, a lot of people who were new to the concepts explained in the chapter seemed to have enjoyed it, while those who were already familiar made good points about it being too anvilicious. I made some edits to try to reduce that, and even took the whole segment about the pokeball stasis out, so if it pops up again in the future, that's the reason why.

  Second, this chapter is my first attempt at consciously compressing the story to be more focused. It's the longest one yet at over 12k words, but each of the character perspectives in this one could easily have been their own chapter. I wanted to make a show of good faith to those who have been impatient with the speed of the plot progression, to acknowledge that I do hear the criticism and am trying to keep it in mind.

  As a result, I'm particularly interested in feedback again, as I'd like to know if anyone thinks a part of the chapter isn't paced properly or feels as if it's lacking detail or context. It might take some time for me to strike the right balance, but I hope the chapter is still enjoyable for everyone. 

  Thanks for reading!

    I had to reread the previous chapter, since I was confused by the "everyone's going to probably die in a generation or two?". Do they mean a not aligned AGI or a meteor/antibiotic resistant pandemic?

    Also I am bewildered that they didn't clean the bucket before sitting to plan.

    Said that, I enjoyed immensely the chapter. It's nice to see Red and Leaf pursuing their objectives and scale up while remaining human. Usually I was really taken in Blue's battles, but this seemed almost boring. I think just wanting to beat the League is too two dimensional now that the others had an upgrade on their motivations.

    I don't know if you had already answered this but I'm really interested: how many of Red's mental techniques do you personally use, and what are your resources for good writing that you use for Leaf?

    Thanks for writing!

      >I had to reread the previous chapter, since I was confused by the "everyone's going to probably die in a generation or two?". Do they mean a not aligned AGI or a meteor/antibiotic resistant pandemic?

      More the former :)

      >Also I am bewildered that they didn't clean the bucket before sitting to plan.

      Eh, it's not a lot, and he hasn't eaten yet, so it's mostly just bile. Does that make it better? Probably not, but in my head they don't care as much.

      >I think just wanting to beat the League is too two dimensional now that the others had an upgrade on their motivations.

      Yeah, that's kind of why I made sure he had a *reason* to want to beat the League and become champion. It's definitely not a motivation that on its own I find interesting, even if it's done really well in some stories like Game of Champions.

      >I don't know if you had already answered this but I'm really interested: how many of Red's mental techniques do you personally use, and what are your resources for good writing that you use for Leaf?

      Some. I already made a flowchart of the one he followed back in Body and Mind, and I've been thinking of doing more blog posts lately, some of which would be about the techniques Red uses.  I'll see if I can make the time for them sometime this month.

      As for the writing resources, mostly a combination of personal experience and online research. If you google around for it you can find some good websites for journalistic writing advice or just general rules to persuasive writing.

  Can't wait to see Red bring psychic powers into the domain of Science! All that pseudoscientific mystic crap that they were perpetuating up until now will start to be debunked! Finally! :D

    Yep! Either that, or the world really is crazy and Red'll go insane! :D

        Technically foreshadowing happens in the story, I believe. Anything said here is either Word of God or just the author gleefully messing with readers ;)

  Okay, does Zoey Palmer have blue or brown eyes here? You mentioned they're blue on the first meeting with Leaf, then they're brown on the second?


  I love Red's idea of being prepared by putting the bucket there.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Shit, I knew I forgot something. The original idea was to say that she put contacts in for interviews to soften her gaze because someone told her before that it was disconcerting, then I wasn't sure if that was stupid or not and decided to edit it out, but forgot to change the mention of the brown eyes.

    Thanks for the reminder! Good *eye* for detail! Eh? Eye? Eh?

    (I'm sorry)

  People are mentioning the montage feel, but tbh this feels like the *correct* balance.  Not just in a "this successfully balances out the slowness of other chapters" sense but a "this should be the *baseline*" sense.

        Also good to know :) I get a mix of feedback on story length and the amount of worldbuilding: just trying to find a better balance between the two, if it exists.

  First of all. I realy enjoy P:TOoS.
  I woud like to ask; What about trinkets? In game, pokemons can hold items like berries or fangs. Will trainers give theirs pokemons something? Maybe a skarf around their neck?
  I woud like to ready that Red, Blue and Leaf build some bonds with their pokemons. Maybe that Blue paint his handprint on Matauris shell and it stays on even when she evolve?
  Thanx for responding. Big fan. :)

  Wonderful. Ever since the ability was first teased, I've been waiting for Red to start realising his psychic potential. To me, psychics are one of the most underused aspects of the Pokemon fandom. 

  What is it like, being a psychic in the world of Pokemon. What is day to day life like when you can sense the minds of not just other humans, but the whole spectrum of Pokemon intellects? How is your ability to battle Pokemon affected, when you can actually feel the suffering of the animal you're giving orders to? Are you allowed to even go into casinos? If not, what else can you not do?

  How do Pokemon react to you? Now that Red has begun training his passive reception, are the Abra going to prefer him over the others? I imagine they would; as psychic Pokemon, wouldn't another psychic mind seem the most familiar to them? Or perhaps not; apart from dark types, I imagine that some of the most successful competitors / predators an Abra could face would be other psychics. Perhaps they'll see him as a greater threat instead?

  And finally, as we saw in Misty's chapter, being able to feel the emotions of other people doesn't seem to be an ability you can turn off. Once Red learns passive reception and fully opens his psychic 'ears', so to speak, how is that going to affect how he interacts with other people?

  EDIT: Something I just saw rereading Misty's chapter. One guys talks about how he knew 'only psychics with a teleporter and trainers with flyers' could respond quickly enough to the Pokemon migration. Is training psychic pokemon to a high level so much easier for Psychics, that some abilities (such as teleportation) are really only utilised by human psychics in conjuction with their pokemon?

    >To me, psychics are one of the most underused aspects of the Pokemon fandom.

    Agreed. It boggles my mind how rarely it's touched on in other pokemon media.

    >Is training psychic pokemon to a high level so much easier for Psychics, that some abilities (such as teleportation) are really only utilised by human psychics in conjuction with their pokemon?

    It's definitely easier, and opens up more possibilities. A normal trainer can train an abra to teleport them to a specific location by rote. A psychic can communicate with their abra to teleport them to a different place on command.

  ```
  I really got a Worm vibe from this chapter for some reason. This is a good thing. 
  Just out of curiousity, how many chapters do you think are left in OoS?
  On an unrelated not the time travel entry for rational writing was excellent.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    If I had to make a rough guess, it would be a total of about 120 chapters in total. That's a rather daunting number considering the pace in which these come out, so hopefully chapters like this help to keep things moving a bit faster. Or maybe I luck out in my various ventures someday and am able to write as a full time job :)
