  Wild Seed is about how two immortals relate to each other as the only long-lived humans on the planet. They have major disagreements in how they each attempt to create fellow immortal champions and there's strong themes of slavery and unique usage of social power.

  I bring this story up here because it sounds like something people here are interested in, even if no one's obviously rationalist (just enlightened self-interest at best). It also has the best treatment of an ancient mind that I have ever seen.

  Has anyone here read it and what do you think of it?

    I have not, but on the basis of Bloodchild I am willing to try out another Octavia Butler fic. 

    (In Bloodchild, the protagonist is a member of a small colony of humans living on an alien planet. The humans live on a reservation and are used by the aliens to brood their young in a rather Alien/ichneumon wasp kind of way, except that death is not inevitable. The story is about the possibility of the protagonist playing host to another character's young.)

  Ooooooh, man do I have a love for stories exploring the lives of immortals that actually express that they're immortal in a way besides "I'm so tired of life I want to die."

  Adding this to my list.

    You might want to add Poul Anderson's "Boat of a Million Years" to that list as well.

  I read this as a teenager and forgot the title and author. After reading Jason Shiga's Demon, I remembered this story vividly but couldn't remember the title. Thanks for linking this!

  This is one of my favorite stories. I highly recommend it to the kind of people who don't pay attention to Content Warnings when they open a new piece of fiction. I don't exactly remember what it was, but for some reason after reading this I did not lend it my 4-years-younger sister like I did with most of my novels.
