## [RT] A rationalist in the Zombie Apocalypse

### Post:

"Forget it, Laura," Dave said, "I'm going after her, and that's all there is to it."

"Me too," Trish agreed, strapping her combat knife to her leg.

"Guys, I'm not arguing that you *shouldn't*," I said, trying to keep the frustration out of my voice. "I'm just saying there's a motorcycle dealership *on the way.* Why don't we stop and get some armor? You can't just run around in jeans and a t-shirt!"

"UGH. Not this again." Dave rolled his eyes and Trish tried to hide a weary grin. I'd been traveling with these morons for about a week and a half, but was starting to feel my desire for human interaction *thoroughly* slaked.

"If there's one thing I'm glad died with the old world," Dave said, "It's helmet laws. I'll be damned if they rise from the dead, too." He swung a leg over his chopper and kicked the starter to life. Trish climbed on behind him.

The thing was *at least* 110 decibels.

"Hold on, do you have your--" but before I could finish the sentence, they had roared off down the road toward town.

A glance over at my ATV anwered the question: Their walkie-talkies were still next to the charging cradle. *Next to.* They hadn't even charged them up after I'd insisted they take them last time.

I sighed and climbed in to the cab, going over my pre-mission checklist:

--

**VEHICLE**

☑Vehicle Mechanically sound

☑No loose panels

☑Batteries fully charged

**COMBAT**

☑Armor free of defects

☑Alpenstock

☑Air tank full

☑Marker in good working order

☑Ammunition

**FANNY PACK**

☑Emergency rations

☑Water purification pump

☑Walkie-Talkie

☑Door cable

☑Door wedges

☑Soldering torch

☑Multitool

☑Ball Gag

☑Flash Light

☑GPS

☑Crybaby

--

Everything looked good, so I punched in the hospital on my GPS and trundled off after the two idiots.

Sure enough, the road into town was full of zombies, no doubt drawn by the passing cacophony of the motorcycle. When they saw my little ATV, they came shambling toward it. I pushed through the mass, the large wedge welded to the push bar parting them like the red sea. They scrabbled at the cab, but the polycarbonate panels I'd bolted over all the openings afforded no purchase to their questing fingers.

I keyed the gate signal on my walkie-talkie so it would patch me through the shortwave repeater I had set up back at base camp. "Alcatraz, this is Laura. You there?"

After a few seconds, Joey's voice came back, "Hey Laura. What's up?"

"Trying to save these idiots' kid. They fucking *left* her behind on a salvage mission. Can you believe that?"

"Shit...is she okay? Did she radio you?"

"*No.* Every time I tell them to take their walkie-talkies they act like I'm their mom asking if they packed fresh underwear."

"Jesus. So...where are you?"

"Just crossed the border into Utah. It'll probably take me a few more weeks to reach you, especially when I have to waste charge on bullshit like this."

"Well--oh, shit. I got a bite. We got 3 Salmon over 30lbs already today. I'm telling you, the zombie apocalypse was the best thing that ever happened to fishermen. Talk to you tomorrow?"

"Over and out," I confirmed.

I saw Dave and Trish's bike parked in the hospital lot, surrounded by a milling sea of zombies. I flicked a switch on the dash and the salvaged ice-cream truck PA on the back of the ATV stared blaring an off-key Turkey in the Straw. The zombies surged toward my little vehicle in a wave, and I led them on for a few blocks before shutting off the PA and dropping a crybaby through a small hole in the floor.

A crybaby was a device I built a few dozen of after scavenging a toystore in Denver. They're just the voicebox from a baby doll wired into a cheap walkie-talkie. When triggered remotely by the CTCSS from my radio, they start to cry like an infant, the perfect decoy or bait for zombies.

I triggered this one immediately and left the majority of the horde behind, searching dully for the nonexistant baby while I circled back to the hospital.

When I got there, I climbed out of the hatch on the roof, alpenstock at the ready. It's a weapon of my own device, based on the old mountaineering tool. It's a 6-foot rod of oak, topped with the head of a spontoon tomahawk. It had good reach, and in close-quarters situations I can unscrew the top two feet to make a one-handed weapon.

I cleared out the handful of stragglers that had stayed behind or followed me back, then climbed down and headed into the hospital. 

As I made my way to the second floor, a pair of zombies, one in scrubs and another in a medical gown, burst out of a door and tackled me to the ground.

"God...damn it," I muttered. They bit and pawed ineffectually at me as I struggled to get to my feet. Apparently frustrated by the impregnability of the kevlar motorcycle jacket to human teeth, the doctor zombie tried to drag it up to expose my belly. 

Unfortunately for him, I'm not a complete moron. My jacket is affixed to my pants, gloves and hood by heavy brass zippers, secured from working their way open by little steel clasps on the zipper pulls. Even my socks and pants are attached that way--you can never be too careful about crawlers.

I couldn't really get a good angle to swing my alpenstock, so I brought up my paintball marker and put a 12 gram lead ball into the patient's skull, then kicked the doctor off and spit his head open with the alpenstock.

I got up, checked the integrity of my armor, and was about to get back to searching when I heard the worst imaginable sound: gunfire on the roof.

I swore under my breath and sprinted up the stairs, my panting causing condensation on the inside of my mask. I burst out onto the roof to find Dave, Trish, their daughter Coral, and a couple of strangers were desperately trying to fend of an advancing swarm of zombies.

I raised my marker and peered through the reflex sight. I took down four zombies as I advanced, then dropped another with a kick to the knee with my steel-toed boot and executed it.

The paintball gun was a little .50 cal that had belonged to my neighbor's kid back in Indiana before all this started. It didn't need gunpowder, just compressed air from the SCUBA compressor I had back at base. Additionally, it made hardly any noise and I could cast my on ammunition quite easily--all I needed was some scavenged fish weights or old pipes.

Unsurprisingly, Dave was already out of ammo for his stupid revolver, and Trish was brandishing her combat knife as if it was any fucking good at all. The strangers had a shotgun and a glock, and between the three of us we managed to finish the job.

"You alright?" I called.

The shotgun and glock immediately swiveled to point at me.

"Why are you wearin' a mask?" the big bald guy with the shotgun demanded.

"Oh for fuck's sake, it's to keep the fucking zombies from biting my fucking *face!* Why are *you* wearing cutoff shorts and a wifebeater? The world is crawling with creatures that want to gnaw you to death and nobody even wears a goddamn jacket!"

"Sorry about her," Dave said, "She's kinda preachy."

I closed my eyes and counted to ten, then walked over to the door through which the zombies had been coming and closed it, jamming a doorstop wedge from my fanny pack underneath.

"Okay," I said, having regained my composure. "Was anyone bitten?"

Everyone shook their heads. The scrawny guy with the Glock surreptitiously hid his arm behind his back.

"You. Glock. Did you get bitten?"

"Uh...no."

"Tell me the truth."

Shotgun turned to Glock. "If you got bit, tell me, so I can shoot you in the head."

"Or what?" Glock demanded.

"Or I'll shoot you in the head."

"Nobody's shooting anybody in the head!" I shouted. "Look! I've got a ball gag. If anyone got bit, they can put it on for 24 hours, and if they turn, they'll be no threat to anybody."

"Laura!" Dave said sharply, "We don't give out charity! The people are more dangerous than the zombies out here!"

I stared at him. A creeping realization suddenly dawned on me. 

"Oh my god," I said, "You're all infected. You're all zombies."

"Laura?" Trish said. "I think you're overheating in all that armor. Why don't you take it off?"

"No, seriously," I said, "That's why everyone I've met have been acting like idiots. You're not *full* zombies, but you *are* infected. The disease hasn't completely hollowed you out, but it has lowered your intelligence and turned you into paranoid, violent, stupid assholes who can barely utilize the resources around them. That's why people can manage to lose against an enemy that just walks toward noises in a straight line and then tries to bite them."

I suddenly felt myself smile. "Actually that makes this a lot easier. So long, idiots. I'm going to California."

I turned around to see a thick plume of black smoke coming out of the door I'd emerged onto the roof through.

"Uh...Dave. Do you know anything about this?"

The pride in Dave's voice was audible as he said, "Yeah! We lit a couple fires downstairs before coming up here, to prevent any zombies from following us. Who're the idiots *now?"*

  HAHAHAHA! Amazing, simply amazing. The wedge on van is a near perfect tool for dealing with a horde block, coming second only to a snowplow of course.

  I don't think the alpenstock is that great a weapon. When using the full length, there's going to be a lot of stress on the point that's apparently screwed on. And it would take time to unscrew. She's probably better with two weapons.

    Yeah, the premise definitely needs a hand-wave, but I wanted to address the utter stupidity most of the characters seem to exhibit in The Walking Dead, for example, and the only way to really do that is run with the same premise.

      Oh, one small thing:  you don't end a radio conversation with "Over and out", it's just "Out.".  'Over' means "I've finished what I was saying and am waiting for your response."  'Out' means "I'm done talking, period."  Using both together is like saying, "Okay, your turn...psych!"

      The paintball marker was a really clever trick.  Can you actually jazz them up enough to be lethal without rupturing the tank, especially when firing lead ammo instead of paintballs?
      ```

      - u/Tinfoil_Haberdashery:
        ```
        Man, I'm a ham, I should know that about the radio.

        As to the paintball gun, it's hard to say. A regular paintball gun fires ~4g projectiles at 300 feet per second, but can usually achieve higher muzzle velocities than the 300fps limit paintball fields impose for safety and comfort. Call it 400fps (120 m/s) at the top end. This translates to ~30 joules of energy that the projectile can deliver on impact. Normally, the high-surface area, lightweight paintball decellerates a lot in flight and a lot of the remaining energy is dissapated into bursting the paintball.

        If you were to use a lead ball, the muzzle energy would theoretically be similar (~30 joules) but that would translate to a much heavier projectile moving much more slowly. It would also be less affected by air resistance due to its slower speed and greater mass. Upon impact, it would deliver much more of that energy to the target instead of bursting.

        30 joules is about the same muzzle energy as a reasonably powerful air rifle, albeit one that is designed for rodents and birds. I *have* seen video on youtube of a hunter using such a rifle to bring down wild pigs, so 30 joules to the head *can* be lethal.

        Whether the more distributed impact of the projectile due to its greater surface area would render it nonlethal, or whether the barrel length and mechanism of the marker would be able to impart the full 30 joules to a lead ball, I don't know.
        ```

        - u/eaglejarl:
          ```
          > Call it 400fps (120 m/s) at the top end.

          Hm.  According to the Wikipedia page on [air guns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_gun), there have been significantly more powerful ones:

          > In the 17th century, air guns, in calibers .30–.51, were used to hunt big game deer and wild boar. These air rifles were charged using a pump to fill an air reservoir and gave velocities from 650 to 1,000 feet per second (200–300 m/s). They were also used in warfare, the most recognized example being the Girandoni air rifle.

          also
          > Spring-piston guns have a practical upper limit of 1250 ft/s (380 m/s) for .177 cal (4.5 mm) pellets.

          There's also [the Dragon Slayer](http://www.pyramydair.com/article/_50_Caliber_Dragon_Slayer_Air_Rifle_December_2007/45) air rifle, which shoots at 1,000 fps.  Oh, and I found a [cool calculator](http://www.pyramydair.com/article/What_is_Muzzle_Energy_August_2003/5) for airgun energy/speed/bullet mass.  I actually found this thing a long time ago when I was writing 2YE; I used it to calculate the details of the steam cannon that the protagonist built.  I'd forgotten about it and it was cool to run over it again.
          ```

          - u/Tinfoil_Haberdashery:
            ```
            Well...yeah, there are more powerful air rifles, and virtually all air rifles have a higher muzzle velocity. But there are two common types of air rifle you can find at virtually any sports store:

            Break Barrel: very sustainable weapon, reloaded by cocking the barrel like a lever to compress a pneumatic cylinder or spring. Downsides: takes many seconds to reload between each shot.

            CO2: High rate of fire but requires CO2 cylinders in addition to ammo, reducing sustainability.

            Neither of these would be particularly practical, since the break-barrel (the kind I personally own) takes way too long to reload and the CO2 type requires a rare resource.

            There are other options; Pre-charged pneumatic (PCP) air rifles are probably the best option for a zombie situation since they can fire multiple rounds in quick succession with high power and accuracy. However, they're pretty specialty and quite uncommon. Most people who would lay down the cash for one would just as soon get a gunpowder firearm, so most stores don't carry them.

            In addition to their rarity, PCP guns only get about 30 shots per recharge--not terrible, but not great.

            Meanwhile paintball markers are very common, get hundreds of shots per recharge, and have an insane rate of fire compared to any of the others.

            They might not be the most effective or powerful, but I wanted this story to be tempered by what the protagonist could realistically get her hands on. Otherwise she'd be driving around in a solar-powered electric tank.

    While a disease that spread via biting indeed wouldn't work, in the walking dead everyone is infected by the virus. It may have just spread like the common cold, and then spontaneously turned 99.9% of humans.
    ```

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      Interesting. Good choice on the writers part. 

      Has it been established whether the disease is passed on from mother to fetus? If it is, then this is the last generation of humans.
      ```

      - u/illmuri:
        ```
        The way it actually works is the virus is latent in everyone. It didnt really turn 99.9% of everyone at once. Rather, the virus is in you until you die. When you die it takes over your motor functions. The problem is when in major cities you have a few hundred people dying every day. They start killing and then there is exponential growth, and no localized area to contain.

        In the show, corpses show signs of progressive deterioration as time passes. In a decade or so I figure the zombies will mostly be gone, and any surviving settlements will just have to take up vigils over sick and old people and practice cremation.
        ```

        - u/eaglejarl:

          Makes sense.  Thanks for the explanation.

          I think there's a viral load minimum that can cause spontaneous turning, too. That's why a bite will turn you even though you're already infected.

            ```
            I believe the premise is that biting you doesn't give you the zombie virus. Biting you gives you something else that simply kills you and the zombie virus takes over.

            Of course, the two are probably related. Occam's Razor.

  This is pretty great, and now I'm curious: is there a well written and scientifically accurate article somewhere on what technologies would be usable during an apocalypse? I'm pretty sure GPS would be fine for decades, while gasoline would disappear quickly. Not sure what would happen with batteries. Obviously anything that can be charged via solar would be fine for as long as solar panels are, but I imagine lithium ion batteries would wear out pretty quickly and something like walkie talkies would be nearly useless after a decade.
  ```

  - u/Tinfoil_Haberdashery:
    ```
    It's an interesting question. Solar panels will last decades, and are probably the lowest-maintainance power source--but you're right. Batteries are inherrently quite fragile and won't last forever even if babied. The lithium battery in your phone might last a few years, the lead battery in your car about the same.

    If you had a lot of solar panels and a stable base of operations, I suspect a mechanical power storage method would work--pumping water into a tower and then using a dynamo to turn that stored potential energy back into electricity on its way to water your crops.

    Barring such a complex solution, you'd probably be stuck with using electricity only during the day, and then only in amounts that solar panels could provide on a continuous basis--no welding for you, unless you've got a ton.

    Internal combustion engines wouldn't be entirely beyond reach; gasoline engines could run on ethanol, and deisel engines could run on peanut oil or other liquid fats.

    I know primitive batteries could also be devised with commonly available metals and simple vinegar or fruit juices, but that's not particularly efficient.
    ```

    - u/thenebular:
      ```
      Lead acid car batteries are actually pretty darn simple and you can make your own sulfuric acid using instructions from chemistry books you can find is pretty much any library. If you've got the lead for the paintball marker, you can refurbish the car batteries. In fact if you don't care about size, you can build your own cells to make maintenance easier.

      However mechanical power would be king, so hydro dams would become prime real estate
      ```

      - u/Tinfoil_Haberdashery:
        ```
        Interesting. Unfortunately I have only an end-user's knowledge of battery chemistry, but if lead acids are really that simple to build and maintain then they'd be a prime candidate for power storage.

        I don't know about hydro dams. Few rivers have just one dam, and if one of the dams upstream gives up, it could trigger a domino effect that could be very bad news.

        Also, if you're staying in one place for any length of time, I think you could set up hydrogen electrolysis and/or methane biodigesters to fuel internal combustion engines, which would make much more portable mechanical power.

          Lead acids are really simple, but they're low voltage so the energy density is low (and they are horrible environmentally, with all that lead and acid). You wouldn't want them as primary storage or we'd be using them today.

          Hydro dams are designed as low maintenance for safety, so there isn't much danger they would fail as dams, but even if they did a dam further downstream wouldn't be affected much as it has a very large reservoir behind it to absorb most of the water. Really hydro electric would be the easiest way for people to get power. You want to find the cheapest and easiest way to get electricity, just look back to what they used in the beginning. Water wheels did most everything because it was cheap and most important, constant.

      But what do you do after fifty years for solar panels? I think current solar panels for consumer use (that attach to homes, I don't know about portable camping ones) are meant to last ~30 years. Just like lithium batteries, I don't think they'd be replaceable without a bunch of infrastructure.

      I didn't know cars could run on peanut oil. That's pretty neat.

        For electricity generation the best solution is hydro. It has very low maintenance (could propably run decades with just cleaning the waterway) and its renewable. They can scale from very small (enough for a small house) to really massive.I would secure a source like that. Plus you need water anyway.

        Storage is trickier and baterries wont last long. One thing i can think of is using our spare hydro generator power to electrolize water into hydrogen. Now petrol internal combustion engines can run on hydrogen and air very nicely with small modification (basically bypass the fuel rails entirely and just add hydrogen in the air intake directly with a valve to regulate power). Biggest issue is how to put the hydrogen in a tank but we could salvage some equipment somewhere and have unlimited fuel.

        WE can also use this with portable petrol generator for remote sites we might need electricity.

            Yea i agree its dangerous, thats why I meantioned the storage is the biggest issue. I would not stockpile it in big quantities or in big tanks for sure. Small car tanks for ~50km range and away from each other. Produce-consume in some kind of schedule plus some extra in case of need.

        They're usually guaranteed to lose no more than 20% of their output after 25 or 30 years, so they'll still be useful after 50.

    /r/collapse is open for AMAs and very rationally-minded. We'd love to answer those questions!

    GPS would be down within 60 days. Energy is a huge concern, but not in the way you think: electric cars, for example, seem like a great idea when the gasoline infrastructure collapses, but don't forget that cars need good and free roads too. Without the rule of law, roads would instantly turn into prime ambush material. Solar panels and inverters would be the most sought after things in a post-apocalytic world, because they make lighting, manufacturing and cooking practically free. Unfortunately they need to operate in the open (drawing attention) and they're quite fragile too. So I doubt that we'd be able to operate a solar-based society for much longer than a few decades.

  A great source of lead is automotive wheel weights, the kind that crimp onto the rim.  Hit up one good sized parking lot and you'll have pounds of lead.  Hit up a tire shop and you have more than you could use in a life time.  And it's not likely to be a heavily looted resource.

  The lead alloy used is also pretty good for firearms since it's harder than pure lead, meaning you can drive the bullet to reasonable muzzle velocities.

  This reminds me of [Zombie Apocalypse,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_Apocalypse_\(film\)) a zombie movie by "The Asylum" of all companies. It's the only zombie movie I know where people act rationally and deaths are due to unforseen situations and calculated risks rather than being a dumbass. Bite checks, getting armor, meeting other survivors and exchanging information rather than being jackasses... good movie.

  I think it's more "rational" than "rationalist", btw.

    In retrospct, "pragmatist" would have been a more accurate term for the protagonist. This is definitely more a story about rationality than rationalism.

  I've never seen The Walking Dead, so how much of this is directly referencing it?
  ```

  - u/Tinfoil_Haberdashery:
    ```
    There aren't any explicit references except the main characters' daughter; in The Walking Dead, the protagonist's son is named Carl, but he has an accent that makes it sound like Coral. 

    However, this story wouldn't be out of place in virtually any episode of The Walking Dead. The overarching theme of the show seems to be that the rational self-interest of various individual factions results in a tragedy of the commons that works against the interests of humanity as a whole; it's not the zombies that are the threat, it's the other humans.

    However, to maintain that narrative and its resulting tension, the show often resorts to improbable bad luck and/or inexplicable incompetence. It's also heavily rule-of-cooled, so loud motorcycles and sleeveless shirts are somehow seen as reasonable in a universe where the primary threat is drawn to loud noises and wants to nibble you to death.
    ```

    the loud motorcycle, lack of helmets and armor, forgetting walkie talkies, not using ball gags or crybabies.. pretty much everything. there are more rational characters in the story as well, and they tend to live longer.. but one of the main characters, Daryl, a badass Georgian moonshiner who uses a crossbow and rides a very loud motorcycle *everywhere he goes* hasn't died yet.

  ~~A .50 caliber ball of lead would weigh more than 12 grams. A 12 gram ball of lead would be too small to work in a .50 bore, unless used with an improvised sabot, like some kind of gelatin capsule around it.~~ Nevermind, the weight is right. My instincts were wrong about that point. The problem would be that the lead ball would weight about 10 times as much as the 1.25 gram .50 paintball the marker is designed to work with. The character would need to modify the valve settings significantly to get sufficient velocity to penetrate a skull, and would only get around 20 shots per tank at those settings. Unmodified, the marker would just have enough power to push the ball far enough to go about 6 feet. Firing at a 45 degree angle for maximum distance, the ball might not exit the barrel. Part of this would be because of hop up, a technique used in smooth bore air guns to increase range by giving the ball backspin through warping the barrel. Soft paintballs can deform easily to get past the bends but lead would get jammed up.  
  Protip: there are companies that make legit compressed air hunting rifles, for use in controlling large pests in environments where you might not have a good backstop. They mostly get used with night vision optics to put down foxes or coyotes prowling for livestock, poultry, and housepets, without contributing significant noise pollution. The main character could have grabbed one from a pest control business. These are designed for lethal use, some are powerful enough for deer, and they tend to get 25-35 shots per tank.
  ```

  - u/Tinfoil_Haberdashery:
    ```
    I think you're probably right about the muzzle velocity.  I thought hop-up was more used on airsoft and not on paintball, though? Not sure.

    I actually wrote this a while back and having just found this subreddit, thought it would be a good fit. Since then, I've done a fair bit more research on air rifles. If I were to do a rewrite, I'd probably give the protagonist a pre-charged pneumatic .25 calibre pellet gun.
    ```

    - u/hobodemon:
      ```
      The pellet gun might not work wither, depending on velocity. They make pellet rifles that will go supersonic but with a pellet that small and light you'll lose velocity quickly to air resistance and go transonic around 50 yards. It probably wouldn't sufficiently damage a brain to disable a zombie. Go with an air rifle built for hunting, in the .375 caliber neighborhood.  
      One more point: a rational person would probably keep rope with them in a zombie apocalypse. Herd of zombies took over the first floor? Rappel off on the clearest side of the building. You could feasibly keep a few 100 foot bundles of parachute cord in a backpack. They're stretchy under load, but two strands will support a person. The cords would be narrow and uncomfortable for a traditional rappel, but a controlled descent could be achieved with a pair of prusik knots for support. Put your weight on one, and slide the other, put your weight on that one and slide the first one down. It's time consuming but better than losing your grip, and you could rest indefinitely and go back up too.  
      Anyway. Great read. Just wanted to say she can probably still solve the situation she's in at the end. The knots she would need to know are a prusik hitch, and a figure 8 loop. Both of these are such useful knots you can find them on wikipedia.
      ```

      - u/Tinfoil_Haberdashery:
        ```
        Good thought. There are few situations for which rope *isn't* useful.

        I have a belt I made using some seatbelt webbing and a V-ring quick fit bar. It's a great belt and I've used it to rappel before. Not as comfortable as a real harness, but it doesn't look out of place in most company.

        I honestly think you could make a figure-8 type of thing, even if you couldn't loot one. That would make rappelling a lot easier.

        I've seen a video on Youtube where a guy took out a couple of wild pigs with a .22 subsonic air rifle. Precise headshots, of course, but since that's the only thing that works on zombies anyway, I think it's plausible.
        ```

        - u/hobodemon:
          ```
          For better improvised rappelling harnesses, I recommend a Swiss Seat. Or just two alpine butterfly knots right next to each other, and use the excess rope as a waist belt.
