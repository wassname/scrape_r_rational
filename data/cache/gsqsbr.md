  I'm really proud of this chapter: I'm actually really glad we cut it in two because this one is so much better as it stands alone to introduce >!Julias, the golem-cum-house elf!<. It's a concept I always enjoyed, and the transformation scenes made a phD mathematician in my life extremely excited - hopefully someone will work out why.

  There's a discord, which has been awesome fun, so I recommend you join it because I love everyone. Link's on the actual AO3 page. 

  I like alien aliens, and Julias is my attempt at that. He's probably too human, so maybe more of a nod/homage.

  Someone on my last post also asked me if the story was any good since it's a Romance (uh, I wrote it, so I hope so?), but I thought I'd include my response in case anyone is wondering:

  -----

  It's not the main thing in that there's no quivering members or anything like that; it's an urban fantasy story set in 1944. There are no sex scenes in the story, though the characters do canonically have sex (you know, the old "in bed, fade to black" sort of teen-appropriate way).

  Standard human-vampire romance (both men, which seems to turn a lot of people off offhand, but eh), but there's deep worldbuilding. Starts out with the MCs falling for each other, but then it becomes about the obstacles that start falling between them being together and how they overcome it. 

  Apart from the worldbuilding (which I literally have had a phD mathematician who also has a physics degree help me get right), I've been told people consider the writing itself high-quality (I've aimed to have it be very polished and well-edited). 

  The reason it's rational is because this is not a romance where the conflict is from comical misunderstandings: the partners communicate with each other, they work on their relationship, and they experience growth because of it. 


  Here's some praise I've got from an /r/rational perspective if you'd like to hear what others have to say:

  EDIT: "This chapter is a delight, tight and careful and slightly horrifying." is a compliment we just received for this chapter so that was good

  "Itâ€™s not Animorphs the Reckoning but dangit sometimes I just want Visser Three and Marco to sit and drink coffee for ten pages and maybe kiss" - /u/Callmesalticidae

  "Normally I go [to r/rational] for munchkinry and fun, but this was good and gripping, and I read the entire story to date in one sitting." - anonymous

  "You know what you do well? Presenting strange information to our blank slate stand-in and have him actually ask questions about how things work. He's asking questions I actually want to know" - /u/leakycauldron

  DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:

  * what do you think William's up to with the phone call / Sardinia / etc?

  * can you munchkin the magic items mentioned? 

  * would you ask any questions that Red missed? (I might answer them in character if you want)

  * do you think Julias is happy?

  * i'm trying a summary in the title, because i sort of have realised that the a r t i s t i c flower names aren't very descriptive. I don't think I quite hit the mark this time: any ways I could do better?

    Is the golem the only 4th dimensional creature around, or is there an entire well, "realm" in the fourth dimension?
    ```

    - u/AngelaCastir:
      ```
      Firstly: yay!!! I'm glad it was obvious enough for someone to get it because none of the characters in the story would have any idea how to explain it in-text (including Julias: I think there's a philosophical concept of "can a fish explain what water is", and I don't think Julias is quite 4D to us the way we are 3D to people in Flatland). 

      Anything that transforms uses the 4th dimension to do so (e.g. vampire fangs, werewolves),  but my physics/maths educated husband 100% assures me that most magic can be achieved using 4 dimensional physics (actually I think it's basically string theory?). But a lot of the magic you see (the trunks/etc being bigger on the inside, the infinite vial of water) can be trivially explained with 4D.
