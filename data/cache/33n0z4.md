## [Meta] What's your username on this sub, and why did you chose it?

### Post:

If we're going to have a post about flairs, why not a post about usernames?

### Comments:

- u/Nevereatcars:
  ```
  I'm a good advice giver and I wanted my username to reflect that.
  ```

- u/Transfuturist:
  ```
  I'm transgender, transhumanist, and a futurist.
  ```

  - u/rineSample:
    ```
    -Kwizatz Haderach

    M...Muad'Dib... is that you?
    ```

    - u/Transfuturist:
      ```

      ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I used to be writing a thing.
  ```

- u/xamueljones:
  ```
  I choose xamueljones, because I like to have a normal name with the first letter switched out for an uncommon letter (J, Q, X, Z). For example, I would take Richard and change it to Qichard. Hence Samuel had s switched out with an x.

  Names where no (sane) parent would ever name their child feel weird to use. That goes double for usernames with numbers at the end. I suspect that people who don't put a decent amount of time (a few minutes at least) into picking a name tend to treat politeness in social interactions on an online communities as a suggestion instead of a necessity. If you aren't going to care how you are perceived by others through your username, then you aren't going to care if others get offend by what you say or do.

  I added jones to the end and made the name lower-case to subtly honor /u/alexanderwales because he was the one to lead me to /r/rational and reddit in general via [The Last Christmas](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9915682/1/The-Last-Christmas). By matching his style of all lower caps and a first-last name, I can pattern my username after 'alexanderwales' without being too similar.
  ```

- u/capsless:
  ```
  after my preferred typing style

  ('nocaps' was taken)
  ```

- u/Chronophilia:
  ```
  I like thinking about time travel.
  ```

  - u/TimTravel:
    ```
    Same.
    ```

- u/2-4601:
  ```
  Simply a reference to one of my most fondly remembered works of fiction, along with a dollop of satisfaction knowing that most looking at it will get it wrong.
  ```

- u/puesyomero:
  ```
  it roughly translates as "merely myself" from an Mexican idiom. started using the account name as a joke to troll a friend on Fanfiction ("who are you!?!" "merely myself dear") but afterwards kept it there and on other places :)
  ```

- u/Chosen_Pun:
  ```
  I really like meta-humor, and "Chosen Pun" has several such layers of personal significance beyond the obvious.
  ```

- u/PeridexisErrant:
  ```
  It's a reference to *Wizards at War*, and the traditions of magic in that universe.

  The Peridexis Effect is the difference between speaking in the language of magic and actually casting a spell, and hence a reminder that [words have power](http://calvinanddune.tumblr.com/image/107124259357).  And, well, /r/errantry plus making it unique on all sites.
  ```

- u/Arandur:
  ```
  My username is a translation of my surname into Quenya, roughly.
  ```

- u/CopperZirconium:
  ```
  Mine contains elements from different usernames I've had in the past. 

  My first username I ever used was CubicZirconium (CubicZirconia was already taken) because the only thing better than a diamond is an artificial diamond made with the awesome power of science! Unfortunately, it and the other username I've used, CopperFlower, are apparently fairly popular so I had to come up with a new one. CopperZirconium 1) sounded cool and 2) combined both my nerdy and artsy names. 

  I don't know if Copper and Zirconium actually form a useful alloy or not. I assume not due to lack of Google results.
