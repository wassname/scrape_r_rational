  The Redemption of Christopher Columbus by Orson Scott Card falls into this category. I liked it.

  If you're asking about *just* information, there's an interesting discussion on the topic in the wandering inn comments section of an old chapter. [https://wanderinginn.com/2017/06/21/2-31/](https://wanderinginn.com/2017/06/21/2-31/)[https://wanderinginn.com/2017/06/21/2-31/](https://wanderinginn.com/2017/06/21/2-31/)

  search for the word "infrastructure"

  Otherwise, take inspiration from Africa.  that's basically what a lot of the humanitarian efforts in that region are trying to do.
