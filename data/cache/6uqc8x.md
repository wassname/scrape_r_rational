  Let's look at some descriptions of level-ups.

  >**First one:** [***Level up!***](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126)

  >That last message came with a sensation that I can only describe as orgasmic. Golden light burst forward from me in a wave that kicked up wind and I briefly lifted up off my feet. It was like someone had jabbed a live wire directly into the pleasure center of my brain.

  >It was over in less than a second and left me trembling afterward.

  #

  >**Fourth one:** [***Level up!***](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25980909)

  >You might have thought that the golden light was familiar to me now, but it still managed to catch me by surprise, and the wave of ecstasy was no less sweet for having experienced it before. I lifted out of my seat, only slightly, and came back down without losing my balance.

  #

  >**Fifth one:** [***Level up!***](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/26163864)

  >I sank down to my knees as the golden wave of bliss took me, but it lifted me partway up, supporting me entirely as it shook my body with ecstasy. It seemed to last longer this time, long enough that I felt myself in its grip. When it stopped, I felt this hollow emptiness, as though I’d been pithed.

  #

  >**Seventh one:** [***Level up!***](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/26748348)

  >It had been too long since I’d felt that light touch me, the fingers of it gently gracing the pleasure centers of my brain. I felt somewhat hollow as it receded from me, a feeling that hadn’t come with it before, and it was with regret that I returned to the real world. 

  The apparent trend isn't hard to note.

  Speculation: level-ups' side-effects are going to be increasing in intensity and duration, asymptotically approaching wireheading. At higher levels, Juniper would become obsessed with leveling-up, as no worldly pleasures would be able to compare to this sensation.

    My theory is that each level-up brings him closer to divinity. Because he's a god. He created this world (with some help) and each level up restores some of that divine power.
    ```

    - u/Noumero:
      ```
      ... Sure. Let's see, there's a nearly-infinite number of gods in this world, but most of them are locked into an eternal state of bliss. Juniper was, for some reason, brought down from it, and is now on a quest to retain it.

      (Probably not.)

  Piqued my interested, just finished reading up to here. Definitely one of my new favorites.
  Great read, and I actually can't wait to continue reading.

    Alternatively, he could just have a bit of some sort of hitherto undocumented magical perception. This could explain how he knows backstories and the abilities of people and magic items he's in the room with, though in the latter case, this perceptive process is *rewriting his memory* rather than doing the game-layer overlay thing.

    With a lower prior due to the stronger ESP required, this class of explanation would explain how he knows what many of the 1000 magical items he's made do, so is unfortunately a bit hard to test.

  Fantastic serial. I tend to disdain LitRPGs, but this one is fascinating and clever (people in the world aren't stupid and protagonist doesn't get to win by thinking about basic and obvious things), and the advantages (levelling up is OP compared to training) is balanced against zero world knowledge in a deadly world.

  ```
  Great Webserial, got hooked instantly. Hope there is no unnecesary sex scenes
  ```

  - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
    ```
    I don't plan on including any sex scenes, mostly because I have this division in my head between proper prose fiction and erotica, and I don't tend to like it too much when they overlap. So if anyone *were* to have sex, it would be more of a "fade to black" thing rather than descriptions of body parts and fluids and things like that.

    (And I say this here mostly to assure people that this story isn't going to dip into pornography, and conversely, to warn people that this story isn't going to dip into pornography, if that's the thing they're after. If anyone *really* wants to read heavily NSFW stuff I wrote, you can find that under the /u/HPMORkinkthrowaway [NSFW] username, which I've decided I'm not actually *that* ashamed of.)

        Hey, better to be disappointed now than later.
