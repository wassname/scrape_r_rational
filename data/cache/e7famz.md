## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  Dear rational, please abuse the following ability:

  You have the ability to temporarily shrink down to a height of 12 centimeters, or any height between that and your real height.

  - Mass & inertia is adjusted by same scale
  Your strength & durability are square-cube adjusted to match real animals of that size
  - Your mind remains the same
  - You can only shrink things other than yourself that in some way more than 50% hang off you, so not shoes when worn, but a lever trailing on the ground would be shrunk. In zero gravity, you would be able to shrink anything up to 1000xyour original mass.
  - You can't grow things that haven't already been shrunk to that extent- things have a 'natural' size.
  - You don't have any wealth other than derived from this ability
  - You cannot reveal that you have this ability
  ```

    (assuming a height of 180cm for easy math)

    * Transportation:  you can pack 3375x as much of anything into a truck.  More, even, because you can pack spaces more efficiently.
    * Miniaturization: you can create models at 15:1 scale, making them incredibly detailed, and then shrink them down to the size you want them to be, making the surface details 225x more precise than what you can achieve at 1:1 scale.

      That'd be some amazing warhammer figurines, let me tell you.

      Then again I'm not sure if I could win one of those painting competitions even if I were to literally violate physics.

    Shrinking CPUs might make them 15 times faster and much more efficient.

    As far as I understand, the simple way to build very, very small machines (Build a machine that builds a smaller copy of itself, repeat) fails on the step where the product must be more accurate than the producer. With me involved, the machine can build a copy of itself that is 14 times larger than itself and 14 times less accurate, and then I shrink it by a factor of 15. Nanotech, yo. At the molecular level, it's also sure to come in handy that the machine is made of atoms 15 times smaller than the raw materials. And the nanoswarm can't possibly eat the planet because I'm needed to shrink each batch :)

    Surgically lengthen my bones to increase my shrinking factor.

    Can you shrink a balloon with the air inside it?

    Can you shrink the air itself? Technically the column of atmosphere above you is hanging off you. Can you shrink it somehow? Could you manipulate winds on a massive scale by shrinking/expanding large volumes of air since they have low low mass?
    ```

    - u/girllich:
      ```
      Balloon yes.

      Gases are supported by nearby molecules outside your column (50%) in sort of a cone shape, I'd say
      ```

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    Incorporate weights into the top half of my shoes so I can wear shoes. If I let go of an object while shrunk, does it unshrink? If I shrink radioactive material, does this conserve total radiation or radiation per volume? I can shrink wings to fly.

    How is the last point implemented? Do people spontaneously forget the ability if they observe it or I tell them? Do I lose the ability if anyone figures out that I have it? What if a camera sees it?
    ```

    - u/girllich:
      ```
      - It doesn't unshrink if you let go.
      - Radioactivity is a great point. I'd say it emits reduced scale particles at the same rate
      - Last point is just for me, not enforced by physics
      ```

      - u/munkeegutz:
        ```
        Then there's possibly value in shrinking radioactive waste- making it smaller would reduce the cross sectional area of the radioactive emission, making it interact with nearby matter less often (by increasing is mean free path).  I don't know if this effect is strong enough to be interesting however- it depends on what dominates the chance of interacting with a human body
        ```

      - u/Nimelennar:
        ```
        If it doesn't revert when you let go...  Can you shrink something, grow yourself back to normal size, and then shrink that thing even more?
        ```

  - u/appropriate-username:
    ```
    You haven't listed a speed - how long it takes to go from max to min height - so I'll assume faster than light movement/height change. Hold a magnet and generate explosions from air friction to generate tons of free energy and sell the energy for tons of money.

    If it's slow, shrink barrels of rocket fuel and make an absolute shit ton of money.

  How would you design a building to be resistant to frequent explosions and toxic substance leaks?

  Requirements:

  * incidents will only originate in laboratories
  * incidents can destroy a laboratory, but should be contained to a single room. An explosion should not be able to destroy a neighboring laboratory (barring extreme cases) and toxic gas should not be able to escape the laboratory
  * protecting the people in an incident-creating laboratory is not required
  * usage of modern tech is permissible but strongly discouraged
     * "modern" is anything invented after \~1800
     * no computers
  * Explosions can be:
     * pressure
     * light (including invisible radiation)
     * electricity
     * any other form of energy
     * the size of explosions ranges from something like a grenade to enough energy (if released as a normal pressure explosion) to destroy a small house
  * Toxic substances can be:
     * toxic gases, like mustard gas or carbon monoxide
     * flaming substances, like napalm or white phosphorus
     * cold substances, like liquid nitrogen or CO2 slush
     * corrosive liquids, like acids or bases
     * flammable (but unlit) gases, like hydrogen or methane
     * flaming liquids, like gasoline
     * any of these combined, or any other substance you can think of (regardless of when it was invented)
        * there will be no nanotech or other machinery
  * designs should be resistant to sabotage
  * accidents are random and the results of the accidents are not intelligent or possessed of desires. liquids flow downhill, gases diffuse normally, etc 


  Thoughts?

    I'm not sure if it is against some unspoken assumptions, but why not let open space do the work for you?  It's what they did in the real 1800s.  A couple of acres of scrubland that's a few miles away from any neighbors seems to fulfill all the requirements.

    Explosions will blow up a shack you're mixing things up in, but if they're all dozens of yards away from each other you're fine.  If you're doing anything particularly volatile you just pick a spot outside and do it there.  Any gas leaks dissipate before they hit any people.  Toxic substances will diffuse into the environment.

    Nobody can come sabotage or steal things, since you're a couple hours away (at least) from any civilization.  Depending on where you situate things, any infiltrators can be seen an hour+ before they arrive at your compound.

  - u/chiruochiba:

    You said use of modern technology is discouraged, but you could probably still take inspiration for best practices from real life building code requirements for hazardous locations.

    For example, here's a [decently thorough outline](https://www.emerson.com/documents/automation/article-interpreting-requirements-of-articles-500-516-of-nec-appleton-en-518452.pdf) of the portion of the National Electrical Code (NEC) in the United States which covers requirements for the different classes of locations containing flammable/explosion prone materials. The  Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) also has a [set of rules](https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_id=9884&p_table=standards) that apply, and The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) has [many code standards](https://www.nfpa.org/Codes-and-Standards/All-Codes-and-Standards/List-of-Codes-and-Standards) that would be applicable. [NFPA 45](https://karafire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Standard-NFPA-45-2004.pdf), "Standard on Fire Protection for Laboratories Using Chemicals", would probably be relevant.

      Thank you, I can't believe it didn't occur to me that there would be analogous standards in the real world.

    Very interesting question.

    How big single lab room should be?

    You've given a lot of requirements, but everything comes down just to having strong, and preferrably hermetic walls.

    1. Find the optimal wall structure (thickness versus strenght versus material used versus cost), most likely wall will be made of different layers
    2. Add an entrance chamber with disinfection system to each room with two heavy vault doors. Every lab room should have at least two entrance chambers.
    3. Equip each room with separate air conditioning, water supply systems, etc, in order to minize the connections with the outside
    4. Arrange labs and halls (with extra vault doors) in such a way that a lockdown of a biggert part of facility is possible in the worst case scenario when single lab walls fails to contain the danger
    5. Actively watch and monitor situation in halls and in every room

    That's the basic idea, of course it could be extended and improved.
    ```

    - u/true-name-raven:
      ```
      I like this, especially combined with the other idea of cribbing from real world building codes. 

      Why do you need two entrance chambers?
      ```

      - u/Dezoufinous:
        ```
        How much are scientists lives valued in the setting?

        The second exit door is just there to help improve survival rate of people in the room in case of contamination/incident. There is always chance that explosion will happen near the one of exit doors and thus make it unusable, trapping people inside.
        ```

    - u/covert_operator100:
      ```
      As for gas leaks, negative pressure ensures that the gas stays in the room in an emergency, while still giving you ventilation on regular days. Oxygen masks can protect experimenters from inhaled poisons or particles (but not from acidic gas). The exits can have an airlock if necessary, but that edges on modern tech.

      The biggest fear I'd have in this setup would be slow-acting problems like disease, but the CDC uses negative pressure combined with air filtration to ensure nothing gets out.
      ```
