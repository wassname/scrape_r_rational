## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  I've been considering going vegetarian, primarily out of concern for animal wellbeing. I'm not super educated on the subject, and I was wondering if /r/rational had any hot-takes on the subject

    In my experience going vegetarian was nearly effortless, once I decided to do it. I don't think the practical side of it should be all that challenging.

    I'll post my thoughts about why I believe vegetarianism is of ethical importance when I have more time, but as a matter of honestly I'm also compelled to say Eliezer Yudkowsky's post on why he *isn't* vegetarian was very persuasive. I think he's wrong, but he's not *obviously* wrong. It should be easy to google; I'll link it later regardless.

        I didn't really find that post very compelling at all, it mostly relied on EY's own biased assumptions and rationalizations as usual.

        I think a more compelling reason to adopt a vegetarianism lifestyle is the fact that it is much more environmentally sustainable.  Livestock farming generates a tremendous amount of pollution and produces a lot of waste.  

        BTW I'm a firm omnivore.  I just think vegetarianism makes the most sense from an ethical, resource scarcity, and environmental perspective.  It's just hard... I love steaks too much.
        ```

        - u/MagicWeasel:
          ```
          So... become a vegetarian except for the occasional steak? Stop eating seafood and chicken, the two biggest animal killers? Become "vegan at home" but eat anything that strikes your fancy when you are at restaurants or visiting friends? Commit to meatless Mondays if you haven't already?

          Heck, just buy soy or almond milk instead of cow's milk to stock your fridge at home, but keep the rest of your diet the same? (Cow's milk is worse for the environment than even the much maligned almond milk, after all, so if environmentalism is your primary concern than switching away from cow's milk in your own fridge is a very low-effort one)

          It's not all or nothing, after all! The word flexitarian was coined for a reason, and maybe it was coined for people like you?

            >So... become a vegetarian except for the occasional steak? Stop eating seafood and chicken, the two biggest animal killers?

            Isn't that the exact opposite of what a vegetarian-for-ethical-reasons should do? Seafood and chicken are both more environmentally sustainable and significantly less intelligent than cows.
            ```

            - u/MagicWeasel:
              ```
              Depends on your values/etc I guess. I don't know if seafood is environmentally sustainable though, mostly it isn't is my understanding, and chickens are very intelligent (though not sure how much compared with cows). 

              One cow weighs as much as O(100) chickens, so you know, as long as you believe a chicken is more than 1% as "ethically worthy" as a cow, you should probably not eat chickens. 

              Also, the person I was replying to specifically stated they want steak - so if wanting steak is a terminal value, then cutting out all animal products but steak is the best available option even if steaks are literally the worst thing you can eat.
              ```

              - u/GaBeRockKing:
                ```
                > I don't know if seafood is environmentally sustainable though, mostly it isn't is my understanding,

                It depends on the fish. The factory farmed stuff is probably pretty sustainable, but not the stuff caught by fishermen.

                > chickens are very intelligent (though not sure how much compared with cows).  
                > as long as you believe a chicken is more than 1% as "ethically worthy" as a cow,  

                I went down a brief rabbit hole looking for articles on chicken intelligence/cognition, and it was pretty inconclusive. That is to say, the majority of the research carries a clear bias from environmental and animal welfare groups in drawing their conclusions-- while they certainly prove chickens aren't *dumb*, their abilities don't seem to be anything special. Meanwhile, cows, being large, social mammals, are on the upper end of animal cognition.

                I wouldn't go so far as to say that a cow has the raw mental capability of 100 chickens, but I don't think any reasonable system scales ethical weight directly proportional to mental processing power. For example, most people would feel less bad about killing hundreds, or even thousands of insects than a single rodent.

                Combined with the environmental inefficiency of cows, I genuinely think that, ethically speaking, they're one of the worst common animal products.

                disclaimer: independent of the OP's value system with regards to how highly they value meat, I'm invested in this argument primarily because I decided to try to lower my beef consumption in favour of eating more chicken, and reducing meat consumption in general a few months back primarily because of environmental harm, secondarily for health reasons, and tertiarily for ethical reasons. I'm open to reversing course back in the other direction (i.e., less chicken, more beef) if I find new evidence, although I doubt I'll ever go vegetarian or vegan.

            - u/MagicWeasel:
              ```
              Basically, agriculture is terrible for the environment, and growing plants to feed an animal so you can drink its body fluids is a lot less efficient than growing (different) plants and blending them with water. 

              I'm using water consumption specifically as this is what almond milk is criticised based on. 

              250ml of cow's milk takes [255 litres](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jan/10/how-much-water-food-production-waste) to produce.

              According to anti-almond milk sites, it takes about 1 gallon of water to grow one almond, and almond milk is 4% almond at the high end. One almond weighs about 1g so a 1kg litre of almond milk will contain 40g of almonds or 40 gallons of water (160 litres). So a cup of cow's milk takes more water to produce than an entire litre of almond milk.

              Almond milk isn't a good substitute for cow's milk nutritionally anyway FWIW. I think it's great taste and health wise, but if you need high protein, high calorie, high sugar, high fat beverage you're better off with soy, which I believe uses less water than almond.

        I don't really agree with his notion of how animals work. Or at least, I don't agree with how he reacts to his perceived reality.

        My model for how animals work is that they don't experience their emotions so much as they are their emotions. They don't give critical thought to what they're feeling, they simply react to it as best they know how. Yes, their minds are orders of magnitude less complex than our own, but that doesn't mean that they don't have value. Every animal is a completely unique being with its own perspective and set of experiences, and I don't think lacking the capacity for self-reflection invalidates that.

          He claims that he has a more detailed (i.e. gears-level) model of how consciousness works than most people who like to talk about this subject, and that this model massively drops the likelihood of most farm animals being conscious. Whether you're inclined to trust him on this is up to you, but assuming that he's telling the truth about having such a model, things get a bit more complicated than "my views are different"--for all you know, he has decent cause to rule out the possibility you describe *a priori*.

          (Personally, I'm neither inclined nor disinclined to trust EY on this one. I haven't seen anything to suggest that he's normally dishonest in these kinds of discussions, and he certainly has enough relevant background in the area, but that's counterbalanced by the fact that dissolving consciousness seems *really freaking hard*. Overall I'd probably place a similar amount of credence in EY making this claim as I would in, say, Daniel Dennett, Gary Drescher, or David Chalmers making the same claim.)

          - u/SilverstringstheBard:
            ```
            I differ from him in that I don't think they need to be conscious in order to have moral worth. Simply having emotions and being capable of learning are enough for me.

    How do you determine if an animal's life is or isn't worth living?  (Positive utilitarianism vs. negative utilitarianism vs. ???)

    How do you determine what is happening to farm animals?

    Given some set of experiences, how do you judge the feelings/qualia of something that doesn't share many of your foundational values (such as a chicken)?  

    ---

    One set of answers (the smallest amount of good justifies existence, the industry accurately presents conditions on farms, and those conditions are suited to the well-being of the animals living in them) argues against welfare-vegetarianism.

    Another set of answers (the smallest amount of suffering must be avoided, activists accurately present conditions on farms, those conditions are worse for animals than you would naively assume) argues for it.

      > How do you determine if an animal's life is or isn't worth living? (Positive utilitarianism vs. negative utilitarianism vs. ???)

      Somewhere pretty middle-ish, I guess? The sum of the magnitude of all positive experiences minus the sum of the magnitude of all negative experiences should be greater than or equal to(?) 0, though I recognise how annoyingly unmeasurable that is.

      > How do you determine what is happening to farm animals?

      I've always just sort of taken it for granted that a system designed for the sole purpose of creating as many plump animal corpses as possible would be unpleasant for the animals. If I'm wrong, I get the relatively mild inconvenience of not getting to eat meat, if I'm right then I get to raise the universe's utility. (The obvious answer is to do more research, which I feel woefully underqualified for ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯)

      > Given some set of experiences, how do you judge the feelings/qualia of something that doesn't share many of your foundational values (such as a chicken)?

      I'm not really sure if I understand this point. I don't see how foundational values affect a being's qualia, (indeed to even suggest a being *has* foundational values is to imply it has qualia, and therefore is deserving of moral consideration)

        Let's say that you know an animal is spending a day hanging upside down in a cave.  If it's a bat, that's a good experience.  If it's a giraffe, it's probably going be in severe distress and die very quickly.

        After doing the research for the second question, you know that cows are raised in XYZ conditions.  Are those good conditions for a cow to be in?

    If your motivation is concern for animals, then you would also have to consider evangelizing. For the most part, if you want to go vegetarian, go ahead. However, it's worth noting that the animal rights issues are probably going away relatively soon, considering recent advancements with lab-grown meat.

      I'd be a pretty terrible evangelist. Part of what appeals to me about vegetarianism is it being personal enough that I don't have to change how I interact with people.

      Lab grown meat is definitely exciting, but I'm skeptical it's going to make it to the mainstream without heavy resistance from farmers.

    Only hot-take is that, animal death per calorie wise, eggs are one of the worse things you can eat, so you should do your best to avoid eggs as much as you can. Milk is the least terrible animal product because cows produce so damn much of it, so that's not as "pressing a concern" to eliminate from your diet if your primary concern is ethics. (Seriously, I believe beef is less harmful to animals than eggs are and it's not even close).

    Been vegan for about two years now, so I've got tons of recipes and know all the substitutions and stuff. My own transition was very slow (took about 4 years), and the first thing I stopped eating was chicken and the last thing I stopped eating was very rare steak, which apparently is the opposite to the typical "i'm vegetarian but i eat chicken" so go figure.
    ```

    - u/TempAccountIgnorePls:
      ```
      I'm confused. Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but eggs don't require *any* animal deaths, do they?
      ```

      - u/MagicWeasel:
        ```
        Well, putting aside the fact that wild chickens lay 12 eggs a year rather than one a day, which has big impacts on even a backyard hen's bone density, commercial egg production kills billions of chickens.

        First of all: egg layers and meat chickens are different breeds, so the male egg layers are economically worthless. So they are macerated (this literally means put into a giant meat grinder, alive), or they are suffocated. At a few days old. This is... not a "good" death.

        Then their sisters are killed sometime between age one and three, when they'd normally live eight years. (Their egg production slows down, so they're not as commercial viable). 

        Oh, and the backyard chickens your neighbour / aunt / etc keeps? Their brothers would have been killed the same way as a commercial layers'. So they're not a complete loophole - and if you're thinking the ethics through, you're better off not eating those eggs and giving those eggs away to people who would have otherwise eaten eggs that were obtained in worse conditions.

        (And yes, places like Germany are hoping to do sex selection for chicken embryos, preventing the male chickens from being born, which would improve a lot of the bad stuff with eggs, but these are not happening on a commercial scale yet).

          Killing chicks seems horrible but imo it's likely not causing any suffering. Seems much much less likely that day old chicks have a mind worth worrying about than adult chickens.
          ```

          - u/MagicWeasel:
            ```
            Yeah, but the adults are killed 6 years before the end of their natural life and their conditions are absolutely horrible. So it's still not... nice.

            Also - I am not sure if this is apocryphal or not, but there were some little baby chicks in a macerator and a journalist was doing a tour and was given the opportunity to press the "on" button to kill the chicks, and they couldn't bring themselves to do it. Putting it on that visceral level hit home for me in a weird way, there's no way in hell I could ever press that damn button, and if I buy eggs I'm paying someone to press it for me. I'm sure plenty of people would do the calculus on how many eggs they eat and how many baby roosters that means they'd kill and would happily press the button to kill that many roosters, but I personally couldn't. 

            Backyard chickens have the "bred to produce so many eggs it damages their reproductive tract" problem still. 

            More info: https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/wiki/eggs

      - u/ulyssessword:
        ```
        Given the lifetime and productivity of laying hens, you can count each egg as being responsible for the death of ~1/500 hens (or 1/250 hens and roosters, which are culled as chicks).

        IMO chicken has a higher death-per-calorie ratio than eggs.
        ```

        - u/MagicWeasel:
          ```
          Chicken definitely does, but presumably OP, as a vegetarian, wouldn't eat chicken. (I have some sources in my comment below)
          ```

  - u/blazinghand:
    ```
    If you want an easier way to get most of the morality benefit vegetarian, switch to eating large animals. Avoid eggs, chicken, salmon, sardines, turkey, and so on. If you eat a pound of meat each day, for 365 pounds a year, that could be hundreds of chickens, sardines, salmons, eggs, etc, or it could be a single cow or a single tuna or something. 

    By solely eating large animals, you could get 99% of the way to being a vegetarian in terms of reducing number of animals horribly killed. This is one of the best possible compromises; if 100 people did this, this would be as good as 99 people becoming vegetarian, and it's quite easy to do.

  Blegh.........

  Today I had an ocular migraine.

  For those to don't know what it is, it's a migraine where you experience disturbances with their vision such as flashing or shimmering lights, zigzagging lines, stars, or psychedelic images. If you're like me, you instead get blind-spots in your vision. Then a normal headache pops up once the vision issue clears up after an hour or two.

  This is the second time I ever got it and while it's not as bad as the first time with a shorter duration, less severe blind-spots, and prior experience with it, it's still utterly fucking unpleasant wondering if I'm going to permanently lose my vision.

  The main reason why I'm posting about it is because the worst part about it was having absolutely no clue what was going on when it first happened to me. So, if random shit is happening to your vision out of nowhere, don't worry it's very likely to be an ocular migraine. Just calmly go to a doctor with a friend to check out what's happening. After taking an aspirin for the headache of course.
  ```

  - u/SeekingImmortality:
    ```
    I had this for the first (and so far only) time in the last few years, and yes, that was utterly terrifying.  I was driving home, picking up fast food, and suddenly had a glowing hole in the upper left of my vision that persisted, and slowly started growing.  By the time I got home, I was on the phone with my significant other (who was an hours drive away at the time), panicking, trying to look up my symptoms online, wondering if it was a type of stroke or something (despite having ZERO pain or odd sensations, and feeling like other than the panic that my thinking was perfectly clear), asking the SO if I should be calling an ambulance since I no longer considered myself safe to drive myself to the hospital, etc.  The blind/glowy spot grew to encompass half and then 2/3rds of my visual field, 'visible' even when my eyes were shut, and then.....just like that, it went away and I could see just fine.  Aaaand that was it.  No further symptoms, no reoccurence since.

    Freakiest thing.  Went and saw an eye doctor the next day who said it was an occular migraine, and sometimes they 'just happen', and to just go with it.

    Stupid failable human body.  Hurry up with the perfect nanomachine medicine, society!

    Aural means ears, I think you mean ocular!

    I get ocular migraines too, about once every six months (more often when I take BC with estrogen which I am no longer allowed to due to the migraine history). I actually had one on Friday, funnily enough. 

    First time it happened to me I freaked out, told a doctor friend, he had no advice, but it went away after about an hour. It didn't happen again until I started using estrogen-containing BC a few years later, went to a doctor, he said I was having an ocular migraine and not to worry about it, said it wasn't related to BC. Every other doctor I've spoken with has looked horrified when I told them my doctor said that and said that it was definitely related to BC and he was an idiot for saying it wasn't when I specifically asked. So, that was a thing that happened to me...

    Funny thing is they happen in one half of your "visual field", but they don't just happen in one eye. Since your visual field is not divided by eye. Which I found strange.
    ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      Whoops! Thanks for the correction.

      The ocular migraines happening in half of your visual field makes sense since headache problem originates from your brain rather than in the eyes even if that's where the symptoms are manifesting.

      If you look at this [image](http://www.zuniv.net/physiology/book/images/fp5-6.jpg), then you'll see there is one red and one green line to each eye which explains the blind-spots in only half of the visual field.

      Human brains are so *badly* designed by evolution.

      Yes!  When it happened to me, I definitely noticed that while it was on the left part of my visual 'field', I couldn't isolate it to one eye vs the other at all, which made me at the time panic that I was having a stroke or something else directly affecting my brain.

  I have a specific memory problem that I would like advice/input on: I cannot remember any details/trivia about real people. Apart from myself, I don't remember anyone's favorite color, favorite foods, hobbies, dislikes, etc. I remember their names and relations to me, and that's about it. This seems weird to me because I can remember fictional characters just fine. It's just real people that I can't remember. 

  I have come up with four hypotheses that I can't distinguish between without other people's inputs:

  **Hypothesis 1**: People remember other people instinctively. Their brains have automatic software that retains info about their friends and family without any effort. In this scenario, my problem would be that my brain is just missing this software, and there's nothing I can do but work around it.

  **Hypothesis 2**: People remember other people instinctively, but only if they have strong feelings about them. Their brains have automatic software that only turns on and retains info about people they care about without any effort. In this scenario, my problem would be that I don't care about other people strongly enough (I probably don't), and so I would need to self-brainwash into caring more. Somehow.

  **Hypothesis 3**: There's no such instinct. People remember other people because they put effort into studying them, just like students studying for an exam. In this scenario, my problem would be that I haven't been studying, and should start taking down notes about people.

  **Hypothesis 4**: It's normal to not remember real people. Only stalkers or fictional idealized friends remember that kind of stuff. In this scenario, my only problem would be that I've been lied to by TV, and I should definitely not study up on people like a stalker. This last hypothesis seems unlikely to me though...

  So yeah, which is it?

    As with everything human, there is a great big bell curve going on. On reddit/askreddit you can find a ton of people who are super-rememberers - they get in trouble for remembering that someone liked a specific chocolate brand 4 years ago. 

    So I'd go with hypothesis one for the missing software but disagree with the conclusion. Applying your generic memory - to people facts is possible, and notes are a great external support of that. 

    (My people detail memory is pretty bad, and I have made notes about people after first dates, for example.)

    Part of the thing RE hobbies: I think fictional people are more interesting than real people. I like cross stitching, but Harry Potter likes flying around on his broomstick. Even characters with "boring hobbies" usually have those hobbies chosen carefully to bring forward character traits that make them worth paying attention to. 

    Whereas the boring truth is I like cross stitching because I bought a mini kit at a craft shop once and then decided it was good to have something to do with my hands while I watch TV. A character in a book probably likes cross stitching because they were really close to their grandmother who taught them and passed down all their embroidery tools when they tragically died in a zeppelin accident, which is a much more memorable thing than "hipster millennial likes doing something that's kind of trendy because it's a good way to pas the time". 

    Just my hunch, anyway.

    And to use the favourite colour - Peeta from The Hunger Games has his favourite colour as orange, and the reason I remember that is because he talked about it being like the sunset, which had a great visual image, and then later on Katniss talks about something being orange and thinking how it's Peeta's favourite colour. I am pretty sure Katniss mentioned her favourite colour in the same passage too but I can't for the life of me remember it because it didn't get attached to an image like that and didn't come up again in the story.

      True that. Boring fictional people get removed out from the meme pool far faster than boring real people get removed from the gene pool. 

      That doesn't help me figure out what I should do about it though. I can't exactly make the people around me more interesting characters. *Imagines stabbing someone's parents to give them a tragic backstory.* Yeah that's not going to end well for me lol.

    How about another hypothesis?

    **Hypothesis 3.5:** People remember things better in different ways, you remember characters better because you get your information about them in written format with few other distractions. Real life interactions are generally face-to-face and auditory, so not only do you receive the information in a potentially harder to remember format, you are also busy looking at the person's face. Reading facial expressions takes a lot of mental bandwidth; it's why people glance away when thinking hard or trying to remember something.

    Some people could just be better/more practiced at social multitasking. And in that case taking notes would most likely help you.

I hope this takes off because I wasn't early enough to get in on the ground floor of the "[using undiagnosed Asperger as an excuse to be a dickhead to people](https://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=2832#comic)" phenomenon. /s 

    I am pretty sure h3 or h4 are more correct than h2 or h1 are. I don't know what my mom's eye colour is for example but I could definitely choose to remember it if I see it again and regurgitate the info when relevant (it never will be). 

    Another hypothesis could be that people are more complex and uninteresting than fictional people, if you read about a fictional character you're not going to read that he casually plays chess sometimes when he has the free time for it and he tried to get into rock-climbing but only went five times because that would be boring, forgettable and would tell us nothing about the character but it would be perfectly ordinary for a normal person. The character you read about wants to play chess with the protagonist in every interaction and his rock-climbing skills will come up when dramatically appropriate and save the day! You can't really define real people by saying "This is sally, her hobby is cosplay, her favourite colour is violet and she prefers earrings to necklaces."

  Upon starting a Hero’s War I realised a trope common to rational (and many non-rational) fiction that, now that I am aware of it, kind of rubs me wrong: *First Hypothesis Bias*

  Let me expand on that a bit. 

  Suppose you have a plot with an urgent need of solving, in a somewhat rational manner (as in, the solution space doesn’t require dipping too much into the typical trappings of knowledge and experience not available to the reader), and the MCs need to figure out an angle of attack or a weak point to investigate. The gather knowledge and lay it out, and brainstorm what they can do to overcome the problem. A character has an idea, it is followed through, and it works. There are variations in the narrative, of course, for instance factions putting forth different ideas and the MCs ideas being adopted only after the status quo ideas are shown to be not working.

  However, the basic proposition is still: 1st/initial ideas are tested and proven true/working.

  We as the reader are rarely shown the failures, the work that needed to be accomplished prior to coming to a true conclusion. The reasons are relatively obvious—it’s tedious to show the twelve hundred eighty-nine various titrations, the statistical analysis that lead to the insight which approach worked better, and then refining with another one hundred five titrations before one can be somewhat sure the proffered cure has a reasonable chance to cure the ailment of the week. But there’s rarely shown any of the misses; the narrative usually focusses on the successes, and therefore implies the correctness of the immediate hypothesis. 

  I think this narrative bias has a good chance of creating a real-world bias in the expectations and testing of hypotheses. Yes, a good scientific education should do away with this, but the problem with biases isn’t so much the individual, but the societal impacts (This isn’t meant to diminish the effects and importance of biases on the individual, but rather to point the focus how widely-available narratives with shared biases can induce similarly wide biases). With the narratively introduced expectation of immediate hypotheses / proposition of solutions, the actual work required to come to the proper (and probably right) solution is depreciated. An individual newly entering a field of scientific study will expect to see (somewhat) immediate success in hypothesis testing, unlike the probable slew of unsuccessful or inconclusive tests. They will perceive this as failures (personal or professional), even though it is probable and worthwhile by weeding out false hypotheses and pruning the solution space.

  **TL;DR**: In that vein, are there stories that prune the solution space prior to arriving at the correct solution? I remember Frank Schätzing’s *The Swarm* doing a decent job of it, but it’s been over a decade since I last read it. There was also *Heromaker’s Legacy*, I think, though I didn’t finish it (spent too much time in minutiae).

    Interesting, especially given the existence of tropes like [never the obvious suspect](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTheObviousSuspect) and [unspoken plan guarantee](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnspokenPlanGuarantee) (warning: tvtropes links) where the first guess in a case/any plan that is spoken about on screen prior to its implementation are guaranteed to be incorrect/fail.

    In particular, stories in the fair-play whodunnit genre often put a lot of effort into showing the various failed hypothesis and dead ends that the detective has to go through before arriving at the correct conclusion. I don't see a reason why rational fiction couldn't use a similar plot structure.
