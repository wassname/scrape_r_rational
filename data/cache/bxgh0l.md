## The "Mewtwo in Prison" chapter (https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/40/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species) is my favorite, recommendations?

### Post:

Really loved that chapter ( [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/40/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/40/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species) ).

I'd been enjoying the series, but after reading and re-reading that one chapter, I went back hoping for more of Mewtwo or more of that vibe in general and have barely read anything since then.

Is there anything else like that?

BTW: Are there more chapters with Mewtwo?

    Seconding this in general, it's a great book.

    I read it and I like it for how it depicts the mind-made-of-sub-minds idea, and also the clever prison escape aspect.

    What really sets the Mewtwo tale apart for me is the intensity of the positive and negative emotion, and the magnitude of desires

  my first thought is the fanfic *Animorphs: The Reckoning* which does a lot of interesting things with alien mental processes while playing around with the structure of the writing. [This chapter](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/6/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning) (it's chapter 6 but still kinda spoilery) would give you an idea of what I mean and you can probably tell if it's the sort of thing you're looking for.

  (Unfortunately it's been a while since it last updated and it's not clear how dead it is.)

  Late reply, but Twig's also got an [interlude chapter](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2016/03/18/enemy-arc-9/) with the same vibe. That link leads directly to the chapter, and it's relatively far in so if you start reading you're spoiling yourself and doing so without context.

  The serial is hardly rational (I believe consensus is that it's rational-adjacent) but Wildbow's take on a biological AI in >!the Primordial!< is fascinating.
