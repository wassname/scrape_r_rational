## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I'm looking for stories, books, or fanfictions that are about technology uplift due to any cause (time travel, ASB, clash of civilizations, etc). While not every example in my extended doc is rational, these ones are some of my favorite that are rational in my opinion:

  * [Down a Rabbit hole to Westeros](https://archiveofourown.org/works/20415661/navigate) \- An insert into ASOIAF with foreknowledge and a desire to avoid the coming plot. Basic knowledge of GoT helpful but not required. Ongoing.
  * [Saruman of many Devices](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7568728/1/Saruman-of-many-Devices) \- Saruman receives knowledge from an unexpected source before his fall. Minor crossover, knowledge of Lord of the Rings helpful but not required. Probably abandoned but still worth it in my opinion.
  * [Last Hurrah of the Bismarck](https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/last-hurrah-of-the-bismarck.474100/reader/) \- A ship of sailors finds themselves inexplicably in the past clearly due to an ASB/god/something outside of their control. How will they change the future? What should they even try to change? Priorities and perspectives will be stressed. Weakest example of uplift in the story of the examples here as it mostly happens off screen. Ongoing.

  For more examples, or if you too are curious about this genre, you can check out [this short google sheet.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y4wkV364_0Bc3xPvgHYsFEQ6OCYyNBRudMPw4nFXn5U/edit?usp=sharing)

    This has been recommended fairly often before, but the manga [Sengoku Komachi Kuroutan](https://mangadex.org/title/a4304d3b-191d-471f-8c78-353d403a35d0/sengoku-komachi-kuroutan-noukou-giga) is very entertaining and fits squarely in the uplift genre, though it has its share of irrational bits. The protagonist, an Ordinary Japanese Agricultural High School Student, is walking down the road one day when she suddenly finds herself in the year 1565. As luck would have it she was carrying a history book covering the [rather violent and horrible time period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sengoku_period) that she'd brought for some light reading, a smartphone with an offline wikipedia dump, a solar charger for it, and several varieties of modern high-yield (and non-hybrid) vegetable seeds, including a bunch of new world plants. Her luck continues when she immediately runs into Oda Nobunaga, who puts her in charge of a tiny famine-stricken farming village and tells her to boost their crop yields if she wants to live. Uplift ensues!

    [The novel version](https://yado-inn.com/skm/), which I *haven't* seen anybody recommend yet, is essentially the same thing but much more so. It focuses quite a bit on the details of the technology, to a degree that just wouldn't be practical in a manga format. If you've ever wanted to read a fiction book that goes into long, entertaining explanations of historical rice cultivation methods or the pros and cons of different types of wells, this is it. And the translation is top-notch.

    A Hero’s War has 2 SIs one of whom works on metal forging uplift in a lot of detail. I didn’t finish this one but the part I read was good. 

    Ascendancy of a bookworm has some uplift. In the translated parts I read it was in very narrow fields, particularly books, dresses etc… Partial translation [here](https://blastron01.tumblr.com/post/181369364884/ascendance-of-a-bookworm-096)

    [Lost in an Isekai](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/lost-in-an-isekai.866362/) has some uplift in a world with monsters and adventurers. A bit lighter in detail on the uplift but with a broader scope. It is a dead fic but fairly long. 

    Lest Darkness Fall is one of the original uplift stories where a man goes back in time to prevent the Roman Empire from falling.

        Yeah it's pretty... questionably written. There's no questionable material within, since Spacebattles rules are pretty strict on what you can write. I'd say the writing was a bit too stilted for me to get into. But one thing it does well is show the uplift process and just how damn long it takes to do anything. It takes like a year before crossbows can even be sort of manufactured at scale, and that's small potatoes compared with the monsters in the story. The protagonist does not think about sex at all except when he meets Katherine, at which point he's a blushing maid. It's alright.

    The [Safehold](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Safehold) series by David Weber takes place in a future where all of humanity but one hidden colony has been wiped out by genocidal aliens, and that colony has been deliberately kept at a medieval technological level for nearly a thousand years to avoid any electronic emissions that might alert the aliens to their survival. The protagonist, a survivor from pre-genocide humanity, wakes up in an android body and decides to start *changing* things. It’s a long (ten books so far), fun read, with larger than life characters, lots of detailed military action (especially naval action of the [wooden ships and iron men](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoodenShipsAndIronMen) variety), every side of the conflict trying to out-gambit the other, and surprisingly deep discussions of philosophy and religion.

    The [Belisarius series](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BelisariusSeries) by David Drake and Eric Flint has a less dramatic uplift in absolute terms, but an even better story. In the far future, two opposing factions have different ideas of what humanity’s destiny should be, and have each sent an agent into the past to change the course of history in their favour. In the sixth-century Byzantine Empire, General Flavius Belisarius comes into possession of a strange jewel that shows terrible visions of things to come—but also hints at how that future might be averted (it involves industrialization and gunpowder). And meanwhile in India, a cruel empire which is controlled by something that is at once less and more than human is preparing to make a play for domination of the entire known world, and humanity’s future…

    I’ve read this series three times. It holds up.

      ```
      Those are kind of using the word "uplift" differently -- in those books it refers to one species uplifting another into sapience using some combination of genetic engineering and selective breeding, which is why so many of the characters are neo-dolphins or neo-chimpanzees.

      That said, it *is* a very good series, well-written and often thought-provoking. I'd personally recommend skipping Sundiver (which is meh), starting with Startide Rising, then continuing on to The Uplift War. There's also a sequel trilogy which I found to be good but not on the same level.

    [Release That Witch (online)](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/release-that-witch/) - modern guy gets isekaied into a prince's body. Medieval era technology plus magic. He gets guns and other tech up and running. It is probably an unrealistically *fast* uplift. I think it is a translation. I stopped reading it at some point, it was getting too weird, and it was becoming less about technology winning the day and more about weird made up magic things winning the day.

    [Schooled in Magic (book series, amazon)](https://www.amazon.com/Schooled-In-Magic-24-book-series/dp/B07F7Q8LDF) - modern girl gets isekaied into a world with magic and medieval era technology / politics. The world is fighting a losing battle against necromancers. She doesn't do a ton of uplift stuff for the first few books, but she does utilize modern knowledge to make better spells. I think about a dozen books in the uplift stuff starts kicking in hard. Not entirely cuz of her doing, but just because she has let people know what is possible and they have run with it. I stopped reading right before a book with a bunch of gunpowder battles were gonna take place, maybe at book 10. Also after looking it up and linking to it, holy crap there are 24 books in the series. I might go back and read again, the series was hard to binge read, because he constantly kept explaining things from previous books, but that might work out in my favor now.

    I like books in this mini-genre and I've read many other stories that might fit, but those two feels like pretty standard ones that I didn't see other people recommend.

    Might I recommend [The Man Who Came Early](http://vvikipedia.co/images/c/c7/Poul_William_Anderson_-_The_Man_Who_Came_Early.pdf) as a particularly realistic example of the genre?
    ```

    - u/fassina2:
      ```
      I wouldn't call it realistic, necessarily, it depends on the starting conditions you are set up with on the scenario. While the criticisms on his practical application and knowledge are valid and very relevant, they wouldn't apply as much if he was in a society that had use for other skills most modern humans have like math.

      &#x200B;

      On lest darkness fall, the mc makes a living initially by using math knowledge to secure a loan from a banker. Which he uses to set up a business in which he can through trial and error create useful things that end up making him money on the long run. 

      &#x200B;

      There are many potential points of failure in his particular strategy, but it's much better than The man who came early uses. 

      &#x200B;

      If you start up in a foreign land, without knowing the language, and without money or resources most people are fucked. Sure depending on your capability, appearance and luck you would likely be able to start some uplifting operation if you so wished, how fast you'd be able to do it depends on the factors I mentioned.

      &#x200B;

      But saying modern people don't have much practical knowledge therefore they are inherently fucked if placed in the past is flawed, and so is calling such an interpretation realistic. Just by knowing what's possible you can eventually achieve things through trial and error. Whether you'll have the opportunities to achieve your goals depends on your luck and your ability to avoid failures you can't recover from, but that's how life has always worked.

  It's been a while since I've had the time to comment on these threads, so I'll try to space out recommending some of the stuff I've loved over the last few months.  For this week, here's one that I'd been wanting to rec for a while:

  I'd had Bakuman on my mental you-should-probably-read-this-at-some-point list for a long time, so one day when I was feeling just the right combination of bored and adventurous, I started reading it on my phone. I got about halfway through the series before stopping myself and ordering the physical volumes of the rest.  

  Its writing is just *intelligent*, in ways that are surprisingly insightful, even conditional on the mangakas being veterans (they created *Death Note*), and simply more exciting than I expected a manga about two middle school kids wanting to be mangakas to be - not to mention having a fair amount of heart interspersed.  The character work is also *brilliant*, with a huge supporting cast (for the setting at least) all of whom feel real and who grow and develop in pretty cool ways. 

  There is one part in particular that I felt kind of conflicted about, but I respect the authors a *lot* for going in that direction, and don't think they pulled it off badly. Spoilers for two minor arcs: >!At one point, a character is introduced who tries to revolutionize the way manga is created, with focus testing, large creative teams working up ideas, etc - and when he fails the first time due to hubris and the setup being too shaky, he learns from some of his mistakes and tries again later. It fails again, but while the authors may have been making a point about how setups like that have too many points of failure and this would the realistic outcome, it felt like they making the "antagonist" make stupid mistakes, with artificially created stakes to prevent further attempts. Of course, this may itself be a point by the authors about how much you'd need to cripple new methods to make it an exciting competition.!<

  Does anyone know of a fiction with a protagonist who is a true example of "politician for a good cause"? Like a protag who is capable and willing to engage in machiavellian/realpolitik fuckery to gain power, but through it all keeps a strong internal moral compass, and uses it to truly change their country for the better?

  I guess I just want some awesome moment where the protag sees their chance to seize power and push forward their true agenda after spending the entire time building power and pretending loyalty to the dominant regime, and have it all be for a *truly good cause*.

  Looking for nonfiction recs in the vein of [The Wonderbox](https://www.romankrznaric.com/wonderbox) by Roman Krznaric - essentially, generalist books that explore the historical evolution of particular concepts such as nature, what makes a good life, etc.

  Books that explore different perspectives to such topics (perhaps from different cultures) would be welcome as well. 

  Thanks in advance.

    I've been reading & really enjoying The Silk Roads by Peter Frankopan. It's a historical overview of the development of modern civilization with a focus on Asia, the Middle East and North Africa as opposed to Western Europe the way I (and most Westerners) were taught. Each chapter deals with a period of history and the industries/technologies/philosophies/conflicts that defined it, starting in the middle of the first millennium AD and working up through the end of the 20th century. Examples are precious metal extraction from the New World in the 15th/16th centuries, the rise of various empires built primarily on human trafficking revenues, the rise & spread of Islam, etc. Extremely well-researched and well-written, though informationally dense enough that it requires sustained focus to read.

        ```
        Definitely not! I knew nothing about some topics, a bit about some others, and a lot about a few, and all were equally interesting & comprehensible. The imtemt of the book is to develop an understanding of history different from the one taught to most Westerners, but I think even someone with a totally blank slate would get a lot from it.

    You might enjoy [*Murder Most Foul: The Killer and the American Gothic Imagination*](https://www.amazon.com/Murder-Most-Foul-American-Imagination/dp/0674003845). It's an in-depth exploration of the ways in which public perception of murder and murderers has changed throughout history.

    It delves into how society changed from thinking that 'murderers are no different from you and I', or 'there but for the grace of god go I' (18th century trial sermons) to the perception of murderers as incomprehensibly morally alien. It explores the way that growing literacy rates and ease of publication eroded the clergy's monopoly on moral narative, paving the way for the publication of spectacular 'trial reports' that profited from the public's voyeuristic fascination with 'murder as spectacle,' which in turn gave rise to the murder mystery genre which is still popular to this day.

    The book's scope stretches from the 18th century to the modern period.  Along the way, it also reaches into tangential topics such as the birth of sadism with Marquis de Sade's works in the mid 18th century, reports of Jack the Ripper in the late 19th century, and the gradual replacement of female midwives with 'educated' male physicians during a period when scientific understanding of female physiology was still sorely lacking (18th to 19th century).

  Are there any stories like the recent few arcs of Ar'Kendrythist? Mild premise spoilers for those who haven't read the story yet. A benevolent but overpowered mage wants to steer a world at the brink of destruction to a brighter future. Naturally, this results in lots of friction from self interested parties, as well as problems of logistics, magic, policy, and many other ill-defined fields. I felt that Ar'k gives the world improving part as much nuance as it deserves. People slip through the cracks of far-reaching policies, sometimes political interest supercedes the general interest of improvement, and sometimes good people unintentionally do bad things. It's all very human, but without too much cynicism.

It's almost definitely in part due to how much I love Superman as a character, but that was *twisted*, and right from the get-go - and it doesn't ease up, just digging it in deeper and deeper. Never before have I appreciated to this extent why many people need content warnings (not that I would've heeded it here, never having before appreciated etc).

          >!... and that's just the first chapter. Superman's ultimate fate is having his body being harvested for armour and military tech for decades until it finally deteriorates, his mind being used as one of LexCorp's servers to run massive computations for automated systems (at this point all his higher order brain functions have been permanently wiped away, ground down after decades). All of the Justice League members are slandered in court through Lex's influence and money and framed for Superman's death, and they're eventually killed in their own ways trying to get back at Lex. Batman dies after Lex traps him and allows the Joker to torture him for hours, Nightwing is tortured and killed at the hands of Deathstroke, etc.!<

    Lots of fun if self-indulgent.

    There's also an alternate continuity, marked with Renegade options, where he takes a crueler and more aggressive path to power.
    Catnip for some readers, though I tended to skip those chapters.

    Fair warning: the fic jumped from Spacebattles to SufficientVelocity and, shortly after, QuestionableQuesting.

      I believe the "story only" thread in QQ has everything, if you don't care about reading comments. 

      That being said, as someone who is still reading it, I'm thinking of dropping it. 

      For 1, the number of "alternate universe" chapters seems like it's been increasing, and they are now almost evenly split between "renegade" and "random chapter from an insert into a different universe that the author got interested in" (most recently it's the Transformers universe). I find these not very interesting and think it's an excuse for the author to "write something different" without having to drop his schedule. So he's actively making it worse to ensure he never misses his deadline, which annoys me somewhat.

      And finally, there is no connecting thread/plot (this is not a new development, but it's becoming an increasing issue for me). Lack of a plot isn't _inherently_ a problem (that's almost the defining characteristic of slice of life workds), it's just something I'm slowly finding myself less interested by. He's basically just cataloguing what happens in the life of SI superhero character. As a sort-of-experimental writing excercise (how do you write a story that has no central thread and won't ever end, while still only writing about larger/more important things than the daily minutia you usually get in these kinds of storeies?) it's kind of interesting but after so many years of it, the novelty is wearing off.

        Ha, I swear I saw similar complaints about the AU chapters from back before his bans.
        Even if it was mostly Renegade back then.
        Or the alt-ring versions.
        Seems things have only gotten more extreme.

        The first chunk had a clear enough plot of finding his legs and getting used to this bizarre world.
        It was followed by a decent arc of sufficiently serious threats.
        By the time he >!reclaimed Larfleeze's lair and started fighting planet-scale battles!< I felt it had reached the tipping point; I kept on a bit before dropping it for similar reasons.

        > I believe the "story only" thread in QQ has everything, if you don't care about reading comments.

        I am not sure how different versions of this fic interlink. For example, the QQ version has 177 chapters and 160K words, but the Spacebattles version -- as preserved by FicHub.net -- had 860 chapters and 1.126 million word.

    > I'm looking to read good ratfic or litrpg in the Marvel or DC universes. If I could ask a genie for it I'd say I wanted to read Worth the Candle meets Marvel comics, gamer Dr. Doom would be amazing.

    It's not a litrpg, but try David H. Reiss' Doctor Fid books. They're about a Dr. Doom expy slowly transitioning from an anti-villain to an anti-hero.
