## Writing Prompts r/rational Style!

### Post:

People here have a lot of interesting ideas that never make the jump from a writing prompt to a story.

Maybe you have ideas that only people from r/rational can do justice.

Let's post our ideas here and hope that someone picks them up.

The only rule is that all writing prompts must be a top-level comment.

  This [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a8atr6/d_friday_offtopic_thread/ec9t203) was posted to the Friday Thread just as I was thinking of creating this post. So I'm including it since some people seem like they want to write something based on this idea.

  When AlphaZero detects that they are winning, it effectively starts producing garbage moves, just to hold its advantage. When you see this, you generally know you've lost, but you don't know why. A win is a win to it after all. The utility function doesn't take into consideration the margin of victory, merely the fact of it.

  I'd really love to see something like this emerge in rationalist fiction. 

  On one hand, it could make for a nice explanation of why the transhumanly smart AI seemingly does stupid things mid-plot, and still crushes humanity, or why the humans even _seem_ to have a fighting chance at all, despite the overwhelming superiority of the opposition.

  On the other and given could be leveraged by plucky protagonists acting in a sufficiently out-of-model fashion to defeat an at least marginally technically superior foe if you want to go with a more standard Hollywood trope.

  Coffeeshop AU of HPMOR, with Dumbledore as the owner, the Defense Professor as manager of the location that Harry and Draco and Hermione and Neville work at, and Voldemort as the former owner of a rival chain and Harry's parents' murderer. His current parents don't change.

    OFFTOPIC: 

    Are coffeeshop AUs A Thing, or is there a coincidence that my friend suggested we do a coffeeshop AU of something. She also suggested a "small sourthern town AU" - is that also A Thing? Am I just completely out of the fanfic community loop?
    ```

    - u/boomfarmer:
      ```
      Coffeeshop AUs are a thing, and so I assume that Small Southern Town AUs are also a thing.

    "What else can you do?"

    Minnie poured some milk foam into a cat.

    Harry scrambled back unthinkingly, backpedalling so fast that he tripped over a stray sack of coffee beans and landed hard on his bottom with a *thwack*. His hands came down to catch himself without quite reaching properly, and there was a warning twinge in his shoulder as the weight came down unbraced.

    At once the small image of a tabby cat swirled back into just so much cream and coffee. "I'm sorry, Mr. Potter," said the barista, sounding sincere, though the corners of her lips were twitching upwards. "I should have warned you."

    Harry was breathing in short gasps. His voice came out choked. "You can't DO that!"

    "It's only a latte," said Minnie. "Caffè latte, to be exact."

    "You poured microfoam into a cat! A *SMALL* cat! You violated Conservation of Milk! That's not just an arbitrary rule, it's implied by the foam of the espresso! Rejecting it destroys emulsion and then you get milk texturing! And cats are COMPLICATED! A human mind can't just visualise a whole cat's anatomy and, and all the cat cuteness, and what about the *wittle itty bitty whiskers?* How can you go on *drinking* if you've got a cute little kitty you'd destroy *every time you took a sip?*

    Minnie's lips were twitching harder now. "Practice."

    "Practice *isn't enough* to do that! You'd have to be a god!"

    Minnie blinked. "That's the first time I've ever been called *that*."

  1. HJPEV gets transported to the world of Yugioh, without his magic. What will he do?
  2. All pokemon are sentient after all, and you have been transported to the world of pokemon in Ghetsis's body.
  3. Legend of Zelda, except that Ganondorf is the good guy and Link and Zelda are evil.
  4. Deconstructed time travel romance fic, like, what would happen if the protagonist of such a story was actually smart?
  5. Rational romance period. Tell the story of a healthy romantic relationship between two smart sensible characters, and make it interesting.
  6. This one might not be possible to give the rational treatment but I thought some people here might like it: Someone is stuck in a groundhog day scenario which will not end until they have written an original zombie story with an angle that has not already been tried.

  Unlimited Blade Works / HPMOR crossover fanfic.

  Rin summons caster-class HJPEV using her family's invisibility cloak heirloom, certain that she's going to win easily with the best servant. But it turns out Kirei Kotomine still has his caster servant from the last Holy Grail war, a terrifying intelligent wizard just as empty inside as he is, and they've had 10 years to prepare.

  (admittedly, I'm not sure how this would work without Kotomine & Quirrell winning in like 5 minutes)

    EY said that LV easily beats HJPEV in a straight fight unless HJPEV has some game-breaking advantage. So either give him one, or how about...

    Kirei summons Draco instead? Malfoy heir with 10 years to learn and prepare looks like an interesting and very tough opponent, who is nevertheless not unbeatable by rational!Harry.

      Not 11 year old Harry, 110 year old Harry outfitted with all the magitech enhancements he can think of with 100 years to think about it and access to the philosopher's stone, as well as time to learn all the spells a normal wizard might. 10 years might not be enough to make it last longer than 5 minutes the other way.

        That one sounds difficult on account of the need to be at least as intelligent as the characters you write. I don't think anyone could even come close to being able to write hjpev with a century of prep. Maybe if it was crowd sourced ideas you could make up for the time thing but...tough

        It's a story. You can do flashbacks, you can write about their feelings, etc. You could write a whole book about those 5 minutes.

        It's not like movies and series don't cheat with time. Whenever they show a bomb with a timer, you can bet they stick in far more material than what the timer says.

  The Martian, but the failure is during launch from Earth and the crew capsule crash-lands in the ocean during a storm. All personnel but the main character escape the capsule and are rescued; he stays with the capsule's air pocket and oxygen supplies for a few days until the capsule washes up on a deserted tropical island, with all electronics ruined.

  He still gets discovered by a satellite operator, but what makes rescue problematic is that he's washed up in disputed territory in the middle of a regional conflict. (Pick whatever makes sense for an orbital launch abort.)

    First world countries remove citizens from warzones/unstable territory fairly often, nevermind if they're a high ranking military employee in our space program. The answer is either "unmarked black helicopter picks them up" or "mercenary squad which no one looks too far into picks them up". US department of state even [says](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/what-state-dept-can-cant-do-crisis.html) that they "provide departure assistance" if there is no commercial means of leaving dangerous territory, including "U.S. military or other U.S. government assets" in exceptional situations. Somewhere like North Korea, where we aren't able to do covert rescue ops due to China backing them and have to do prisoner exchanges, isn't the norm.

    You could still write a story about an astronaut being held captive by a militia or something, but it's pretty much just be waiting around until the birds come in.

  Time is bent into a loop that repeats over and over. It will last for a total of 10,000 years.

  It normally only lasts an hour, but it can be extended by one second every time you die before reaching the end of the current iteration of the loop. For example, if you die 60 times, then all future loops will last for one hour and one minute.

  The goal is to survive to the end with your mind intact.

  I just realized how the HPMOR/Gurren Lagann crossover works. I've been trying to cast the Defence Professor as Kamina, and Harry as Simon. But that's not how the story works.

  Harry is Kamina, Draco is Simon, Hermione is Nia, The Defense Professor is the first-arc opponent, *Snape* is Viral. The timeskip is the ensuing seven years of Hogwarts. But who, or what, is the Anti-Spiral?

    Are you willing to take stuff from Significant Digits too? If you are, the big bads from SD would make an excellent Anti-Spiral.

  Rational!Universal Century Gundam, with the background tech level raised to what we have now with regards to miniaturized computers, touchscreens, voice recognition, radar, sonar, aerodynamics and hydrodynamics, and non-Gundanium alloys and materials. And "thrust pushes you up" as the dominant spaceship design instead of the show's "thrust pushes you forwards" design paradigm.

  An 'AIsekai', where an oracle-type artificial intelligence, after its final shutdown, is copied/rescued by the Administrator God of a fantasy realm, and gives it a new task: To calculate the Worth of his World, with a 5% margin of error.

  Someone with actual ethics gets Kilgrave's/Purple Man's power set. (Probably at an age when they've lived long enough to actually develop said set of actual ethics.)
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    If their ethics are deontological, it's really boring: they never use those powers.

    If their ethics are utilitarian, then it's going to turn into Death Note very quickly.

    (actually, you could say Code Geass is pretty much this concept, except for the part where that story isn't rational in the least since it's riddled with utter nonsense at multiple points)
