  This was absolutely delightful. The idea that >!an alter ego could be an entirely different (but equally heroic) person!< was completely novel to me.

    Thank you!  After I finished writing, the thought occurred to me that it seemed a simple enough idea that it had probably been done before, but I haven't yet seen somebody chime in with where.

      It doesn't appear in the [list of ways](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/PlayingWith/SecretIdentity) to play with the trope of Secret Identity.

      The closest trope is [Identity Impersonator](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdentityImpersonator) where you have a body double in the same room as you to 'disprove' yourself as the hero. In your story, it's simply a never ending case of a "failed" Identity Impersonator which I have never seen being done anywhere else.

      Thanks for the story. It was pleasure to read such a novel twist.

      I don't recall an exact case offhand, but for something related, there is Helmuth, of the Lensman series, who "speaks for Boskone" but the rank and file have never encountered actual Boskone, and the protagonist becomes convinced that Boskone is a fiction and it's all just Helmuth. >!The council of Boskone totally exists, they're just operating from another galaxy.!<

  This is delightful, and reminds me of the classic “Captain Gars” trope (the name of King Gustav of Sweden’s alter ego, which was just an acronym of his initials) where the obvious alter ego is just maintained as a sort of “polite fiction.”

  *Everyone* knows who the alter ego is. Everyone pretends anyway, because refusing to go along with this lunacy wouldn’t benefit them one bit. You’d just be making a powerful enemy and going against the grain of everyone else. I love the idea of people involuntarily being forced to play along from the sheer social pressure alone.

  I swear this concept is in my pile of completely unwritten worm fanfic ideas, down to the phrase “mask code” instead of the endlessly annoying “unwritten rules”. But now I don’t have to pretend I’ll write it someday, since EY just did a much better job of it anyway.

    Mind if I steal the phrase ‘mask code’ from you?

      I mean, really it's Eliezer's at this point, but I certainly don't mind. Any story that doesn't act like the common phrase 'unwritten rules' is a specific in-universe thing is great with me.

  The "Fans!" webcomic had a storyline ( the arc in question began at  [http://www.faans.com/books1-6/index.php?p=357](http://www.faans.com/books1-6/index.php?p=357)  ) that does something like the premise indicated -- though the implementation is not the same.

  Most relevant page (which explains the background and spoils the mystery) is probably [this](http://www.faans.com/books1-6/index.php?p=388).

    >!No, look, what happens in the sequel is obvious.!<

    >!*Clearly* the 'Goose (who is Bruce) survived the shots because he's the 'Goose. Then there was a moment when the attention of the crowd is on the shooter. He couldn't have left to change undershirts without being noticed... but he is known to be able to move faster than the human eye can see.!<

    >!So, clearly, what he did was to take a bit of metal from his pocket. A key, some coins... something along those lines. Using his well-known power of thermokinesis, the heated up the metal until it melted, and then spread it over his chest evenly as it applying superspeed sunscreen. Then he waited - just long enough for it to solidify - before getting up.!<

    >!He opened his shirt, claiming that the thin (and unmarked) sheet of metal was a bulletproof undershirt; and since the metal was moulded to his Masculine Mongoosely physique, it *looked* exactly like a slightly stretched undershirt; though, of course, it wouldn't actually stop a bullet.!<

    >!And then he left, before anyone could closely inspect the 'undershirt'...!<
    ```

    - u/keeper52:
      ```
      I don't know why people are getting all conspiracy theory about this.

      >!It's ridiculous - take away the colors and the flair and suddenly most people can't even recognize the supersuit that they've seen a hundred times before.!<

      >!The Goose's suit has got to be one of the most advanced garments known to man - obviously he's going to want to wear something similar when he goes out as Bruce. And obviously he'll go with a copy of it that is tasteful and subdued and appropriate to wear under Mr. Kent's formalwear.!<

      >!Mask Twitter has been all over this. If the logic of it all doesn't have you convinced yet, then go look up the thread comparing images of the "damage" that MM's suit took when he got rocked by the Piper with the pictures of Bruce's new "bullet wounds". Same suit, different color.!<
      ```

      - u/CCC_037:
        ```
        >!The suit? No, the suit of the 'Goose is just ordinary spandex. Besides, Bruce, being the 'Goose, won't wear that in his civilian guise because that would be proof that Bruce *is* the 'Goose and while other's lips may be loose, Bruce the 'Goose is very public in his denials of being the 'Goose.!<

        >!It only looks like a super-suit because it's attached to the skin of the 'Goose. Besides, Mask Twitter is probably in breach of a dozen cases of unmasking supers, and the only reason they're not prosecuted is because none of them have any sort of decent proof. You can't trust what you read on there.!<
        ```

        - u/keeper52:
          ```
          We're not talking about an unmasking here, just sorting out the Undershirt Conundrum. And in this case everyone else is making up convoluted stories while the folks on Twitter quickly settled on the one simple straightforward explanation.

          >!We already saw what Bruce has to say about his super undershirt and he went with the "we happen to have the same tailor" defense. No one bought it for a second, but you know the drill - Bruce's denials don't have to be at all convincing, it just has to be impossible for any of us to pin things down definitively.!<

  Why wouldn't a supervillain attack Bruce Kent thinking he was Goose? l think this ploy would be exposed quickly in a rational world.
  ```

  - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
    ```
    I'd say it'd be rather less dangerous in a rational world than in a comic-book one.  Suppose that in Worm you know that Alexandria is (her civilian identity).  She probably doesn't get one assassination attempt per week in the first place.  If for some reason you *are* attempting that, why attack her civilian identity and get a hell of a lot more opprobrium for having broken the unwritten rules?

    Why would you start a fight you were going to lose?  Blackmail and kidnapping is much more effective.

    - u/ratthrow:
      ```
      Why fight heroes at all? Because you think you have a chance of winning. And what better way to maximize your odds than by ambushing the civilian alter ego?
      ```

      - u/Norseman2:
        ```
        This depends on the superpowers involved. For example, if you want to get rid of Superman, attacking Clark Kent is always a bad idea unless you happen have kryptonite. Of course, even if you do have kryptonite, with this approach you'd end up attacking a guy who is actually immune to kryptonite, probably packing a gun, and has Superman available to provide immediate assistance.
        ```

        - u/Nimelennar:
          ```
          Yeah, considering that the Masculine Mongoose explicitly has "meta powers," it's more likely to be a situation where if you tried to put a bullet through the secret identity's skull, you'd expect to end up with a flattened bullet than a dead hero (and that would have been an excellent decoy to run at some point: set up a fake assassination attempt that Bruce Kent inexplicably walks away from without any injury).

          If the hero were Bruce Wayne, or Tony Stark, or Oliver Queen, on the other hand, and was just a badass normal with some high-tech toys, then this ploy would carry a much higher risk of backfiring, because assassinating the "millionaire playboy" would seem to be a workable way of ridding yourself of the hero.
          ```

          > Of course, even if you do have kryptonite, with this approach you'd end up attacking a guy who is actually immune to kryptonite, probably packing a gun, and has Superman available to provide immediate assistance.

          You're a supervillain with kryptonite. I imagine you're going to do more than just throw an unpowered punch at the dude while waving a green rock in his face. Anyone that is looking to pick a fight with Goose or Superman will crush a baseline human like an insect.

    ```
    The "mask code" seems to suggest some societal pressure against such actions. Maybe every other superhero has promised to focus on any villain that breaks the code?
    ```

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      Probably most of the more reasonable villains as well. Keeping such a code benefits every villain who wants to have a civilian life or who has people to protect. Which probably means the heroes prop up such villains on the side, to flood the market with people they can bargain and reason with if necessary.
      ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    Depends on what the Goose's powers and defences are. If the Goose is like Superman, then little point in a surprise attack other than making him even angrier at you. If he's more like Batman, maybe, but also depends on how many defences Kent has. He's supposed to be a millionaire so you'll expect his house to be a fortress (in fact it's necessary to keep up the fiction; it would make him more suspicious as a potential Goose, which is exactly what the real one wants).

    Of course, in general, in a rational world, any superhero at all who's not some kind of abso-fucking-lutely invulnerable would simply die in action way before the villains get the chance to start pondering other attack strategies.

  That was great! My only doubt is, >!if this person is so wise and so smart and so good, what on God's good Earth was going through their mind when they settled on such a stupid, jockish code name as "Masculine Mongoose"?!<

    It could have been >!coined by the first reporter who got a story on him. Or he could have shown up for the first time in public in costume in India or thereabouts, and gotten his nickname from the way he ducked and weaved and struck the villain he defeated. It could be a stupidly literal translation where it could have been "The Manly Mongoose."!<
