  Speaking only for myself, I think I have a slightly different view of copyright because probably something like 90% of the stuff I read nowadays is fanfiction. So in that sense, a work isn't just there for its own sake but also forms a basis where I plausibly read more stuff in that setting from people writing outside of copyright than the original author's. So I can't help but see copyright as a risk to my authors instead of a support.

  Also when she talked about the way that awards are the deciding factor for bookstore shelf placement, I sort of went "... and how is that the awards' fault again?" To go "and thus, the equitable distribution of awards must be in the interests of all" seems to be putting the cart before the horse somewhat; surely the fault here lies with the bookstores and their simplistic selection of material. But to be fair, I haven't bought a book at a bookstore for half a decade or so.

    *sigh.* 35 years until Lord of the Rings enters public domain. Unless yet another court case pushes back expiration dates.

  >I wonder what I meant. Of course, the books you read early, before 20, and love passionately, they get to you. Even if later on you can’t read them again. You were shaped by certain books. All of us that read a lot, we’re partly book-manufactured. It’s really hard to talk about the influence of such books on you because it goes so deep. It’s like, what was your father’s influence on you, what was your mother’s influence. How can you say? You grew up with it. So, you will find I dodge all questions about favorite books and so on. What does it matter what I like?

  Based Ursula Le Guin!  This is why I've always kinda wondered if reading the *Young Wizards* series qualifies me as a tyke-bomb.
