## [D] Sunday Skills Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Sunday thread for discussions on writing skills!

Every genre has its own specific tricks and needs, and rational and rationalist stories are no exception. Do you want to discuss with your community of fellow /r/rational fans...

* Advice on how to more effectively apply any of the [tropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic)?

* How to turn a rational story into a rationalist one?

* Get feedback about a story's characters, themes, plot progression, prosody, and other English literature topics?

* Considering issues outside the story's plain text, such as titles, cover design, included imagery, or typography?

* Or generally gab about the problems of being a writer, such as maintaining focus, attracting and managing beta-readers, marketing, making it free or paid, and long-term community-building?

Then comment below!

Setting design should probably go in the Wednesday Worldbuilding thread.

  So, JaNoWriMo is almost over and I've written about 22,000 words, which I'm really proud of. In doing so, I managed to iron out a lot of plot things to make everything make more sense (just this weekend I worked out a way to make something that happens in Volume 3 follow logically from actions taken in Volume 1, rather than just kind of happen for *reasons*).

  It's funny, when I first started the project I was scared, I hated everything I wrote, and so on. Now I'm excited, proud, and it's all coming together (but not finished - maybe another 5-10k words, hopefully). Of course, my early chapters don't seem as fluid. I'm going to have to edit them heavily, or maybe just rewrite them entirely. The other thing is that I keep on finding more stuff that's relevant to add, and so the thing gets longer - but in a good way, in a way that fleshes things out, rather than a way that makes it longer than necessary for no reason.

  So, I guess the biggest thing I've learned is if you want to get good at something, force yourself to do it when you're bad at it. The other biggest thing is that it's really hard to write at my desk at home, but easy to write in empty meeting rooms after I finish work and in public libraries. There's lots of research that shows that context is very important, so it's really no surprise, but worth noting. Public libraries are great in general, incidentally: free wifi, nice places to sit, and I spent some of my time looking through recipe books and taking photos of recipes I wanted to make some time. 

  I'll hopefully share the full story on here in a couple of months, though if anyone wants to be a beta reader I think it's about ready for that.

    January November Writing Month? 

    > though if anyone wants to be a beta reader I think it's about ready for that.

    I'm game! Sorry for not responding about that earlier, by the way.

      Yep, JaNoWriMo is a tiny and unofficial January edition of NaNoWriMo.  November is a terrible month for me, I had exams in 2016, my wedding in 2015, and so on, so it's just... better to go for January. I think I'll "take February off" (really: ratchet Beeminder to 250 words a day), and then speed up to 750 in March again.

      I also apparently signed up to design a species in your kickstarter so I should probably email you about that along with the links to my writing.
