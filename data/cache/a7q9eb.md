## PGtE appreciation thread

### Post:

I keep checking /r/rational and it's so quiet without the tri(++) updates on one of my favorite stories. It's going to be a long month.

  Isn't every chapter thread an appreciation thread?

  Gawds, I know. It's been such a staple of the week for so long now.

  Just imagine how weird it'll feel when it's *done*.

  Could anyone give me a motivational kick to finish Book 1?

  I liked the start and Catherine's introduction (can-do orphans who find their own agency in the world is a recipe for success), but the >!petty Squire spats and tacky Dread sovereign quotes starting every chapter!< really grinded my interest down before the nail in the coffin, >!Catherine's stilted entry into her company and war game!<. Bookmarked ever since and collecting dust, but PGTE is pretty popular here so maybe someone can extol its forthcoming virtues if I just soldier on?

    I don't think you share the author's sense of humor, some of the parts you've mentioned were the highlights of the books. The war game was one of my favorite parts in the series. 

    I don't think you'll find some revelation down the road that justifies slogging through if you don't already enjoy the hook.

    Copying from another comment:

    Book 1 is definitely the weakest entry in my opinion. The stakes basically go down after the Summerholm thing transitions to the war college. Book 2 is significantly better, [totally free of wargames for example] so I'd recommend at least that much, although if you don't like it either that's probably a good time to quit, since 3 and what we have of 4 are comparable to that. 

    Basically the end of Book 1 is probably the weakest stretch of the whole thing, so if you liked the beginning I do think you'll enjoy where it starts to pick up, in Book 2.

    I like it for the worldbuilding, mostly. Also, the protagonist going from fuck-up to fuck-up yet getting the better deal at the end is like watching a 30 car pileup with miraculously no injuries. The banter is also pretty funny sometimes, reminds me of Hollywood action flicks.

    The epigraphs are hit or miss, but there's some gems in there.

    I thought 2 was really good, definitely better than 1. 1 seemed like it ticked a bunch of YA boxes just to tick them. On the other hand I also burned out about halfway through 3 and lost all motivation; I thought there was a pretty clear decline in EE's writing when they were forced to move to triweekly updates. I caught myself skimming through chapters paragraphs at a time enough that I just asked myself, "why am I reading this at all?"

    If you are slogging through book 1 I'd say try to give it a finish. It ends on a high note as far as I can remember. However, if you don't even like the funny little epigraphs then it probably just isn't for you. They're the essence of the story in a microcosm.

    I thoroughly enjoy it, highlight of the stories I read that are updated on a schedule (rather than 'when it's ready'). That said, what I like might not be what you do. If you're not enjoying a story, you don't have to read it just because other people think it's good.

      I'm not saying I have to read it or that I read anything because others think it's good. But if it's popular here on /r/rational, then I expect some enthusiastic reader can make a good case for why PGTE is more than the superficial flaws that bothered me in Book 1.

        Didn't hate the wargame, but didn't love her reaction when she experiences some of the fallout of her (quite cold) decision to let the lone swordsman go. It's a bit raw at that point, but in retrospect, reading more, she's a bit more tolerable after she settles into her pattern of making dubious compromises for the greater good. She is, after all, a villain...she just needs a little more time to ungrow.

        In short, I dropped the fic around where you're reading, but apparently  for other reasons, but now find it quite palatable, especially as the story expands, the stable of (unstable) characters develops, and Foundling settles into her persona a little more. If, after great characters like Apprentice and Archer are introduced, you still find it's not for you, then so be it.

    When you say book 1, are you going by the table of contents?
