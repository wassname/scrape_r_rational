## Cyberpunk-ish rational reading?

### Post:

Title says it all, really. I've finished the Sprawl trilogy by Will Gibson recently, and I really liked the aesthetic and the writing. So, the question is, is there something that brings my two favourite literary genres together? 

I am aware of "Branches on the tree of time", and I didn't like it much when I tried to read it for some reason. Anything else?

  Well I don't know about "rationalist", but I can give you some recommendations in general.

  I really like /u/cstross's [Accelerando](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando-intro.html). It's more post cyberpunk, but still. I feel it has the cyberpunk feel, but it's a lot less "low-life" until the vile offspring. And even then the protagonists are immortal and living post-scarcity.

  The other big one is "Snow Crash", which is more traditional cyberpunk. Although somewhat of a parody. It explores some really cool concepts, and if you haven't read it I encourage you to find a copy.

  Finally, a fan work. [Free Radical](http://www.shamusyoung.com/shocked/), a system-shock fanfic by Shamus Young, has one of the best descriptions of a neural interface and one of the best handlings of AI I've seen in a novel.

  None of these are exactly "rationalist", but they're rational, with internally consistent worlds and all that. They explore interesting concepts, even if they don't teach rationality skills.

    I've read all three, I second Accelerando in particular as a very rational work. Snow Crash is interesting, but more plot-driven.

    Can you point me to the neural interface description and why you think Free Radical is great at handling AI? I read through it, but nothing really sticks (probably because I haven't played System Shock).

    Just an aside: although Snow Crash is a good read and fits OP's request, I feel like Neal Stephenson's later works are much more mature. So if you feel like Snow Crash is occasionally sophomoric, don't be put off from reading Anathem or Cryptonomicon!

  I feel like parts of the Takeshi Kovacs series by Peter Morgan approach being rational. In particular, there's a lot of interpretation of people's actions, and reducing those actions down to basic motivations. Unfortunately, it does stray from rationalism occasionally - but when it does that, it tends to be relatively self-aware about it. The first book is Altered Carbon.

  ```
  It's more of a post singularity, post crash, but if your enjoyment of cyberpunk is more based on the clever heist than the grit of the sprawl you might want to try the "The Flower Prince Trilogy" starting with the "Quantum Thief".

    Ventus is available online for free on the [author's website](http://www.kschroeder.com/my-books/ventus/free-ebook-version).

  ```
  The Polity is kind of post-Cyberpunk, but they use all the cyberpunk ideas rationally, for ex. if you can make cyborg arms, you make tons of them and make rejection-proof snap-on versions for battlefields and emergencies.
