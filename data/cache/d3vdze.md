  This worldbuilding doc was a [Patreon goal](https://patreon.com/alexanderwales) from awhile back that took a lot more focused time and effort than I expected it would, partly because there was so much that I wanted to add to it. You will notice a few omissions:

  * Not all 200 of the mortal species are listed
  * There's no complete list of exclusions
  * Bloodline and specic magics are generally not listed
  * There's no comprehensive list of magical flora and fauna

  All of that would have made this thing about twice as long, and it would have taken three or four times as long, in part because it can be creatively draining to make long lists of things (even if I do have some extremely brief lists).

  All of that might get chucked into a Part II sometime in the future, if I feel like it, though it might be after *Worth the Candle* is finished, because I'm going to go ahead and not look at this thing for a bit (corrections or necessary changes excepted).

  Note that there's no section on gods, clerics, etc.: this is deliberate, because they haven't been formally introduced in the story yet.

    > There's no complete list of exclusions

    I admit I'm disappointed by this. Exclusions were what I was most looking forward too.
    ```

    - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
      ```
      I think they're a lot of fun, but there are also canonically fifty-three of them (by a conservative count), and I tend to find similarly formatted lists to be really draining after about ten or so, and I would want more than a single sentence for each, covering what the magic/effect is, whether the place is livable, how you would be likely to die there, and its history ... conservatively three paragraphs each? Which would be one hundred and fifty information-dense paragraphs. I'm not saying that I wouldn't/won't do it, but it would nearly double the length of the doc, it would include things that are definitely spoilers, and this project suffered enough scope creep as it was.

      (I'm trying to think of how many are namechecked in *Worth the Candle* to figure out how much work is done:

      * 13 Horrors
      * Glassy Fields
      * Blue Fields
      * Parsmont
      * Risen Lands
      * Datura Desert
      * Everblood
      * Nightsmoke

      Plus a bunch that are implied to exist, one way or another. My own list of excluded skills has 82 of them, but I would have to cross-reference that with the text, and I know some of them would have to at the very least be renamed, if not refactored.)
      ```

      - u/derefr:
        ```
        I would note that if you’re worried about scope creep—there’s a certain point where this stops being a hobbyist “worldbuilding document” and becomes a freestanding, commercially-viable RPG campaign-world splatbook. So the ROI graph kind of trends down for a while, then spikes way up.

        (Obviously, it’d only make sense to commit to a project like that until after WtC is done, once there’s nothing more to spoil and you don’t have any other active projects immediately calling to you. But such a project would be—like this doc is—a nice byproduct/outgrowth of your working notes, and yet still wouldn’t require the sort of heavy game-design + QA work that actually making a fully-fleshed-out RPG out of WtC’s—not necessarily wholly existent—mechanics would.)

    This is really cool, I'm looking forwards to reading it!

    The doc does contain spoilers for unpublished Worth the Candle, is that correct? Just looking at that first paragraph, I don't recognize any of those names.
    ```

    - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
      ```
      Different people have different standards for what constitutes a spoiler, but generally speaking, I would say no, there are no spoilers for much past the first book, and there are a number of things that have been fully covered in the published materials that aren't in this specifically because they'd be spoilery. That said, part of the thrill of reading is seeing new things get introduced, and there *are* one or two things that will be gone over in the text that are in the doc, I think.

    ~40 years actually. He first showed up in 9BE, spent a few years dicking around with that theater troupe, a few years killing the Dark King and gaining power, and then making the First Empire. He disappeared forever in 30 FE.

  It's funny, the story usually compares the Empire of Common Ccause to the UN, but the first chapter really made me think about the EU: political bloc originally conceived as an economic zone to maintain peace after the collapse of a genocidal empire, check. Ever increasing scope creep, check. Byzantine bureaucracy that nobody can actually change because all decisions require an unanimity vote, check. Only thing that's missing is a member polity deciding to leave after a referendum and almost driving itself to civil war in the process.
  ```

  - u/LupoCani:
    ```
    I think this has been discussed before. The EoCC is compared both to the US

    >“It’s complicated, Juniper,” said Amaryllis. “The Empire of Common Cause operates under a legal framework that’s meant to govern interaction between polities, and which has slowly crept into everyday life -- lots of parallels with your own United States, actually, minus the Civil War.

    and the UN

    >When people said “the empire” they meant something akin to the United Nations, in that it was a rather toothless organization whose real power came from member countries agreeing to impose standardized laws or make global (they said hexal, for obvious reasons) sanctions against one another.

    in the text, and the EU does sit somewhere in between on the toothless/not-toothless scale. Overall, I'd say the EU is the closest analog, with a couple of caveats.

    * The legislature appears more similar to that of China, the National People's Congress. They have in common both that they're very large, and that they are only rarely in full session, instead delegating legislative power to legislative subcommittees. As far as I can see, while western legislatures do delegate a lot of power, it's almost always to departments under the executive branch.

    * The EoCC clearly isn't always toothless, and there's been references to the organization as whole declaring war or taking similarly extreme action, which is beyond what the EU has ever done.

    * I'm not read up on the Court of Justice of the EU, but I think that on balance, the concept of a powerful judiciary that often rewrites the legal reality, with limited recourse by the traditional legislative process, is more prevalent in the US than the EU.

  Nice worldbuilding document. I like it. 

  Keys and cloaks - this whole thing about big enough pyramids distorting time reminds me a *lot* of Pratchett's Discworld book Pyramids.

  The >9000 hells - seems like inspired by D&D's 666-layer'd Abyss?  

  Interimperium - I would have used the word 'interregnum' here, as it's an awesome word.

  > In the naive case, a velocity mage will increase their own velocity at the expense of mass, conserving power. This allows for much faster movement, at the expense of an ability to affect the world. A velocity mage at ten times speed will punch with one tenth the mass.

  > The big problem with speedsters is that velocity is extremely powerful, since power equals mass times velocity.

  I think the above still has some issues. Momentum equals mass times velocity, but energy equals 1/2 times mass times velocity squared. If you're at half the weight and twice the speed, your punch is still effectively more powerful. This means that as far as damage is concerned, increasing speed by some factor at the cost of reducing mass by the same factor. 

  The basic example would be one billiard ball hitting a second of the same mass (head on, and assuming the collision is elastic). If the two have the same mass, all the momentum and kinetic energy of the first is transferred to the second; the first ball comes to a complete stop. If you halve the mass of the first and double its velocity however, conservation of momentum and energy work out to the second ball receiving 8/9 of the kinetic energy of the first, i.e. 16/9 times the kinetic energy (meaning 4/3 times the velocity) it would have received without the change in mass and velocity of the first. The remaining 1/9 remains with the first ball, which bounces back at 2/3 of its original velocity. (I hope I did the math right)

  In other words, while velocity mages have to worry more about recoil, their punches would actually be stronger. A more even trade might be increasing velocity by a factor x at the cost of reducing mass by a factor x^2, preserving kinetic energy rather than momentum. In the billiard ball example, that would mean only 16/25 of the original kinetic energy would be transferred to the second ball (i.e. it would move at 4/5 of the original velocity compared to the case without mass/velocity adjustments), while the first would recoil at 6/5 of the original velocity (which makes recoil an even bigger problem compared to the first case, and actually seems to reduce the ability of a velocity mage to interact with the world (obviously the math would be more complicated compared to the billiard ball example, but I'm fairly confident things would work out in much the same way)).

      > inconsistent present tense.

      I'm not sure on this one, because "how they **were** practiced" seems like it would indicate that they're no longer practiced that way. Compare:

      > My wife and I were a natural fit because we share a similar sense of humor.

      That intuitively seems perfectly fine to me, because though the tense isn't consistent between the two clauses, it doesn't have to be, and breaking it apart would be completely fine:

      > My wife and I were a natural fit. We share a similar sense of humor.

      It's mostly a question of connotations. (And I don't particularly like putting those two verbs in line with each other in this case.) Usually in cases like this, I would just rewrite the whole thing so that the problematic structure isn't there at all, but I'm not actually sure that it's wrong, or if it is, *why* it's wrong.

      Fixed all the rest though, thanks.

    > For a period of roughly a thousand years, Scamadus was known for its steel, which was folded some hundred times, giving it a unique pattern and several beneficial properties.

    Not a typo as such, but folded steel is only folded a few times, maybe a dozen or so at most, because each fold doubles the number of layers. Folding 100 times would make the steel completely homogenous. This is in ch2.


    > This zig-zag while moving up the ranks has made blood magic one of the less favored of the magics in recent, more peaceful times.

    For the section on blood magic, I think this should specify that becoming a master blood mage is less favored, as blood magic in general is one of the only healing magics left. The various abilities that the novices get aren't combat exclusive, and could help you in mundane situations in various ways.

    > Combat-focused gem mages are quite rare: it’s usually a contingency of some kind, or a readily-used burst of offensive power.

    This line in the gem magic section is confusing since gem magic seems to be only useful in combat.

    > Additionally, a still mage can only affect whole objects.

    This line in the section on still magic seems explicitly false, unless im not understanding it correctly. Still mages can still someone's heart, which is only a part of them, and this is a commonly known ability.

    > They carefully track their food intake, supplement their means with medicines,

    In pustule magic, means should be meals

    > Wards can either act as barriers against the specific magic, or they can act to annihilate the magic that passes through them, with the latter costing far more concordance and taking considerably more training to use.

    In the warding section, this should probably read "annihilate or suppress the magic that passes through them", since entads can be warded against, making them non-functional, without destroying them.

    > Sinusoidal

    You use this word a number of times, but I think you're thinking of a sigmoid function. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function?wprov=sfla1
    A sinusoidal function is a sine wave, which in context would mean various parameters decrease as more of another are added after a certain point. I explicitly noticed it in the water magic section, but saw the word a few other times as well. A sigmoid function increases quickly at first then levels off, which is what I think you intend.

      The bit about folded steel is probably a DM Easter egg to anime subculture, referencing the meme “SUPERIOR NIPPON STEEL, FOLDED OVER 1000 TIMES”.

  During the Second Empire, there was research into using Soul magic to predispose Passion mages towards heightened emotional states, one aim being power generation through the resulting magical effects. Although a theoretical description of Passion magic remains a futile endeavour, it was empirically determined that peak magical output resulted from not a single intense feeling but instead a repeating series of transitions between four distinct emotions. The first such set to be discovered was the Lust-Hunger-Anger-Fear loop, which led to the erroneous belief that only primal emotions could form the vertices of these "carnal cycles".

  A lot to think about. 

  First of all, Aerb is a shitty place. I thought Warhammer 40k was shitty, but Aerb is on a whole other level. It's not as grimdark, but it would be so much worse to exist there. 

  Are there still elves on Celestar? It sounds like there still are. So for all the bullshit on Aerb, there's even more bullshit there (Is it smaller or bigger than Aerb?). And considering the type of stuff that goes on on Aerb, there should be stuff happening there that threatens all life on Aerb, cue star quest. 

  The magics are so arbitrary. At this point, I wouldn't be surprised to see mist magic, snow magic, steam magic or ice 2 magic. 

  I wonder if the powers of the Ice Wizards or Apocalypse Demon are going to get explained. I'd like to get a feel for the type of threats Arthur faced. I don't really have a sense of how powerful he was atm. Ice Wizards are mentioned 3 times, the Apocalypse Demon 6, 

  Do Infernals reproduce or are there a set, finite number of them? Is it possible for the mortal species in the Hells to fight back against the Infernals? Do they just not because there's no magic available and the Infernals are much better fighters? If that's the case, I can imagine a scenario where you industrialize the creation of souls and swamp the Hells with overwhelming numbers of mortals so that they stand a chance.

  - u/FireHawkDelta:
    ```
    I suspect ice magic is extremely degenerate, designed as an NPC-only skill and excluded when Uther tried it out. Ice powers are generally broken in battle shonens, with a tendency to do weird metaphysical things at high levels. I can think of multiple ways a single application of ice magic could create an exclusion zone: a freezing spell that fuels itself with the heat it destroys, ice-nine from Cat's Cradle, general matter generation shenanigans, maybe even just extreme lethality against most of the mortal species making Ice Magic 100 a solution to way too many fights in the DM's opinion.

  Quite an impressive world building document!  It’s nice to see all the one off species and places complied into one place.  It seems I missed or forgot many minor details or else they weren’t given in the main story.  Like, for example, all I could remember of the Vitrics was that they were blue and that we had only seen female members of their species, their lightening magic and mono-gender I had completely missed.

  Seeing this document, I can see how Juniper is constantly reminded of his own world building.  Aerb feels both more (seeing more details) and less (seeing more hackey obvious simulated and inconsistent elements) real now.

  The things that aren't described are somewhat interesting in that the lack of mention makes me suspect they are likely to be future story elements that are avoiding being spoiled to strongly.  (I am mainly thinking about the Gods of Aerb, but also somewhat about the exclusion zones)... oh wait

  > Note that there's no section on gods, clerics, etc.: this is deliberate, because they haven't been formally introduced in the story yet.

  already addressed...

  One minor question comment... was it intentional or accidental giving the full work link instead of the chapter by chapter link.  The full work link tempted me into reading it all in one sitting, not that I mind, just noting how it may alter reading habits from reading it incrementally to reading it all in one big chunk.
  ```

  - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
    ```
    I put in the full work link because it's one of my favorite features of AO3, and makes the document a lot more searchable, along with showing its whole length at once. It's just personal preference. I imagined that only a few people would read it straight through.

- u/paradoxinclination:
  ```
  It's funny that the document states that the bulk-teleport spell was used in warfare, but also that it's unuseable by living creatures due to it sterilizing anything that the spell transports. It's unlikely that they used it to drop heavy objects or tele-frag people, since the document specifically states that the spell would fail if it was aimed too high into the air or into spaces that are already occupied. So how the hell did people use the bulk teleportation spell in war? I suppose it could have been useable for living creatures at one point and then been partially excluded.
  ```

  - u/burnerpower:
    ```
    Logistics. The ability to transport supplies instantly with no risk of them being intercepted would be insanely valuable to any army. Also I don't see anything in the document that says telefragging is in any way restricted outside of wards so it should be effective.
    ```

    - u/paradoxinclination:
      ```
      Sure, I don't disagree that completely removing your supply chain is awesome, I'm just not sure it's such a game-changer that it would require the formation of an empire to restrict its use in war. It's even stated that cities had to be warded against attack by bulk teleportation, so clearly they had *some* kind of offensive use.

      >The Athenaeum of Barriers was put to work fortifying cities against attack by bulk teleportation as best as possible, and pacts of mutual defense and/or teleportation-in-warfare bans were put into place, which, along with trade agreements and enforcement mechanisms, formed the basis for the rise of the Second Empire and its eventually legal formation in 176 FE.

      And the section where bulk teleportation is described states that it fails if the chosen space is already occupied, so telefragging would appear to not be an option.

      >Given the proper ingredients and a copy of the ritual, anyone can teleport a volume of space to nearly anywhere else on Aerb. This teleportation will fail if the destination location is high up in the air or if the destination location is already occupied.

        I'm not sure how the space occupied clause limits bombs. It shouldn't stop teleporting bombs next to people. Am I missing something? Anyway cities have to be warded so their enemies can't teleport bombs to currently unoccupied spaces within them. Atleast, I think that is the reason for the wards.

        Teleport perfectly sterile poison gas into a city. Or acid from the Elemental Plane of Acid. Or a lot of oil and a lit match.

        There's *plenty* of ways to use bulk teleportation to attack.

      Telefragging won’t work because the spell fails if the target space is occupied. 

      Another application you overlooked is teleporting time bombs shortly before they explode, or chemical weapons in general. 
      Hell, if you have a good enough layout of the enemy’s garrison, you could teleport blockages into all the main corridors, entrances, etc.

    A rock the size of a shipping container doesn't need to fall very far in order to crush someone or something. Objects could be teleported to block roads or other means of transportation. You could swamp an area in something difficult to remove, like tar, or something noxious like animal corpses. An animal corpse wouldn't be a direct threat, but if there are a bunch they could quickly rot and cause problems. A spy could teleport vital materials to their own army. Transportation of otherwise stationary weapons would be practical. You could also swamp an area in propaganda, causing demoralization. Depending on how the spell is set up, you could make tons of pitfall traps by using the teleportation spell as an earthmoving ability.

      Interesting thought, I should have considered non-living threats sooner. Automatons or undead soldiers would be perfect for this kind of warfare, too bad there don't seem to be any kind of non-excluded ways to create undead left in the hex.

  This is fantastic. I understand why there's no time or space to write out the whole world, but I really hope we get to see some more details in the rest of the story. I'm especially interested in the exclusions - it was a bit wierd to come across the City Made Manifest several times and not have a clue what it meant; these seem to be things that any well-educated child on Aerb would know about but that I'm missing.

  One munchkinry/question on the Renacim:

  > When one dies, they will reincarnate within a few days, taking the place of the closest available embryo in an already-pregnant woman.

  Is "Closest available" just a distance measurement? Because it seems like that would lead to lots of elderly renacim choosing euthanasia in the attic above a pregnant queen's bedchamber. The highlights of the special exceptions at Sound and Silence and education processes to maximize utility for Pallida seem like they would be greatly aided if you were born into wealth and power, which could be easily accomplished under that reincarnation strategy.

    By not have a clue, you mean more than this?

    > “Manifest Destiny - The fall of the Second Empire was, by some accountings, inevitable, but by others, it was the work of a single incident. The exact nature of the magic that allows the immortal man named Manifest to puppet his subjects from a distance is unknown, as is his exact location, but it is clear that with the magic excluded, his range is limited to only Lankwon, once the Imperial City, now the City Made Manifest. Defeating him will be an impossible task, but one that you have taken upon yourself.”

    Regarding Renacim, I think it’s safe to bet that any royalty in the world will take care to keep their pregnant women away from the bubblegums (elderly or not). And if it fails, they can always kill the baby.

    This comment confuses me. Isn't that the nature of the phrase here on Earth? Wouldn't it mean exactly the same thing?

    To break it down "a rising tide lifts all boats" means that a win-win solution has been achieved. All she's saying is that it's a rare case where there's a win-win situation, rather than win-lose, except that the magnitude of wins is different, which makes the aphorism inapt. She's not commenting on the action of the tides.
