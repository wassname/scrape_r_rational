## [Not a story] Looking for group for rational(ist) roleplaying.

### Post:

One of the things I have enjoyed a lot over the last couple of years is roleplaying in the format of play-by-post. Most commonly it takes a form similar to pen-and-paper with the main difference being that it's done on a written form which, in my experience, allows players to go much more in depth with their characters thoughts, feelings and demeaner. It also allows people to play cross time zones and with vastly different schedules although it have a tendency to be pretty slow.

When I have been reading the various stories on this reddit I've been unable to stop thinking about how fun it would be to be in one of those. What would I have done if I were thrust into a world with vastly different (and rigid) rules? How would I have used a time loop for? 

I've had good experiences with similar games in the worm setting and think it would be a lot of fun to play a character in a setting similar to that in one of the hard fantasy settings that are found on this subreddit, or a completely new one with different rules to be explored. Anyone interested in playing or running such a thing?

Edit:

I suggest that those who want to be the Destiny Maestro/GameMaster write a pitch for their games, either here or on the [#Looking_for_group](https://discord.gg/DCcHUX) on the discord, people create characters for the games they think are interesting, and GM's pick which characters they think will suit their game best. /u/GaBeRockKing have some suggestions for places to play the games further down.

A pitch could include the basic outline of the world, what the players would be doing, the degree of which the story is preplanned vs. how much player, expectations for player/characters, GM's wants/expectations for the game, focus area of the game, tone of the game, system used.

  I'd be interested; it's been a while since I've done play-by-post, and I'm missing it.

  That being said, reddit isn't the best platform for it. Maybe we could gather players here, then move to [sufficientvelocity](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/) or [spacebattles](https://forums.spacebattles.com) instead for the actual RP? I know there's a lot of overlap between /r/rational users and people in the SB/SV/AH/^^^^QQ crowd.

    Wait, what was that last one?

      shhhhh

      QQ is [Questionable Questing](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/).

      It split off from SB before SV did. There is an overlap in the userbases of the these three sites, but QQ's is definitely the smallest.

      Most significantly, there is a distinct lack of a puritan administration, so a lot of NSFW or boderline-NSFW content that would go to SB or SV, if it were allowed, gets posted on QQ instead. (You need to be logged-in to access QQ's NSFW sections).

  I'd be interested, though it's already becoming apparent there's probably too many people interested in being players for this to work as any normal game. So maybe set up a discord or something and hopefully there will be a 1:4/5 ratio of people who want to GM to those who want to play and people can split off into groups of manageable sizes.

    There's already a subreddit discord, linked on the sidebar, or accessible via http://discord.gg/rational. It's pretty easy to set up a channel for coordination - and in fact, we already have #looking_for_group, which tends to serve that purpose.

  I’d be interested in playing. My schedule is tight so play-by-post is a format that would work really well for me. I’ve been wanting to get into D&D, but time constraints make it nearly impossible for me to commit to anything.

  I will be definitely interesting in something like that. Not sure whether reddit is the best place for it.

  I occasionally run a play-by-post murder mystery roleplay in a futuristic setting with a few of its own "rules," in that certain fictional technologies are available. In terms of rationality, I did my best to write a "smart" killer, and to set up the clues in such a way that the players can systematically eliminate suspects and solve the mystery through careful observation and deduction (or, in the case of the killer's player, manipulate and mislead everyone to their advantage). The game lasts for two IRL weeks and players can post at their leisure. It's not exactly what you described, but is that something you (or anyone else here) would be interested in?

    I am instantly and extremely interested in the concept of a play-by-post murder mystery. How might I join the next of these to be run?
    ```

    - u/CeruleanTresses:
      ```
      By still having the same Reddit account next time I run it! I just ran it a few weeks ago and it's kind of an endeavor, so next game probably won't be for a couple months at least, but I'm taking down your username so I can contact you when the time comes.
      ```

      - u/natron88:
        ```
        Wonderful, I look forward to it!
        ```
