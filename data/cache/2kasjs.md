## [Last Announcement] Kickstarter for "Pay Attention": 24 hours left, reaching for second stretch goal

### Post:

Hi folks,

[The Kickstarter for "Pay Attention"](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/213223018/pay-attention) has done amazingly well, thanks to you lovely people.

Today is the last day; as I write this, there are 25 hours left on the clock.  We are very close to the second stretch goal and I'd love to get there; if you know anyone who's been on the fence about pledging, please give them a nudge.

This is the last announcement you'll see about this Kickstarter -- when it ends tomorrow, I'll send the 'thank you' message to the backers.  For now, let me just say this:

Thank you, /u/Timewinders, for giving me the idea for this story in the first place.

Thank you to everyone on this reddit for encouraging me to do the Kickstarter back when I wasn't sure about it.

And thank you so much to everyone who has pledged, Tweeted, Facebooked, or mentioned it to anyone ever.  You have no idea how amazing this is for me.

  Well, I chipped in $5. Wish I could give more. I started out really disliking the writing in Two Year Emperor, but after the 7th or 8th chapter either you improved drastically or I got into the swing of it. Now you rank pretty highly on my author quality lists.

  Anyone with a lot of disposable income want to add a few thousand words to the story? I know I'd really appreciate it.

    Thank you very much, that's really great of you.

    I'm glad to hear that you ended up liking 2YE.  Out of curiosity, do you remember what you didn't like about the first few chapters?

    Looks like someone heard you.  Someone picked up the $75 "Extra 2,000 words" reward.  Thanks!
