  Hmmm, I should probably get into Doc Future again. Been a while.

    To be fair, updates were really sparse for a while 8-)

      I'm glad you're back to writing regularly! Having to finally pick up all the plot threads as you come to the conclusion is tricky. As George Martin, Jim Butcher, Patrick Rothfuss, and honestly everyone in SF/F except Brandon Sanderson can attest.

  Even if you are paranoid, that doesn't mean there aren't people out to get you.  But Flicker's day gets a little better. Journeyman is returning from the events in the Nine Worlds he later relates in Chapter 45 of The Makers Ark [here](https://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/175160878791/the-makers-ark-chapter-45).

  I really appreciate Journeyman's management of infohazards here.
  ```

    ```
    He's had a lot of practice and has a talent. He's going to need all of it...
