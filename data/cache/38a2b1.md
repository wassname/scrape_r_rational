  Woot!

  [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1ryed3/harry_potter_and_the_methods_of_rationality/) was one of the subreddit's first ever submissions, posted by /u/seraphnb on December 3rd, 2013. I don't actually have the statistics on when we hit 1000 subscribers, but [we hit 2000 on January 4th of this year](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2rcbbz/meta_rrational_hits_2000_subscribers/), which the reddit dating algorithm is still calling "4 months ago" (per OP) but is really much closer to 5.

  So, we went from 0 to 2000 in thirteen months, and we've gone from 2000 to 3000 in five months. I'm guessing this increase was definitely attributable to the Grand Finale of *Methods of Rationality*, considering that's the subreddit that spawned this one, so of course there would be a trickle-down effect.

  The next 1000 will undoubtedly come much more slowly, but, if we manage to keep up the steady rate of submissions and quality discussion we've enjoyed over the last year and a half, I'm sure it will be all in good time. Not that it matters or anything ...

  Here's to another happy 18 months!

  Neat.

  Just a reminder to be the change that you want to see in the subreddit; the internet runs on the [1% rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_%28Internet_culture%29), and you can heavily influence the direction of this sub by being part of that 1% of content creators or 10% of commentators. The average submission to this sub gets around 15 upvotes; that's not uncommon for a sub this size, but it means that a single person can have a huge impact.

    This. Even if I don't particularly enjoy a piece of fiction (which isn't often here), I'll upvote and/or comment to give the author some encouragement. 

    Who knows? A little push and anyone here could make the next Harry Potter.

  I unsubscribed to mess with you guys.

  I get most of my reading content/recommendations here; this sub has prevented me from going crazy on base every week. Also, it has provided much motivation to write. I'm in the middle of a rational short story that I'll hopefully post soon.

    Where are you in the army?

      The city-sized country-state of Israel. We specialize in not having convenience stores or convenience in general.

        מה קרה לך?  היו לנו המון חנויות של 24 שעות בחיפה.

          I was thinking more along the lines of Target/Walmart. Convenience stores here are about as convenient as a root canal before your solo on Broadway. Not to mention the incredible lack of quality for the prices.

          In a similar vein, if I want to buy a book, I have to go to the צומת ספרים at the mall and pay 45₪. I miss Amazon Prime.

          Also, I'm not בנימין, sorry. But hi anyway. טוב לפגוש אותך.

  I've been coming here for a while but I just saw 2,999 subscribers and clicked to become #3000... I'm sure others also became #3000 but since I did it most recently I claim the mantle and whatever powers that may grant to me.
  ```

    ```
    The counter is still at 3,000. So I just unsubbed and re-subbed.

    WE CAN ALL BE #3,000 TOGETHER

  It also [appears to be](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FACnyu7sMFeERPl2X1d6FcGu85p1mTLa4ondhH-p1eA/pubchart?oid=1365658218&format=interactive) (online user count, /r/rational in red) just on the verge of exceeding /r/HPMOR for overall activity!
