  I really liked this chapter. Feels like things are actually happening!

  So it turns out creating a blue isn’t as simple as filling slimes with mana from Essence Well. It *could* be an issue of being too much mana at once or the slimes being too low level, but regardless I like that Rain tried it.

  I assume next chapter Rain will get to access the artifact, so that’ll be exciting. Either that or he’ll just direct the crew towards the disturbance and we’ll see it later.

    Welcome to the club! And regarding the latest chapter may I just say, >!cha ching.!<

    How many early chapters do patrons get?

      Looks like 8 chapters for $2.50.

  Does clarity increase the ability to see past enchantments?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I think that’s the only logical explanation. It also probably means there’s a difference between the rock illusion and Val’s invisibility - Val is actually bending light, but the illusion is purely mental.

      I've been thinking that Rain's soul damage is messing with it, much like it messes with Accolades.

  this novel is so good, even though still not as good as Mother of Learning. I do hope I can find more novels like these.

    Try [Dungeon Crawler Carl](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29358/dungeon-crawler-carl/chapter/442507/chapter-1).  It's got a similar isekai + LitRPG setup but it's significantly faster paced with more action and humor.

    Did you read The Daily Grind yet?
    ```

      ```
      Can you give a description longer than the one listed on RR?  I'm thinking I might try it, too.

        It's not really a litrpg, though it has skills and other weird shit. They never actually list all they got, and they'll get a lot. No actual stats.

        Dude finds an infinite office dungeon in the office he works in, and gets interested. Finds monsters like staplers and plants and dodges exploding coffee mugs. Killing monsters gives skill orbs, which are usually shitty, but when you get a lot of them, you'll get some useful ones too. Could be +1 to cooking blueberry pancakes or +3 to japanese customs bureaucracy. Usually very specific stuff. Ofc, this is not the only kind of orbs and there are other secrets too...

        He starts asking roommates and d&d friends to his looting party and... Is this enough?

          Inspired me to start reading it, ty.
