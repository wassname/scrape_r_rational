  I feel like the recent chapters have been Cat realizing that events have kind of gotten away from her, and it's weirdly gratifying.

  Is anyone else having some trouble putting a tune to that song?
  ```

  - u/Yes_This_Is_God:
    ```
    Yeah, I tried a few different tunes, but none of them worked out in my head.
    ```

    - u/ErraticErrata:
      ```
      I used 'Come Out Ye Black And Tans' as background music while writing the song, though it diverges from the melody pretty quick.
      ```

      - u/JdubCT:
        ```
        Since you're around what did you base Hakram's Deadhand song off of?
        ```

        - u/ErraticErrata:
          ```
          Didn't use a particular melody for that one, I went by ear.
          ```

  - u/JdubCT:
    ```
    They've been away from her from the very start. She's creating a story that can change creation in a way that's only been done in a minor way before (Calamities). If she were *really* able to control everything she'd already be a god.
    ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  It feels like Cat is kind of "catching up" with what her plan was from the start. Like, from day one, her plan was "unify Callow and Praes", and her method has always been "find a common enemy to point them at".

  I guess it's great that it's progressively hitting her that this strategy is super unstable and potentially disastrous.
  ```

- u/paradoxinclination:
  ```
  It looks like Cat is going to begin running into the problem all great conquerors eventually face; you run out of enemies to kill and your armies find new ones.
  ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  By the way, I love this line:

  > “The custom exists,” she said. “But only Praesi think it’s common. If a couple needs to fight to choose who’ll raise the child, they shouldn’t be having children. It’s a sign of immaturity.”

  I'm not sure how to put it, but it's great. It summarizes everything I think about culture, how we perceive it, and how we relate to it as individuals.

  "Yeah, there are people who get into a ritual duel to settle who will raise their child. Specifically, morons who think 'having (the orc version of) pubic hair' is equivalent to 'being an adult'. Actual adults talk about it like fucking sentient beings."
  ```

- u/JdubCT:
  ```
  The Sword, indeed, weighs more than the Crown.
  ```

- u/GriffinJ:
  ```
  The song didn't flow too well but the weight of it was very satisfying. Overall I'd say this was a great foreshadowing chapter.
  ```

- u/MutantMannequin:
  ```
  > The more my Name and the mantle I had stolen from Winter set me apart from humanity, the more I understood I had to grasp tightly onto it.

  Firmly grasp it in your hand. Firmly grasp it!
  ```

- u/Law_Student:
  ```
  I wonder if the shape of things to come will involve Kat turning the Empire into its own redemption story, thereby defying Bard's plans by subverting the Good vs. Evil and Heroes vs. Villains narrative dictated by the Gods (who I suspect Bard is or works for) into something new and more complex. The Empire has already become a better place than the Good kingdoms in a variety of ways, and Kat has recruited two heroes to her party to create a story where heroes and villains are working side by side.

  Ultimately I think this comes down to Kat finding a way to end the Gods' imposition of their story onto all the mortals. That stupid endless Good vs. Evil conflict is the root of all the problems.
