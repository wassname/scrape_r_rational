## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

    >How probable is it for something like that to happen?

    Almost zero chance that it directly causes the end of the world.

    Russia has been getting hammered by US sanctions, and combined with free-falling oil prices that's put their economy in the shitter. Putin is acting tough to get the US  to the negotiating table. While they won't start WW3 over a middle east backwater the US doesn't particularly want to invade regardless, they might make it tough for the US to act in the area (for example, by funding extremists, or using their diplomatic weight to convince other nations to stop giving the US basing rights.) As such, Russia's intention is to get some deal along the lines of "we look the other way, you drop your sanctions."

  A quick recommendation for Logan (movie, probably still in theaters). Really good story.

  Not rationalist, a few minor plot holes, and the usual problems with child actors, but still a really really enjoyable story.

  - u/HeroOfOldIron:
    ```
    Nah, the actress for X-23 did an amazing job. Especially in the one scene where she ends up crying, her nose starts running and if what little I remember from acting classes several years ago is true, that's something that only happens when you're really managing to act really well.

    Agreed on the plot holes, they existed but weren't Armageddon levels of stupid and distracting. Seriously, fuck that movie, it's way easier to teach astronauts how to drill than it is to teach oil drillers how to astronaut.
    ```

  - u/Afforess:

    Really? I thought it was an okay action movie, but the plot seemed pretty weak and I am thoroughly tired of Hollywood "soft-rebooting" franchises. 

    Logan's biggest plot hole was the whole money issue. Logan's a super-predator past his prime, so why isn't he using what he has and taking money from people. Ideally criminals, but still, chauffeuring vegas tourists to make money? Really?

    I was also annoyed that the driver-less semis were portrayed as being dangerous and the software didn't watch out for pedestrians.
    ```

    - u/_stoodfarback:
      ```
      [spoilers RE: money](#s "It made sense to me. My read of the character: in general, he's a broken man who's dying and can't stop it, maybe doesn't want to stop it. Always drunk, very short-term in his behavior. In this specific case, he accepted a responsibility, taking care of Xavier. If he hits up some criminal organization and doesn't get away 100% clean, that brings the conflict to his door, right to Xavier.")

      [spoilers RE: semis](#s "In the driver-less incident, the semi in question belonged to the agro company that was antagonistic to the guy who wouldn't sell them his land. They mention in-story that it might've been on purpose. In this setting, the companies seem to have a lot of power over the law; for example, the main antagonistic company being very cavalier about killing the witnesses in the gas station.")

      However, this is just my understanding of the story as I remember after watching the movie once. I might be way off.
      ```

    - u/captainNematode:
      ```
      [very mild spoilers](#s " I thought making the driverless semis front-to-back symmetric to be really stupid. Not only would it confuse the hell out of older drivers on the road, but it's also aerodynamically disadvantageous! Cars are pointed in their direction of travel for a reason!")

      [slightly less mild spoilers](#s " The money issue to me was more egregious with respect to Xavier. Surely as a once multibillionaire he would squirrel away stashes of a few $100k all over, both in liquid currencies and in supplies (in the comics he has a few billion from his inheritance, but obviously a decent number of mutants could amass huge fortunes with a bit of creative power application, even secretly. Hell, even the X-Jet in the movies would be worth, in terms of operating costs, $1B+). At least, that seems a very basic, reasonable precaution once you have that sort of money, one that he could have Logan rely on in his moments of lucidity.")

      [plot-relevant spoilers](#s " I was also really bothered by the *salt-of-the-earth farming family* subplot. It seemed thoroughly obvious to me that, when a huge organization with untold power and resources and little regard for human life is out to get you and you're not at all secret about your travels and getaways, anyone in close association with you will wind up dead, tortured/interrogated, or both (I whispered as much to my wife when they first extended the dinner invitation). I can maybe get Xavier's desperation for family and social togetherness (and perhaps senility) clouding his judgment, but is Logan just... apathetic? Stupid? Does he value Charles' wishes being fulfilled above the lives of the farmers? He's not without experience in these matters and yet only puts up token disagreement and resistance. ")

      As for child actors, I thought Dafne Keen did a really solid job, but I agree that some of the other kids' performances were a bit lacking. 

      And while I had a few other qualms with the movie (that I forget now), overall I rather enjoyed it! [](#s "A good last hurrah for (this iteration of) Wolverine (/Hugh Jackman).")

  So...I got accepted to San Francisco State University earlier this week, which means that I'm going to be working on a Master's in Philosophy come August. 

  Any suggestions for finding good housing in the Bay Area? I'm looking on Craigslist, Zillow, etc., and keeping an eye on anything that looks good (my main problem here is that I'm not in SF yet, so I can't do check out the sites in person or anything), but if anyone has advice then it would be appreciated. 

  Also, if anyone happens to know somebody who's going to be needing to fill a room around August, then that's cool, too. It doesn't matter how small the space is, so long as I'm physically capable of sleeping in it, and I'd rather live in a walk-in closet for cheap than go too far into debt for a room that I could swing a cat in. 

  Also, if there's anything that you wish you had known before going to grad school, I'd appreciate hearing it. I've been doing my research, but I'd prefer to not miss out on a good bit of advice just because I didn't ask.
  ```

  - u/captainNematode:
    ```
    Congrats!

    Housing suggestions in the Bay are pretty budget-dependent -- how much are you getting as a stipend? The usual approach for grad students is, in my experience, to send an email out to your department listserv (or have your advisor or the department head or w/e send one out) asking if anyone needs a roommate (and introducing yourself etc.). Another alternative would be to post on your university's grad student/dept facebook group (or look for similar posts there). You have a bit more assurance that you won't be living with any super awful people, insofar as grad school admissions serve to filter them out.

    If you really want your own place w/ no flatmates, you could also look into seeing how much you can afford to skimp out on going into campus, e.g. one of my labmates (in a computational evolutionary anthropology/biology lab) lives 1.5h away and only comes in ~2 days a week. Though it sounds like you don't mind somewhat cramped conditions!

    As for more generic advice, you can check out [threads like these](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/search?q=what+do+you+wish&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) on r/gradschool. For myself, I wish I had started learning C++ sooner, as well as read a few books and watched a few MOOCs earlier than I actually had. Dunno how applicable that would be to your program/projects!
    ```

    - u/callmebrotherg:
      ```
      > how much are you getting as a stipend? 

      Nada, unless I'm very mistaken about something and have missed an email somewhere. Student loans and work-study all the way. 

      > As for more generic advice, you can check out threads like these on r/gradschool.

      Thanks. 

      > If you really want your own place w/ no flatmates, you could also look into seeing how much you can afford to skimp out on going into campus,

      Huh. Do you know how I could find that out without asking? "I'm wondering how often I'm going to actually need to come to campus" would probably give the wrong impression.
      ```

        > Huh. Do you know how I could find that out without asking? "I'm wondering how often I'm going to actually need to come to campus" would probably give the wrong impression.

        Hmm, part of it depends on the specifics of your project (e.g. if it has a significant lab component), how much coursework you're taking, the nature of your work-study, if you're explicitly assigned an office/desk in your advisors office, etc. But one way to figure it out beyond that would be to ask your advisor how often you should anticipate meeting with them, and if they'd prefer you work at your desk in eye's view over the library or something. If they're ok with you working at the library, you can just stay home lol. ;] You could also (correctly)  frame it as a financial thing and not a laziness thing by asking what they recommend for housing, and if they think it would be better for you to live somewhere closer or save on costs by living farther away and commuting not as often, if you want to be more explicit.

  Whoops, nearly missed this week’s update.  Totally forgot it was Friday.


  This is probably going to be a short, boring update--the first of several, I think, as I work on getting the skeleton of the framework together.  There’s not much to comment on when it’s a matter of “so yeah, I implemented requirements 1 through 6,” but I’ll try and find interesting things to highlight and elucidate.


  I have created the three repositories that I think need to exist, one each for XGEF, XGEF Mods, and Renegade itself.  I made them in Bitbucket, my hosting site of choice, but I’ve discovered that this basically restricts the number of people that have access to the private repositories to 5, including myself.  I actually have other projects with a close friend, so the real limit is three others besides myself. I don’t *think* this will be a problem for the foreseeable future, but in the event that it becomes an issue I’ll migrate over to GitLab, I think.


  ----


  First point of order is to create the System and Entity objects as they’ve been designed, and then implement the portion of XGEF that allows Systems to look for their associated Entity files. I am unsure of whether or not this file-crawling bit should be a moddable System itself or not, but I’m leaning towards making it its own thing.

  Actually, now that I think about it, if I made it moddable, it would have to as a matter of course permit access to the file system for any arbitrary mod that extended it.  One of the limitations I want to include is what Space Engineers has done for their in-game scripting, namely having a whitelist of APIs that the code is permitted to access.  This won’t stop a super dedicated hacker, but at least it will stop idiots from making a `rm -rf /` mod for funsies.

  So I guess it *won’t* be a System.  Guess that answers that.


  ----


  Speaking of Systems, I’m trying to come up with a better name for them.  Systems are essentially a single mechanic or aspect of the game, which will have associated configurations (Entities).  This can range in complexity, from a Stat system defining how the concept of stats works, to a Creature system defining what units are, to the WorldGeneration system that defines how worlds are created.


  ‘System’ is a base library within C# and I don’t like how potentially confusing that is.  Module is out, as that is too easily confused with Mod (I’m thinking I’ll just call them Mods, and have it stand for both Module *and* Modification). 

  Entity is taken.  Component will likely be used elsewhere (the Entity-Component system is a well-known structure, and we will be using it).  Procedure, Struct(ure), Process, and Schem(a) all have computer science meanings that get in the way.


  Anyhoo, if you have any suggestions, I’d love to hear them.


  ----


  This next week will be the week off in my 3 weeks on, 1 week off schedule that I now follow, so don’t be surprised with radio silence next week.  I’m going to try spending some of it coming up with a simple exercise regime that I’m capable of following, as well as probably taking a look at fleshing out a Discord bot.

    For a new name for "System", maybe Framework? My usual process in the case of name conflicts is just to prepend the shortform name for the project, but I know people sometimes dislike that approach.
    ```

    - u/ketura:
      ```
      Yeah, I'm thinking maybe just call it XGEFSystem or CoreSystem or something. Framework is used within XGEF (eXtensible Game Engine Framework), so I don't think it fits there.

  I was attacked tonight by a few assholes on the way home. Only a few punches, and they didn't steal anything, and I don't think I'll have bruises... but fuck, it could have been worse.

  EDIT: Thanks for the kind words, guys. I got a night of rest and I feel okay now. No, I don't think having a weapon would have helped me. There were quite a few of them (six or more? Idk), so what I did was get away from them before they escalated further. Starting any kind of violence would have ended with me in the hospital. I mean, it was kind of dumb of to approach 6+ guys drinking beer at night alone, but I was tipsy too at that point. Lesson learned, I guess.

    First off, really sorry to hear this happened to you.

    Second off, I recommend taking up some sort of martial art. It does wonders to help you feel safe, even after a short time. Not just being able to handle yourself in a fight -- it helps you learn to be on the lookout and avoid fights like this, accept when situations like this are unavoidable, and regain your sense of safety.

    Personally, I've been involved with Tae Kwon Do and could not recommend it enough. That said, I've heard any similar practice gives similar benefits -- find somewhere convenient, try it out, see if you like it.
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      Yeah, I'm thinking along those lines. I don't really have time to start learning a martial art, but this is motivation for me to train harder at parkour and general fitness.

  Fun idea for a private [conversation venue](http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/62lpoc/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dfnkwc5):  
  \- Set up a private Git repository  
  \- Add a single HTML file to it  
  \- Allow chosen conversation partner(s) to access the repository  
  \- Enforce proper format (`<blockquote id="1234">`) and quoting (`<a href="1234">`) by refusing pull requests that don't conform

  It essentially would be a 4chan thread with no images and no comment limit. Obviously, much the same effect could be accomplished by exchanging an HTML file through email--but that would allow an unscrupulous participant to edit long-past exchanges silently, without anyone else's noticing.
  ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    One more advantage - over and above the emailed HTML file - is that conversation between more than two people can be more easily sustained.

    Though... for a simple two-person conversation, use of tools such as 'diff' can allow automated catching of edits in long-past exchanges.

  So once a month or so I like to look at reddit’s WritingPrompts subforum, reading whatever top entries [have accumulated since my last visit](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/top/?sort=top&t=month). I decided to try my hand at [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/60w89c/wp_at_age_15_you_told_the_gf_you_were_in_love/) this time around [~650 words], but since I submitted it so late, I doubt anyone will actually ever read it ([maybe](https://nikvetr.wordpress.com/2017/04/06/writing-prompts-story-1/) future digital archaeologists?). So I’m reproducing it here in case some here might find it mildly amusing! Enjoy!

  **[WP] At age 15 you told the gf you were “in love” with that you’d always be there when she was in need. Aphrodite heard you and made it a reality, whenever your gf was in need you appear at her side. Problem is, you and the girl broke up after 3 weeks but you still appear even now… 10 years later.**

  Adam sat in the center of a large warehouse. Towering over him were plastic crates, metal cylinders, and sundry other boxes, cases, and containers, all tightly secured. Glancing down at his watch, he noted the time – just before 9 – and began to stow away a half-eaten apple, guzzling the last of his coffee. Various supervisors over the years never failed to impress upon him of the importance of punctuality. Such busybodies, the lot of them, but they had a point, and at least the pay was excellent.

  Breaking away from thoughts of his compensation, Adam’s brow furrowed as he looked around, picturing the contents of all the packages surrounding him. Given the nature of his job, it was never clear how long it would be before he returned home, but he’d often prided himself on always finishing whatever work was needed of him.

  Suddenly, a pop! as air rushed in to fill the vacuum hole left in the warehouse. Before he could so much as blink, Adam found himself in an entirely different room. Standing beside him was his once high-school girlfriend, her frown rapidly curving into a toothy smile. “Adam!” she said, “I was wondering when you’d show!” “So impatient,” he replied, reaching out to steady himself. Spying a large window (or was it a screen? He could never easily tell these days) in one of the room’s corners, he saw a smooth, snowy landscape stretched out before him, punctuated by the occasional icy spire. A very faint breeze could be observed scattering flakes bit by bit.

  “Hey, Lynne, how’s it going? Where are we now?” he asked, looking back and returning a smile. She’d been traveling recently and, apparently, without event, for it had been weeks since he’d last been summoned; otherwise, several years of following his ex- as she went god-knows-where had sapped him of any pressing desire to keep close track of her *exact* whereabouts and occupation. “I’m good, crew’s good. SO unhelpful, as you might expect. Currently we’re just outside Cilix, near the penitent fields.” At least the snow and ice represented a change of scenery from that hot, roiling hellscape of last year, and those red, barren deserts the year before that. He was certainly glad to be out of that hyperindustrious town of Musk, hopefully for good. They were all just a bit too tireless there…

  A wave brought him out of his memories – summonings frequently brought them on. Right, Lynne needed help, that’s why he was here. “What is it this time?” he asked. “Plumbing!” she answered, walking along cases and reading the label on each. “Aha!” she said, finding one that contained large, interlocking plastic plates and tubing. “Gotta get the septic tank set up and interfaced with the garden. Bit boring, I know. But no less important for it” she said, “I should be able to handle the rest!” “That’s what you always say,” Adam responded, smirking, and they got to work.

  …

  A dozen hours later, he began to feel a familiar tug stirring inside him indicating that his present task was complete, Lynne’s needs satisfied. Sighing deeply, he stood up from his computer, removing his headset and shaking out his hands. Though it took a bit longer than anticipated, working together they’d indeed managed to get the sewage systems fully up and functional. And even with delays, he should still be back shortly after 10, with just enough time to grab a bite before crashing. It had been a long, long day and Lynne, though determined, also looked ready for sleep.

  “I think I’m almost done here,” he announced, Lynne looking up. “Aww, just as we were having so much fun,” she replied wearily. “Well, thanks for all the help! It’s been a pleasure, as usual. Reckon I’ll be seeing you in three or four days? I’m going to need to dig a very deep hole.” “Ha, sounds good, guess I’ll see you th-” he said, vanishing.

            >municipal People's Protection Units

            You'd trust a bunch of volunteers with no chain of command with that kind of authority? What you're describing is a gang. And yes, the police are a gang too, but they're a relatively predictable one. A new organization like that, made up of volunteers, has a lot of potential to be a lot worse. Of course if I'm being uncharitable maybe you think it will only be a lot worse for the right people....

            When I see people advocating that *their* ingroup should replace the police, with very little oversight, I ~~reach for my~~ get a bit antsy.

            >take over the workplaces

            Workplaces are useless without a supply chain, and most of the "workplaces" that would be taken over would be near the end of the supply chain. Of course take over the right logistics companies...

            But still, what you're describing isn't easy, and isn't really something the wisdom the the crowds can organize, I don't think.

            >and the military

            How?

            >Begin supplying food

            Well local farmers already can't meet demand for their region. So we're back to logistics companies to accomplish that. We need to be able to ship food around to accomplish this goal. A few minor changes can do better then what we are doing (in canada) now, but none of them are complication free.

            >housing

            Admittedly a lot easier without a lot of things like occupancy laws.

            >health-care

            That is actually a lot easier. And we already do it in canada.

            ---

            The thing I think you might not be getting about this problem is that supply chains are *hard*. You want to supply housing for people, but think about all the stuff we need to build new houses. Gypsum, electrical cables, electrical outlets, light bulbs, pipe, circuit breakers, insulation, paint, hinges, windows, flooring, etc.

            Then realize that each of those components needs yet more components, and a certain amount of labour.

            Making sure that every component-factory gets the right amount of components with the minimal amount of wasted effort is a *hard* problem. It's a giant directed graph, with each node doing computation about what it needs.

            Any company we take over isn't going to be functional unless we take over all the component-factories it depends on, we provide an alternative component factory, or we provide some way of interfacing with heretical component-factories.

            So if you want to take over the means of production, which I think it the main goal, start working on economics 2.0. Some way to manage that giant directed graph. A workable centralized/cooperative planning apparatus that can interface with external market systems.
            ```

            - u/None:
              ```
              > You'd trust a bunch of volunteers with no chain of command with that kind of authority?

              No, of course not!  The whole point is that they *have* a chain of command, and are accountable to popular assemblies where any citizen can object to what they do.

              >But still, what you're describing isn't easy, and isn't really something the wisdom the the crowds can organize, I don't think.

              What I'm describing requires nothing more than a change in corporations law and corporate administration.  People *know* how their own workplaces run, simply because doing *your own job* everyday requires intimate knowledge of your own job and the institution around you.  All that worker self-management entails is letting that information flow *bottom-up* from the people who actually have it, to the people who need it (administrators).  It just entails turning leaders into representatives, exactly as we've chosen to do in almost every other context of democratic societies.

              >How?

              With the exact soldiers who carry out all the orders already.

              >Well local farmers already can't meet demand for their region. So we're back to logistics companies to accomplish that. We need to be able to ship food around to accomplish this goal. A few minor changes can do better then what we are doing (in canada) now, but none of them are complication free.

              So you work *with* the workers in agriculture and logistics, who now have fuller control over their own work lives, and care about the actual goal of supplying food to people.  They didn't start hating you because you gave them more freedom!  Quite the contrary, working people given freedom and self-control at work tend to devote themselves *more* to the terminal goal of their job.

              >Admittedly a lot easier without a lot of things like occupancy laws.

              And with land-value taxes, a robust social-housing system, cooperatively owned apartment buildings, etc.  All non-innovative institutions that have already been tried and succeeded -- to the point that they often had to be *forcibly* dismantled by their ideological opponents, to the active objections of their users.

              >Making sure that every component-factory gets the right amount of components with the minimal amount of wasted effort is a hard problem. It's a giant directed graph, with each node doing computation about what it needs.

              Well yes, and I'm proposing to make it *easier* by giving far more control to the people who actually carry out the work every day, and thus know what needs doing.

              >Any company we take over isn't going to be functional unless we take over all the component-factories it depends on, we provide an alternative component factory, or we provide some way of interfacing with heretical component-factories.

              All three of these are good options.  We should use all of them as-needed.

              >A workable centralized/cooperative planning apparatus that can interface with external market systems.

              So there's a few things to say here:

              * Centralized planning is subject to information-transmission problems.  At best, each level in a hierarchy can accurately capture the correlations between the components below it.  This actually means that the top of the hierarchy is missing *most* of the information about the joint distribution, even though it also has *much* of the information necessary to reproduce any one component.

              * "Market systems" *require* an equitable distribution of income and a high velocity of money in order to function as efficient information-transmission mechanisms instead of rent-extraction devices.

              * And really, markets are not useful because they actually achieve efficient price equilibria.  We all know they can only do that under idealized circumstances.  [They're useful because they allow experimentation](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2012/12/the-red-and-the-black/), and it's *experimentation* that actually creates growth.  This should make sense from philosophy-of-science, and from the success of the scientific method more broadly.

              * Really we're talking about [collective](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01987) [active inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.04187), and we should really just cast things in the correct cognitive terms to find out *how good* any given "economic" method (two levels of abstraction up) is at solving the underlying basic problem of coherent, well-coordinated, goal-directed collective action.  Seen from this perspective, the successes of markets and the failures of planning make sense: a frozen algorithm that doesn't take new inputs at runtime can't do inference, but there are many online Monte Carlo algorithms can approximate inference fairly well.  An interesting question would be: what's an online variational algorithm for economic needs?

              * Cooperative planning is already something that firms engage in on an everyday basis.  The real question is theory of firms: where does it work better to plan out the actions of many people as part of a single organization, and where does it work better to partition people into different organizations?

                You see, that's a lot more reasonable a set of points than the whole "row row fight the powah marx did nothing wrong" shtick. I think that the aesthetics of revolution are getting in the way of your ability to effectively communicate, coordinate, and get things done.

                It's also seems like a lot more approachable of a set of problems. Instead of trying to coordinate a bunch of people into open rebellion. You create a "local currency" running on whatever algorithm makes sense for "coherent, well-coordinated, goal-directed collective action". Get some firms/people/whatever to adopt said local-currency, and watch as they out-compete other firms by their nature of being better co-ordinated.

                I am a decently competent web-dev, and I will donate at least 20 hours of my time towards implementing a web-interface for such a system. My time will go a lot further if you implement the code in python, since I can wrap it directly in my web framework of choice (django for static stuff, aiohttp if we need push alerts and websockets). I know at least one other developer who would be interested in working on such a project if it's at all sane beyond that 20 hour mark.

                >What I'm describing requires nothing more than a change in corporations law and corporate administration.

                Well then produce educational tools on how corporate administration *should* work. And corporate law is pretty flexible. If you expect firms running like this to out-compete other firms, then you should just be able to draw up a cooperative company charter, start some companies (a bit more complicated), use the profit from those companies to create a cooperative venture-capital firm, and so on.

                  Ok, I feel like *now* we've got an actual point of departure, and an interesting difference in felt ideological hegemony.

                  I've lived in two countries.  I could bring this list of proposed changes to society to the Powers That Be, and depending on the place, I'd get the following responses:

                  * "Everything good about that we already do, and the rest is a bad idea.  We know, because we had socialism once.  It sucked.  We're so glad capitalism gave us growth.  We also really miss our kibbutzim.  Collective life was great.  Whatever happened to that?"

                  * "That's commie talk and the cops should put you rioting anarchists away.  Now get the corrupt big government's hands off my Medicare!" (Less serious)

                  * "That all sounds very nice, but it's just not possible.  The politics, the cost, you can't do major reforms in a complex society!  However, I do believe that we *could* help people by creating jobs, through cuts to the minimum wage, subsidized job-training loans, and a carefully calibrated subsidized health-care program." (Very Serious Person)

                  The pattern is, of course, that people rationalize away their support for actually-existing socialist and social-democratic policies *that benefit them*, while rationalizing *in* their otherwise broad support for forms of capitalism that actually *harm* them.  As a result, everyone sounds incoherent: nobody believes they're on a happy medium, everyone claims to want to move Right for some reason, but they can't find many specific changes they want to make *which actually work in practice*.

                  The exception is breaking up monopolies, a free-market position that does actually work, because it involves increasing experimentation and decreasing rent-extraction.  Hurray for good principles actually working!  Mind, unfortunately, most "free-market" parties just don't do much antitrust enforcement these days, and even support business consolidation.

                  You seem to say this is a "reasonable set of points", indicating that it would be worth taking up in public and thinking about.  Great.  Unfortunately, I couch things in terms of revolution because, AFAIK, in the society I live in, you *really do* need to fight an actual, militant revolution to get this kind of reform through.

                  Yes, even though the New Democratic Party could maybe move left a little bit, put this stuff in its platform, and still get a decent vote-share up in Canada.

                    You can run a corporation however you want, pretty much. You don't need to smash heads to start a cooperative, to manage companies however you want.

                    There are a bunch of places that use local currencies. You don't need to smash heads to start a local currency, you just need a system that offers tangible benefits to its users.

                    And frankly, people preaching about how we're not doing enough to fight the power, while participating in the university system, one of the oldest institutions for enforcing socioeconomic status, while also not visibly doing anything to actually solve any of these problems? That pisses me off. And as far as I can tell is describes of the people who advocate for violent revolution.

                    I think that the socialist ideology would get a lot further along if it actually *solved problems*. And don't tell me that the only problems that can be solved with socialism are big scale and require everyone to cooperate. Visibly and consistently solve smaller scale problems with socialism and I'll buy into it.

                    You're a software dev for fucks sake. You have one of the best toolsets for letting people solve small scale problems with socialism, for providing that kind of social proof.

                    Hell, 90% of the software I interact with is more or less socialist. That's more or less how community developed FOSS works.

                    So fucking build things that solve problems instead of telling us how we need to do more. How we need to kill our neighbors because they're not doing enough.

                    Right now you're engaging in tribalism and being useless instead of fixing things, as near as I can tell. Whining about how other people don't support socialist policies while not seeming to do anything that makes those policies more viable. But I don't think it's about solving the problems for you, I think it's about fighting the enemy, and getting them to accept that you're right.

                    Well screw the enemy. These kinds of policies work, and they will eventually out-compete the enemy, as long as we actually support them. Visibly and consistently solve smaller scale problems using socialism and we'll have a lot more support for it. But this kind of violent revolution talk actively hurts that cause.

                      Actually, you *do* need laws allowing you to charter your cooperative in a location with reasonable tax laws.  And, hopefully this surprises you, getting those laws passes has *actually been hard* in a lot of places.

                      Yes, there have actually been legislatures who have said, "We won't pass a law letting you organize worker-owned cooperatives.  We don't see the point.  Just start a *normal* company!"

                      >And frankly, people preaching about how we're not doing enough to fight the power, while participating in the university system, one of the oldest institutions for enforcing socioeconomic status, while also not visibly doing anything to actually solve any of these problems?

                      Uh, you got any people around here you're directing that at?  I'm currently just some guy.

                      >I think that the socialist ideology would get a lot further along if it actually solved problems. And don't tell me that the only problems that can be solved with socialism are big scale and require everyone to cooperate. Visibly and consistently solve smaller scale problems with socialism and I'll buy into it.

                      It *does* solve problems, and I see no need to use that excuse.  My argument for socialism is less along the lines of "I promise this will work if everyone cooperates" and more along the lines of, "This will work if they get their damned boots off our throats and stop trying to *force* us into irrational systems that waste our efforts and make us unhappy."

                      I'm not an "end of history" Hegelian communist.  I expect that a socialist society can, will, and should have its own internal conflicts and differences.  There will be no single glorious utopia.  There will be a somewhat more *efficient* expression of the needs and desires of the mere mortals who already make up the world.

                      It'll be like shoveling snow with your neighbors: you might have some arguments as to who shovels what, and you're still ultimately doing a bunch of hard work in awful weather, but by cooperating about it you get everyone inside to their hot tea a lot faster.

                      >So fucking build things that solve problems instead of telling us how we need to do more. How we need to kill our neighbors because they're not doing enough.

                      I don't advocate for killing your neighbors.  I advocate for militant nonviolence until the point where the existing state initiates violence, at which point we defend ourselves and our neighbors.

                      Like, let's go back to the Syrian war, since that's what started all this.  *Wars* are not some *natural* state of affairs in Syria.  The Syrian Civil War *started* in 2011.  US airstrikes *started* some time after that.  Current Western strikes *started* just a couple of nights ago.  There's no need to kill my neighbors for "not doing enough" about the Syrian war, because my neighbors didn't drop any bombs, the Air Force did.

                      >Right now you're engaging in tribalism and being useless instead of fixing things, as near as I can tell.

                      Dude, I've been to... I think three IRL demonstrations in the past week.  I would have gone to another one about the war last night, but I honestly thought I was gonna heave a brick and ruin things for my stupid hippie comrades who don't want to get arrested, so I went to my in-laws' house instead.

                      I've spent whole bunches of time writing letters, knocking on doors, dialing people's phones.  I'm a delegate to a platform convention scheduled for a couple months from now.  I send a monthly donation to the organization I belong to, and attend regular meetings, where local leaders coordinate our activism together.

                      I get that some people play Internet Activist and don't do IRL stuff.  I am not that person.

                      I also object to the charge of tribalism since I actually feel a lot more sympathy for the ["dirtbag left"](https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/12/we-need-the-ironic-leftaka-the-dirtbag-leftnow-mor.html) than I do for the suited-up professional-class liberals who characterize Scott's "Blue Tribe".

                      >But I don't think it's about solving the problems for you, I think it's about fighting the enemy, and getting them to accept that you're right.

                      It's very much about solving the problems.  Look, if I had a minimum viable product around which to start a company, I would be founding a cooperative.  It's one of those things I've always wanted to do.  I also just don't have a minimum viable product, and I'm not sure how much effort is currently required to produce one for the kind of thing I want to make.  It's seemingly a bit more than would actually constitute anything *minimum*, but hopefully I've *almost* got a new job nailed-down, so I might have time to think about that sort of thing and more experience with the relevant techniques soon.

                      (I've also been spending a lot of effort job-hunting and working on *another* problem, which culminated in a nice little presentation I gave.  Unfortunately, the presentation was dumping too much information on people at once, and left them more confused-but-interested than anything else.  I might have to try a grant proposal.)

Write in all caps all you want, but the world still turns and our actions still have consequences. We must press on. We must do so to the best of our abilities within the bounds of our political system. This is as true today as it was a few days ago, or a few months ago. I can only hope our efforts are enough to secure peace and civil rights.
