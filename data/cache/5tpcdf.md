    The author is, anyway. I'm afraid poor Henry is very much dead.

      I was going to re-do the pasta for thematic appropriateness but I wasn't sure if I wanted to go that far into the kitsch.

      I will accept any downvotes people will bring on me. I wanted to grace this thread with emoji pasta as evidence of my enthusiasm. 

      I am the peacock who proves he is a worthy mate by having a ridiculous, impractical tail: my praise and enthusiasm is so complete that I will accept the most negative karma score in order to signal as such.

        ...I'll allow it *this time*.  Further pasta will be removed with prejudice.

          Thankyou for having mercy on me <3

    I want to downvote this because of the awful copypasta, but I'm so hyped about this fic being back that I can't even blame you.

  David, a great hero motivated by his devout love for his loyal pet snake, loyal pet hermit crab and loyal pet iguana (all sadly and tragically deceased) steps out into the world and onto the pages of history prepared to protect animalkind from the greatest threat they face: humans stealing their DNA to engage in shapeshifting.

  I do like seeing these motivating scenes for the minor bad guys, even if David was a gigantic douchebag in canon and may still be in this story.
  ```

  - u/Bowbreaker:
    ```
    As someone who has never read canon: Who is David and how does this chapter relate to his canon version?

    Edit: Going purely by the wiki David got thoroughly fucked for the crime of being a teen that lacks self awareness and humility.
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      Aaaaaand trying to blackmail and murder the main characters. Personally, I remember the David arc because it was the first Animorphs book I read, and it was one of the only arcs in the series that spanned multiple books.

      This chapter does not relate to canon, except for the mention that David has a pet who dies tragically.
      ```

      - u/Bowbreaker:
        ```
        But only after being isolated and essentially press ganged into their resistance movement. Not something that your average egotistical teen usually has to deal with. Of course I am going purely by the wiki summary here.
        ```

          While it's perfectly understandable that he should react negatively to the situation, he went to the extreme. Tried to sell out to the invaders, and when that was thwarted he tracked down each of the animorphs and tried to kill them. He killed (or dumped the already dead body of) Jake and Rachel's comatose cousin and took his place. Brushed off the apparent deaths of Tobias and Jake, because after all he hadn't killed a *human*, but a bird and a cat. Dude was twisted in the head and utterly selfish, and not even in a smart self-serving way.

            Naturally, he'll be receiving a rationalist upgrade just like everybody else.
            ```

            - u/CouteauBleu:
              ```
              "Thank you for the superpowers, guys, but I'm not interested in dying a martyr. Plus I'm sure the President knows what she's doing. So... I'm going to make my own thing and live a long, pleasant, hedonistic life with my new superpowers, *without* us threatening, blackmailing or trying to brutally murder each other. Bye!"

              ... right?
              ```

                You can always dream.

                I think the tagline of r!Animorphs was established as "... and then it got worse."

                  The last Racheal chapter seemed to be mostly positive.


                  ... Am I going to regret having said that?

    Should be fixed; thanks.

    No, just burning steel wool.  It looks super cool.

  ```
  Not sure if it was intentional, but this chapter felt much more flowery and stylistic than the rest of the story. A bit jarring, but I think it fit the character pretty well. Keep up the good work.
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    A lot of the interludes take a more flowery tone, I think.

  The murder of this random hermit crab fills me with more rage than almost anything else in the story.

    And now you understand David.
