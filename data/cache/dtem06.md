## After On - very smart and funny novel about Silicon Valley and the rise of AI. I think you guys will like it.

### Post:

I'm only a third of the way through the book, but so far its amazing. 

Very funny, very well written. It has startups, AI, neuroscience, and secret special agents in it. [Audiobook](https://www.audible.com/pd/After-On-Audiobook/B06ZZXC8VJ ) is voice acted incredibly well.

So far it's too early to tell how "rational" it is, but I bet people in this sub will enjoy it.

### Comments:

  ```
  I don't know about this book, but from the authors TED talk and the  trailer for his book "Year Zero" it seems he tries to hard to be funny.

    No clue about the trailer, but I actually really like year zero. It's both good and actually pretty funny.
