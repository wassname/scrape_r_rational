  I actually really lked it! The idea of memory-eroding magic is a very interesting to play around with, since it allows an interesting drawback -- and it also creates so many possibilities, since you can make aminesia stories very easily. I am intreaged about the significance of the star, though I'm not sure if 'star' is an acurate description since it is possible to take it. Color me intrigued, I'll be following the story closely.

    One, it's a fantasy setting. Normal physics getting smacked upside the head and told to go home is a regular occurrence.  


    Two - The perspective character from the first chapter is equally baffled about what the heck is going on. I suspect that the main reason it's referred to as a star is that it showed up at the same time a notable named star disappeared from the sky, and a magic spell to analyze light gave a result consistent with stellar emissions. Given those two facts I think it's perfectly logical to refer to the object (whatever it is) as a star until he has the time to gather more information and try to come up with a more accurate noun (assuming one is even needed).

  When I first saw the title, my mind leapt to the possibility of an Asterix and Obelisk fic and I got really excited. Alas!

  At first I thought this was an Asterix & Obelix fanfiction.

  I'm crushed it wasn't the case. =(

  Let me know what you think! And also typos.

  ```
  So do we think the mages shot the star down? Star seemed like it was surprised by some kind of outside force and they did get there awfully quickly.

  Also, the bootleg Snell's law and the other optics stuff is fun.

    That'd be my guess. One mage to find it, one mage to bind it.
