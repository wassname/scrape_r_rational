## [Challenge Companion] Reverse Portal Fantasy

### Post:

**This is the companion thread to the biweekly challenge, please post recommendations, ideas, or discussion below.**

Portal fantasies tend to be power fantasies; the hero is an everyman from our world who becomes someone special in the magical world. Sometimes being from the mundane world gives the hero special powers (typically in the form of engineering and science) but just as often, he has no special powers at all. They tend to hew closely to the monomyth, especially in their beginnings, because they're a very literal take on the monomythic "crossing over into another world". (Note that I'm painting hundreds of movies, books, and television shows with the same brush, so this is a very broad generalization.)

Reverse portal fantasies are much more rare. I wouldn't say that they're *exclusively* used as a critique of media, but that's what I think they're most associated with; *Fables*, *Enchanted*, *The Last Action Hero*, *Redshirts*, and [this Bouletcorp comic](http://english.bouletcorp.com/2014/09/05/kingdom-lost/) all spring to mind. If I had to guess, I would say that's because the reverse portal fantasy brings the fantastic into our world, which is what books (and movies) already do.

I have no strong recommendations this time, in part because it's a far less populated sub-genre than the portal fantasy.

  Charles Stross' The Nightmare Stacks came out last Tuesday, but is otherwise EXTREMELY qualified for this challenge. It is also REALLY, really good. Not really rationalist, which is why I made my thread praising it [over in /r/printsf/](https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/4qf4c9/charles_stross_nightmare_stacks_laundry_files_7/) rather than here, but if this trope interests you at all you should check it out (though the Laundry Files are best read with the context of having read earlier novels as well).

  Man, there are so many of these in MLP fanfiction it's ridiculous.

  Here's a few links from my favorites on fimfiction (that is, complete stories):

  [This isn't my house!](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/23693/this-isnt-my-house) - [Comedy]

  [Celestia Sleeps in](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/76290/celestia-sleeps-in) and it's incomplete sequel [Onto the Pony Planet](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/132779/onto-the-pony-planet)- [First contact - my favorite of my favorites]

  [The Roomate](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/23103/the-roommate) - [Rainbow Dash is an exchange student]

  [Pillow Case](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/112663/pillow-case) - [OC pony is an exchange student]

  [The Eagle has Landed](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/159150/the-eagle-has-landed) and [The Eagle is Sealed](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/164531/the-eagle-is-sealed) - [The apollo mission finds Princess Luna]

  [The Seventh](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/95264/the-seventh) - [Celestia on earth]

  There are also a truly massive number of "x pony appears in real life, person tries to hide them from the ebul gubmint stories" but I don't have any complete ones on my favorites list.

  MLP:FiM also has a pretty staggering amount of regular portal fantasies as well.

  [Emergence](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/emergence-rwby.308628/) is exactly a story about that.

  Cute girls(team RWBY) who are learning to kill monsters are dropped into our worlds with no way to get back home. Our beleaguered friendly and ordinary group of Earthlings decided to help them out, sometime risking serious life and limb and jailtime. It's an adventure story led by perfectly ordinary characters with mostly helpless main protagonists of a different series.(they can fight, but what can you really do when confronted with unfamiliar culture and language and people?)

  Then the government found out and gave them the opportunity to go to school, have an identity, and so on, and took it off from said ordinary Earthlings.

  Then it morphed into a slice of life school fanfic for a while.

  Finally, that phase ended with another set of team(JNPR) coming through, along with the villains(they had a confrontation), except the the boss got a screw loose here and there, and proceeded to eventually blow the masquerade wide open into a military thriller.

  Said military thriller then become a first contact fiction as well, as the big bad behind the villains are revealed, and they wanted to invade Earth.

  Overall, it's an enjoyable read with some uneven quality. But I recommend it for anyone who's interested in a thoughtful exploration of the concept.

  Oh, one other thing I wanted to mention.

  Portal fantasy is a convenient genre, because it's inherently a fish out of water scenario where the audience identifies with the fish and sees things through their eyes. The audience enters into the new world along with the protagonist, and learns things as the protagonist learns things. This is very helpful for the purposes of getting exposition out.

  In contrast, you don't get those benefits from a reverse portal fantasy. Any worldbuilding of the protagonist's homeworld has to be done in short order, usually within a chapter or two at the beginning, or a very brief scene in a movie. I think that might be one of the reasons that reverse portal fantasy is very often media-aware; it allows authors to quickly sketch out a homeworld that's intentionally generic or a riff on things that the audience is already aware of. That keeps the writer from having to frontload too much exposition.

  *Enchanted*, the movie. Disney princess from an animated world running on story tropes, her pursuing prince, and finally the sorceress/evil queen (tm) end up in our world. Pretty good for a Disney flic.
