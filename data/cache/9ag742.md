## How will the government plan when they know of a disaster firsthand?

### Post:

It is popular in fictions that when a disaster strikes (usually what can end the world like global disaster, zombie outbreak, alien invasion, AI berserk...), the government fail to do anything and the whole society collapses. However, I don't think the government is that useless. With their power, they can know some signs of a disaster happening beforehand and prepare some measures for it. What do you think the government have in hand when they know a disaster will strike? 

I also want to ask a topic related to it, if the government decides to evacuate the citizen, how will they do it? I'm reffering to specific things like how they will distribute the rations, how they get the supply, where the medicines are taken from.

  Unfortunately for storytelling, a rational response to a disaster often makes it... not a disaster. Take a zombie outbreak, for example. The rational response was best depicted in [this xkcd](https://xkcd.com/734/), which doesn't even get to the point of a government needing to do something.

  In any such disaster, there will be many more intervention points, at which the crisis could have been averted. In order for you to have a story in which a disaster threatens to end civilization, people need to have made bad decisions over and over and over again, until things have finally gone so wrong that the problem is big enough, or has been ignored for long enough, that it's too late to respond effectively. Basically, disaster stories always start with the government holding the idiot ball.

  Given all that, if you'd like to read stories about governmental responses to disasters, there are plenty of real-life examples. Of course, the most rational responses are the ones where there was no actual disaster, because of preparations made ahead of time. Unfortunately, it's a little harder to find information on that sort of scenario, because it's less newsworthy when nothing bad happens.

    The first thing I can think of is the opening of Evangelion (which is not, of course, a rational show by any measure, but anyways...). The military knows than an Angel is coming and are well prepared with armour, aircraft, and a nuke (? some kind of huge bomb at least). The reason these preparations don't trivialize the show is that they all turn out to be *insufficient*, as the Angel shakes off or regenerates from all the damage it takes from mundane weapons - to the surprise of the military.

    We can take some inspiration from this scene in designing a disaster which is known ahead of time and prepared for. I think you only need one element to make a rational large-scale response to a disaster still have tension and stakes: information! If the preparation is made with certain incorrect information in mind - details about the disaster which are reasonably thought to be accurate turn out to be inaccurate, or the scale of the disaster turns out to be more focused or more broad than was reasonably expected - then an interesting story can be built out of both the discovery that the prepared resources aren't appropriate to solve the problem, and the reaction of the first responders needing to find a way to use said resources creatively to either solve the problem anyways or, if you want to be darker, just *mitigate* the damage/loss of life.

    So basically, plans made on incorrect or insufficient information plus competent and interesting characters figuring out where their information is wrong and then using available resources to do the best they can once they have better information. Which is... one of the main ways to make *anything* go wrong in a rational story, isn't it?

          Anime used to have a bit of a nuclear taboo (Japan being unique in having citizens whose families died in a nuclear attack). 

          Evangelion's N^2 mines are one example. Others include Macross and its 'Reaction Weapons'; Gall Force and its SVE missiles and to a lesser extent Code Geass and its FLEIJA weapon. More recently, Zankyou no Terror (a show with terrorist protagonists threatening a nuclear attack on Tokyo) somehow managed to make it through the entire series without ever actually using the words 'nuke' or 'nuclear weapon', instead euphemistically referring only to 'stolen plutonium' and the like. 

          In Japan, only *villains* use nukes. (See: Legend of the Galactic Heroes and its Westerland Massacre, or M'Quve's threat in Mobile Suit Gundam)

          The latest generation of anime has more or less moved past it (see No Game No Life's shiritori game, for example), but its a noted writing quirk through to the early '10s.

    I think an interesting way to get around this story-telling roadblock, is to simply amp up the severity of the disaster, and, more importantly, make government agents the protagonists.

    A zombie outbreak story, only maybe the infection is already airborne and in the water and also has carriers in both animals, insects, and people; and the protagonists effectively are the government, so there  are actual stakes. If they fail, then civilization as we know it falls. 

    Essentially, make the story about the government response to the apocalypse, and write some nice Competence Porn. Like how everybody is really good at their jobs and smart in The Martian, and yet it's still a gripping story. Imagine a story like that, only instead of NASA trying to rescue a guy on Mars, its the CDC trying to hold back the zombie apocalypse. It could be awesome!

    I think how the plague gets out in Stephen King's The Stand was rather plausible, as far as I remember. There were proper procedures in place, but one guy gets tunnel vision when his family is at risk and forces the gates with his car. Not exactly rational behavior but definitely plausible human behavior. 

    I do not remember what happened after that, perhaps the reason he got far enough to infect more people was because a lot of bad decisions.

    I think you are giving governments way too much credit. 

    Take a look at the handling of hurricanes in south eastern US. 

    This is an annual event -- these things happen ALL THE TIME. Yet these areas keep getting hit and the response is often dramatically insufficient, resulting in thousands of deaths and billions in property damage.  

    in terms of an outbreak, governments might step in once things get *really bad* by closing airports or investing in vaccination research at the extreme, but mostly just put out advisory warnings and maybe do a bit of preventative sanitation or pest extermination controls. 

    I have a buddy who works in disaster simulation.  He builds computer models of what might happen if terrorists poisoned the water supply, or shut down electricity in a metro area, or released a biohazard.  It's not good.  The incompetence of government response is mostly offset by the disorganization and incompetence of malicious agents.  I mean, do you think the TSA is a rational and effective response to 9/11?

    When the malicious agent is Nature, the gloves come off, and humanity usually gets clobbered.

      I feel like that's less the fault of the government, and more the fault of the people who live in these regions for 1. living in these regions, and then 2. not voting in candidates who run on platforms about emergency-preparedness (i.e. increasing taxes to fund FEMA, the national guard, etc.) but rather voting in candidates who specifically *reduce* the budgets of those organizations.

      Also, things *have* to get "really bad" before the government will be *supported* in closing airports. People would riot if the government closed airports without a good (read: already far past good) reason.

      > do you think the TSA is a rational and effective response to 9/11?

      The TSA is good at catching spies. Terrorism is a cover-story. (If it was really about terrorism, the NEXUS program wouldn't exist.)

    > Basically, disaster stories always start with the government holding the idiot ball.

    I wonder if this could be not-true, given a sufficiently large idiot ball somewhere else.

    Like, say, if there was *first* an environmental equivalent of *The Purge*: a 24-hour period where a randomly-distributed 1/3rd of the population just went crazy, reverting to [enraged] animal behaviour, and then just stopping without any memory of what they did 24 hours later.

    ...and then a zombie-virus outbreak occurred in the middle of it.

    It'd take a fairly clever government to handle both.
    ```

  - u/MilesSand:
    ```
    So basically in order to have a disaster they need to handle it like climate change is being handled in the US
    ```

- u/boomfarmer:
  ```
  The US federal agency called the Center for Disease Control regularly uses zombie outbreak scenarios for medical emergency disaster response drills. You should be able to find at least media coverage woth a quick Internet search. Because these drills are multi-agency, if you want the real nitty-gritty details you should be able to get a lot of paperwork from FOIA requests and from agency-published afteraction reports.

  Beyond that specific example, you'd want to refer to published plans and historical records for hurricane, fire, earthquake, flood, and terrorism-driven evacuations of cities, suburbs, and rural areas. Particular places to start would include the graphic novel edition of the 9/11 Report, the one-year retrospectives of Hurricane Harvey, any historical study of Hurricane Katrina, of the Fukishima nuclear disaster, of the Haitian earthquake, of any Pacific tsunami in the last 20 years, of the refugee crisis in the Middle East and Europe, or of Puerto Rico after the 2017 hurricane season. That should cover a lot of the good and bad responses. Also read any of ProPublica's reporting on Red Cross failures.
  ```

  - u/vimefer:
    ```
    So Government response to disasters appears, historically, to be marred by efforts to make Government look not-bad, to the point where (Chernobyl, Fukushima) it hinders international coordination, and these efforts tend to engender conspirationism of all kinds. Efforts spent during or after the fact for evacuation, reestablishing control and rebuilding are diverted by widespread corruption fueled by the lessened scrutiny perceived by the actors (Katrina, Harvey, Haiti especially). This latter aspect would be the most narratively useful.
    ```

    - u/boomfarmer:
      ```
      > Efforts to make Government look not-bad,

      But what makes government look bad? Ineffective responses do. So they're incentivized to respond effectively.

      (The Red Cross's [issues](https://www.propublica.org/series/red-cross) are a long story that are unique to non-government responders.)

      Yes, corruption, confusion, and lack of established coordination are narratively useful for writing a disaster story. But don't forget the operators who have plans ahead of time, and are proceeding according to plan.
      ```

      - u/Solonarv:
        ```
        > effort to make government look not-bad

        Sometimes this is accomplished by covering up the incident (or diminishing its extent), because a govt that doesn't let disasters happen in the first place is viewed as more competent than one where they do happen.

        Nevermind that this impedes rescue and disaster relief, and when the truth inevitably gets out it's a much larger loss of face.
        ```

- u/Fresh_C:
  ```
  Ender's Game somewhat works with this premise. The first invasion that happened prior to the beginning of the story likely caught Earth off guard.

  But the government restructures society and put several programs in place in order to be prepared for a second invasion if it ever were to come. Though the story only really focuses on one aspect of their planning, so it might not be what you're looking for.

    That's true regarding how they precipitate the disaster, not how they respond to it. Or are you referring to something other than the obvious impending AI threat? (Because yes, obviously that's a case where they are making it worse, and response to a foom is largely an irrelevant question.)

        Third world countries also comes to mind - namely, AFAICT solving world poverty would boost the economy of first-world countries (as well as everyone else) in the long term, because having more R&D generally means more efficiency faster, and more economically-developed countries means more R&D. Plus, larger economies for first-world sorts of goods, which means better economies of scale which means cheaper.

        Point is, this is a sort of inverse-disaster (losing out on potential $$$), yet the governments don't do shit about it. Although there are almost certainly major principal-agent problems and whatnot, so they're not necessarily acting "irrationally".
        ```

        - u/lillarty:
          ```
          That comes down to loss aversion though, which is a different issue. 

          With classical disaster scenarios, people are taking (sometimes drastic) actions to prevent a large loss form occurring, but in the scenario you're talking about, it's essentially investing in a stock that there is significant reason to believe will rise in value. 

          Sure, both vaguely seek to have the situation in the future not get worse, but they're not really directly comparable.

  They'd take the threat, break it into facets, and then reach for the combination of relevant plans that match the pattern. 

  Take zombies.  That's a communicable disease, plus low level revolt, plus a long term insurgency that uses ambush tactics, but not guns. 

  We almost certainly have run war games like, "ebola outbreak, in Connecticut, and locals violently resist quarantine.". You'd dust those notes off and have one guy run that mission.  Some other guy would start prep on the plan for fighting door to door in France.

  Turn this into a crisis by having the government get blinded by their own pattern matching.  They have a plan.  It looks to be working.  So they stop thinking about how zombies aren't like riots until.... 

  Add to this by realizing that the government could use Sci Fi tropes as euphemism.

   Instead of doing a war game, "how do we invade France?" you could write "how do we liberate France from (rolls dice) mind controlling space bats.". The latter let's the planner sidestep a long intro about why the US is drawing up plans to attack an ally.  We're not shooting French soldiers! We're shooting cloned copies of French soldiers. 

  This means that, when the space bats land, some Lt will dutifully do a search, "find" the answer and stop looking

    >

    To be fair, the entire point of pattern-matching is that it's a shortcut, and the point of pre-made plans (presumably massively inaccurate on all sorts of assumptions) is to have somewhere to start.
    ```

    - u/best_cat:
      ```
      There are a couple kinds of pattern-match problems.  One is 'sincere' where the generals write guides on how to fight the last war.  This creates friction when the new war is different.

      A more comedic problem comes when plans use fantastic names in a very non-literal way.  The CDC 'Zombie Guide' wasn't really about Zombies.  They're just using 'zombies' to introduce the general idea of disaster preparedness. 
       Since the plan isn't actually intended to be about zombies (but about real-world threats) it omits stuff like 'motorcycle armor.'

      I can see this coming up if the US wants to write plans about invading an allied or politically sensitive country. 

      You don't want to write "what if [Ally]'s religious minority grows in population, gets radicalized, and starts a low-grade insurgent warfare targeting major infrastructure projects?" because that document would be subject to FOIA, and is just not-impossible-enough that people would take real-world offense.  At the same time, you want people thinking through real-world scenarios.

      So, you'd do a find/replace, and put a fantasy gloss on the whole thing.  Don't say "radicalized" we say "controlled by alien space bats."  You don't say "internment camp" you say "space-bat decontamination facility."  And then have a plan where people controlled by the alien-space-bats have exactly the combat capabilities, logistic and morale problems that would be faced by a partially-identifiable civilian insurgency in France.

      This lets your staff think through a 'realistic' scenario, but means that you don't get hauled in front on congress to explain why you're invading an ally.  And, the fantasy gloss -- insurgents have big space-bat hats, and not clothes identified with real-world culture -- means that whole operations would be less offensive to the participants.

      The funny part comes when literal Space Bats invade.  And then some Lt does the find, and gets reams of detailed counter-space-bat insurgency instructions, none of which are actually intended to be about Space Bats.

      Parts of it are definitely unrealistic, but in general the responses from humanity ran the full gamut I'd expect: Denial, profiteering, governments trying simple, proved solutions first, people just breaking under pressure, sociopaths put in positions of power as a desperate gambit, communities forming on a smaller scale...

      The battles and such wouldn't happen, of course, but the collapse of civilization would soon ground the military. What good is a tank without gas? Where do you get your gas when the wells, distilleries and raffineries are all abandoned? The national stockpile lasts for some 90 days, right?
      ```

      - u/EthanCC:
        ```
        It lasts for 90 days at the maximum withdrawal capacity, meaning if you're going through the stockpile as fast as you can. I don't know how fast you'd go through rationing, but the stockpile is Ω(90 days). I'm not too familiar with the specifics, if they're even declassified, but I do know that there are plans in place to rebuild from everything up to a nuclear war (under the optimistic assumption there are even any people left alive). It might require adopting 1911 era weapons and giving up on vehicles for a while, but it's possible. The general idea, as I understand it, isn't to treat it as a military operation in the usual sense but to prevent the breakdown of social order at all costs while trying to rebuild the supply chains necessary to keep people alive.



        From the perspective of what characters see, depending on how close you are to a military base I'd expect them to show up at most a few weeks after the event, institute martial law, and start handing out food rations.

  The place to start would be the [National Incident Management System](https://www.gocivilairpatrol.com/programs/emergency-services/operations-support/national-incident-management-system-nims).

  This is how the US government organizes teams for response to wildland fires, military action, and natural disasters.

  It's an excellent system. The basis is to get people who have an understanding of what resources are needed and how to get them on site as soon as possible and then get them ordering resources as smoothly as possible. It puts a lot of weight on logistics and operations in order to make sure everyone gets fed and has a place to sleep. On top of that things like daily briefings and after action reports keep things improving. 

  If there were any major crisis in the US, you can guarantee that is the system that ground teams would be working from.

  Look at how the government plans for current disasters. What is publicly available of the disaster response to a nuclear war is a good place to start. Also look into first hand accounts from areas that have been hit with large hurricanes, that's how they would deal with rations and so on. The short version is martial law->food and water->temporary shelter->rebuilding, all of this until the last one being handled by the military. I believe people are given ration cards and rations are airlifted in if the roads are inaccessible, but don't quote me on that.



  The plans for a nuclear war would probably be closer to what you're looking for, because they assume all other institutions have broken down. Hurricane and other real life examples of disaster response rely on having a large amount of industry and food to bring into the area, with the only limit being logistics.






  There are a lot of smart people who are very good with logistics who have planned for major disasters, you would need to somehow render the military ineffective for this sort of collapse to work. In other words, the most believable thing that could cause a major collapse like this is a massive war, nothing else can really cripple every disaster relief option simultaneously. If you have a rational alien invasion or berserk AI you're screwed anyway, there won't be people around to relieve for very long.

  This question is quite general. Governments have a wide variety of contingency plans, from battling epidemics to safeguarding VIPs to responding with military intervention to civil unrest or disasters. Not all of these plans have been, or can be, fully vetted. Most are not known to us. And, of course, disasters can happen that the government is utterly unprepared for.
