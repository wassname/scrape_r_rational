## a story, told in the style of forum posts, about the world dissappearing

### Post:

Title is pretty self explanatory. i think the story was posted here. as a challenge. it's definitely told forum-style, the world outside a college dorm(?) is turning to white nothingness, and time is weird now. It was quite good, and i'd like to find it again.

  That sounds a lot like [this story](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3bt5o2/weekly_challenge_buggy_matrix/csp9ujc/?context=3) I posted here in a challenge... well, except maybe the "good" part heh.

    Not really. Good story though, thanks.

    It wasn't posted here, it was linked. Told almost entirely through forum posts. The workd broke in some way, time is looping(?) or somehow broken. And there's a white void outside the msin character's dorm.
