  It will be really awkward if the Dead King goes "Why did you murder Malicia's delegation? Did you think I'd be okay with that?" and banishes them.

  Also, wow, Catherine. Killing enemies who surrender is not cool.

    enemies who surrender is not
    cool.

    To be fair that was Archer. The ones Cat killed didn't have time to properly surrender.
    ```

- u/Agnoman:
  ```
  I'm not entirely sure how Cat managed to casually  convince Malcia's minions to betray her, when Malicia has mind control powers she's happy to use to ensure loyalty with in her minions. Did Malicia forget to Speak to the people around her in this vitally important mission? Is this a bluff and there's another puppet, or even the *real* Dread Empress, still in Keter?
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Can someone explain how this worked? Masego has shown time and again that sorcery can beat aspects, and the dead king is as good as it gets with that; notably, he made this good enough to keep out *ranger*, but aomehow a shadow of akuas name, which wasnt even meant for fae, is enough?

  I also didnt think that was what call did, either; im pretty sure an akua chapter said what if did, and it was something to do with control?
  ```

  - u/Ibbot:
    ```
    Akuas name was for fae.  It was stated multiple times that it was for anything from outside of Creation, and that’s more than broad enough for creatures from Arcadia.
    ```

  - u/hoja_nasredin:
    ```
    I go with hpmor.com
    "a ultra specialized artifact beats a more powerful one but broader."
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I don’t know how an aspect designed to control devils is more specialized for summoning fae than a ward that closes off arcadia, though.
      ```

      - u/LordSwedish:
        ```
        An aspect of a Diabolist who has now essentially become a Fae spirit? It's a summoning tool but when it's made of Fae, suffused in Fae magic, and used by a Fae, it's gonna summon Fae
        ```

  - u/TideofKhatanga:
    ```
    Beyond being a stolen aspect, the whistle was an artefact. Those things are no joke.
    ```

  - u/taichi22:
    ```
    It is extremely likely that wards, like everything else in Creation, are based in application of narrative. They are boundaries, meant to enforce the will(s) of a caster or collective casting group.

    Because of this, I would theorize that far and other such beings are naturally more susceptible to such bounding, being creatures *created of narrative*. Similarly, humans, bring life created by the gods to escape the eternal question, are inherently less susceptible to warding schema.

    Now, Cat is something else entirely, a demigod, and the whistle she holds is narratively extremely powerful. On top of that, the Dead King is literally allowing her to do as she pleases. It is entirely possible that the passive actions of the story actually cause his warding scheme to be permeable to any summon that Cat makes, as it is done with his tacit permission. It is also possible, given Cat's travel through Arcadia to Keter, that he has never bothered to ward against fae. Or that he has simply removed fae wards in light of Catherine's presence. It could be any of those things and more besides. We can only speculate.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Cat couldnt enter keter through arcadia, explicitly; she had to stop outside, and enter normally. We also know that when she tried to enter arcadia from inside keter, she got the elf, so its not that he took down the ward either.
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I think that it has been proven that
    Miracles >>sorcery >> aspects

    I think the artifact level was either a mix of the former 2 or a man made miracle
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      That would make sense, if true. When did we learn that? I had been pretty sure it was just an aspect
      ```

  - u/MutantMannequin:
    ```
    Option 1: The wards didn't anticipate portals being created from inside Keter. When Cat made her portal in the Threefold Reflection, the exit emerged in Keter, which means you can enter Keter by Arcadia *sometimes.* It seems like an oversight on Neshamah's part, but he did have a named elf standing guard, and it's possible he assumed it wouldn't really matter how mobile a fae incursion was once it was already in his walls. It might have just been an engineering challenge that wasn't worth the effort at the time; we know he didn't anticipate Cat's apotheosis (at least, very far in advance).

    Option 2: The whistle is a summons, and not a normal one. It bypasses the need to actually *travel* through Arcadia at all. And consider: the Wild Hunt is formidable, but unlikely to topple a major city on its own, provided it's not caught by surprise. Perhaps the most dangerous things that can be summoned are angels and demons, and Neshamah subdued an entire Hell, and has since grown in strength, so I doubt he's worried about the latter. It could be that summons aren't a major concern to him.

    Option 3: It happened because Neshamah let it. It's mentioned several times that many of the oversights that permitted their plan to work have been incredibly improbable, and Cat has speculated that Neshamah was politely, indulgently looking the other way. He could have quietly permitted the summons.

    ```
    Sorcery can beat aspects doesn't imply that any particular sorcery beat any particular aspect.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  On the topic of Cat wanting Thief to start training to be better a fighter, I wonder if Thief could be a transitional role to Assassin.
  ```

- u/Solaire145:
  ```
  Anyone wanna bet The Dead King gives her the equivalent of a slow clap  and a pat on the back for the great show? Cause you know he saw the  whole thing.
  ```

- u/MutantMannequin:
  ```
  At this point, the excursion to Keter was worth it purely to stop Malicia's deal. Even if Cat doesn't cut a deal with Neshamah like she originally intended, she has successfully stopped a significant expansion of the Kingdom of the Dead without any real cost to the Woe other than time. Stopping this deal was a win for Callow.

  We also know, though, that the original deal she came to make is a bigger gamble than ever. If Cat ultimately decided to provide Neshamah his invitation, Malicia could very well report it to the Grand Alliance. Regardless of the potential military consequences of that, we have to remember that Cat's primary goal is the signing of the Liesse Accords, and she just won't have the political standing to push any kind of international agreement if she's seen cooperating with the Dead King.

  I think her best bet now would be to give up the negotiations in Keter, instead reporting to the Grand Alliance that, "Hey, I just prevented an alliance of Praes and the Dead Kingdom from sweeping down into Procer." Given Procer's long history as beings of pure bitch, they wouldn't credit her, but it definitely couldn't *hurt*. Callow would be proud of Cat, too, which helps with the whole civil unrest thing.

  Honestly, though? I expect the deal to go through, and I expect the Pilgrim to use as leverage in his quest to redeem Cat to death.
  ```

  - u/BaggyOz:
    ```
    She's only delayed a deal if she walks away with nothing. There's nothing to stop Malicia sending another delegation.
    ```

  - u/werafdsaew:
    ```
    The alliance isn't about to trust Malicia's words about anything.  Cat still needs the Dead King on the field to take pressure off her, so nothing has changed there.
    ```

- u/Zayits:
  ```
  Damn, I really wished Cat would have tried for another round of negotiations before going all out. Let's hope she'll at least try to make use of the Wild Hunt already being here.
  ```
