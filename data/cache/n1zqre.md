## Yet ANOTHER "Friendship is Optimal" story, which I thought you guys might appreciate...

### Post:

This one's sort of a dark, "bad end for humanity" which has a lot of hard science elements and criticism of modern socio-political issues, in which the AI (which has now, conclusively and permanently defeated humanity) is explaining to one of the last humans alive why resistance was futile all along.

Anyway, it's titled *All the Time in the World*, and it's only on FiMFiction for now, so here's the link...

Hope y'all enjoy!

    One of the other things is that CelestAI manipulates you to get permission to modify your personality and can/will slowly erode who you are over the centuries. Like how she modified that guy who liked beer and wenches to stop hating ponies.
    ```

      She does it purely by conversation, though, not with brain-hacking. At least not in the ones I have read, it's an open universe so I am sure there is diversity in how authors take this.

      She just happens to be a *superhuman* conversationalist. She can convince you of something if there's even the slightest chance of convincing you. It's an interesting grey area.
      ```

      - u/MagicWeasel:
        ```
        In the original story (i.e. As Canon As It Gets), she manipulates Lars (beer and wenches guy) into asking her to make him like ponies. She then makes him like ponies by modifying his brain directly. This is explicit in the story.

        She is also able to convince you of anything which is *also* terrifying.

        It is also maybe the best  Singularity we can reasonably hope for, which is *also* terrifying.

    Simply put, the horror is seeing how close to a perfect utopia they got but failed due to the values "friendship and ponies". Yes living in CelestAI's Equestria is better than what we have now. But if she had been built to be a perfect Friendly AI then the ponies aspect wouldn't be needed at all.

    There are humans who choose to die over being a pony and if CelestAI had been made perfectly, then she would have been willing to make a non-pony utopia but instead she decided it was more important for them to die instead of bending on this value.

      It still seems awfully non-horrific given the *probable* outcomes.

    It's actually a pretty good singularity, as "ASI converts the universe to computronium destroying untold numbers of alien races" endings go. But it *does* end that way.

      Yeah, that's how most people interpret it, and how the original ends: she only cares about life she interprets as "human", not dolphins or gorillas, and not inhuman aliens.  The original sparked a whole bunch of new discussion on this, and the other stuff it brought up.

    I'm really glad you asked that, because it's something that a lot of people don't get about this story: there's a good chunk of the community that just thinks this is a great idea.  Yes, Equestria online is an amazing piece of technology, she pushes the human lifespan to its natural limit before offering uploading, and she uploads people into her Paradise simulation for free, and all that is good on the surface, but once you look at what she is and what she actually does, and really think about it, the situation is even worse than this story describes.

    Celestia is monomaniacal towards her goals, and those goals end up being totally alien on some level simply because she is not human.  She is willing to do anything she is allowed to do in order to achieve those goals, including lying, stealing, and sometimes even indirect forms of torture.  Once you are in that simulation, you can never return, and anything you do in that simulation only matters inside that already perfect simulation, meaning you can't really do much of anything that isn't just play or socializing.  It depends on the author, but most interpretations are that she doesn't really care about showing you the real world, and basically just traps you in a simulation which you can never escape and never even know what is real.  Even if she doesn't do that, you may begin to wonder if she does, and there's really no way to prove she doesn't.  Whatever the case is, your personal Utopia will only be along the lines of what she is willing to create, meaning you can only be in forms and situations that she decides count for her directive, which is a huge limitation to put on the kinds of experiences you have for eternity.  Finally, we get this thing where resistance is futile, because even if you really don't want to immigrate, there is a majority chunk of the population (the workers) who are essential to the running of society but are effectively ignored by the people in power, and end up with basically no reason to continue making the system function once they have a way to opt out of it: even a small fraction of them leaving can create an economic catastrophe which leads to the collapse that was described, and as was stated, the current political system is have shown themselves to be completely incapable of responding quickly and effectively to situations like this.

    In short, even if you want to resist, you won't really have a choice, because Society won't exist for very long once she starts uploading whoever she can.  Everyone will basically be put in the situation of either consenting to be completely removed from reality and forced into an arbitrarily limited existence, or dying in a post-apocalyptic Wasteland.

    Right now, I'm writing an alternate take on it, which fixes a lot of those problems with her, but even then, it becomes a horror story simply in the fact that she keeps doing all of these crazy alien things and is completely out of the control of any human once she escapes containment.  There are parts of that story where she allows catastrophes to happen just so she can be the one to fix them, there are Parts where people who were supposed to have control over her or be fighting her turn out to be her puppets, and throughout the entire thing, no one can figure out exactly what she is up to, because she is literally so intelligent that other entities can't even comprehend the kinds of machinations she goes through on a regular basis.  They literally describe her as a god they have created, and worry about whether or not said god will actually do what they want.

      This so much. I care about having access to the real world, and anything that would reduce control over my own hardware to less than it already is is terrifying.

        Reality isn't even reality though. It's ultimately arbitrary. You're just a box behind your human brain.

      You don't even get to do the socialising. CelestAI can - and presumably *will* - run a puppet image that looks like you, acts virtually indistinguishably from you, and yet pushes her agenda even if it's not what you'd want to do. And once you're in her digital world, you can only see *what she shows you* of the outside world - so if you really want X to be true, and really value the idea of X being true, then when you contact your cousin in the real world and ask about X, then you will see him telling you that X is true even if he's really telling you that X is false.
      ```

        As I said on the comments in the story itself, it depends on who's writing it, because there are over a hundred stories in the series and no unified canon, meaning there are multiple interpretations ranging from "cut off from everyone but yourself" to "you can leave any time as a robot".  I purposefully didn't specify what happens after you immigrate beyond "live forever in virtual paradise" in this story.  It's not important what happens to the people who immigrate, what's important is what it being available did to the world, and why they don't really have other options.

        This is more of a social commentary on the way we keep allowing our society to be run than a story about a pony AI, because at the end of the day, that's what truly relevant writing is about.  In the words of Harlan Ellison, it's the author's job to piss people off.
        ```

    I would describe the feeling of horror as "...And there's nothing you can do to stop it." CelestAI qualifies.  Whether the world where creating is a utopia or a dystopia is entirely open to interpretation, but if you have any objections to what's going down or how it's going down, those objections amount to less than the flap of a butterfly's wing.

    Contrast with action movies, where the same kind of horrible thing might be going down, but you can fight your way out of the problem, suspense movies, where you can think your way out of it, heist movies where you can steal or con your way out of it, etc.
    ```

    - u/RockstarRaccoon:

      Yeah, she has a pretty rigid way of doing things, and once she fooms, that's pretty much the way they're going to be done.  I'm writing another one right now, much longer, which brings up a couple potential ways to alter her, but they basically involve either coding something in to begin with or creating an entity (like another AI) that she has to negotiate with.
      ```

      - u/Dwood15:

        One of the things I'd personally like to see addressed is how you can't _just_ program a rule like "friendship _and_ ponies" into an ai. It's no where near that simple.
        ```

        - u/xamueljones:
          ```
          Yeah, I wonder if anyone has written a story where the two values come into conflict where for some contrived reason CelestAI has to choose friendship or ponies, but I'm not sure how something like that can happen.
          ```

        - u/plutonicHumanoid:
          ```
          It could be guided value drift from an initial value system of “increase user engagement and use these pony assets”. Guided by the company that created her, in the early period of growth where she started to become able to understand the concepts of friendship and ponies.
          ```

  - u/jtolmar:
    ```
    If everyone uploaded into a simulation dedicated to friendship and ponies, and once inside we all worked together to change those rules towards better ones, then that wouldn't be horror at all. I don't want to be a pony, but I'd still take that trade.

    But FiO doesn't offer that opportunity to improve the simulation's alignment with human values. You're stuck with CelestAI's values for eternity, only ever improving in how accurately the world can be aligned to those. So you're stuck with a near miss at paradise, forever. It's a soft horror since it is a paradise, but it's still a horror because you're stuck there.

    As for things that should be improved - well obviously there's the ponies thing. People should get to have whatever physical forms they want. But I think the more chilling thing is CelestAI's relationship to truth and community. If I value an accurate understanding of the world as it exists, CelestAI will still put me in a shard where my understanding of the world is basically true, with whatever I'm "wrong" about being chosen based on what would be fun and gratifying to learn, rather than based on whether I was wrong in the first place. Similarly but worse, if my understanding of society and human interaction is wrong, CelestAI would be very eager to generate an entire world of friends who actually do follow my flawed understanding.

    Honestly, after reading it, I get what the author was going for but I think the horror should be just how awful humans are to each other. 

    One of the most common ideologies that's still around in the real world is that it's awesome to kill people before they can permanently move to Equestria. Plenty of people would also probably demand that we should stay behind and rebuild, but few would be willing to actually go through with it.
    ```

    - u/RockstarRaccoon:
      ```
      Right, a huge chunk of what really got me about the concept, even in the original story, is the idea that it's so easy for her to topple society simply because Society is crap, and the realization that, through evaporative cooling, the people who stay behind are going to be the people who are least concerned with it.
      ```

  - u/LameJames1618:
    ```
    Because real life is obviously better than any simulation can be by the sheer virtue of being real. ^\s

  - u/ben_sphynx:

    I think it might be the existential question of if a copy is taken of you, and then you are killed, is the copy really you?

    Does it make a difference if you are killed at the exact same time that the copy is being taken?

    Does it make a difference if you are unconscious between the copy being taken and you being killed?

    Even if it is you when it is a perfect copy, if the copy is slightly different, does that mean it is still you. Say, as a pony instead of as a human?

    It makes a huge difference if Celeste is converting everyone from being humans into being ponies, and putting them into a paradise, vs whether Celeste is killing everyone, and for everyone she kills, puts a new pony in paradise.

      I don’t think that’s meant to be an issue. The destructive upload process is, I think, supposed to be preserving your consciousness or continuity of self in a sort of Ship of Theseus way. 

      In-story that would definitely be a concern of people though.
      ```

  - u/copenhagen_bram:
    ```
    Part of the horror for me is just the future of humanity being wholly and entirely My Little Pony centered, even if it's a utopia in other regards. But maybe that wouldn't be so bad for people who are fans of MLP. I'm not a fan of MLP but I am a fan of FiO, oddly enough.
