## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  If you didn't know, Young Justice Season 3 is out, and it is excellent. Highly, highly recommended to anyone who's seen and enjoyed the first two seasons. To people who haven't seen the first two seasons, they're aimed at a younger demographic(seasons 1-2 are more age 8-14 where season three is more 16+ imo), but as far as children's super hero cartoons go it's one of the better ones. 

  It handles super heroes quite rationally, they essentially operating as special ops agents who do occasionally have to kill and/or be killed. The traditional problem of "why is Batman remotely relevant when Superman's there?" is dealt with fairly nicely, and the villains are very competent without going into absurd "exactly as planned!" levels of over-prepared foresight. It's fairly progressive with female/minority representation without shoving it down your throat at all. It also has essentially zero filler whatsoever, which is nice since they fit in a lot in just 13 episodes.




  Also I recently saw Avengers Endgame, it's excellent. A bit fan servicey, but it was very satisfying fan service. If you've seen it, here are two interviews, one with the screen writers, one with the directors, that goes into a bit more detail about plot and lore details that couldn't fit into the movie that I enjoyed: [Screenwriters](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/29/movies/avengers-endgame-questions-and-answers.html) [Directors](https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers/comments/bj2c8s/end_game_qa_from_russo_brothers_in_china/)

  Looking for recommendations.. Who would you say are the best depicted lgbt characters that you have come across in your reading? They don't necessarily have to be the protagonist of the story. The dearth of realistic, multidimensional gay characters in my reads have left me sorely disappointed so far. 

  I really loved the webcomic, [Always Human](https://m.webtoons.com/en/romance/always-human/1-i-guess-thats-why-i-admire-her/viewer?title_no=557&episode_no=1). Non-dysfunctional relationships ftw!

    Webcomic wise, https://questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=1 -- a slice of life comic in a world with widespread modest-strength AI -- has been fairly consistently entertaining, and includes, over time, a wide variety of identities.
    As with most webcomics, quality of art Drastically improves over time.
    ```

  - u/MereInterest:
    ```
    I rather enjoy [All Night Laundry](http://www.all-night-laundry.com/) for its portrayal of LGBT characters.  What I like is that while the main protagonists are a lesbian and a trans woman, these are not their defining characteristics, nor is the story centered around their sexuality and identity.  The protagonists are trying to stop an eldritch thing from breaking into this world, and their recklessness/cautiousness are far more important to the plot.

    I quite liked this:  [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30279514-dreadnought](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30279514-dreadnought)

    The premise is that a teenage transgender girl happens to be present when a villain kills someone who is essentially Superman, and his powers transfer to her. This includes changing her body to what it's supposed to be like. The plot is a combination of dealing with this and of "oops, guess I'm a superhero now".

    I liked the second book a little less, but maybe only as much as expected when the novelty of a new series / setting / character has worn off. It was still enjoyable.
    ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    I really liked ~~Fitz~~ Fool* in the [Farseer trilogy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77197.Assassin_s_Apprentice)(though he's explored more as a character in the Tawny Man trilogy). It's unclear what his sex is(or if he even has one), and he seems to change genders several times. Or maybe he just lets people make whatever assumption they like, and just goes with it. 

    I like that it's not written as a major part of his character, but it's not ignored either.  It's a subtle character trait that is nonetheless crucial to understanding his character. Hobb's writing as a whole tends to be very understated, and hugely into drawing out pathos.

    edit: *mixed up fitz and fool

    I'm writing a Worm fanfic set in Seattle called [Donjon](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/donjon-worm-oc-seattle.734914/) that has a trans lesbian protagonist. It's an almost entirely OC cast, the main character triggers when her emotionally abusive roommates escalate to physical intimidation. The manifestation of her powers twists her entire apartment complex into a death labyrinth filled with traps, forcing her to scramble to contain the damage. I post updates every Friday.

  [Set in Stone](https://setinstonestory.wordpress.com/2015/10/08/backstory-revamped-into-prologue/) was immensely entertaining. Finished reading it about a week ago, I find myself time and time again impressed with its world building, plot development, characters, and prose. In that order. It's about a live of farmer under a tyranny of an insanity-proof AI. Some says the prologue is exposition too-heavy. But they're important exposition, written with enough poise I didn't feel the author shove unimportant facts down my throat. In fact, I like it. Greatly recommended.

  Oh boy, its monday again. 

  I am currently making my way though [The Gods are Bastards](https://tiraas.net/about/) and have been following [Mother of learning](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning) for a while. 
  I know i know, both aren't the most rational, but they come up here often enought to work as a reference for what I'd like to ask for. 

  Both somewhat feature the effect strong characters have on their worlds, like Tellwyrn or >!Zach and even Zorian in the later loops!<. 

  Are there any stories that feature how such characters handle their... aloofnes(?) over the common person? how they deal with their situations? 

  My thought train is: how do you even order a chicken sandwich when everyone knows your name? Especially when you are an immortal that has shaped history. How do you hide that you can >!trade blows with dragons!< when you are back in school? 
  Thinking about this, how do even real life celebraties deal with this? 

  Anyway, this is what im searching for. Hit me with cheesy secret identies, badass OP characters and what not - just try make it about them trying to have a life! 

  Thanks!

  Any fantasy stories (fanfiction included) in which Magic problems are translated into real-world math problems (whether that's recognized in-universe or not) and solved during the course of the story for a plausible execution of a 'prodigy main character does the impossible' plot point? 

  Basically talking about something like The Waves Arisen, wherein >!an infamous Elemental Manipulation problem is solved by Naruto with the clever use of topology!<. I'm adamant about it being a pure math thing exclusively, not physics or chemistry though. So, for instance, HPMOR's >!Partial Transfiguration!< doesn't count.

    >And whether, indeed, she's dead at all...

    Another one that has a math based magic system is [The Magicians](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6101718-the-magicians), but it's not something that's really explored.

    If you enjoy the Erogamer you might enjoy "The Sins of Cinnamon" (NSFW). It's an RPG world, and don't know how to hook you without possible spoilers but give it a few chapters. Heads up though I was personally disturbed by the first sex scene (masochism?) and a kind of incest one, but it's still a good read without the smut.

  I recently watched all of Lucifer, a crime drama based on the Neil Gaiman  graphic novel of the same name. Basic premise is Lucifer Morningstar, AKA the Devil, has gotten tired of playing along in God's game and is taking an indefinite vacation from Hell in LA. It's definitely not rational, but it hits a few of the same notes as UNSONG vis-a-vis religion jokes, so I thought I'd put my thoughts up here.

  I think my primary interest in it is in exactly how charmingly unlikeable Lucifer is as a character. He isn't evil, not by a longshot, but he's consistently an asshole to everyone around him, friend and foe alike. What makes this charming is that most of the dickishness comes from being understandably maladjusted after having been kicked out of heaven and sent to rule a plane of the maladjusted for several thousand years. He gets shallow relationships, meaningless sex, and basic human desires, but he's completely lost when it comes to understanding positive human interactions, with predictable results. It's an interesting take on an alien perspective, one which is clearly based upon humanity and yet inhuman all the same.

  If you enjoy mild mocking of Judeo-Christian mythology in your crime drama which plays itself for laughs and with seriousness, I'd check it out.

    First, for HxH stuff, only two things spring to mind, as I haven't read much of them. First is *Myrmidon*, which is a very very good crossover with Naruto, where an adult Hinata and her team have a very limited entry point into HxH setting, and go there during the Chimera Ant arc to get a sample of the Queen. It's been very very good so far, the settings are meshed wonderfully, and the fights have been stellar. Second is a nice little fluffy shipping oneshot called *[A 'Need to Know' Basis](https://archiveofourown.org/works/364757)*, that one just kinda makes me smile.

    As for timeloops, one thing that absolutely has to be mentioned is the anime *Tatami Galaxy*. In this one, the timeloop is gifted to the main character as a way for him to re-do his wasted college years and achieve the whirlwind of romance and fulfillment that he expected. He doesn't really have any memory of previous loops, at the beginning he chooses a different club to join and the two years proceed to play out. The cyclical nature of the show is executed very well, every character is shown from a variety of angles that reveal that they are more complex people than they appear, and it all leads up to an explosive finale. Not really a show where you wanna see the timeloop being exploited, here it is used to examine characters and explore its themes about life and grasping opportunities. It's one of the best shows I've ever seen.

  A quick review of some of the Royal Road stuff I've read. Some of which has been posted before. Most of this is not exactly great fiction, but can definitely be fun if it is the type of thing that appeals to you. I happen to quite enjoy litrpg, portal fiction, and similar premises, but recognize they can fall into guilty pleasure territory easily.

  [Deeper Darker](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23290/deeper-darker)
  >Set in the far future when humanity has reached the stars and finds it is not the first to do so. Alien technology has been left behind by a long dead race. Ancient cities, abandoned starships, temples and fortified bunkers all contain artefacts and devices far in advance of what humans have been able to produce. Technology that feels more akin to magic, so powerful it can allow a single person to dominate a star system. But these relics of another time have been left well-defended and behind bewildering and impenetrable security measures. 

  Fun. Competent grammar. A little slow to start with all the different perspectives. Pretty rational so far. Good world building, reasonably distinctive characters.

  [Eterna's Source](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/2635/eternas-source) 
  >Sery is a Source, born with immense magic but unable to use it. Enslaved for her power, her life is one of abuse and exploitation until one day, everything changes.

  Mainly fluff. It's fairly fun though. Not really rational, but world building doesn't have any obvious stupid gaps.

  [How to Kidnap your Princess](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23759/how-to-kidnap-your-princess)
  >The realm is in shock. The princess has been kidnapped. The beautiful, kind, and extremely talented magician princess is gone. Woe to the wretched villains that took her away, screaming into the night. Their weight in gold to the one that rescues her. Ministrels sing with tears how the people miss their princess. The hope of the kingdom is gone. But maybe, just maybe, that was not the entire truth. What exactly happened to the princess?

  Accidental bodyswap. Genderbend / dual mind taken fairly seriously. Summoned heroes are weapons of MAD, feared for their tendency to go murder hobo. Fairly loose rules, and situations are clearly set up just for humor / theme. Not really rational.

  [Skyclad](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21361/skyclad)
  >Morgan Mackenzie had a very bad day. First at work, then at home, and then her bathtub fell through a portal to another world, with her in it. Now she's stuck thousands of miles from any sort of civilization with nothing but the bathtub and a lace puffball scrubby. But she learned magic, so that's sorta nice. Now if only she could find some clothes... 

  Rather entertaining despite the silly premise. Follows the 'protagonist levels up in the wilderness' litrpg trope, but does it pretty well. Power levels are handed out easily, but there isn't a lack of risk so far. Decent world building, follows the rules, but they tend to be somewhat vague rules.

  [The Power of Formations](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21450/the-power-of-formations)
  > Emmet Laghaz loved puzzles.

  >All day, all night, puzzles. Ever since he was a child, Emmet could turn anything into a puzzle.

  Cultivation novel, but much more reasonable and sane than usual. MC is basically a magic engineer in a world focused on magic warriors. The rules about what formations are capable of are vague, but don't contradict themselves. Good stuff falls in protagonists lap pretty easily, and conflict is minimal so far. Still decently fun.

  [Song of the Void](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21979/song-of-the-void)
  > A great race faces extinction and tries to leave a legacy for the future. Young races building on the ruins of the old. What happens when one of the old ones wakes up and finds the universe changed? Will she try to find new meaning? Will she try to help the younger races or will she punish the grave-robbers for their sacrilege? Or will the eternal servant of her people try and finally find some happiness of her own?

  OP protagonist. So far its more about her effect on the world than her having actual risk or conflict. Pretty interesting world, with interesting (if a bit cliche) factions and conflicts the MC is disturbing.

  Been on a Gamer-inspired story binge recently. I know I should watch what I eat, but I'm really enjoying the experience. In general, I like the humorous aspects of it - the contrast between what a game actually does and reality - above the dramatic aspects, so it's not like I'm disappointed when the protagonist makes everything a non-threat. 

  What are the best stories in this genre?

    I don't know many text stories, but I could recommend a few webcomics.

    [Adventurers - life in a console RPG](http://www.giantrobot.club/adventurers) 

    Starts out as gag-a-day style. It develops a plot and the art gets a lot better than the fairly crude first few strips. Mostly comedy, very little drama. Complete.

    [Order of the Stick](http://www.giantitp.com/Comics.html) 

    It's a stick figure comic in a world that runs on D&D 3.5 edition rules. Has both comedy and drama.

    [Erfworld](https://erfworld.com/erf_stream/about_view) 

    Gamer gets transported to a world that runs on Turn-Based Strategy rules. Mostly dramatic, occasional comic relief.

      Seconding Order of the Stick, as something that starts out as a bunch of jokes about D&D and evolves to a genuinely amazing story. This stick figure comic has some of the most awe-inspiring moments I've seen in fiction, and it's a stick figure comic.

  Anyone else here reading *A Song for Two Voices* by Swimmer963 aka Miranda Dixon-Luinenberg? It's a rationalist/effective altruist take on Mercedes Lackey's *The Last Herald-Mage* trilogy, and I really like it.

  Anyone know any good fics about humanitarian aid efforts in a sci-fi setting?
  The only two I know of are [Going Native](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3396972/1/Going-Native) and [Children of Nemesis](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9679648/1/Children-of-Nemesis)(which barely even counts because the story dies before it really even starts).

    This is partly covered in Kim Stanley Robinson's *Blue Mars*.

  I just finished arc 5 of worm, and I very much did not enjoy the way it seems like it is going, so I stopped reading it. I only read worm because it was the only story in the /r/HPMOR similar stories list that had an audiobook that was up-to-date/complete, and I much prefer audiobook format to text format. Are there any other rational stories like HPMOR that have a complete or up-to-date audiobook? Other things I prefer are that the main characters be kids, and that at least one of them is a girl.

    A good story that fits all your criteria is [Red Sister](https://www.amazon.ca/Red-Sister-First-Book-Ancestor/dp/B071NY4GV5/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Red+Sister&qid=1557392062&s=books&sr=1-1) by Mark Lawrence. The story of a strange little girl in a dying world who joins a convent that teaches how to fight and use magic. I'm told the audiobook is also pretty good.

    Another favourite of mine that you might like is [The Diamond Age](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/827.The_Diamond_Age). In a future that has undergone a nanotechnology revolution, a poor girl inadvertently acquires a state of the art and ruinously expensive interactive book meant to teach a smart, curious young girl like herself everything she needs to be a great person.

    You're not going to find audiobooks of most online stories. Worm and HPMOR have huge cult followings, so they're the exception. I suggest finding a way to read text that suits you - I read a lot more than I used to thanks to my phone, for instance. Other people have sung praises for the e-ink kindle reader.

    Where did you think Worm was going from Arc 5, out of curiosity? Because, while the tone doesn't change much over the course of the story, the greater context of what's going on changes quite a bit.
