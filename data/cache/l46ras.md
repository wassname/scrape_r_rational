  Wildbow's [Pale](https://anchor.fm/paleaudiobook/episodes/Pale-0-0-Blood-Runs-Cold-edv2li) has an audiobook. If you're looking for Urban Fantasy, I can recommend the story, though I haven't tried the audiobook myself. Even has a side character who went through a time loop scenario!

  There's still the one up on youtube

  I was on chapter 29 when it got deleted, and have been thinking about this a lot.
  The good thing is that it will return someday, but it's not certain when.

  Personally I'm going back to what I used to do, catching up and reading some manga. 

  There is nothing like MoL, but if you want to fill the void just a bit, I recomend the manga "Mashle", it's different, but ti me it has a similar vibe and is hillarious.

  It's still up in one place as far as I know.

  Mother of Learning? So that's a complete podcast that you reccomend?
  ```

    Can't speak about the quality of the podcast, but I've started the text version of it recently and it's pretty good.

    Basically a groundhog's day scenario, in which a young wizard relives a month of magic school over and over again.

    Of course there's bigger plot things that happen, and I'm not that far into it yet. But the gist is that it's a rational take on magic with the groundhog's day twist.
    ```

    - u/Rebuta:
      ```
      ok cool I'm gonna give it a try
      ```

      - u/Gitaxis:
        ```
        Itâ€™s pretty amazing. 10/10 would recommend, one of my all time favorites.
        ```

    ```
    The podcast wasn't complete, and it got removed because the author got a deal with audible. The story itself is complete and free on royal road.
    ```

    - u/Rebuta:
      ```
      Yeah, I just found that out the hard way. But I still think I'll read it in text version, which just means I can't start right away.
      ```

  ```
  I listened to it on TTS first when it was ~40 chapters in and again when it finished.

  TTS is much more listenable if you just crank the speed up... I listen to podcasts at like 1.8x-3.0x depending on what feels right but my speedup on TTS is 6x. No idea why the default is so slow.
