## Fiction that changed how you think

### Post:

What fiction (especially rational/ist fiction) has changed the way that you think or how you look at the world? 

(The book which comes to mind most readily for me is *Blindsight*, which got me really interested in the workings of the mind on a biological level, made me value consciousness that much more and, somehow, helped me through a particularly depressive period in my life)

  Permutation City.

    Even better, a version of Permutation City with a corruption halfway through that made my ebook reader think the book ended halfway through.

    Exactly halfway through.

    For a few months, I thought that the [book](#s " just... ended... in the real world, with Maria having launched the TVC Universe and Durham committing suicide, with no answer to whether it continued or whether there was anything continuing inside it after its simulation had been 'stopped' IRL.")

    Made me think *really hard* about what was actually going on. [spoiler](#s " I arrived at something pretty similar to the Mathematical Universe Hypothesis and continued developing from there.")

      Holy shit, are you me? I guess we must have pirated the same version of it, because I had the exact same issue, and thought it was just an extremely disappointing ending. (I wasn't redpilled on AI or even thinking that hard about it back then)
      ```

      - u/Vebeltast:
        ```
        That's the amazing thing - as far as technical story quality goes, it was an awful ending, but that wrenching sense of wrongness drives the philosophical point home in a uniquely memorable way.

    Do you still recommend this? I'm a little wary about a hard sci-fi book on artificial intelligence that's over 20 years old. 

    Also, interesting fact, there's a very positive review of it on Amazon by none other than Eliezer Yudkowsky, written in 1997!

      It's not about AI but about emulations of human minds. It's also not really hard sci-fi because it assumes some rules about our universe that I don't think are true... However, the part about the emulations was very fascinating (and a bit scary).

  Dune.  I had already read a lot of science fiction and fantasy, but Dune was the first that really caused me to think deeply and philosophically about its meaning and theme for an extended period of time.  I was in High School at the time, and after finishing Dune, it occurred to me that the sensations I felt was what my English teachers wanted me to feel about the novels we read in class.

  Harry's speech to Dumbledore in the humanism chapter of HPMOR made me consider morality independent of an omnipotent god which (with the help of the Sequence) eventually lead away from my YEC Fundamenalist Southern Baptist beliefs.

  In the aftermath of abandoning my religious beliefs, Shinji and the Warhammer 40k made me take humanism seriously.  The Finale of the Ultimate Meta Mega Crossover made me question the upper limits of what is possible in my newfound materialistic understanding of reality.

  The Prince of Nothing trilogy is my equivalent to Blindsight. Had a lot of cool stuff about cognitive biases and consciousness in it (though it could get a bit didactic), with the same sort of strain of eliminativism I believe I've heard is in Blindsight, capped with some horrifying scenes with those ideas taken to their conclusion. All against a well-designed fantasy  backdrop (based on the Crusades)playing off tropes in the genre.

  It got me more into the issue of consciousness and how we think, lead me to Kahneman and others and their views (albeit far less extreme) about thinking, which definitely had an impact on how I think about the mind.
  ```

  - u/callmebrotherg:
    ```
    Oh, goodness. I remember reading about this. Felt like "Game of Thrones but more imaginative worldbuilding", which is nice, but also not sure how I'd do with those horrifying scenes that you mention (or *some* horrifying scenes, which I assume are among those that you are thinking of).
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Yeah, the author has a dark take on things. It can get bad. 

      But the peaks are relatively few, so it does tend to a similar level of darkness to Game of Thrones (but perhaps a bit worse because he writes *weird* people, people who are difficult to empathize with because they're actual religious fanatics, not snarky agnostics like Tyrion). 

      Really, it's hard to tell if it's for someone. Some can look past those bits or really enjoy it, others can't and I'm not surprised.

      Ironically, the rational protagonist makes it worse. He's...a bit *too* rational. Hard to like.

          Most of it is in the first few bits of the book anyway, for anyone that wants to look at the spoiler:

          [Spoiler]
          (#s "Kellhus is essentially the result of a massive, 2,000 year old breeding program meant to eliminate human weaknesses and biases. They believe (as modern cogsci seems to lean) that humans are driven by passions that they often have no clear understanding of but that they rationalize anyway and are incredibly confident in their ability to judge . To be "free" in their eyes, you need to be able to understand and master some of those passions, or at least "see" them. Otherwise, free will is just an illusion,something the brain does. So they went into hiding, and tried to breed out all the "flaws" in human thinking and biology, improving themselves for millenia, learning to suppress those pesky emotions. ")

          [Spoiler](#s "By the time Kellhus shows up they're basically transhumans. They have massive amounts of cognitive empathy- but no emotional empathy  combined with an awesome intellect (capable of mastering languages in days) and the near total ability to read faces so men are essentially children to them. They can manipulate them at will, make them love them, die for them.")

          [Spoiler](#s "The problem is; Kellhus is a transhuman in the true sense-beyond man- ,not in the rosy way. He's not really human or burdened with anything other than The Mission. He finds what he calls "The Shortest Path" and executes it, regardless of who dies or is hurt. He's...like an arch-sociopath, moving people like pieces for his own rational ends, using their superstitions and beliefs against them. A lot of those pieces are characters you come to empathize with more than Kellhus, after all, even the worst human is still human, Kellhus...isn't. It's very difficult to read this hyper-rational person completely turn these people inside out. You intellectually know that he's right and is being totally rational, but it's infuriating and scary, especially since what he's doing works because he denies our basic...humanity.")


          Which is as the author intended,Kellhus represents modernity,and the danger of both transhumanism and reductionist psychology. The sort of things he does are the sort of things we're afraid corporations will do.

            Otherwise, I understand what you are saying. [Kellhus ](#s "is perfectly rational by himself, but rather it's his ancestors who made the assumption that emotions prevent rational behavior (which is a controversial concept in the cog-sci field).")

It's not just a higher emotion disdain, the way Smith would hate humans for making illogical decisions based on love. It's the way say..a freshman psychology student would be terrified if you hit them with some of the myriad examples of framing issues Kahneman uses. They actually do start out with emotions, they just learned to suppress them when they're older...somehow. So they avoid the problem I think you're hinting at - emotion is necessary for judgement and discrimination. So they get the good parts without the trouble.")

              All things considered their basic assumptions seem to have worked out for them. It's just odious to see in action.

            Surely the lesson here is not "biases and idiocy are awesome and an essential part of makes us human" and more of "make sure powerful agents have friendly goals". 

            I don't really remember what the overarching goal was, so it probably was some vaguely defined bullshit. I'd be completely fine with Kellhus fully exploiting the stupidmonkeyness of everyone around him in service of a worthwhile goal. I remember cheering for him half the time when I last read it.

              Why would that be the message? Is the message of Lovecraft that blindness to the massive forces that dwarf humanity is awesome and an essential part of what makes us human? Well...maybe, but no one said blindness is positive, only that the visceral reaction to the consequences of it being exposed is natural.

              And it's not as if the fear that transhumanism or AI can go bad is crazy. If you already want it to happen you'll only take the note of caution for granted and forge on, but it isn't silly in and of itself.

              >and more of "make sure powerful agents have friendly goals".

              Make sure how? He's not an AI and even that is not certain.

              It wasn't. But it wasn't anything you'd value.

              The sequel series deals exactly with that "worthy goal" situation should you [spoiler] (#s "fuck with people to prevent the apocalypse?") ironically though [major spoiler for second series!](#s "Kellhus might have become crazy since the strictly rational path would have been to let the apocalypse happen- Earwa is a world with objective morality, where sorcerors are damned, an apocalypse would close Hell-and the chaotic Outside that may disprove all the empiricism Kellhus believes in- off, preventing him from spending eternity in damnation. So he's being insane by helping, by believing that he is a prophet. If he's really helping...")

                Yeah, I don't really know who I was addressing with my whinging. Some imaginary straw man most likely. It just sometimes feels like the aim is not to say "let's be careful while we do this awesome thing" and more of "no, transhumanism is pernicious and evil and we should pre-emptively lobotomise anyone who does not disapprove of it absolutely". I haven't figured out why every strongly cautionary statement about transhumanism feels like a personal attack against me just yet. Affect heuristic and my tribal affiliation are probably big parts of it.

                tl;dr Transhumanism mind-kills me, disregard previous post.

                >Make sure how? He's not an AI and even that is not certain.

                In this particular case not letting him loose on the unsuspecting populace, unless there is some existential threat or something similarly dire. It's not so much about preventing him from fucking with people, as making sure the end justifies the means.

                >The sequel series deals exactly with that "worthy goal" situation

                Perhaps I should read them again, even though I vaguely remember being disappointed when Kellhus started loosing his marbles.

                  >Perhaps I should read them again, even though I vaguely remember being disappointed when Kellhus started loosing his marbles.

                  It's actually a mystery how crazy he is or how right he is. And it's part of what's driving the suspense of the later series. He's crazy for a Dunyain..but the Dunyain have been wrong. After all, Kellhus was certain that magic and god weren't  things...until he stepped outside. 

                  But if you were interested in the rational bits I suppose it would be pretty strange.

  Terry Pratchett's stuff probably shaped my viewpoint more than any other author. Probably partly because I read him at the right time when I was still fairly young, but also partly because he often says a lot of fairly profound-sounding stuff (a larger portion of than average of which is not just sounding profound but is legitimate insight).
  ```

- u/Farmerbob1:
  ```
  I know myself rather well.  This is partly because I spend so much time considering where I stand on things.  I have a very broad range of interests and can discuss most topics at least on a surface level.  I am constantly examining myself and everything around me to validate what I know.  This makes me a very, very stubborn person, and I can think of no single work of literature that impacted me dramatically by it's content.

  But I still have an answer.  Wildbow's *Worm*.

  *Worm* was a good read, but the content of the story wasn't world changing to me.  How the story was written, the process of serial web fiction - **THAT** got my attention.  I determined long, long ago that if I ever tried to write a novel, it would never happen, because I couldn't write that much all at once with no input, and didn't want to impose on family to read what was certainly going to be terrible crap, at least at first.

  Wildbow's *Worm* was the first serial fiction I ever encountered.  Somehow.  I had always read dead tree books before, nothing online.  The idea of writing little pieces of a book, piece by piece, hit me like a Louisville Slugger.  Two years later, I can barely look at that first story and not cringe, for so many reasons.  But it was good enough that people liked it, and gave me feedback that I desperately needed.

  In short, *Worm* showed me a way **I** could write.  At this point I'm far over a million words written since I found *Worm*, and about to start editing six novels for publication (the oldest ones are gonna be painful!)

  - u/Gcrein:
    ```
    1: Can you elaborate on how Twitter has changed the way you think?

    2: I just glanced through the Wikipedia page for The Mars Trilogy. I couldn't help but notice the first line of the description of Maya Toitovna, "An emotional woman who is at the center of a love triangle between Boone and Chalmers..."

    So like, does this book have well written female characters?
    ```

    - u/boomfarmer:
      ```
      Okay, so Maya Toitovna is not the most stable of characters. In some ways she uses sex and relationships as a way to achieve and maintain and demonstrate power, which is very apparent because Frank Chalmers is the head of the American side of the mission and John Boone is the First Man On Mars. She worked her way up through Roskosmos by playing the game of beds.

      As a counter to this negative stereotype of Russia, you have the rounded, stable Nadia Cherneshevsky, who does not define herself through her relationships, and who is a role model to many of the nisei (the second-generation Martians). Nadia's relationships are healthy ones. She's also an engineer, not a politician.

      Maya eventually pairs with the psychologist, Michel, who is himself psychologically unstable. This is a healthier relationship, but Maya still has problems with major swings in her mood trends.

      Ann Clayborne is the chief aerologist, and while she has relationship issues that we are told ultimately stem from being abused by a male relative when she was young, she does have a stable family life with Simon. The Reds idolize her, but (I haven't read the books in a while) I don't think she likes their attention and elevation of her to a figurehead. She loves Mars, not the life that grows upon it.

      There are other well-written women in The Mars Trilogy. Jackie's relationship with Zoe is between a narcissist and her independent daughter, across a generational gap that expresses itself politically. Phyllis' rise and fall from power is itself well-written, but Phyllis is not a POV character. The mystic biologist Hiroko is not a POV character, but we see her through the eyes of Nirgal, Sax, Nadia, Michel and in some ways the non-POV character Coyote. Zoe, Nadia, and Maya are POV characters. 

      If it sounds like there are a lot of troubled female characters, there are. There are also a lot of troubled male characters. I think the least-troubled person among the First Hundred is Sax, and he's described by his students as a colony of a hundred enhanced lab rats puppeting a human body.


      ...

      I don't think KSR has any people do things because they are male or because they are female, with the exception of Hiroko. Maya isn't emotional because she's a woman, but rather because her brain and past relationships were fucked by Russian social hierarchy. Nadia builds to build, not because she's a mother or some such. Coyote doesn't wander because he's male, but because there's no real place for him on Mars. Hiroko becomes the mother goddess figure of Mars because, well, *shikata ga nai*, but also because she's carrying out her philosophy through the farm team and her family. Characters do things because the characters have reasons, and if those reasons are sexist it's because of in-book sexism rather than blatant authorial sexism.

      Does this answer your questions?

It's served to open my eyes to a lot of stuff that I miss in my social circles, and consider political things that I didn't know about.

  Dune. Dune is a fantastic book for teaching you to think in layers. The feint within a feint within a feint is real. The sequels for Dune teach you that just because a writer is clever, it doesn't mean he knows what he is talking about or will come to accurate conclusions.

  MoR, obviously, because it lead me to LessWrong. 

  Pratchett's works are fantastic because in making fun of the way everything works they make you consider why they work like they do and what would work better. I have read them all.

  Surprisingly, Artemis Fowl. I was 11, and looking back it did not change the way I thought for the better. Instead it made me an insufferable little swat for a few years there. Though I suppose we all look back at our childhood like that.

  Puella Magi Adfligo Systema is a quest on SV. It gave practical experience of testing reality and observing the results. Also learned how to write fight scenes partially from that, which I am glad for. 

  Ian Irvine's View From the Mirror books. They were the first stories I read where good did not gloriously triumph over evil, and instead was an ever marching parade of taking shit in order to just barely squeak an ambiguous victory, all overturned because you did not pay attention to one particular detail. Not very good lessons from that one either. I learned cynicism. Took a while to get over. Also forced me to consider that the evil invading aliens might be alright people in a shit situation with bad PR.

    > Dune is a fantastic book for teaching you to think in layers.

    I think it was sometime around reading Dune (I can't remember exactly when, so I am not 100% it was entirely a result of reading DUne), the I picked up the habit of trying to internalize and understand competing points of view/worldviews simultaneously.  I was a Young Earth Creationist at the time, but I tried to seriously imagine how an "evolutionist" (I would have used that terminology at the time) would view things (as opposed to just assuming their viewpoint was because they had rejected God, like >90% of the other people at my church would think).  The decisive point was when my "atheist" mode of thinking started outputting more moral answers than my Christian mode of thinking (which was used some mix of moral realism and Divine command theory).

    But yeah, it was around the time that I read Dune in High School that I started developing the tendency to try to hold multiple contradictory viewpoints/worldviews simultaneously.

    I think God Emperor of Dune might have contributed to my thoughts on omniscience and free will would interact.

      I stopped bitching about bands "selling out"! I used to be really bad about that, when I was a teenager. Then this song came out, and I really sat down and thought about my reasoning.  

      [Vicarious](https://youtu.be/iOKV9Stri_M) changed the way I looked at media.

  [HPMoR taught me that the ones you love can be the most evil people on Earth.](http://i.imgur.com/CZkB7fO.png) Also that /r/HPMoR is a fearsome hivemind that outsmarted Eliezer on one occasion.

  Kill la Kill has changed my perspective of resolve and sacrifice. Chills were a regular occurrence. That was my second fiction after quitting antidepressants, and it had a big impact on me emotionally.

  Hourou Musuko makes me want to be all that I want to be. The third fiction after antidepressants, and I definitely cried. I like crying.

  Peter Watts (Blindsight et al, Starfish et al, The Things) is remarkably good at portraying the inner experience of alien psychologies. I badly want that skill, and I'm preparing for an attempt for RaNoWriMo. I doubt I'll get close in the first draft, but that's more for laying down the plot and setting.

  Ghost in the Shell would have been nice to see years and years ago, but I saw it only two weeks ago. I was too familiar with the themes and ideas involved for it to have a real impact on me, but if I had seen it as a child, I think it would have been very formative. Viewing it now only yielded appreciation for the animation, art, and music. I only pieced together the actual plot after a second viewing, as it's very sparse on detailed exposition.

  My own story idea is suffering from a number of unfortunate coincidences; the main character is very similar to Ghost in the Shell's Kusanagi Motoko, and she even has a similar hairstyle as Motoko in ARISE. All this, and I had made those details concrete weeks before I watched GitS. Writing is suffering.

    **Yes.** It gets so bad that sometimes I feel like a story I've written is trash because it doesn't feel enough like Blindsight, before I realize, wait, this isn't even in the same genre, *not every book has to sound like Blindsight.* 

    On a related note, I think that one of the most difficult things for me as a writer is accepting that different authors have different styles, and though I write differently than many of my favorite authors that does not mean that my style is automatically inferior.

    I saw that in elementary school. Arte (an art-house oriented TV channel) had "anime night" and my mother, who was going out that evening, thought "Oh cartoons! That will keep him busy alone at home". I'm sure I missed a lot of nuance but it still opened me to interesting new ideas. It was also pretty heavy for me that age, but nothing compared to [Jin-Roh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin-Roh:_The_Wolf_Brigade), which run right after that. That ending...

  I've mentioned this before but Animorphs and the Ellimist Chronicle put a way of abstract thinking into my brain that I find useful for understanding causality.

  The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening started me on the path of evaluating just what the nature of life and reality is.

    ```
    I think the train of thought that Animorphs (with the kids morphing animals and retaining their minds but having their experience filtered through the animal's instincts) put me on kind of lead me to reinvent substance dualism in order to describe what empirical predictions my religious beliefs at the time should make.  I believed that analyzing the brain closely enough would show that it was interacting with something outside of conventional physics...
    ```

    - u/Nighzmarquls:
      ```
      the thing I rather LIKED about animorphs is that their brains are actually still around. They cover it during the book where ax throws away a comment how morphing super small creatures makes him really nervous.

      Because his original mass is being pushed into Z-space and he is worried that an infinitely unlikely collision will occur between his mass and a passing star ship.

  JoJo's Bizarre Adventure [(CrunchyRoll)](http://www.crunchyroll.com/jojos-bizarre-adventure/episode-1-part-1-phantom-blood-653409) [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoJo%27s_Bizarre_Adventure) taught me that inner strength and outer strength are the same thing. I haven't watched/read Stardust Crusaders-- this is just talking about Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency.

  Seconding those who cited *Blindsight* and the works of Terry Pratchett. Also *Ghost in the Shell*. I would also cite *Revolutionary Girl Utena* (and, to some extent, its spiritual-semi-predecessor *The Vision of Escaflowne*).

  Recently, *Inside Out*, though it's caused my love-hate relationship with the Rationalist community to waver further.

  I haven't gotten very far in The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant series, but its words and phrases stick in my head. It's helping me become a less pessimistic and self-destructive person, learn how to forgive myself for flaws, those kind of things.
