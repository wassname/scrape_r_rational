## Name that fic: Multiple viewpoints, kids find spacesuits "underground" on their generation ship.

### Post:

I recall reading a story maybe a year ago that had a lot of different viewpoints going on at once. Unfortunately most of them blend together in my head with other stories. One part stands out, where some kids on a generation ship or ringworld or similar find some spacesuits and a way to get outside the ship and see space while on a tether. I think I lost track of it after a few chapters and never picked it back up, and now I can't remember the title.

Anyone remember that story?

  You're probably thinking of [Sideways in Hyperspace](https://sidewaysfiction.wordpress.com/), which was also posted on /r/HFY.  The parts that you mention are in chapters 8 and 12.

  Right, and there were also some first contact stories going on at the same time, right?

  Aha! Some clever googling turns up [Sideways in Hyperspace](https://sidewaysfiction.wordpress.com/).

    Nice find. It was gearing up to be really good. I liked all the characters and the premise was sufficiently mind-blowing.

  Sideways in hyperspace, it was really good, it's too bad it hasn't been updated in more than one year

    Aww, damn. That's probably why I stopped reading :(
