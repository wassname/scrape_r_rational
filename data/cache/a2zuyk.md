## Recommendations for KU subscription

### Post:

I have recently put kindle unlimited and wanted the communities input on what good books are present.

Books I liked (not exhaustive list)

Cradle Series

Dawn of Wander

Mother of learning 

Release that witch

HPMOR

3 body problem

And the usual books recommended in this group.

I am open for good recommendation from both sci-fi and fantasy.

  Kindle Unlimited has some real garbo on it that gets high reviews, so it can be pretty difficult to sort good books from bad.

  A series that I enjoyed was the Bobiverse by Dennis Taylor. It's about a guy that gets his consciousness uploaded into a Von Neumann Probe.

    I really disliked the first book of bobiverse. [Here's a discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5u054p/hsf_rt_we_are_legion_we_are_bob_a_novel_about_von/) about it from last year. 

    I agree with the other thing you said though.

      I'm on the opposite side of the fence on the bobiverse. You make a great criticism  about the way it depicts resources, but I still like it for approaching the fun, challenges, and opportunities of uploading.  Do you have an alternate book you like that explores that possibility space, IMHO Diaspora is too tied up with dimensionality, and loses all of the fun of math when exploring the coal face metaphor, to really be a fun exploration of uploading.

  ```
  [Brandon Sanderson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68428.The_Final_Empire?ac=1&from_search=true): Stormlight Archive, Mistborn (original trilogy)  

  Anything by [Mark Lawrence](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4721536.Mark_Lawrence)  

  [The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/64341.The_Metamorphosis_of_Prime_Intellect) - He also posts it for free his website if you google it.  

  [Divine Dungeon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32509131-dungeon-born) series. Kind of like Crandle in its power gathering mechanisms, but about a dungeon and way more lighthearted with really mossively terrible puns.

  Phil Tucker is a more unknown author I'm rather fond of. [Chronicles of the Black Gate](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29936142-the-path-of-flames) - a past-paced fantasy epic with a fair amount of characters, locations, and story lines. [Euphoria Online](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39980416-death-march) - a LitRPG that I thought was pretty awesome, especially compared to most of the other books in the genre.


  [The Shadow of What was Lost](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22878967-the-shadow-of-what-was-lost) - Another fantasy epic, but featuring time travel!

  A bit more experimental of a recommendation, but I rather enjoyed this video, [Fable of the Dragon Tyrant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZYNADOHhVY)

    Last time I touched divine dungeon it had like super bad writing so idk if that's a good recommend
    ```

- u/GlueBoy:
  ```
  Try Kings of Paradise and Perilous Waif. Both pretty good.
  ```

  - u/nolrai:
    ```
    Perilous Waif is really good. Sort of silly, i mean it's about a literal princess raised as an orphan, but super fun, and not very stupid.
    ```

  ```
  You double-posted.

    Hey, thanks for noticing, removed the other one

  ```
  I think Diaspora (Greg Egan) is on KU?
  ```

- u/RMcD94:
  ```
  There's a monthly recommendation thread in the sidebar.
  ```

  - u/user19911506:
    ```
    Any recommendations are fine from any genre , it would be best if it is available in KU
    ```

  - u/Shaolang:
    ```
    Where in the sidebar is the monthly recommendation thread?  I may be blind but I can't seem to find it.
