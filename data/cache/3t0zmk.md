## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

    Could you PM me your email address?  I should put you in touch with Joshua Fox of LW-Tel-Aviv.  He's from a Kfar somewhere near Jerusalem.  He's a cool older guy, great for advice.  The community there will also be a good set of people for generally spending-time-around while openly atheist or secular.

    Standard /r/athiesm advise is to tell your parents you're an athiest at a dinner you paid for in a house you own.

    If you are, or expect to be able to, relying on them for any kind of support, do not tell them, for it may disappear. 

    Religious differences are one of the things that you can lose family contact permanently over. Handle this with all the care you would take disarming a live nuclear device in a heavily populated area.

  This subreddit has had a serious impact on the way I write home-brew content for my gaming group. I now give a lot more consideration to how massively seemingly minor powers can be exploited.  
  #Forewarning
  **Duration:** Instant  
  **Range:** Personal  
  **Target:** Self  
  **Effect:** Specify a single action, the DM will give you a yes or no answer as to whether this course of action will bring harm to your character within the next 30 seconds.  
  *Note:* Yes you could theoretically pull a P=NP exploit by repeatedly precommitting to stabbing yourself in the hand if you get an incorrect answer. Do however take a moment to consider how stupid you’re going to feel when you mutilate yourself for an answer that turns out to only be ‘technically correct.’
  ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    you'd feel bad if the answer was misleading in such a way that you'd regret the answer you got within the next thirty seconds, which could be reasonably quantified as harm.

    And I want to say you can potentially look forward in time a lot further than 30 seconds (like in that one story with the pills where the future reader sends data back to himself) but you might be able to elegantly avoid this by treating boredom as harming the asker.

    This is actually a really powerful power, but you can probably restrict it by having a very broad definition of harm, making it so it can basically only be used if the person is under absolutely no threats.

  This was a great weekend for PRODUCTIVITY.

  * I did a phone-bank for an LGBT rights bill.
  * I got my pull-request and bug-fix merged to the machine-learning project that I volunteer for.
  * I had a spare machine at work training its ANNABELL copy for a nice Turing Test.
  * I started radically simplifying my proof development in Coq.
  * I received the official notice that I finished grad school!

  And then today I bought a video game.

  The most recent Wait But Why [article](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html) is about Elon Musk and his methods of achieving greatness. It describes a good method of rational thinking. I liked the breakdown of variables you need to keep track of to achieve goals.

    Elon Musk understands Spiral Power.

    Well, that certainly explains a lot.

    That was a great read. Thank you for sharing that.

  I want to get you rational people's thoughts on the Paris attacks. IMO it's a drop in the bucket of violence that is perpetrated on and by Islam daily, for example [Drone Assassinations](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/03/us-led-air-strikes-on-isis-targets-killed-more-than-450-civilians-report). While I'm not surprised by the focus of the media, it does sadden me. Our first world countries are involved in perpetrating so much violence, killing innocents regularly. And then something like this happens and we act outraged - it just seems so hypocritical.
  ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    On a country level, utilitarianism only matters insofar as your own citizens are hurt. That being said, money spent on this war would save a lot more lives if devoted to researching even stuff like autonomous vehicles to prevent crashes. I don't thing it's hugely hypocritical from a realpolitik standpoint, just laughably inefficient.
    ```

    - u/Rhamni:

      At the same time, ISIS has a very real track record of wiping out captured males and old women and sentencing young women to Rape&PregnancyForever. For all the faults of the US, Russia, China and even North Korea, I don't think even the wildest conspiracy theories about them are as nauseatingly 'evil' as what ISIS is. War is a horrible waste of money and life, and it would have been so very much better if 'we' had just left Hussein in power, but now here we are, and ISIS is not going to let us just not fight them. They sincerely believe that sky man wants them to murder and rape in the name of god.

    The Paris attacks are not at all comparable to the drone assassinations. 

    ISIS *wants* to kill as many innocent civilians as it can.  

    The US does not try to kill innocent civilians. The drone strikes aim to assassinate military fighters from the Taliban, Al-Qaeda, and so forth. We may argue whether they are a good idea, but fundamentally they are not unjustified, given that they are targeted at fighters from groups who are waging war against the United States. 

    Innocent civilians do die in US operations, but this does not mean that those operations are comparable to what ISIS does in any moral or otherwise meaningful sense. 

    Intentions matter. 

    For example, you mention (in a comment below) the bombing of a Medecins Sans Frontieres hospital -- the US admitted this was a mistake, apologized to MSF, and promised to hold members of its military accountable if an investigation finds this was anything more than an error (source: http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/07/us-afghanistan-attack-msf-idUSKCN0S10SX20151007#WeGo8tfDuhPql0SQ.97 )

    TLDR: in judging military actions, it is morally imperative to distinguish between actions which aim to kill as many civilians as possible (e.g., 9/11, Paris Attacks, London Subway bombings) and actions which only kill civilians as a by-product of attacks on military targets (e.g., US drone strikes).
    ```

    - u/Polycephal_Lee:
      ```
      2 big questions:

      Why does intent matter?

      How can you discern a government's intent?
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        First: intent matters because any understanding of morality in which intent doesn't matter leads to absurd conclusions. 

        Suppose person X shoots and kills person Y. Does it matter if X did it in self-defense, knowing or reasonably believing that Y was about to kill him if he did nothing? *Of  course it does*. Any other answer here is too ridiculous to contemplate.

        Thus the same action (X killing Y) could be either right or wrong depending on X's motive. 

        Second: like people, governments put out statements about their goals. 

        After the MSF catastrophe, the US apologized and vowed to investigate what happened and make changes in its operations so that this does not happen again. 

        After the Paris attacks, ISIS put out a statement saying this was only the beginning; going on to say, regarding that people of France, that "the scent of death will not leave their nostrils" provided several conditions continue to be met, one of which being that "they dare to curse our Prophet."

        There is nothing difficult about comparing intentions here.
        ```
