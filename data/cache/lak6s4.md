  I'm so glad that Max is still alive and kicking. She's a really interesting character, and as much as I hate that her revolution has failed and she's lost her best friend, I'm eager to see how that affects her moving forward. I hope she gets the spotlight a bit more in the future, now that she's no longer occupying the role of "shadowy villainous mastermind." At this point, Max has more in common with Ana and Wes than not, so I don't think it's entirely out of the question. Plus, that dream world thing is still super intriguing and I want to see where it goes.

    I love that she's halfway between a mook and the big bad, and still somehow more of a heroic character than the protagonist team.   All her efforts were appropriated by tunnel vision the first time around but maybe she'll do better next time. 

    I also can't wait for her to meet Hira and learn what's going on with him/her.

  Part of me thought it was a bit too convenient that the Black Tortoise is back right when the Principality needs a new external enemy to distract the people.

  Then he hit us with the Christea Ronaveda recording.

  Anyways, I'm glad Max is still in the game, even it it sucks that she lost her only friend. For all their faults, Grace and Max really deserved better.

    Yeah, I'm impressed that after all the shit she went through, Grace still managed to save Max.

    That woman had a lot of flaws, but incompetence wasn't one of them.

    Yeah, being born in this word is incredibly bleak. Either you are a subsistence farmer or canon fodder.

  > The simple life was never possible for me.  A ‘simple’ life required financial stability and free time.  Her boss at the bike company had taken that from her when he decided to pay her starvation wages.  

  Reminds me of [a SMBC comic](https://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&id=2012#comic).

  > Two days ago, we orchestrated our greatest attack yet against the imperialist butchers of the Principality

  I like how the guy has absolutely zero shame using "imperialist" as an insult right after calling himself "Conquerer of the Nekean Islands, Ilaqua, and the Principality, and Grand Marshal of the Shenti Empire".

  > Leo’s Place

  Heh.

  I wonder if Leo is even aware that the spoiled epistocrat he helped get her status back is the girl who helped crush Commonplace?

  > Her lieutenants lowered their guns, and stared at her.  Then, one of them spoke up.  “Ma’am?”
  >
  > “I told you,” she said.  “‘Max’ is fine.”

  Wait, is that a password?

  That's so clever if it is.

  > Max strode to the edge of the room and threw open the curtains, letting in dim light from the streetlamps.  From this window as a vantage point, they could see some of the larger streets of Lowtown.
  >
  > Even at this late hour, tanks rolled down the boulevards, past storefronts and apartment buildings, accompanied by soldiers and the occasional Guardian.  Far more soldiers and firepower than Commonplace had ever gathered in one place.

  Is that really wise, Max? If you and your men can see the soldiers outside, the soldiers outside can see you and your men conspiring around a table.

  > “Two weeks ago, national support for Commonplace sat at thirty-one percent,” said Max.  “Four hours ago, it sat at fifty-three.  Paragon’s crackdown.  Our revelations about Parliament.  They didn’t fall on empty ears.”  

  Holy shit.

  This is a poll filled by people who just learned that their government mind-raped their own parliament, and murdered them when they outlived their usefulness.

  Either Paragon poll workers are *really* good at getting honest answers, or the actual numbers must be even higher, and *almost everyone* hates the government in place.

  > “Maybe it’s not important, which world is real,” said Max.  “The important thing is which world I care about.  Even if they’re both real.  Or if they’re both fake.”

  Max is really not thinking through the consequences if both worlds are real. Like, if it is, that means there might be other conduits. It means Paragon might eventually figure out a way to communicate with alternate!Paragon and leak all the intel she knows.

  Conversely, if they figure out how to communicate with Maxine's other world, she can start a revolution there too, learning from her previous mistakes (and maybe free herself while she's at it).

  (Also, I just realized, Max being split in two worlds gives her kind of an advantage; she has an extra day every day to think about everything she's doing, everything she just did the previous day, etc; when the whole revolution was decided in the span of a few weeks, that's a big advantage; the fact that the doctors force her to recite everything that happened probably helps her structure it too)

  > Max leaned forward, placed her palms on the woman’s ears, and kissed her forehead.  “Hope you’re ready for war.”

  I'm so happy Max isn't dead.

  That woman is a fucking legend.

  > Max reached into her bag, pulled out a thick piece of bacon, and bit into it. The tastes of salt and fat and pork blossomed in her mouth.

  Yaaaaaay!

  First Ana looking in the mirror and seeing a woman, then Wes maybe-quitting alcohol, then this.

  This ending arc is weirdly upbeat.

    Definitely the government dude.  Doesn't take statistics to buy some comprehensive study reports, address the biggest impact points, and adjust to stay on course as confounding issues reveal themselves.  

    Of course, it doesn't take statistics to know that that free baseball ticket hotline is only available as long as phizer is happy with which laws are passed, either.

  Well, Commonplace fucked it all up. Time for Big Daddy Tortoise to show everyone how it's done.
