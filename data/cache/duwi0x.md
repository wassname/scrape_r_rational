  Feel inclined to mention that Zero HP Lovecraft is an alt-right white supremacist, and all their stories have the undertones of that in them.

  That being sajd, I just don't like this one very much. [the green new deal](https://zerohplovecraft.wordpress.com/2019/09/28/the-green-new-deal/) (TW: suicide) or [The Gig Economy](https://zerohplovecraft.wordpress.com/2018/05/11/the-gig-economy-2/) were both better.

    Mind linking some text that proves this? If you do, I'll add an objectionable politics warning if I link stories by this author in the future.

      Very helpfully, they have an entire [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/0x49fa98/status/1023248792013819904) cataloging all their tweetstorms on various topics. They're a...prolific tweeter.

      [Here's](https://twitter.com/0x49fa98/status/1100426272130228229) a good one. [Here's](https://mobile.twitter.com/0x49fa98/status/1100426272130228229) a tweet in the thread about this very work.

      EDIT: woops, that second link is supposed to be [this](https://mobile.twitter.com/0x49fa98/status/1189925844279386113)

        Tbf, those selected threads have homophobia but not much in the way of racism, just stringent anti-progressivism. Ill call him a homophobe, but I am down for precision in my labelling!

        (didnt read every tweet of course)

        Prolific tweeter indeed! Reminds me of Nietzsche, pointy edges and all.

            Some people don’t want to read content by actual Nazis.

    The Gig Economy reminds me of [Alex Beyman](https://www.inkitt.com/AlexBeyman)'s [Persistence of Vision](https://www.inkitt.com/stories/horror/35463) with the idea of life appearing in bizzare substrates and mediums which gives it a somewhat Lovecraftian vibes.

    After reading all three stories by Zero HP Lovecraft, I think that Alex Beyman shares a lot in common with Zero HP Lovecraft. Both of them write stories thinking about the future with lovecraftian themes and how memes can be dangerously effective on the individual. Zero thinks about the market as a memetic danger, while Alex does the same thing but with religion in [Triangle Opportunity](https://www.inkitt.com/stories/horror/7465).

    Ah, thank you! I thought I'd got a really weird vibe from The Gig Economy when it showed up here a while back; now I know why.

    ```
    I just read the gig economy, and wow. No more Lovecraft-inspired things before bed.

    Shame the author is such a crappy person.
    ```

  - u/Baconoflight:

    true, probably should've added a disclaimer to that affect myself. I think this one is still pretty good separate from the author's awful politics, but certainly not for everyone. I'm a big fan of transhumanist kink stories like this, Metamorphosis of the Prime Intellect, etc

    edit: also hadn't read GND yet, thanks for linking

    > Zero HP Lovecraft is an alt-right white supremacist

    What does this have to do with fiction? Its clear who the bigot is here
    ```

    - u/Luck732:
      ```
      I mean, probably the alt-right white supremacist, right?
      ```

      Look at regular Lovecraft. A great deal of his stories are, "people that aren't the right type of white are scary". 
      So it has everything to do with it.


      Also, please explain who the true bigot is in that situation.
      ```

      - u/PM-ME-YOUR-SEXTAPE:
        ```
        Clearly he who judges art by merit of the artists identity. Bigoted enough to feel the world should conform to his political beliefs
        ```

        - u/VapeKarlMarx:
          ```
          Almost none of those words match the way you are using them.


          It'd just be easier if you came out and said you are rascist and feel attacked.  We can work from there that's fine.  We don't have to pretend this is some grand ethical debate.

  Ah sweet, thanks for linking this, I loved The Gig Economy, always wondered if that author would give us any more stuff.  Can't wait to read!
  ```

  - u/DuplexFields:
    ```
    Ah yes, Gig Economy. The only story I’ve ever read that managed to make its own copyleft notice unsettling and ominous.

    just sam\[z\]dat for the similarity of strangely coherent fever dream qualia. I was aboutt o say sam\[z\]dat is non-fiction, which would imply zhpl is fiction but...lol?

    Also, The Tower by Hotel Concierge.

    Also Sam Reuben's And Darkness series.

  Wait till you hear about the politics of the guy ZHPL took his name from
