## [Biweekly Challenge] Cat and Mouse

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4docs7/biweekly_challenge_animemanga/?sort=confidence) the prompt was "Anime/Manga". The winner was /u/Sailor_Vulcan with their story, [Yugiohnai! Episode I: The Heart of the Cards?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4docs7/biweekly_challenge_animemanga/d1uarl9). Go read it now! Congratulations to /u/Sailor_Vulcan!

##### This Time

This time we're doing "Cat and Mouse". Give us a story about hunter and prey, with the option for role reversal. In some ways you might consider this a subset of the asymmetric warfare.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, May 4th (Star Wars Day!).** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Next time the prompt will be "Romance", one of the most consistently irrational genres out there. This was originally going to be the prompt for Valentine's Day, but I then I forgot all about it until after the fact. Here "Romance" should be understood as a shorthand for "Romantic Relationships", since you're free to travel outside the traditional genre boundaries.

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 5/4.** Please private message me with any questions or comments, as the beloved meta thread is now archived. The companion thread [can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4fr7sl/challenge_companion_cat_and_mouse/).

  I went pretty literal with this. Used a word derivative of "squeak" 6 times. On the plus side, no "suddenly".

    (Their limited perspective is amusing.  "Ever since we started interacting with them, they've wanted to kill us!  Why!?"  "Well, what interactions have you had with them?"  "We break into the food supply they prepared for themselves and eat up as much as we can." "Well, *maybe that's why*.")
    ```

      I'm glad that came across. Rats lack a lot of concepts that humans take for granted, and I tried to capture some of the difficulty they would have in interpreting our behaviour.

      The chief difficulty in their reasoning is that the humans are acting indirectly. It's not about predation or dominance, and the food they're eating isn't even kept in the human's nest.

      Nili potentially could have figured it out (separating "nest" from "food storage") but decided it didn't matter.

  Short, 619 words. Not my best work, but I'm trying to get back into writing and it didn't turn out terribly.
