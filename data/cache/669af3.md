  I've just read this as part of the humble monthly bundle and liked the story. I do have a bit of a problem  [with](#s " the fact that the aliens hid the reason for the existence of the Cyto suppression technology and how they use it. I don't really understand the reason for hiding it especially since humans would be unlikely to have moral qualms about this.")

  ```
  A pretty moving tale; [](#s "I really empathized with Jason wanting to keep FTL tech out of human hands, considering his impression of the alien societies, although i'm sure most people here would say 'no, fuck that, share ALL the tech!'. Based on his understanding, it could easily have catastrophic consequences. Now, his entire life goal is upended. Poor Jason Write.")
