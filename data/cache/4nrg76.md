    Seven dragons for seven demons is [an acupuncture thing](http://www.nyior.com/acupuncturenewyork-www/om/acupunture/styles/5e/5.1.%20gui%20or%20demons.htm), but it would be a little weird for Unsong to start in on Asian traditions at this point (not *that* weird, but a little weird).

    [Revelation 12:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+12&version=KJ21) describes a dragon with seven heads.

    Isaiah mentions dragons multiple times, usually in conjunction with owls for some no doubt significant reason that I can't remember right now, but I don't think that's the connection either, since the dragons are never numbered.

    Edit: Owls are apparently often found in ruins (is this true?) so it's a symbol of desolation. In Isaiah, "dragon" is perhaps better translated as "jackal", so it's two creatures known for being something like scavengers (the cultural spot that vultures hold today). Also "owls" is sometimes translated as "ostriches", which I find hilarious.

    > it shall be the habitation of dragons, and the pasture of ostriches.

    - u/None:
      ```
      >3 And there appeared another wonder in heaven: behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.

      >4 And his tail drew a third part of the stars of heaven, and cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was ready to be delivered to devour her child as soon as it was born.

      >5 And she brought forth a manchild, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron; and her child was caught up unto God and to His throne.

      >*6 And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared by God*

      Wasn't there an important women who fled recently to a place, influenced heavily by god

      edit//.... wait

      >And his tail drew a third part of the stars of heaven, and cast them to the earth

      That t taking the angles 

      >And she brought forth a manchild

      Not a child a *man*child; so a bit of a loser, someone kicked out of college and working minimum wage

      >her child was caught up unto God and to His throne.

      He did escape to angels 

      But... oh my god, unsong is literally ran by the devil

        Reading that again, I just remembered that Ha'Ari (Harry) is also the name of a wizard. One whose last name is *Potter*, ie. someone who makes clay vessels.

  Considering that Jane comes from Colorado, I think we can mostly confirm that she is Sohu. She probably took up Uriel's offer to increment her age a couple times.

  I guess this solves the skyak mystery.

    >She probably took up Uriel's offer to increment her age a couple times.

    And become Asian?

    I mean, it's possible, but Sohu was described as having "light brown skin, dark brown eyes, braided black hair," and the fan art has her as most definitely not Asian.

    It's a little bit of stretch to say "They are both from Colorado, therefore it's basically confirmed that they are the same person." Especially considering Colorado is where the CometSpawn have control, and so it's likely that there will be more than one character coming from there.

    And last of all, there's no point (plot wise) for Uriel to stop her aging, and then to immediately start her aging again, unless Scott, for some reason, wanted to be intentionally deceitful.
