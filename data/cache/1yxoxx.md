  I don't like Laura. It's sad her husband died, but that keeps interrupting her other thoughts, to the point where I'd recommend therapy. She worries about him more than she worries about Red, and she doesn't even seem have have any good thoughts about the guy!

  I could understand "The house hadn't felt this empty since Tom's death."

  I could understand "Red had been so excited about becoming a professor - some of his father's zeal coming through."

  What you've got is "Red had been so excited about becoming a professor. It reminded Laura of losing her husband. She'd worked as a reporter once. It reminded her of her husband, who she lost. Sam had always been a good friend to the family. Like when Laura lost her husband. The death of Sam's daughter had been so sad. Maybe Laura could have avoided losing her husband. She thought about how her only living child is doing out in the wilderness - it made her miss her lost husband."

  Christ, girl. Worse, this is *the only thing I know about her*. It's the only notable character trait I've seen. She talks about other things, but missing her husband is the only thing she *does*.

  Daisy is worse. She doesn't do anything. She just provides pages and pages of meaningless small talk. She steers the conversation through school and taxes and she has so much screen time, and it feels like none of that is going to pay off. As soon as something interesting happens - Koga's deflecting allegations that he might be what? It's common knowledge that a storm might signal an attack? What's that about? - the plot drops that significant exposition in favor of taking us back to Daisy's small talk! Daisy is a *vampire*.

  This is kind of a problem throughout. The key things I took away from this chapter: Containers exist. Laura misses her husband (more than she misses her son). Daisy prattles on for an eternity. Laura will be traveling as a reporter. Foreboding storm all the characters know about but I don't. Something is going on with a mysterious Dr. Fuji. Those last three points are actually interesting, but they have next to no screen time compared to the character development that makes me hate everyone.

  I'm also not really feeling the worldbuilding in this chapter. The Container is fair enough. But I'm expected to think that a million million megajoules of mass is the easy part, but ten megajoules of thermal energy is supposed to give me pause? Either their mass-energy conversion factor is different from ours (possible, but not shown), or that actually makes the world make *less* sense.

  There's talk of Pokemon on the news, which makes sense. Pokemon are immensely important. So much so that it should be really difficult to write a chapter where the only Pokemon that actually appears is a cooked bird! Is there a compelling reason Laura didn't wait at an intersection for a passing *rhyhorn*? Or why Oak doesn't have a tangela around trained to grab the dishes? Laura stops to chat with neighbors on her way - is there no friendly neighborhood raticate? (Why no, there's nothing unusual about a friendly giant rat that can rip out the sidewalk, why would there be?) A news report about tentacool can't support the universe by itself.

  As others have mentioned, there's some problem with the flow. I think a large part of that is that every little thing makes Laura think of Tom for no obvious reason, but there's lots of little things too. I think you need to take care to spell out exactly how characters' thoughts lead to one another, in general, on a moment-to-moment basis. It's also good form to isolate most related exposition into distinct chunks, unless you want me to think their mind keeps going back to it. So this chapter is... kinda weak all around.

    Alright, this is the kind of feedback I was looking for :) I try to refrain from voting on comments in my posts, but I'm making an exception in this case and upvoting yours to bring more awareness to it.

    >I don't like Laura. It's sad her husband died, but that keeps interrupting her other thoughts, to the point where I'd recommend therapy. She worries about him more than she worries about Red, and she doesn't even seem have have any good thoughts about the guy!

    Good to know: I'll try to put in more redeeming qualities about her and their relationship.  I actually cut back on some of her worry about Red, because it felt like too much: clearly I didn't see how much that unbalanced things :)

    >Daisy is worse. She doesn't do anything. She just provides pages and pages of meaningless small talk.

    Hahaha.  Okay, I definitely didn't think of it that way originally, but now I can see why that would be so annoying.  You're right, she needs more presence: I'm going to overhaul the post-dinner conversation completely.

    >I'm also not really feeling the worldbuilding in this chapter. The Container is fair enough.

Either their mass-energy conversion factor is different from ours (possible, but not shown), or that actually makes the world make less sense.

    The perspective I had on it was that, if you have the ability to transmit matter to energy/data and reconstruct it into matter afterward, that the "million million megajoules of mass" is a "given." I can't really mess with that without removing one of the most singular aspects of the pokemon world.  

    But it still struck me as odd that, even if you have that data to reconstruct the molecules and cells and synapses, that the matter would come out containing exactly the same heat/energy as it did when it was copied.  Body heat, after all, is the result of our metabolism, the chemical processes by which we burn our "fuel" like sugars. Why would those processes also be frozen and resumed exactly as they had before?  Wouldn't they come out inert, which would be dangerously cold for most living things?

    So yeah. It struck me as weird, so I put it in incase anyone else wondered about it: it could be that by mentioning it I'm just drawing attention to an issue most people wouldn't even have thought of, and maybe it's unnecessary either way :)

    Yes, this was basically something I tried to do intentionally that in retrospect might have been a mistake: while obviously pokemon are going to be the subject of news and conversation, they don't have to be a part of every single social interaction, the way they are in the games and anime.  I'll probably roll this change in with the changes I make to Daisy.

    Duly noted. I'll get to editing soon, and post when it's updated. Thanks for all the great feedback!

  Feed me feedback *nom nom nom*

  Edit:

  Thanks to all the great feedback, I'm going to be doing some heavy editing of this chapter soon. I'll let you guys know when the update goes live: in the meantime keep it coming!

    Here's a tip: Go back and read through it again, this time looking for commas.

    No, it's not that you have too many of them. Or too few. Thankfully you're better than that. But, they are all being used the same way. Almost every sentence will go "Something something something**,** something something something something."

    Almost every time.

    Still a good story though.

      >Almost every sentence will go "Something something something, something something something something."

      Made me laugh out loud.  I think you've hit on another quirk of my writing from all the RP I do that I'm trying to overcome :) I'll give the chapter another read through and try to break up or streamlines sentences.

    I like it! I think it was a good way to zoom out, sort of, and show the outside view of events that our protagonists may be encountering from the inside soon.

    [edit] Also, [Mr. Fuji](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mr._Fuji). [In the games, he was](#s "held hostage by everybody's favorite villains, Good Ole Team Rocket").

  Not sure the interlude was successful.  I wasn't really interested, and the present tense writing struck me as awkward in a way it usually doesn't.  For example lines like "She doesn't want...", "She misses him.", and "["I hope everyone is hungry"], They are.".  Also, there are a few weird spots with "she'd" or "she had" where really is should probably be "she has" to fit with the present tense.  I admit that the sentences sound weird either way though.
  Some of what I perceived as boringness can be forgiven as it's clearly a foreshadowing chapter, but I think it's still worth knowing I got that impression.
