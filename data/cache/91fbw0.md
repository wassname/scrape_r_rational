  I would love to receive some feed back since this is the first time I've ever published something online and my confidense of a writer is that of a cat scruyying away from a vacuum machine. Having read WORM, Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, Pracitcal Guide to Evil... I've gotten tired of waiting for my favorite stories to churn out a new chapter, so, having been inspired by these titans of the underworld in literature, I decided to start my own story which I hope that people will enjoy (and find rational).

  Disclaimer: I have written very little narrated fiction and most of it sucked.

  I think you need to work on your writing, on a sentence structure level. I picked a lot of weird sentence flows, but here's an example:

  > I nodded, getting the materials to make it had been hard. Though only one ingredient had been only obtainable through the black market

  You're trying to pack way too much subtext in a single sentence, and as a result, you end up with a really weird-sounding line. (you have 'only' nested twice in the same clause)

  I think what you're trying to say is "The character acquired ingredients for his gift through the black market, which means the gift is valuable, and he's being very cavalier about it because he's used to breaking the law and getting stuff from the black market". The thing is, you're trying to cram that information in a forced "after the fact" fashion that sounds really annoying after a while.

  More generally, you're trying to imply way too many things at once, where explicitely saying them would be easier to read (Practical Guide also has that problem).

  A better sentence structure would be:

  "I nodded. He had reason to be impressed: gathering the ingredients to make that bread had been hard. Some of them you could only get through the black market."

  Overall, I'd give the same verdict to the whole first chapter: you're trying way too hard to be witty, you're trying to cram way too much information at once, and you're not giving enough weight to what you're writing.

  Also, you need to get way better at using commas and periods.
