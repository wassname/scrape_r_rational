  I'm glad to hear someone call out the 'politics as window dressing' thing.  Very few stories are genuinely about politics, because politics does not lend itself well to being understood as a story.  It is usually just used to set the stakes.

  Tangent on a throwaway remark, but a massive amount of American dramatic theatre plots are focused on real estate, usually as  inheritance.

  Which reminds me, has anybody ever debated presenting a rationalist story in any form other than prose?

    Some chatter about webcomics from time to time, but nothing serious that I've seen.

  Hey everyone, this episode we discuss politics as a plot device, and and political fiction as a genre. Enjoy!

  I enjoyed this. 

  Politics in fiction is often an afterthought. Political intrigue is written more like a [mystery or a "heist of information"](https://writingexcuses.com/2019/06/16/14-24-political-intrigue/).

  I'm also a fan of Bueno de Mesquita's [The Dictator's Handbook](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11612989-the-dictator-s-handbook). I'm much more sceptical of [the accuracy of his models to predict future events](http://decision-making.moshe-online.com/criticism_of_bueno_de_mesquita.html). That said, applying his rules to fiction and thinking through second order effects of your political system is a great way to make your political writing believable.
