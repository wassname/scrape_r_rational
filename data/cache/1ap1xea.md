## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  ```
  I sort of recommend [Dear Spellbook](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/49881/dear-spellbook). It's very... consistent and just solid and good. It's about Tal, a sorcerer who found an ensouled book, and uses it to pretend he's a wizard (because sorcerers are killed on sight). Later on he realizes he's in a time loop, and he writes his experiences as diary entries in the Spellbook. 

  The story goes heavy on the DnD mechanics, though without using explicit numbers. The magic system is fleshed out with the different Realms, Fonts, willpower limits, spell tiers, etc. and there's a steady progression in Tal's skill throughout the series. The main plot of the story is also revealed steadily over a long while. 

  The first book is mostly slice of life and Tal fucking around in the time loop (which is 1 day long btw), and it's only in books 2 and 3 that the characters work towards the main plot. I actually found it to be quite organic in how fucking around and finding out slowly leads Tal to the different plot hooks. It felt pretty nice to make the connections with him. Otherwise the story maintains a consistent tone that's mostly whimsical and light with some moments of seriousness.

    I'd like to de-rec this, mostly due to the narrative and style choices.

    Half of the chapters are flashbacks, while the other half are in the present time where the whole timeloop is happening. The author unfortunately didn't have the ability to make this compelling.

    This type of storytelling needs a much more experienced and talented author to pull it off, as well as extensive drafting which isn't really possible with webnovels, and even then we mostly end up with mediocre pieces of writing.  In this case, transition from present to the flashbacks is extremely jarring, and there are quite a few flashbacks that have absolutely 0 substance and contribute nothing to the plot. And on top of that, we get entire chapters dedicated to dry exposition/lore dump sprinkled throughout. 

    It would've been a tolerable read if the narrative moved linearly and there weren't flashbacks every other chapter, but I just couldn't take it midway through the first book and dropped it.

    Also, there are too many pointless monologues and exposition. Sure, it's supposed to be "slice of life", but really it's just bad writing. I don't want to read 5 paragraphs describing the marble floors in a bathhouse. A lot of authors need to read TUTBAD, so they can see what slice of life done well actually looks like. This seems to be the new trend in the webnovel scene, where authors try to excuse their inability to write immersive, coherent and tightly woven plots by just slapping the "slice of life" tag on it.

      Thing is, I love alexanderwales stuff, but I just couldn't stick with TUTBAD. Slice of life is so boring to me that I can't imagine how people like the new "slice of life" stuff, which I agree that a lot of web writers call their work to excuse their inability to focus their stories.

  Here are some stories I've enjoyed over the past few weeks.

  [Chains of a Time Loop](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/75780/chains-of-a-time-loop) \- This was posted here a few weeks back. It's only a few chapters in, but I've enjoyed it. Very similar to Mother of Learning, but I think the characters are more personable and the plot actually moves.

  [An Unclean Legacy](http://hitherby-dragons.wikidot.com/an-unclean-legacy-the-fallen-knight) \- Not very rational, but very fun and funny. I went into it not knowing what it was going to be, and I think that's the right way to do it.

  [Goblin Cave](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/54904/goblin-cave) \- Pretty rational dungeon core story. The dungeon at some point feels safe enough to start experimenting, and tries to determine the basic physics of its world. Really interesting take on what kind of world a dungeon core might exist in, with some interesting economics angles. Unfinished and likely abandoned, but it's stopped at a point that I'd consider a satisfying ending to a first book.

  [The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle](https://www.amazon.com/%C2%BD-Deaths-Evelyn-Hardcastle-ebook/dp/B07CP8YXH3) \- Kind of dark time loop mystery. Some surprising twists, along with some unsurprising ones.

  I've pretty much read everything that was recommended in these threads going about 70-80 posts back. 

  I've also read all the fics that interest me in the first 50~ pages of Royalroad's top rated section.

  I've read almost all quests that were interesting in sufficient velocity, space battles and questionable questing. I've also read a decent amount of the fics in the creative section of these forums.

  I've read a lot of translated chinese/japanese/korean novels, probably over 200.


  So, where do I even go anymore? I feel like I've read everything on the internet that I want to read.

  Am I gonna have to dive deep into the forbidden places like pony fics or glow fics?

  It has become extremely hard to find anything that I want to read.

    You go to your local library and check out 

    1: Bujold. Any and everything. 

    2: Martha Wells: Murderbot

    3: Ann Leckie: Imperial Radch

    4: Vinge. Vernor and Joan, both, really.

    5: Banks. With an M. to go with the Iain, probably not without though. 

    6: If you like humor at all, Pratchett should be available from the library in full and is just as funny as people tell you  it is. 

    7: A lot of the classics are classic for a reason. Try a couple of chapters from them and see if you like them. The libraries always have these in stock, so it's free.  

    More off the wall recs.. do you read french? Because Verne and Dumas in the Original are *masterpieces*. The most common translations of Verne are butcheries. Dumas is not treated quite so dismally by anglosphere publishers, but the original is still considerably better. 

    If you have already read all of these, we're starting to move into authors the library probably *doesn't* have. 

    Graydon Saunders can be found on google play and is some hardcore world building fantasy.
    ```

    - u/AutopoieticBeing:
      ```
      Regarding #5: Banks, there's at least one good sci-fi novel of his without the M.– Transition, set in a multiverse of dimension-hopping sliders who are part of an organisation that 'guides' the socio-economic and technological development of various realities/timelines toward what they see as beneficial outcomes.
      ```

  - u/ErinFlight:
    ```
    Do you have a library card that has Libby? There are so many good published books and if you’ve exhausted webnovels then I bet a lot of them will feel really fresh. 

    Adrian Tchaikovsky does really good “ideas” sci fi. Children of Time is a standard place to start but I also loved his novella “Elder Race”

  - u/ansible:

    There are a bunch of fanfics I sort of automatically skip over because I haven't read or even heard of the original material (manga, anime). But there are probably some good ones in there that I haven't even attempted yet.

    Maybe you can do that, pick the categories with a lot of existing fanfics, and then expand your base by reading / watching some of the original material first.

    >where do I even go anymore

    1) You can try making a list of all those read stories you've mentioned and giving a link to that list each time when asking for recs. 

    Because, from the perspective of a hypothetical someone who's about to recommend a title that you haven't read yet, it's not clear whether that title they have in mind is already inside that "pretty much everything that was recommended in these threads going about 70-80 posts back" or not. So they may just give up and not name-drop a title that would've actually been something new for you.

    2) You can also use machine / AI translation to try works which have little to no presence in the English part of the internet due to not having been translated yet. Those would mainly be Chinese, Russian, Indian, etc.

    You could try getting into translated webnovels? If the clunky prose doesn't put you off too much, after a while it reaches a point where it doesn't really bother you anymore.

    Alternatively, go consume some more original media so you can read fics of that?

    There is still more media to be consumed, but it'll be harder for you to find it. Try branching out of this subreddit, and looking for other places that offer good recommendations you like for reading/watching. 

    Also if you've gotten this far, I hope you have a nice list of the stuff that was the best, feel free to share it with us mere mortals still climbing the mountain.

    Consider video games, short/long films, TV shows, blogs, interesting forums. 

    By now you should have a bunch of ideas in your head and a belief that you can easily do better, so why not create some content too?

    Remember to come back after a while, things change and you'll find some new stuff.

  Looking for fiction like *Piranesi*, which as I understand it is in the "evocative fantasy" genre. I've already read *The Magicians*, which kind of scratched this itch for me but not really. 

  Also kind of in general looking for shorter stories, not short stories but something around 200 pages or 100,000 words would be nice. I'm looking for more tightly crafted and themed stories, rather than long dragging slowly getting better/staying the same stories. 

  Thanks!

    An obvious suggestion might be Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell. A bit on the longer side, though. 

    You could try Patricia McKillip. Her Riddlemaster series is quite good (the second book drags a bit, imo, but the third is great). I also was always fond of "The Beasts of Eld". 

    Diana Wynne Jones was pretty good for evocativeness, though a bit light on the actual world-building and story cohesion. It worked better for YA novels. Try Howles Moving Castle, maybe? 

    How do you feel about Gaiman?
    ```

    - u/gazemaize:
      ```
      Seconding Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell! Clarke also wrote a short story collection written in the same universe (The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories).

      You said no short stories, so this is cheating, but the works of Borges, who was a direct inspiration for the author of Piranesi (it's such an obvious influence that I knew it without even needing to check, but I searched it now to confirm, and sure enough it's the first thing she mentions as an influence for it). She specifically describes his stories as "jewel-like", which is apt.

      Le Guin would be my other recommendation, the Earthsea series especially.
      ```

    All unfinished except for the last one.

    [The Color of Summer](https://archiveofourown.org/works/24587365/chapters/59385853) is a semi depressing story of an insert into Naruto's twin (I know, bear with me). 
    Part of the gimmick is that the reincarnation isn't an isekaid otaku and knows nothing about Naruto. This is reality for him. A very non power fantasy reality ensues fic, with a depressed MC that hates the world he lives in.

    [The Roots that Nourish the Trees](https://archiveofourown.org/works/29094219/navigate) is a delight. Not sure how to describe the essence of it and make it justice, so I will just explain the synopsis. 
    A Danzo with a slightly different recent history decides to make the Konoha Academy less useless, starting with the canon generation just after their graduation. It's kinda like a fix fic? It's an exploration of how things can be better, how windows can be opened when we're not limited by the "this is a story" medium. Ok, mostly training and ninja stuff related. Very slow updates.

    [The Pixie of the Hidden Tree](https://archiveofourown.org/works/44908171/chapters/112994944) is a Tanya the Evil reincarnated in Naruto crossover. Not sure what much else to say. I recommend it to those not Tanya phobic, and it scratches the same optimization and better training itch as the previous ones. Liked the misunderstanding field results, very plausible stuff.

    There's Red Riot on QQ/Patreon that's pretty good. Uzumaki SI in Kiri. Unfortunately, very few public chapters posted out there, and it needs an editor, at least for the Patreon ones.

    [Sasuke Uchiha and the Power of Lies](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13472966/1/Sasuke-Uchiha-and-the-Power-of-Lies)
    This isn't 4 or less years old. This isn't rational at all. Hell, this is crack.
    This is very, very fun though. Absolutely hilarious. By the author of Seventh Horrocrux, it has a very similar style of humor, but with 90% less sociopathy. My favorite of the two. It should be recommended more often.

      I have to de-rec this, It is well written, it is rational, it does update with some regularity and some people do love it, but I found it unreadable.

      My biggest complaint is that there's this consistent feeling of QM vs players, the MC(players) wants to change the world and the world very much does **not** want to change in any positive manner. Which you could say is realistic, people in positions of power want to remain there and military dictatorships don't want to be questioned or hear about human rights, and speaking of equality in a world with S-rank ninjas is ridiculous. but it is a truly miserable experience, every time the players try to enact any kind of positive large-scale change they get absolutely dunked by characters they have no hope of fighting.

      So you end up reading a repeating cycle of think of a nice thing -> presenting that to people in authority -> getting laughed out of the meeting or told that if you bring it up again you'll get executed. Or the time our Allies, >!the pangolins!<, turned out to be evil(>!genocidal!<), that one was fun. And all of that is without even taking into account the times that players vote for something silly and then get insta-punished by the QM. It's realistic alright, but it sure as fuck is not fun.

      Then things seemed like they were about to improve when >!they got Jiraiya on their side!< and for a very short time I had actual hope for the quest, but then >!Jiraiya died!< and we went back to the status quo but worse. In the end, I stopped reading it a while ago.
      ```

      - u/ianstlawrence:
        ```
        To be fair this particular quest makes absolutely no promises of being "fun". The only promise it makes is to be as simulationist as possible in a world where people had a constant thousand year world war, and then in the course of 50 years had two world wars between villages.

        Under those circumstances, the simulationist stuff means that shit is rough, and there is no freebies. 

        I wrote a plan in that quest that got us thrown in a killbox because I put in a line that could be interpreted badly and didn't specify tone. 

        So yeah, it is tough, but man, it is very engaging if you are into it.
        ```

        - u/incamaDaddy:
          ```
          I remember that, it made me super mad when I read through it. that's exactly what I mean about it feeling like QM vs Players.
          ```

          - u/ReproachfulWombat:
            ```
            Pros: Good technical writing, a lot of content, enjoyable worldbuilding and characterisation.

            Cons: Sudden tonal shifts when switching authors, poor pacing, the aformentioned 'author vs players' mentality resulting in repetetive narrative patterns that get boring rather quickly as soon as you notice them.

            3/5. Readable, but the authors don't seem to have the ability to turn imperfect votes into a coherent narrative without having the characters all but turn to face the reader and call them morons. It feels like they'd rather draw attention to how 'stupid' the players are being than interpret the votes in anything resembling a charitable fashion. Once or twice in a quest, I can forgive this behaviour, but it's basically a running theme. As a result, nothing is stable. The MC can invent a revolutionary new technology one chapter and become the darling of the village, then say something wrong at his award ceremony and be dragged off to T&I, then save the Hokage two chapters later and have his status returned, then lose it all all over again because of some other event. It makes me feel like a YoYo, and it's exhausting. 

            This is supposed to be a rational fic, and post to post the consequences of a vote *are* rational(ish), but when you look at the overall pattern it mostly just feels like you're reading a soap-opera
