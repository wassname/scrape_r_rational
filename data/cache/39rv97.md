## You cannot create gunpowder. What invention can you offer a medieval lord that will allow him to win wars?

### Post:

This has to have direct combat applications, no "improve hygeine", you have to be able to craft one of whatever you're demonstrating and sell a medieval lord on it's usefulness. Any answer other than gunpowder. He gives you a month's access to his resources.

  Stirrups, as previously mentioned, took a surprisingly long time to become commonplace. Trebuchets and catapults and other siege weaponry, if before their invention/introduction.

  I know a bit about steelmaking, metallurgy, and materials; superior blades may be possible, but I doubt that I'd have time to get a significant enough improvement to a local blacksmith inside of a single month to impress significantly - lacking all scientific instruments and books about cooling curves and phase diagrams of steel and working solely from memory of martensite and pearlite and so forth, I doubt my skill would be sufficient to make something truly impressive with no modern tools or equipment and no books, in a single month. Modern metallurgy is significantly more advanced than medieval metallurgy, but getting it working in time seems unlikely.

  If I happened to be lucky enough to have an alchemist or other guy who knew how to make to make aqua fortis (nitric acid), I could quite conceivably make nitrocellulose (guncotton) to work around the gunpowder restriction? This feels like cheating; also, not entirely sure how to make aqua fortis ab initio myself, so likely to be screwed by the starting conditions - and furthermore I'd like as not blow myself up.

  If the medieval lord was allowing us to abandon whatever notions of chivalry, honor, etc. most concern him, a ghillie suit might be possible and a little useful for skirmishers and guerrilla warfare.

  If in an era that prizes cavalry, perhaps invent the pike formation? If in one that prizes men at arms in pike formations, well, I don't think introducing and training in longbow use is practical in the time allotted, and probably wouldn't be a real new invention?

  I could conceivably introduce improved armor - it took a long time to get to full plate armor in reality, and that stuff would be pretty useful. That said, as a non-blacksmith trying to teach blacksmiths how to make something I've never worn or had personal experience with this seems... unlikely to work out well.

      Even if it were restricted to roads, and I don't think it necessarily would be, it would still be far faster than normal travel. And it would probably be possible to give scouts more robust bikes that allowed them to travel over rough terrain.

        they're a lot cheaper now, but you won't have mass production in your world. Just a bunch of confused blacksmiths, no tyres, a huge metal weight, chains that would break down pretty quickly, and it could carry less weight than a horse or an ox could. Maybe modern bikes could be more useful, but you won't be able to set up all the engineering, supply chain and materials that you need, before the king loses confidence in you.

          It's actually possible to make one entirely out of wood, and I think that if he were willing to let me collaborate with some of his craftspeople I'd be able to come up with something more workable for the time. The earliest bicycles were made entirely out of wood and iron.

      You don't have to feed a bicycle, there's much less maintenance, you don't need a team of specialists to maintain them, maintenance costs are far lower.

      On the con side they're less effective in direct combat (though that wouldn't be a problem if you're only using them to transport troops) and your initial costs might be a little higher before you begin mass production.

    Bicycles would be hard, I think.  However tricycles would be far easier, and could carry more weight.

    Just think of an army of soldiers on their Green Machines!

    Seriously though, a tricycle would be easier.  An extra wheel for better balance and more weight distribution, the center of mass can be lower.  Easier to train soldiers to ride them.  The pedals can be mounted directly to the front wheel instead of some complex pedal mechanism.

    I specifically mention the Green Machine because it is steered with two columns attached to shafts, connected in turn to a solid axle, rather than a floating wheel

  *There's nothing really revolutionary left*. Let me go down the list of technologies that have *actually* revolutionized military doctrine (that is, *actually* let people win wars):

  * Gunpowder: out.
  * Longbow: irreducible crafting time >10 years (seasoned wood, training).
  * General staff: no way in hell am I going to be able to convince a lord to give up direct control over his unit.
  * Hygiene: out.
  * Railroad: no direct combat applications.
  * Radio: useless without general staff.
  * Internal combustion engine: can't craft that in a month.
  * Precision machining techniques: no direct combat applications.

  If you're willing to let me cheat, then I'm going to skate by on a technicality: gunpowder already exists, I just need to make it practical!

  * Built-up and wire-wrapped barrel constructions
  * Rifling bench
  * Shells, sabots
  * Mortars
  * Leadscrews
  * Ballistics mathematics
  * Surveying equipment/techniques
  * Field and split carriages
  * Powder bags
  * Interrupted-screw breech blocks
  * Time fuzes
  * Minie ball, wadding
  * Brass cartridges
  * Bolt action
  * Mercury fulminate percussion caps
  * Use of ceramics or lead in powder mills so you can use ball mills or edge mills instead of mortar and pestle which in turn means your powder is way more consistent and reliable

    Gunpowder isn't the only thing you can use to power a crude projectile weapon.  Alcohol will work quite nicely for Arquebus-style weapons or cannon analogs.

    Sickness and starvation in the field need not only be addressed by 'hygiene'  Better food preservation will address both of these issues, and allow larger stockpiles of food to resist siege.

  > no "improve hygeine"

  Oh.

  Well, in that case I have to cheat with Wikipedia (if I'm just using my native knowledge, I'm boned, since I couldn't do much more than teach math and logic). However, if I'm allowed to prepare some knowledge ahead of time:

  * If it's early enough, the **stirrup** apparently allows a cavalry to hit a lot harder from horseback. **Horseshoes** allow travel over rocky terrain. The **horse collar** allows for the use of draught horses, which can travel faster than oxen, meaning better supply lines. These all fall under the general heading of "cavalry".

  * I think I might be able to figure out how an **astrolabe** works, and maybe how to build one. This is general navigation, so maybe falls outside the bounds of "direct combat", but I have a hard time imagining that a medieval general wouldn't see the naval applications. Same with some ship-building techniques that I might be able to learn up on and present.

  * In the sphere of **architecture** I might be able to offer some advice on better building techniques in order to improve castle defenses, or point out methods of siege assault. But that's not my area of expertise either.

  But again, that's me cheating with Wikipedia, and I almost certainly wouldn't be able to even *instruct* someone to craft any of those things without a week of study (ideally in the modern world). I'm hoping this answer is still better than just saying, "Nope, I'm fucked".

    Introductory biological warfare is actually pretty easy - and would go perfectly with refusing to improve hygiene.  But I try to be a scientist who thinks about should as well as can, so... no way.  I've also turned down some nice offers for Defense jobs due to pacifism, so really direct combat technologies are out.

    Telecommunications.  Start with Heliograph techniques, which were good enough for the British Empire in India, and try to move up to radio.  Something which has clear military uses even on a tactical scale, but really shines for civilian applications.

    Not going to be particularly useful without a general staff. Remember, up until Berthier invented the general staff (literally right before Napoleon took over) armies were *at most* as big as one guy could shout at, and it's going to be almost impossible to convince a medieval lord to give that up. There's a reason the general staff went out of vogue when the Romans went away and didn't come back until the French Revolution.
    ```

    - u/Pluvialis:
      ```
      What's a general staff and why would a medieval lord not want it and why did they go out of vogue?
      ```

      - u/Vebeltast:
        ```
        You know how armies have things like squads and battalions and lieutenants and captains and generals? That's the general staff. You have units, which are directly commanded by low-grade officers that are coordinated by higher-grade officers up to the Person In Charge. Every officer know what's going on at their level and the level above and - critically - has enough power and permission to make decisions that they can move their troops around to cover problem spots or take advantages when they see them. That's huge. That means that your Person In Charge doesn't have to worry about giving orders to 100-person blocks of soldiers and can concentrate on their strategy and ordering around tens of thousands of guys at a time. That means that decisions like "pincer now" can be made by a person closer to the action, which means those decisions will be more accurate and generally better. That means that individual soldiers have someone that they can trust to know what's going on and that can recover the situation when things start going badly, which is a huge morale boost.

        Part of the reason the Romans were so dominant, militarily, is because they had this working. Centuries, Cohorts, Legions. They could delegate because they had a professional military and trained special-purpose officers and could trust each other.

        Feudal lords couldn't delegate because there wasn't enough trust going around for it to work. Lords couldn't be trusted to handle maneuvers because they'd either screw them up or abandon the plan in a glorious charge or just plain backstab their king or the lord next door. Soldiers were conscripts or militia and couldn't be convinced to follow orders except from the single person on the field with the highest rank. As a result, the size of your army was basically limited by how loud your king could shout. Anything larger would dissolve into chaos because people weren't getting orders they could trust.
        ```

        - u/Pluvialis:
          ```
          Cool. How did the Romans generate trust then?
          ```

          - u/Vebeltast:
            ```
            The Romans maintained a permanent, professional army. Roman legionaries enlisted for 25 years of service and were highly trained. Centurions were generally promoted from the ranks after several years of service and were required to be literate. Only the very highest ranks were political appointments; the rest were merit promotions up a hierarchy, commanding successively more important centuries and cohorts. Roman soldiers often spent decades fighting with the same comrades and officers. Furthermore, the permanent position meant that Roman soldiers could drill and practice and confer institutional knowledge, which meant they could actually do things like "produce and refine an infantry doctrine over the course of generations and practice it until every legionary knew it". [That infantry doctrine itself was *damn* impressive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_infantry_tactics). I can't really summarize it, but it depended heavily on the soldiers executing it trusting each other to cover weaknesses and to step in at the right time or switch out at the right time. Lots of well-ordered rotations, lots of shield-your-buddy-while-he-stabs, lots of "hold here and wait for the flank to pincer".

  Short term: Telescopes and simple two-part ciphers. You work closely with a glassmaker to create a telescope. Then, you create a medieval PGP key encryption method. The major leaders all have a single page representing their key (given at some banquet), with an instructional manual telling their scribes how to use it. Then later on any message sent to those generals will be guaranteed to be accurate. Those two inventions together will give the lord a better scouting force, and the ability to reliably order his lords at a distance without worrying about enemies stealing their orders mid-transit.

  Long term: Crop rotation techniques. Even simple 4 field crop rotation techniques increase the per-acre yield about 100% over early medieval farming techniques. Peasants who produce twice as much grain can afford to pay twice as many taxes. A lord with twice as much money per-acre is going to have a very easy time raising an army to fight his wars. Coffers win wars, when it comes down to it, though there are exceptions to any rule.

  Signal flags, signal towers, and some type of variant of morse code.  I don't know morse code, but I know how it works.

  Also, food preservation methods.  Boiling and wax-sealing clay containers would allow for better ability to store foods against siege, and better ability to keep men fed in the field with less death due to spoilage.

  If the lord was progressive enough, I might try to teach the concept of the assembly line, and uniform components for making things like arrows, spears, and simpler armor pieces.

  Also, potato cannons.  Fueled by the purest alcohol I could manage.  They can be made man-portable.  Flint and steel igniter should be possible.  A wire connected to a piece of steel, which is jerked, forcing the steel to impact the flint inside the tube, igniting the alcohol.

  Without increasing manufacturing you aren't going to achieve much.

  An intelligent and informed person at best will be able to improve steel quality if he has the right knowledge.

  Even if you have specialized knowledge you wouldn't be able to translate it that well through medieval means.

  The best advantage is simple knowing what is achievable and having a modern mentality.

  The scientific method,list of advantage and disadvantage, Assembly line batching.

  The problems like paper, cloth, food preservation, information flow, energy,research and education represent and know that it is the major limits of that world stopping progress.

  The most devastating you could be with modern knowledge would probably be thorough chemistry and biology for WW1 like weapons of mass destruction if your protagonist is a complete psychopath and irredeemably evil by all definitions.

  With better steel and some oil you can motorize stuff as well as other machines.

  I just had a really nasty thought.  Chemical weapons.  Having your infantry skirmishers carry glass bottles full of ammonia OR bleach.

  Squads carrying ammonia are separated from squads carrying bleach.  They work as paired squads.  Ammonia-throwers and bleach throwers concentrate on standard bearers or other clearly identifiable targets.

  Splash-mixing of ammonia and bleach in the middle of an enemy will break up an attacking formation rather quickly.

  That's the crudest effective chemical weapon I can think of (other than fire, which our lord probably already knows about.)

  I'd gather all his blacksmiths and their spare metal (using plate metal too if I have to), and have them build personnel "tanks" out of metal. This would basically be a dome, about the size of an SUV, with slits through which archers could shoot with their longbows. It would also have a great many spears (entirely metal) welded to the tank's shell and pointed outward in all directions, like a hedgehog, to prevent enemy melee from getting too close, thereby allowing those within to choose their targets. The 'tank's shell will also protect its underbelly (one can only exit the tank when the door is unlocked by those within). Each 'tank' would fit 4-6 longbowmen (very cramped) and have a thousand arrows stockpiled (very very cramped). And yes, this would cost a *lot* of metal. 

  Basically an invulnerable mobile tower at ground level, from which longbowmen could mow down enemy soldiers - even the most well-protected ones without putting themselves in any risk. Given how well protected they would be and the fact that longbowmen could fire shots extremely quickly, a line of such tanks along the front line could be both devastating and demoralizing. And they'd be able to clunk forward should the enemy, afraid of such a contraption, decide to break ranks.

  I feel like there are a lot of military strategies that could be effectively employed in the middle ages, but unfortunately, I highly doubt a foreigner with no actual combat experience could convince them to put me in charge. Reserve troops, guerilla warfare, and information warfare as broad general concepts would all be game-changers. (Reserve troops would be particularly hard given the use of looting as an incentive.)

  No hygiene? Well then, I suppose we could take a different direction, and employ biological warfare.

  I'd just rattle off a list of every medieval-level technology I could think of. Communication was horrid back then, and just because a Spanish lord was telling all his friends about this cool new siege engine doesn't mean that British sappers would know how to make them. As soon as I hit one that no one in the castle could identify even with drawings and descriptions, I'd consider the viability and start begging the house carpenters and blacksmiths for a crash course in medieval prototyping.
