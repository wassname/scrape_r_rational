## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  Imagine a timer which, when held, displays the date on which the holder will die. Works only on human beings. 

  All attempts to avoid dying on the provided date meet with failure. Refuse to go on a dangerous mission, a car accident kills you instead. Try to shoot yourself a day early and the gun misfires. 

  I've been thinking about trying to write an SCP about this item. What are some non-obvious things you could do with it? 

  Keep in mind that a lot of bad things could happen to you short of death. Jumping off a building while shouting "I am invincible!" (because the timer has told you will not die today) might land you in an excruciatingly painful near-death state.

    You might be interested in [Machine of Death](http://machineofdeath.net/ebook), which has a (somewhat) similar premise.

      Thanks. I definitely need to read that.

    Sending people with long lifespans on a one way trip to Mars. They can't die, so they must discover alien life or something.

    That or the rocket fails to get them to Mars. But how could it? If the rocket explodes, they die, so that can't happen. Especially if you surround the rocket launch zone with a bunch of people with long lifespans too. With enough of them, the improbability of finding life on Mars should become less than the improbability of a rocket refusing to launch several times in a row without killing any of the several fragile people in incredibly precarious positions.

      Keep in mind that the machine can manipulate future events but not past events.  If there is life on Mars, there has been life on Mars for a long time, and if there isn't life on Mars, there hasn't been life on Mars for a long time and the machine can't retroactively magic it into existence.  The most it could do is convince aliens to stop by Mars at exactly that right time.

      However, I think it's more likely that the machine would cause all of the astronauts to get diarrhea on the day of the launch or get hit by a car and break a leg, or something.  The rocket doesn't have to be the thing that fails.

        This reminds me of the drink in hpmor that causes them to spit/spray it.  Good point.

    I mean for one it's pretty trivial to hook up any number of complex systems designed to kill somebody unless a given event happens. All you need to do is ensure the likelihood of your system failing is less than the likelihood of the thing you're trying to force to occur.

    So with a reliable enough method you can definitely leverage the future to a staggering degree with many, many probability pumps.

    Robert Heinlein's [Life-Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-Line) (full text available [at Baen's site](http://www.baen.com/Chapters/0743471598/0743471598___2.htm)), features such a machine. IIRC the story talks about how it would affect insurance companies.

    There are a bunch of questions that such device would raise, for example:

    * What's the precision of the information?
    * How does it work wrt human constructs of date/time (e.g. leap seconds, time zones)?
    * How does it work wrt time dilation effects?
    * Where does the energy to prevent the early deaths or ensure the timely deaths comes from?
    * What does death mean? Can the dead person be later resurrected? Could the dead be cryopreserved and thawed later on or they would be dead forever?
    * What counts as human beings? What would it show for people that are already brain dead?

    We can probably get FTL communication out of it, maybe even free energy and entropy reversal, depending on how it behaves.

    If you ever needed to destroy it, you just hand it to Dr. Bright.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Because it's impossible to tell if a person was *always* going to die on the date given, or if giving them the device sets their death in stone, the entire O-5 council is in agreement that under no circumstances should Dr. Bright be given the device, lest it force an XK-class end of the world scenario (or higher) to ensure Bright's demise.

    Reminds me of [988](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-988) a little. I think I actually prefer this idea, it has that extra little morbid flair

  In response to /u/vi_fi's work, and my response to it.  Spoilers for the latest chapter of [The Library Unpublished](http://archiveofourown.org/works/11539230/chapters/27124041)

  > 36) I woke up hungover and disoriented. It was raining outside. I wondered what... oh shoot, Sein was in the library and I needed to... I had already been to the library? My memory was a disoriented mess of fragments and I seemed to recall dying multiple times, being brainwashed by a cult, and obtaining near omnipotence at the expense of losing my ability/interest to return to ordinary reality. The most recent memory was accepting my own death in an attempt to avoid suffering. Worse yet, my thoughts felt off, as though they were being generated by a different source than usual. I checked the time and the date... had I not even left to rescue Sein yet? Well, assuming I wasn't insane, I think I knew the "winning" strategy, save for the fact that the chance of self-modifying would become addictive. The "winning" ending also seemed to have made a logical error... Sein had somehow been able to get text out the library so it wasn't true that I couldn't take anything out. I just needed to restrict what I wanted to take out to a single book bags worth (and avoid a runaway feedback loop of self-modification). It would also help to write into existence a useful book to use ahead of time. I had just the idea... I could make a reddit post and get munchkining ideas for the best books to take out. The post's responses itself would be sufficient to write books into existence.

  And the rules for those that don't plan on reading it:

  > After a few minutes of writing and a few hours of searching, as my books did not turn up in the Index, I had established some ground rules. The Library had a very specific notion of what counted as a book. Books made of non-typical materials were out, as were sentient books, magic books and (sadly) rocket launcher books. However, books with information that was unknown to me were possible, as were books with subtle but mundane effects. For example, implementing something like the King in Yellow wouldn't have been possible by stating it to be magic, but stating it to be a particularly maddening and insidious piece of poetry was possible. After all, even something as innocuous as Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werther had driven people to suicide.

    Sorry to joss this. The actual ending 36) has been posted now; it was a simple editing mistake.

    In case any of you still want to munchkin this, you have both my blessing and my enthusiastic attention. u/scruiser, I will remember you as the first one to write fanfic of something I have written :)
