## The Seventh Tower Book One Prologue

### Post:

I've decided to narrate one of my favorite childhood series as it doesn't have an audiobook or ebook available online, other than pirating a poorly done ebook series. This is a warm up to narrating Pokemon: Origin of the Species, if I don't fuck up narrating too horribly.

I would like some feedback on my first blind read through, as we have many people in this community who do podcasts and narrations themselves.

Some disclaimers:

Still learning about how to use Audacity and editing within it. Have yet to get a sound mixer. Also I recorded this while getting over a strep infection because if I didn't start I would never get around to it.

  Oh man, I loved those books as a kid. And never finished them, I believe. I don't usually do audiobooks but I'll give this a listen.

  Whoa, props to you for doing this!

  I auditioned the opening minute or two, a couple paragraphs in the middle, and the last couple minutes. Here are some thoughts, in order of significance:

  1. Your enunciation is quite clear to me. There's a little room for improvement but I think it wouldn't be a high priority to do so.

  2. Your pacing is very stable! This is good, except where it may detract a little bit from dramatism/emphasis. I'd absolutely prefer to err on the side of steady, so great job here too!

  3. As suggested above, you could use some more dramatic tone/dynamic shifts; the recording is a little monotone.

  4. I think the slight amount of *timbre* change I heard at the end (for the shadow?) was good, and sufficient in magnitude. If you're good at the latter, feel free to expand on it, but I don't think that's necessary.

  5. This one's fairly minor, but I noticed a difference in volume between the middle and the end; this is a slight editing or mic placement/usage issue, and may not be of significant impact. It's *maybe* enough to make someone want to adjust the volume on their device while listening, which isn't great.

  6. On the subject of editing, I noticed a slight jump in the last minute or two where you either stumbled or perhaps edited two cuts together a bit too suddenly. This is also quite minor.

  Overall, great job! This sample is far better than I could expect from this context!

  Is this a rational story? A little confused.

    No. This is not rational at all. It's just a story I enjoyed. I know there's been a clamor for a Pokemon: the Origin of Species audiobook and I want to do that. 

    But I dont want to mess it up, not having done audio narration before. So Im doing this and posted it here looking for critiques.

    I trust this community's judgment on quality. I didnt really know how to label it or where to post it otherwise.

        Fair enough. I'll post any further chapters there

  I don't listen to audiobooks, but here are two quick comments as follow up from my mic recommendation. Mostly, I would suggest fixing whatever is causing the background noise in the first 2:50. The audio quality improves a lot after. Mic position and background noise matters quite a lot to overall sound with any mic. Second, https://www.audacityteam.org/download/.

  - u/SkyTroupe:
    ```
    Yes I had a fan going on for those first few minutes of recording. I turned it off afterwards and that's probably what that is.

    I'm an idiot and wrote audible instead of audacity in my post. Thanks for helping me figure that out lol
