  For fun, here's another bundle deal on books from [Story Bundle](https://storybundle.com/ai) with a theme on Artificial Intelligence. However, I haven't bought and read those books yet, so I don't know if they are good enough for a recommendation here. So try them at your own (monetary) risk.

  Sanderson is the one who made the Laws about well-defined magic systems with rules, right? Sufficiently Analyzed Magic type stuff?
  ```

    ```
    Sanderson's Laws of Magic:

    1. An author's ability to solve conflict with magic is DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL to how well the reader understands said magic.
    2. The limitations of a magic system are more interesting than its capabilities. What the magic can't do is more interesting than what it can.
    3. A brilliant magic system for a book is less often one with a thousand different powers and abilities -- and is more often a magic system with relatively few powers that the author has considered in depth.

    ```
    Not so much magical science, as a dedication to magic as an element of worldbuilding rather than an arbitrary tool to drive along the plot.
