  Poor guy.

  I went back through the conversation in Chapter 20 and there wasn't any candle flickering. So, everyone was either being honest up to that point in the conversation or they had taken "the regular precautions."

  My Questions:

  * Did Horry really cast the lie detecting spell on the alcove?
  * If so, how did he cast it without a wand?
  ```

  - u/fawnmod:
    ```
    Re point 2: this is what is referred to, in the business, so to speak, as a “plot hole”.

    (Pretend Horbid gave Horry a book that could one-time-cast the spell, which is how I’ll edit this)
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      On the other hand, if Harry wasn't looking for a candle flickering, he wouldn't notice it. If you're in a drafty room with a candle having a conversation, do you notice every time the candle flickers?
      ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        Who's Harry?
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          it's Horry's fake name, he introduced himself to  Romb and the-one-with-the-unrememberable-name
          ```

- u/None:
  ```
  We got that resolved, at least.
  ```

- u/Frommerman:
  ```
  That was interesting. If all the other mysteries have solutions that confusing, I look forward to this.
  ```
