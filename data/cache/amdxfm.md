  That background image of thin white lines on black is awful. Every time I scroll, the non-zero refresh rate of the monitor makes the sides flicker irregularly, it's very unpleasant to look at.

  So, is Will controlling Rose's body as Rose is doing other things? The classroom scene was confusing to me.

  Also, did the Wind metaphor get mentioned at any other point? I found myself going back a chapter to see if I missed one, but don't remember reading anything about wind.

    Thank you for the feedback! I'm sorry for the confusion. I think both of these points were worth minor editions.

    1. Yes. I think it's a bit too cheeky, and added a sentence to clarify further: *[Carol] studied the body's mannerisms as it continued typing, but could find no tells that would have indicated that the dragon was being possessed by Will instead of Rose.*

    2. In chapter 4 I used the words "storms" and "waterfalls", but it was only one paragraph, so I edited the part in chapter 5 to be more clear: *That morning, [Carol] had made a small breakthrough in the use of a metaphor of turbulent fluids — like storms or waterfalls — to explain the white noise, but for the rest of the day she had failed to make noticeable progress in discerning the meaning of her newfound sense.*
    ```

  Great progress! Finally got around to read the newest chapter. I really like Carols involvement with elements outside the focused group, like her professor or now her parents etc... it actually shows this is not only fun and games but gives a more realistic tone to her actions and background. 

  Sure the discussions about how this will impact earth are interesting but her interactions with friends/familie outside the college will be even more so ... could see a lot of possible conflict potential , if lets say Will is away and she could replace him for a interview for Rose , but must therefore give up her privacy , and has to think about the impact on her life etc...  or if she gets the opportunity to write and publish a unique paper.

  Just found this and I am really enjoying this so far. 

  A mailing list or something similar to subscribe to updates would be great though, I fear loosing this in the bookmarks folder for a year at some point x.x

  Finally got around to reading the whole thing, great stuff even if it is still early days in the story.

  The part when he talked about one bit of communication kind of felt like she gave up trying to explain it too soon, would have been better to explain that to her it feels like a radio but not perfectly tuned, so she can feel or send *a* signal, but it's like static, and that Rose is sure that this is natural and she'll gradually tune in over time.

  When you get another chapter, I would suggest crossposting to a few other places. the story could easily fit in over at /r/HFY for example.
