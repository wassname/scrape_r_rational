  That ending. Well, this certainly shows the necessity of planning for unknown unknowns, and vindicates those who distrusted Silverlake.
  ```

  - u/Seyt77:
    ```
    I doubt anyone ever trusted silverlake fully from all the hints since her introduction on how evil she can be. She literally sent zorian to his death for his first mission and took the salamander free of charge the first time he met him.
    ```

    - u/AKAAkira:
      ```
      That was less about being evil and more about being an ass, I think. Still, she was always pragmatic without regard to morals, so this chapter was definitely something one could have seen coming.

      But I wonder if she feels like she owes Kael and Kana something significant enough to help them from the Ibasan invasion. That's pretty much the only sentimental response we've ever seen out of her.
      ```

      - u/Seyt77:
        ```
        Doubt it as the first time she met Kael, she ignored him outright in favor for Alanic. I wonder if zorian is gonna stay behind to do some training to deal with silverlake. Or even if they can escape at all since pla said they cannot escape without his help. Still they answers who helped red robe get out since many thought it was the lich who assisted red robe in escaping the loop.

        Edit: I feel like silverlake would kidnap kana if she had a chance to.
        ```

        - u/AKAAkira:
          ```
          > she ignored him outright in favor for Alanic

          And *that* was more about her just not recognizing Kael in between the years they haven't seen each other. It was mentioned in chpt 83 that she recognized him since and tried talking to him. Though I can definitely see her outright kidnapping Kana.

          Also, I don't think Panaxeth helped Red Robe for the majority of the loops - if it was capable of editing temporary markers into permanent ones, it'd be doing a whole lot more muck-ups. And it probably couldn't contact Red Robe until he was good enough to access the room with the Controller. At least until that point, Quatach-Ichl is still the most likely one to have helped Red Robe.
          ```

          - u/banemage42:
            ```
            Why would silverlake kidnap kana? Must have missed something
            ```

            - u/MagicwaffIez:
              ```
              When zorian first met silverlake, he explained how he knew kael and what happened to his family, and most importantly, that he had a *daughter*. It didn't get brought up again because zorian likely didn't have thst conversation again... But the reason silverlake tried to make amends with kael, was to get him to let her teach kana.

              Ch 28:
              >"Then I would like you to deliver a message to him," she said. "It's nothing urgent, but I want him to know… that I regret how our last meeting ended and that I would very much like it if he came to visit me with his daughter sometime in the future. Oh, and that I want to teach his daughter the secrets of my magic. She is a descendant of a proud line of witches stretching back to time immemorial, and it is her birthright to continue it… should she want to. Got all that?"
              ```

    - u/Roxolan:
      ```
      > She literally sent zorian to his death for his first mission

      Only if he was very foolish (by her standards) or very desperate. It was more of a fuck-off-and-don't-bother-me-again mission.

      That does mean she stole his labour with no intention of actually helping him out. But that's the height of her confirmed on-screen evil. (Which is why Z&Z willingly associated with her.)
      ```

  - u/AngryEdgelord:
    ```
    I was honestly surprised that Zorian rejected Panaxeth's offer so quickly. I'd figure he'd at least consider it and maybe try to haggle for something looser. Being able to work on breaking through to the time loop by messing with it from the outside might easier then trying to break out of it from the inside.

    &#x200B;

    Who knows, maybe Silverlake will do just that and begrudgingly lend some aid from the outside.
    ```

- u/Yes_This_Is_God:
  ```
  WHAT A TWIST

  Though to be fair, Silverlake was always portrayed as a self-obsessed schemer. 

  Do you think Red Robe is actually dead? It would feel like a bit of a let down, but Silverlake as the Big Bad could also work. Her character has been given a lot of development and we know she's a fearsome opponent, even without the assistance of a primordial.
  ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    I kind of think RR would be a let down of a final opponent anyways. He's no match for Zach in combat and couldn't even subdue Zorian effectively. If they came across him now, he wouldn't even know to have QI for backup, and it would be the shortest fight in the story possibly including the encounter with the Eye beast.

    I don't think he's dead, since that wouldn't allow for any resolution to who he is. Panexeth may have made the same deal with him, but RR probably did leave the loop, because the gate was barred.
    ```

    - u/notagiantdolphin:
      ```
      Chances are he'll be built up as a bit of a 'dragon' - told by Panaxeth somehow to help Silverlake, his new and more effective servant. A lot of talking, followed by ZZ ignoring him entirely with the level of development they've achieved and being confused as to why he's still there while they're doing something else.
      ```

    - u/Gr_Cheese:
      ```
      > since that wouldn't allow for any resolution to who he is.

      Wasn't "who" answered? It was the Veyers kid, he's soulwiped in the current loop. And why he wouldn't take the primordial's offer? Dunno, seems like he should/would have.
      ```

      - u/sicutumbo:
        ```
        He's soulwiped, but they said that that wasn't conclusive. He's the most likely candidate, but even if that's true it doesn't answer how he did what he did. He apparently modified the temporary marker within 6 months of receiving it, as a mediocre mage, when Z&Z couldn't given a full year and almost unlimited resources? How would Zach have even had access to the crown? Too many big questions without any ability to answer them if he is actually dead.
        ```

        - u/Gr_Cheese:
          ```
          You're right, it doesn't really sit well with me either. But the only rational and reasonable way those questions could be answered, with things as they stood prior to RR's death, involved Zorian mind-jacking the equivalent of a Villain's Monologue from RR. 

          That... wouldn't really be satisfying either, in my opinion. 

          RR bailed too early. He was never enough of a threat. His mystique kind of lost importance after Z&Z could take on Quatach-Ichl. The mystery stopped mattering.

          Silverlake is a compromise, but it's one I can live with.
          ```

          - u/Chayim47:
            ```
            I think RR leaving was logical and an important part of the novels progression.

            It’s on you if you don’t think the mystery matters.

            RR was able to shrug off an entire Aranean ambush while still being weak to psychics. I think his identity and motives are going to be an important part of the final arc.

            *edit* 

            If Red Robe is a Red Herring it’d make me laugh.
            ```

            - u/sicutumbo:
              ```
              Did he have Mind Blank on? He's not a bad mage obviously, and it isn't an extremely difficult spell to cast. It would only make sense to cast it when going against an Aranean web, and then to drop it when you want to probe someone's memories.
              ```

      - u/Luck732:
        ```
        I really don't think it was Veyers, I find it more likely that RR is the lawyer that Veyers is rooming with.
        ```

        - u/Gr_Cheese:
          ```
          And that the lawyer just got pissed off with having to deal with this obnoxious Veyers kid at the start of every restart so he "soul killed" him?

          That would be pretty funny
          ```

          - u/Luck732:
            ```
            I think the lawyer was introduced to Zach by Veyers, after all we know (from the very chapter we meet the lawyer) that Zach talked to a bunch of lawyers about his guardian's thievery.

            This is why RR soulkilled Veyers and wiped Zach's memory of him, RR didn't want Zach to ever come looking for him again.
            ```

    - u/summersss:
      ```
      Yeah the big bad can be handled easily in a straight fight. Its the resources they are bringing to bear that is the problem. That's what I like about the story, its not just slash and smash.
      Uncovering the mystery, finding the enemy and stooping the their plots is the hard part.
      ```

      - u/sicutumbo:
        ```
        I am curious as to how they plan to stop the invasion in the real world. They did so in the past by accident when they launched the frontal assault to get the gate, but I don't recall any specific efforts towards diffusing the invasion without such an attack. There's also the issue that the real invaders will be able to call on demons and other spirits for backup, which they obviously can't account for while in the loop.
        ```

        - u/turtleswamp:
          ```
          Zorian managed a tactical defeat of the invasion with a sabotage campaign run by the Araena before he was collaborating with Zack. That's what led to RR deciding to leave the loop.

          If anything it'd be easier to reproduce that outside the loop as that was before Zorian and Zack learned the vast majority of the valuable information and skills they now possess, and even assuming RR made it out, he did so with hugely outdated knowledge of Z&Z's capabilities (they weren't even collaborating at that time). 

          &#x200B;

          Prior to Silverlake's defection the invasions would have been pretty easily dealt with. 

          &#x200B;
          ```

  - u/Nepene:
    ```
    Probably. It wouldn't need to make a deal with Silverlake unless it didn't have an existing mortal agent, and it didn't seem that deceptive. They had enough people that they'd have likely made multiple deals if that was their goal.

    That said, the original Red Robes is likely alive in the real world.
    ```

  - u/CrimzonNoble:
    ```
    Is RR really dead? I mean, at first, I interpreted Panaxeth's statement as RR dying because he didn't agree, but when I reread it, I saw it as Panaxeth saying that RR only managed to get out because he agreed to the deal.
    ```

    - u/Yes_This_Is_God:
      ```
      oh damn good point
      ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    Don't forget that Silverlake has been studying Panaxeth's prison for many years. She's uniquely suited to freeing it.
    ```

  - u/spanj:
    ```
    Is Silverlake really that difficult of an opponent though? Let’s assume she is just as difficult of a fighter as QI. Zorian and Zach alone were enough to obliterate his mental defense.

    Silverlake has previously stated that should her mental defenses be violently crushed, she had set up a self destruct switch in which her mind would collapse. Crush her mental defenses and she’s as good as a vegetable.

    As an aside, everyone’s existential crisis could be avoided if Silverlake kills all the original individuals in the real world. Though why she would go after them is something that you would probably have to reach for...
    ```

    - u/Ozryela:
      ```
      Fuck. 

      Zorian said 70% chance they could get out by taking over their originals, 30% by physical exit.

      Their originals are as good as dead. Silver lake will certain my kill them. 

      Well, if she has time for that. The time loop runs in compressed time. It's possible they'll exit seconds after her.
      ```

    - u/Seyt77:
      ```
      If she is smart, she would pair up with the lich same as red robe and the three of them combined knowledge would be scary as they only wish to release the primordial. Z & Z need to make a choice either attempt to leave this restart or stay and try to squeeze everything they can from the restarts.
      ```

    - u/MagicwaffIez:
      ```
      Well taiven's existential crisis is silly. She dies close to the beginning of the loop if no one interferes. So do alanic and Lukav for that matter. And zorian dies at the end of the month anyway~

      As for avoiding existential crisis's in general, they can't get out without silverlake, Zorian said as much this chapter. So all the temporary loopers are going to lose their memories.

      I'm kind of glad actually. The ramifications of so many loopers would put targets on zach and zorian's backs. A lot of these people aren't really *that* trustworthy. Especially daimen's team.
      ```

      - u/The_Magus_199:
        ```
        Personally, I feel like they’re basically doomed by the fact that we skipped over the whole five loops; we actually have more knowledge of and investment in baseline Taiven than in looper!Taiven, at this point.

        (That said, I could still see Zorian pulling out some sort of memory packet gambit to come up with a way to basically merge them all with their outside-the-loop versions.)
        ```

  - u/Chayim47:
    ```
    I wonder what Silverlake’s deal is? You don’t get that paranoid without getting back stabbed a couple of times.
    ```

- u/I-want-pulao:
  ```
  Oh fuck.

  That's actually a really good twist with Red Robe not mattering at all. (Unless Panaxeth is lying which is a possibility). Silverlake is a fundamentally greedy person, she has a lot of information, and she already wants to work with Quatach Ichl. Now she has to, to make sure the invasion succeeds, or at least the primordial escapes. 

  What a cliffhanger though.
  ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    I think Panaxeth has to be lying. The gate was barred when Z&Z first entered the gate. If RR didn't leave, that means that the gate is barred by default, which doesn't make sense. I am highly doubtful that RR managed to get all the Key pieces without Zach noticing, so the gate was probably unbarred at some point without the Key. If RR didn't leave, why would the gate be barred, because Panaxeth has no motivation to do it, unless he was lying about being unable to transport people to the real world when the gate is barred as well. So RR probably did leave, which barred the gate.
    ```

    - u/vallar57:
      ```
      Yes, that sounds like the most logical order of events. But how does it translate into Panaxeth lying? He simply told Z that RR couldn't exit without signing a contract.
      ```

      - u/Chrono_Nexus:
        ```
        The answer to that would probably be, a person \*can\* exit without a contract. We know the gate was designed to be escaped; it would make little sense that the creators would allow a bound primordial to exact a price from the intended user in this way.

        Rather than betraying the rest of them, I suspect that Silverlake actually used her expertise in dimensionalism and apparent knowledge of primordials to finagle a way through. And I honestly couldn't blame her- the alternative was a form of death by erasure. I can't vouch for her sense of loyalty, but she might be capable of more easily ending the restarts now that she is outside of them. I suppose the question then becomes, can she act quickly enough (with respect to time dilation) to release the others before it is too late?
        ```

        - u/Funnyandsmartname:
          ```
          Then why did Panaxeth lie and say that Silverlake took them up on their offer? The closest thing I could think of would be to make them more likely to take up the offer later, but Panaxeth made that clear it wasn't likely.
          ```

          - u/Chrono_Nexus:
            ```
            Nothing is given freely by such beings. That's the trope, anyway. Panaxeth would not have volunteered that information unless the probable consequence of providing it favored him. It's probably a manipulation tactic to compel others to take up its offer, yes. At least, that's what I think.
            ```

        - u/Caliburn0:
          ```
          No. It's implied that they would have to complete the month one final time after exiting the loop. Thus, the time dilatation is so extreme that the month has barely progressed at all.
          ```

          - u/Chrono_Nexus:
            ```
            Where is that implied? Or is it just an assumption?
            ```

            - u/MagicwaffIez:
              ```
              It was implied that the timeloop is almost instant in a few places, 

              first when ghost serpent first explained the loop to them in ch 53:
              >The triangle is the world of In-Between. It exists between the moments, constantly destroyed and recreated anew. A lifetime condensed in a moment. We are all trapped in this place, phantoms created for the Branded Ones like you to learn from and test themselves against. When the fires that fuel the world of In-Between run out, we will all fade away into the void… except for the Branded One, who will go to the End, to live through this month one last time

              Then zorian explains it to zach in 54:
              >have no proof, but hear me out. It is clear that, in order for this whole setup to work, we have to be under an insane amount of temporal acceleration right now. Otherwise, how could only a moment pass in the real world while we spend decades or even centuries in this… looping world?"

              Zach then explains it to xvim and alanic in ch58:
              >"The copy of the world exists in its own pocket dimension that is under tremendous time dilation. From the point of the copy-people living in this copy-world, the original world is frozen between moments. A hundred years passes in a fraction of a second.

              Anyway, if that's not how it goes, then that's at least how the characters think it does.
              ```

              - u/Chrono_Nexus:
                ```
                This is just speculation for my part, but I have a hunch that the time loop is a mechanism for draining the primordial's power. It's a built-in function of his prison.

                Also, we don't really have a clear idea about the true number of restarts that have occurred. It's entirely possible that in aggregate, the loops are still taking place for a substantial portion of the month they are supposed to emulate. Or even, that the end of the loops coincides with the end of the month itself.

                We'll just have to find out. There isn't enough information to make any kind of accurate prediction.
                ```

                - u/spanj:
                  ```
                  If the purpose is to drain a primordial's power why is it necessary to wait for a planetary alignment? The planetary alignment makes it such that the energy required for each iteration is less costly.

                  If you only want to drain the primordial's power then you should just initiate the Sovereign Gate whenever.
                  ```

                  - u/Chrono_Nexus:
                    ```
                    I'm not sure. Maybe such a sensitive and complex undertaking requires specific, repeatable conditions. Having all the planets oriented in the same direction might be a control against interference from multiple gravitational vectors, a hacky solution to the n-body problem.

                    Also, the summer festival is supposed to coincide with the alignment, upon which the loops would have been initiated normally. For some reason, the loops happened a month early. I'm not sure why (perhaps because the primordial was going to be released before the alignment?) but I would wager that this is a contributing reason for the instability of the loops this go-around.

                    >If you only want to drain the primordial's power then you should just initiate the Sovereign Gate whenever.

                    What if you want to harness it as a battery for other purposes? There is a lot that we just don't know, especially about the gods. I look forward to seeing how the story unfolds.
                    ```

    - u/LavaNik:
      ```
      I mean, I took it as him saying "yes, he left the loop, no, he didn't make it to the other side alive". Hence - the barred gate and dead RR
      ```

    - u/summersss:
      ```
      Yeh It has to be lying. RR used the regular method to leave,that's why they are stuck right?
      ```

      - u/turtleswamp:
        ```
        Note quite.

        The regular method depends on having a soul-less body outside the loop. Only the original looper (Zack) can exit using that method.

        RR tried it while not having left his body vacant on the outside to be reclaimed. Which is the same position Zorian and the temporary looper find themselves in which is why the primordial offered to "incarnate" them, that is manufacture a body for their soul outside the loop.

        &#x200B;

        This tracks with what Zorian said about their options where he was pretty sure they could get their souls out this loop, whereas a walk out solution was low probability but probably also possible with sufficiently advanced bypassing of the intended system.
        ```

        - u/summersss:
          ```
          Thanks that makes sense. 

          Warping the sovereign gate creature to talk to others is one thing, but creating a body from inside its prison; if it can do something like that, then what sort of devilry has it been up to all these years?
          ```

    - u/zolnir:
      ```
      We don't know Panaxeth enough to know if they're lying or not. But we can follow our 'common sense' and believe that godlike beings like Panaxeth are so powerful that they can't be bothered to make lies to an ant.
      ```

      - u/kaukamieli:
        ```
        Except if they were in a stupid prison and really wanted to get out?
        ```

        - u/zonules_of_zinn:
          ```
          common sense would tell me that godlike beings would have no qualms about lying to an ant to ensure their life and liberty.
          ```

      - u/turtleswamp:
        ```
        That analogy doesn't really work when the entity has already opened communication with the "ant".

        &#x200B;

        I mean, if it's bothering to comunicate with you that means it has a goal you can affect which will be best served by you changing your behavior (even if that goal is just amuse itself by messing with you). At which point it has every incentive to say whatever it thinks will get the desired behavior; whether that is revealing a truth you didn't know an letting you act in your own best interest or lying to get you to act against your best interest depend entirely on the situation.

  Excellent Chapter!

  I was really torn between wanting to see how they would capture each piece of the key within a month and actually seeing the story progress. On one hand we would have gotten to read some cool battle scenes but, the story already has plenty of those and it is certainly better for the story to progress.

  This totally leaves room for a sequel right? Zach and Zorian can leave the timeloop, maybe with others, and then the next story will be about capturing Red Robe and Silverlake and stopping them.

        > I am considering some kind of continuation after the story is done, but that would be more of a direct continuation of the current plot. I’ve yet to consider one with entirely new characters or ones developing people like Zorian. I’m highly unlikely to write a prequel, though, since I’m not terribly fond of them as a premise.

        And

        > To be honest, I wouldn’t even try to create plot as involved as the current one for this hypothetical sequel. It would be more of a portrayal of the results and consequences of the main story – a sort of fourth arc where we see how the various characters are dealing with things, how the setting reacts to everything that had happened, that sort of thing. Not quite slice of life but definitely not as ‘epic’ or long as the current storyline.

        > Anyway, it’s still under consideration. I don’t want to invest too much thought in this until the story is done. Don’t count your chickens until they hatch and all that.

  I am very much okay with this, Silverlake is so much more of a threatening antagonist than RR that I am very excited to see her act, I imagine we will see them escaping the loop somehow very soon.  do not believe that Panaxeth could stop them, however it is likely going to take another restart, which will terminate all of the current temporary markers, so I think they are going to have to leave at the very last minute. The conflict outside is going to be mayhem, the group that escapes is going to be up against Silverlake and likely RR backed by the cult of the Dragon Below and the Ibasaan Invaders (which means QI).

      QI abandons his body if mental defenses start to struggle at all, as the next logical step in defending.

  Soooo, if Panaxeth has some agency within the Gate, this can explain the origin of RR (not that RR is very relevant at this point). The main objection to RR being (person of your choice) was that the marker alteration project always seemed an extremely difficult task, and RR was a pretty lousy mage. The marker is confirmed to be a tough nut to crack in this very chapter. However, Panaxeth pretty much solves all the difficult parts for the Red Robe. I remember Zorian though RR was strangely invested in optimizing the invasion. Well, it is explained if he was recruited by Panaxeth from the very beginning! It also means that RR can be anyone, even the Boranova guy. Their initial qualifications don't matter, what matters is that some circumstance by which Panaxeth was able to make its offer, and those are pretty much author fiat.
  ```

  - u/sambelulek:
    ```
    This! I'd like to imagine the Divines cut a deal with the Primordials: "Convince controller we choose to peruse Sovereign Gate to help you escaped. We won't bother you if you escaped this way."  

    And one of Primordials successfully escaped its prison. Only to find the world it escaped to is another layer of prison, now complete with copies of angels and demon. The Divines is outside of it, closely watching, for a chance to learn the weakness of their prisons.

- u/Luck732:
  ```
  I think people are misinterpreting the 

  >"The other person didn't either."

  ```

  - u/tjhance:
    ```
    are you suggesting that RR made a deal with panaxeth and part of that deal was that he spend a bunch of time practicing helping the invasion succeed before he leave the loop? I like it!
    ```

  - u/sambelulek:
    ```
    That sentence mean Panaxeth doesn't believe Red Robe would survive getting out even with him trying to before the gate got barred. That sentence implied, among other, that Red Robe is not the holder of true marker. Will Red Robe survive regardless Panaxeth offer? That remain to be seen since time hasn't really 'ticked' in real world.
    ```

    - u/Luck732:
      ```
      I really really don't think that is what that sentence means. It is far more like Panaxeth is implying that RR took him up on his offer.  After all, why would RR disagree when he has already been helping the invaders do just this?
      ```

- u/sicutumbo:
  ```
  Best chapter in quite a while. The culmination of lots of different projects that have been going on for substantial portions of the story. I love the bait and switch of the title, since you would think initially that it refers to Z&Z's projects rather than Panexeth.

  The good news is that the project to physically step out of the time loop should be unaffected. If Panexeth has the ability to kill people directly, he evidently didn't bother to do so for the rest of the loopers. If the gate is effectively rebarred, this would be the method they have to use now. Harder without Silverlake, but potentially the inclusion of the crown used by Zorian would make up for it.

        Problem is, we have no real indication that they’d be able to social link him enough for the guy to not just immediately go back to helping the invasion once he’s out of the loop, if he even helps them leave instead of double-crossing them the way RR did.

- u/distrofijus:
  ```
  Primordial involvement changes scope/perspective on some of the events we were told previously:

  The cataclysm which turned fertile land into desert might have been the first large issue caused by SG degradation. The primordial who was tied in the capital tried to escape the prison. Situation went nuclear. SG was given for Zach family safekeeping, not to be used again.

  The cause behind the  weeping could have been  Panaxeth (he needed to wipe out the Noveda family which allowed SG started again). SG is apparently assists in the escape in some sort of fashion. Since he is flesh-warper, he could easily create toxins/infection to set up the stage for current events. 

  RR is weird. He couldn't enter the space if he was using modified marker (unless Panaxeth  pulled him into that space). It does not make any sense to be any other that primordial puppet (to coordinate ritual to free him besides other things).
  ```

  - u/sambelulek:
    ```

  One way or another, nobody103 continues to impress with his chapters again and again.

  EDIT: Also, I believe QI is joining the forces of good! QI has always been a morally ambiguous - well, personally I wouldn't even call it ambiguous, he plays by a surprisingly tight moral compass if you pay close attention to it - person, and for all the obvious "he's the one who's trying to release the primordial from the beginning!" MoL has been twists and turns at every corner. Who knows if QI may change his mind?

  I don't want to hold back my praise for this chapter after my criticism in two separate occassions, because this chapter is GREAT! We are aware of two things, the time pressure against temp looper and Silverlake inevitable betrayal. This chapter capitalize the two brilliantly! Starting with establishing the undercurrent of unease at Zorian-Taiven-Kael fun little excursion, strengthened by after mansion orb creation by Silverlake. We are primed for whatever author decided to give us about that issue. Then come surprise Panaxeth. Silverlake timely betrayal not only allowed us to say, "Curse you Silverlake for your ...," but also elevated the tension of time pressure, from previously unease to panic and helplessness. From previously only affect the temp looper, to now also affect the two controller. Brilliant!  

  Saw several spelling mistakes, but eh, what are they in front of great writing?  

  With this, the first part of the next chapter would be most awaited/wanted/anticipated. We will demand resolutions for following issues, (1) Will controller, especially Zorian, have issue leaving the loop even with most assured method, namely having the key and possess their old body? Panaxeth claim of him not being able to leave alive was ominous. (2) Will boring a dimensional passage through Panaxeth's prison still a possible avenue? Previously it is stated with 30% success chance. It was before we know Panaxeth is watching closely. (3) Will the escape of temp looper still possible at all? Silverlake's gone with her ability to make soul-perception potion. With no means of training, temp looper are doomed.  

  And we're curious about the following issue: (1) What will happen with Silverlake inside the time loop? Become a meat puppet at the next restart? (That if Zorian and Zach could not escape at this iteration, forced to try again, or simply decide to do so) (2) Did Red Robe really gone? Not even outside time loop due to Panaxeth doing? (3) Is Panaxeth acting as Guardian of the Treshold? Gate being made from mutilated primordial with nearby primordial acting as guardian is interesting prospect.

  Thank you author for this chapter. I count 2 hours of entertainment from reading this chapter, participating on simpler comment, and writing this comment. I believe I will find pleasure from participating on more weighty comment for hours, if not days, to come.

  Again author shows unique way of showing power. Instead smashing and explosion, we see influence and knowledge, the primordial being able to exert influence outside of its prison is both believable and impressive.

  So I wanted to talk about this passage:

  >People who had zero experience with soul magic would find it impossible to get good enough at it to survive the soul transferal and successfully possess their body. People who were well versed in soul magic, even before the time loop, would probably be annihilated by the originals if they tried to possess them. Aside from Zorian, only Kael, Xvim and Lukav had a good chance of pulling that off. And Xvim, much like Kael, has already ruled out the idea 'stealing his own life away from himself'.

  At first I was wondering about Alanic and Silverlake not being included, but then the second sentence registered as "If they were too good at soul magic before the time loop, the original was fully capable of terminating the copy trying to take over them". So if I read that right, this method is only realistic for people who honed their soul magic skill sufficiently, had room for significant improvement, and had a base that would lend well to quick improvement, right? In which case I guess it makes sense Alanic and Silverlake would be out but Kael and Lukav would be in (and Zorian too, of course). But why not Zach? I thought he was also working on his soul magic over the many restarts.

  Also, I kinda didn't see Xvim as the type to refuse getting out of the loop for non-pragmatic reasons.

  Did blood magic/ingrained magical abilities also have some way to be carved into the soul too, by the way? It kinda seemed to me, in previous chapters, that Zorian and Zach were leery about it because it would affect them through subsequent restarts, but in this chapter it just said that the enhancement rituals would be anchored onto the user's mana pool and life force, both of which I'm pretty sure recover to normal every loop.

  Other than that...the twist at the end was great. Glad to see Panaxeth wasn't able to create an immediate game over, even while upping the ante like that. Though by the same token I really wish Zorian could've fished more information out of it - like what exactly it wants to *do* when it came out, and what guarantee it could give to Zorian that it wouldn't kill him when it's free, if Zorian had actually agreed to its deal.
  ```

  - u/sambelulek:
    ```
    That paragraph took Zorian bias, so it's natural for Zach to be excluded since Zorian think Zach is the holder of true marker. He wouldn't need possession method. His body would be empty. If that paragraph didn't take Zorian bias, yes, Zach will have a good chance of surviving the possession process.  

    Xvim would see little benefit getting out of the loop. The knowledge of loop existence and imminent Cyoria's destruction is minor convenience. He would think that his greatest contribution is helping Zorian inside the time loop.  

    About enhancement being reset, I think, that's because there's unknown variable before them being etched on soul. Them not being satisfied resulted said enhancement reset between restart. That's why Zorian is leery; what if experimental enchantment satisfied those variable, so that he must live with it? I guess, advise from Morlocks allowed him to rule out some of possible variables; allowing him to practice more extensively.
    ```

  - u/Angelbaka:
    ```
    The rituals they're using anchor in the life force, not the soul. A ritual anchored deep enough to transfer over restarts would basically give them a bloodline, whereas the rituals they've started using are just "permanent" enhancement.
    ```

- u/p3t3r133:
  ```
  Just started reading this last week and caught up last night on 89. I have some theories but not sure if they have been discussed so I figured I could post them here so I can be told that this has already been discussed. 

  TL;DR at bottom

  Basically I think a angel set the marker on Zach and gave him the blessing for a larger mana well along with detailed instructions he should do along with the locations of the keys and their function. At some point his actions in a loop brought RR into the loop as a helper/friend (Zach and Veyer had very similar family situations, it makes sense that Zach would have approached him early on and befriended him.). The goal of this from the angel was to prevent the primordial's release. 

  Support of this:

  Zach's large mana reserve has been mentioned as a curiosity but no explanation has been given, but QI's explanation of his large reserve seems to be the same story. He was given a larger mana reserve with no negative shaping impact. It was pointed out that Zach's huge mana had no negative impact on his shaping and that there was no evidence this was a family ability.

  The angel put the marker on Zach to stop the primordial from getting released. Why go about this round about way of stopping it? It was said by Alanic that angels are tied by rules and can't always do the most obvious or direct path of action but that you have to trust they know what they are doing. Any more direct path of stopping the primordial is restricted to them so they placed the marker on Zach exactly a month before the predicted release to give him the most time to figure out how to stop it. 

  The angel clearly prepared a path for Zach by telling the people with the Ring to hand it over. Why would he do this one thing and nothing else to help him? He didnt. He probably at the beginning told Zach everything he needed to know about the loop and what he needed to do. He knew that he ahd no access to Zach in the loop so he prepared him as best he could. When they discovered the Sovereign Gate they made a point of mentioning how little they knew and how impossible it all was without that knowledge. Every time they discover an artifact or marker function they realize it would have been helpful if they'd found it in a earlier loop. I think we will discover Zach was given detailed instructions on how to get the keys once he lets Zorian into his mind.

  Why does Zach's memory suck? He got betrayed by his 'friend' and that's why he (subconsciously) doesn't trust Zorian to look into it

  QI had a memory of getting his blessing for his mana increase. Zach doesn't know why his is huge. Why doesn't Zach remember this? Because RR erased it from his memory. Why did he do this? Because RR is a bad mind mage. He erased everything about himself, and any details he had in his mind about or from the angel.

  I suspect prior to his memory wipe, Zach was able to gather all 5 keys easily at the start of a loop. When he still had the instructions in his memory from the angel. The instructions included details on how he could retrieve the items, how to extend the length of the temporary markers, and all the other details Zorian and Zack frustratingly mention they wish they had an suspected were possible. Its possible much of this information was actually in the Orb but was emptied by RR when he left the loop himself. He then used those to train and figure out a way to stop the invaders. (this is why Zach instinctivly figures out how to use them all so much easier than Zorian, hes had them all in his possession before along with instructions on how they work) At one point he started using the crown to bring in more support and one of the people he brought in was RR, his friend Veyer, not knowing he was a cultist. Together (with anyone else he brought in) they tried to figure out how to stop the invaders while RR secretly supported them to perfect the invasion. Once RR had what he needed (probably the requisit mind magic ability learned from the cranium rats), he revoked the markers of everyone else Zach brought in and erased Zach's memory of himself, the loops they shared and any instructions from the angel and put some sort of geas on Zach to subtly direct his actions into not trying to stop the primordial's release


  TL;DR: Angel prepared Zach extensively for time loop. Everything they worked for they achieved in hardmode, Zach was able to very early on get all the Keys with the angels directions  but was still in the loop trying to figure out how to stop the primordial's release. Once RR was brought in via the crown, and achieved the required skills, he betrayed Zach and wiped his memories of himself and the angels instructions.

    ```
    I think the physical exit plan uses their skills and previous plans more. If they get out through the gate, most people wouldn't be able to make it in the real world. It would use Zorian's soul magic abilities, but wouldn't use his dimensionalism or Primordial knowledge. Much more story time has been spent on Primordial stuff, pocket dimensions, etc. than has been spent on non-defensive soul magic. Everyone aside from Kael and Lukav not making it along with Z&Z would be disappointing as well.
    ```

- u/JiggyRobot:
  ```
  Damn, that was a good chapter.

  I am shocked that only Silverlake apparently took the deal, it sounds like there are plenty of other temporary loopers (many that are not even necessarily named characters).

  Interesting that the primordial threatens death if a person reneges on the deal. He/she is trapped in the dimensional prison. How can they harm people that are outside of that exactly?

  The team apparently now have full admin rights for the loop. I wonder if there is an overwrite in there to give people a permanent marker or something similar. Maybe that is how Red Robe got it in the first place?

    I don't think that she could do anything to help the people in the loop.

- u/TheTheos:

  The situation is so fucked up. From what Panaxeth said (assuming no lies) it seems they cannot leave "alive" aka with their bodies. So I assume their souls can leave. For Zach no issue (has soulless body), for Zorian ethical conundrum (most probably will merge both souls), same situation for Alanic, others cannot leave at all...

  Assuming they leave at this very moment their best course of actions, damage control, would actually be to try to outrun Silverlake to QI and join him, help with invasion with condition that no primordial is summoned. New series of splinter wars and massacre at academy seems to be favorable option to primordial getting free. That is assuming QI would prefer new splinter was without primordial to just new splinter wars. Which I assume is the case, because I doubt that he would be willing to serve anyone, otherwise it's just nearly invincible threat for the future.

  If they leave now, don't join QI and Silverlake gets chummy with QI they are fucked, so fucked. It's essentially goodbye to all their friends and family and constant pursuit from 2 nearly ageless beings. Like if they don't know where QI's phylactery is or they can't  soul jar his soul they are permanently screwed.

  Assuming they don't leave loop now - by that they merely lose support of woke Alanic outside loop. They should figure out how to deal with QI permamently - aka find where his phylactery is. Otherwise they stand 0 chance. Actually Silverlake on her own vs Z&Z is not that scary. It's QI that brings the real danger. So once they get a method to deal with him they should be safe.

  I don't think RR was brought in by QI. It seems plausible to me that in one of initial repeats Zach decided to actually watch the ceremony in which Panoxeth is released and Panoxeth saw a chance and went for it. Panoxeth partially copied Zach's soul mark onto one of the cultists with promise of strength, wealth, etc... So I assume RR is woke outside the loop, thought not sure if with a separate body.

  Also it seems plausible that outside the loop they might get some support from celestial beings - angels, maybe some god will appear.

  Anyway so many possibilities, so many unknowns and I'm so hyped for the continuation.

  Why did the angels start the time loop knowing not only that it was damaged but that the primordial responsible for the time loop was the same one being released?  Were they really that desperate to overlook such an obvious point of failure.

  Something tells me that it was activated by someone else, but the evidence points to it being the angels (forewarning the Sulrothum & Zach's blessing).  Maybe Panaxeth just took an opportunity to hijack it...

  In ch60, Zorian & Zach saw an orb of blood that reacted when the ritual failed.  Maybe Panaxeth used this as a vector to communicate with Red Robe once he got a temporary marker?  Xe made a contract with Red Robe, who was committed to freeing xem anyways.  Panaxeth used what little control he had to let Red Robe leave the loop as the "controller", which barred the gate.  When Zorian & Zach unbarred the gate, Panaxeth took the opportunity to recruit another lackey to ensure his freedom.

  Though, that brings up another mystery. What does the repeated attempts to unseal Panaxeth within the time loop (which IS Panaxeth) actually do? Does it damage the time loop? Does it temporarily release Panaxeth until the safeguards shut the loop down?
  ```

  - u/MagicwaffIez:
    ```
    I'm pretty sure that panaxeth had a hand in the timeloop starting. Not angels.... Because remember, it started a month earlier than it should have, which is why it's much shorter than the '11 lifetimes' spoke of in legends. It was supposed to piggyback off the planetary alignment thing.

    And it starting *now* is suspiciously close to their invasion plans.

        I understand the instinct to think so - I'm pretty sure some other languages have cases where an internal verb is supposed to be in "default form" regardless of the overall sentence's tense. That said, I'm pretty sure that in English a simple past tense means all verbs that are otherwise unconjugated has to be in past tense. For an example I hope is sufficient, the sentence (fabricated on the spot):

        > He couldn't, no matter how much he wants to

        pulls up the same kind of gut instinct judgment on "wants to", even though it's a little bit more apparent here that it's the wrong tense. (Or at least, I hope it's apparent.)
        ```

        - u/sambelulek:
          ```
          > ... that are otherwise unconjugated ...  

          This exception rule is to blame, I guess. My logical approach to grammar goes haywire since my past habit of writing past form after "didn't" proved to be wrong. Still trying to make sense of them, but it's rather low in priority. I relied on instinct, as you said, in the meantime.

    The author's basic writing skills are kinda lousy - amazing story, but I see a lot of this, and a lot of typos. He'd benefit from a serious editor. A more serious editor than mere grammatical stuff - he needs help to bring distinct 'voices' to characters like Qi and Paxaneth. These ancient, ancient beings just talk in the same language as all the rest of the characters.

        It's not really a matter of disagreement, simply a fact. You can't even compare MoL's level of diction, verbosity, and depth of voice to serious published fantasy like ASOIAF or the KKC. Or even other web serials like Worm/Ward or Wandering Inn. The grammer/writing quality is workable/workmanlike at best. You need only ask yourself how many quotable phrases have come out of this work. Answer is - not many. If any at all, as far as I know. 

        It works, but it isn't great. I routinely see far, far worse stories with magnitudes better writing quality than this one, which is a real damn shame. It really does hold the story back from the level of acclaim it would otherwise have.
        ```

        - u/sicutumbo:
          ```
          More of a joke than a really quotable moment, but paraphrasing:

          "I can't even put into words how much I want to hit you right now."

          "We'll work on your vocabulary later."
          ```

        - u/Funnyandsmartname:
          ```
          I never said anything about diction or verbosity. And while sure if you value those things more then The Mother of Learning isn't the best. I will admit some characters may not have as a distinct voice as they should or could; but I do think that a lot of them do have distinct voices.

          While QI, Paxaneth, and the Taramatula Family don't have as distinct and foreign voices one could expect. I think Zorian, Silverlake, Xvim, Kirielle, Taiven, Spear of Resolve, and especially the Ghost Serpent have very distinct voices in my mind. But hey, to each their own.

          Edit: minor grammar changes.

          I think MoL is the best written webserial.  It could still use a few passes from a professional editor, but it I feel that it is in a state closer to publication-ready than Wildbow's works.  Comparing it to ASOIAF or Rothfuss is hardly fair.

          I do agree about the voices sounding similar though.

            Mother of Learning sounds fine to me, but serials like Practical Guide to Evil and Worth the Candle very obviously have stronger writing on a technical level.

            Mother of Learning kind of reminds me of Brandon Sanderson's works: the plotting and world-building are strong, the prose is weaker, and there's not a ton of humor.

            You're breaking the issue down into a set of false choices. Outside of purist literary work in universities, there is *nothing* in written media in which prose quality is the primary appeal. Prose quality can, however, help to tell the actual story even better than it already is, and make the personalities of the characters more distinctly recognizable and developed.
            ```

        - u/sambelulek:
          ```
          I disagree that this matter is not a matter of agreement. While I agree the work would rise a whole level with voices brought to several characters, I disagree quotable phrase to be a measure of greatness.  

          Princess bride was immensely enjoyable movie with many quotable lines, but I was not invested. Classic, but not great. As for your example, I was invested ASOIAF, great writing there no doubt! What's KKC? I don't like Wildbow's fiction but I acknowledge it deserve its acclaim. Wandering Inn? Really? The author focused on word count, allowing herself to be exhausted by her writing effort. She's not even allowing herself some break to rest or sharpen her metaphorical claw. Every time I read them I rushed to the end because passages are sparse of meaning. Emotions were tried to be deep with little success (melancholia only works if used sparingly). Characters distinction is superficial. Conservation of detail is kinked. Wandering Inn is a frustrating piece of fiction because it doesn't allow me to savor every paragraph. It benefited more from editorial works than MoL or this subreddit's other darling Practical Guide to Evil or Worth the Candle. Much more! Forgive me to let you read my extreme dislike. It's almost a year since the last time I read it, but it proved that I need more time to move on from being annoyed that that piece kept getting recommended again and again.  

          *exhale*  

          Yeah, my reply should be only the first paragraph. Sorry for being taunted.

  Im pretty confused right now by everything surrounding Red Robe (did he have the key or just got to the guardian with a hacked marker?)

  "You will never get out of here alive without me," it told him. Its voice acquired a human-like quality by this point, and most of the eyes were gone. "The other person didn't either."

  Im reading a lot of comments taking this to mean he said no to the help, then tryed to get out and died, but how does that play with the Guardian saying that the controller left the loop? If he did scape with help from the primordial that frase is still true, and makes more sense in the story, even having RR still in the loop makes more sense. 

  //

  Leaving that aside now we need to see what happens with Zack, can he get out this loop? will he?
  ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    My theory is that Panaxeth is lying about killing RR, and possibly about contacting him at all. The gate was barred, and it doesn't make sense for it to be barred unless RR left. Why would Panaxeth bar the gate if it killed RR before he could leave? Panaxeth may not have contacted RR because if he couldn't convince him to make the contract, he would be on the lookout for people who did take it, and Panaxeth simply waited for another opportunity.
    ```

    - u/iszathi:
      ```
      Maybe, i usually asume such hints as true since trying to solve a puzzle with fake bits is pretty unfair.

      Btw, he never said he killed anyone.
      ```

    - u/CrystalineAxiom:
      ```
      My hypothesis is that Red Robe didn't need the key because the gate was initially unbarred. He needed Panaxeth in order to leave with his own body intact though since the Red Robe in the other world still had a soul. Also, Panaxeth never said that he killed Red Robe, he simply said that Red Robe didn't escape without his help. That could be interpreted as Red Robe dying or as him accepting Panaxeth's offer. 

      Panaxeth didn't bar the gate. The gate is barred as a natural result of leaving the time loops.
      ```

      ```
      The current proximity is accidental. The first Emperor of Ikos used it, and he lived in Xlotic. I think the Sovereign Gate is the anchor location for one of the primordial prisons, and Panaxeth is simply able to perceive the events of the time loop and interact with the gate and the outside world in some manner.
      ```

      - u/Luck732:
        ```
        I suppose that is possible, I still think the proximity must be related, otherwise why is Panaxeth the only one offering a deal.
