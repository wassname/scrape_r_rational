*There were two things I really enjoyed about HPMOR; 1) Harry trying to figure out the underlying rules of magic and 2) reading all the comments when new chapters were posted. Now I've got a magical system and a story to tell, so I'm aiming at recreating those two things.*

*Sorry about the hiatus, I aim at publishing chapter 4 next week.*

Daniel and Ralph had both qualified for a scholarship at Gruthon Preparatory through their common misfortune of being orphans. Had it not been for this common background, it would be almost impossible to imagine the two boys being best friends.

Daniel was a model student, friendly to everyone and with above average grades in all classes, with a wide variety of activities and sports taking up most of his free time. Ralph on the other hand could only be described as brilliant, although this was not always reflected by his grades. And while you would call Daniel friendly, Ralph could merely be described as polite.

They got along well, but Daniel could not help but wonder from time to time if Ralph would have any friends at all had it not been for their friendship.

In what had become routine, Daniel was ready to go to sleep in the top bunk bed, while Ralph was brushing his teeth by the sink before setting the alarm clock. The room didn't have its own bathroom, but all the sleeping quarters had a lone sink. And while the room could easily fit two beds, there was no furniture except the closets, giving the room a barren look.

Ralph had, somewhat ironically given how quiet the boy was normally, the loudest snore Daniel had ever experienced. Daniel said good night and plugged in his earplugs to block out the inevitable snoring. Still he woke up in the middle of the night, with Ralph snoring so heavily that Daniel could have sworn that the bed itself was shaking.

Daniel was woken the next morning, not by Ralph or the alarm clock, but by a teacher frantically trying to untie Ralph from the shoe laces by which Ralph had hung himself and hang lifeless by from the bunk bed.

It was only later that Daniel found the envelope under his pillow.
