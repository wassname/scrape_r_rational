  Wow, is Gaara OP or what? And intelligently crazy. That's bad. I can't imagine how Talk No Jutsu could affect him in this condition, and in a rational world his purposeful murdering disturbs me more than it did in Kishiverse.

  A question. What's the difference between Naruto's smarts and Shikamaru's? Their training in childhood? Are they supposed to be equally intelligent here?

  Also I love how Orochimaru is legitimately badass, flawless.

  Good chapter. I'll grudge every following day until next week.

  - u/sir_pirriplin:
    ```
    I think Shikamaru's intelligence is the more explicit, deliberate kind, while Naruto's intelligence is more instinctive and implicit.

    That makes Shikamaru a better team player, since he can explain to other people what he is thinking. Naruto on the other hand is very good at being creative and thinking fast in the middle of combat.

    > What's the difference between Naruto's smarts and Shikamaru's? Their training in childhood? Are they supposed to be equally intelligent here?

    Shikamaru does have the fact that he was born into a clan of particularly intelligent ninja, who take education and training with appropriate seriousness, going for him. Overall, though, it's best to reserve judgement until you have a fuller picture of his capabilities.

      Apologies to /u/eaglejarl, but the Kyubey is more terrifying than his Kurama. Although Kurama is pretty damn scary, he seems (*SEEMS*) fairly humanoid. Kyubey has the nightmare of Knightian uncertainty cloaking its goals.

      Their Orochimaru are fairly comparable, but that might be because /u/Velorien hasn't really shown him off yet. Orochimaru is more viscerally terrifying to me than the Defense Professor, but that might be the rapey factor kicking in. Regardless, Gaara is (seems) more terrifying than both Orochimaru because he doesn't even hide his deviant psychology. Orochimaru is probably smarter than Gaara, but it might even be more interesting if Gaara was actually the smartest character so far (besides Kyubey and Shukaku).

      *secretly wants Gaara to be major character*

      If you're up to naming suggestions, it would be pretty amusing to name the One-Tails "Shikako," from the motivated Nara in Dreaming of Sunshine.

      /u/Velorien, you're good at writing characters that scare me, and get me to empathize with despite their obvious status as narrative cannon fodder, goddamn you. /u/eaglejarl, you're good at writing characters who I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY WANT WHILE THEY PRETEND TO WANT SOMETHING ELSE, which is pretty terrifying in its own right. You clearly weren't going for the alien feel, so I'm not actually sure how well you write that, but you do keep me second-guessing almost constantly.

  - u/HeirToGallifrey:
    ```
    It would be interesting to see all the different uses/flavours of intelligence; perhaps even each tailed beast could represent one.

    Off the top of my head, they could be planning, analysis, deduction, creativity, manipulation, learning (as in absorbing information or techniques that already exist), empathy, genre savviness, and...I don't know, rationality?

    If this is implemented, I'd see Kurama as being planning (doing the tricks with the shuriken and deliberately lying to Naruto to gauge his reactions), and I'd wager that the Shukaku would be analysis (obsessed with seeing new techniques, immediately figured out that the light-wielding ninja would have nothing more to show him). Just a random idea.
    ```

    - u/Nevereatcars:
      ```
      Kirabi is creativity. 8-sword style didn't invent itself.

      Also I think you might be confusing our two ongoing Rat!Naru fics. I don't remember the Nine-Brains ever actually deceiving Naruto about anything. It's Eaglejarl's Kyuubi who seems to be playing the Manipulative Bastard game.
      ```

      - u/HeirToGallifrey:
        ```
        Agreed with the eight-tails. And you are also correct, I did confuse *Team Anko* with *Lighting Up the Dark*; apologies for the mistake. Your Kyuubi might then be Calculation or something to that effect.
        ```

        > It's Eaglejarl's Kyuubi who seems to be playing the Manipulative Bastard game.

        Hey!  I resemble that remark!  Kurama is the soul of innocent helpfulness.  Yes, he lied to Naruto *one time*, but it was only as a test of character and he owned up to it on their next meeting, even though he didn't have to.  Everyone beats up on Kurama just become he's a hyperpowerful inhuman Primordial monster with a known penchant for eradicating entire cities!  Poor guy.
        ```

  - u/FuguofAnotherWorld:
    ```
    I honestly think Talk No Jutsu could still work out, it would just need tweaking to new situation. Something along the lines of "You want to see interesting things not just now, but also as far as possible into the future as well, therefore maximise working togetherness and minimise things that make dangerous people want to kill you in order to maximise your lifespan and thus maximise the number of interesting things you see."

    Except more eloquently put and padded out a bit. Also, I'm loving the Orochimaru is selling himself as the good guy, or maybe the necessary evil. It's just a better strategy when talking to recruits.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I guess you're right, touchy-feely heel-face turns are badly suited for rational fiction, but updating instrumental value could fit well.

      About [Orochimaru](https://www.orosaiwa.it/img/home/biscotto2.png), I'll suspend my judgement until we have more info. But the same old *follow me and I'll grant your revenge at the price of everything you have* could never have worked out with moderately smart people. Sometimes manga are content with being admittedly dumb.

        > follow me and I'll grant your revenge at the price of everything you have

        To be fair, Orochimaru was counting on Sasuke thinking he could beat him in the future in order to coax him away from Konoha. The problem with his plan was that Sasuke was right.
        ```

  So, nobody's going to talk about this?

  My two cents: Eh.  At least it's better than his stated canon motivations of ~~painting with all the colors of the world~~ learning all the jutsus in the world.

  I don't know why he was so obsessed with it, anyways.  Kakashi is supposed to have learned thousands of jutsus, but we never see him use more than a small handful of them.

      Also, on another note, in that one movie where Naruto goes in the past and meets his dad, I never got why *Naruto's* memory had to be erased too. I mean, I get it from continuity perspective, can't have Naruto finding out who his parents are in a movie before he does in canon, but like, what was their explanation in-universe? I get Minato and Kakashi's memories needing to be erased, they can't know about the future, but there was no good reason to erase Naruto's memory too. Naruto was just about to return to the future, so how was him knowing about the past going to affect anything lol?

        It had to plausibly return to the status quo of the anime.

      - u/Gaboncio:
        ```
        There's also a fantastic theorem somewhere that states that all information gained from traveling to the past must be destroyed upon return to the present. That implies that while it may be possible, it is literally insignificant. I like that a Naruto movie honors this, even if unintentionally.

        Sasuke and Sakura named their daughter Salad.

        Well, *technically* they named her [Sarada](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Sarada_Uchiha), but Sarada sounds like a japanese pronunciation of Salad and the japanese name Boruto of Naruto and Hinata's son was changed to Bolt in the english so people thought Sarada might be like Boruto, just an english word with japanese pronunciation, and the fan nickname stuck.

  My only Naruto experience is through rational fanfics so I have no idea about its accuracy, but I'm really liking the portrayal of Shikamaru. He seems like a good candidate for a rational fiction (and apparently [one already exists](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6781426/1/Shikamaru-vs-the-Logical-Fallacies)).

  I'm assuming Orochimaru was the one that left the notes, and probably did so for more than just that one team. That lets him establish a perimeter so that his little discussion with Sasuke can go uninterrupted and unobserved without revealing his involvement. Clever, though I do wonder how he found so much dirt on so many genin; he must have been planning this for a long time or has comprehensive intelligence reports.

  Gaara is apparently the host of the One-Tailed Beast in canon. That presumably means that he's a serious threat here. His sensory abilities and ninjutsu control imply that Gaara is leveraging that, and the distaste at drinking the blood from the heart suggests that it isn't total control (as does the fact that he isn't murdering everyone).

  This might be a state that Naruto could also reach, though I imagine it has some serious drawbacks with respect to free will, morality, etc. Gaara's sand control and perceptiveness would make him another pretty hard counter to the Uzumaki style, so I wouldn't put any money on Naruto solo even with Nine-Tail's cooperation (or at least I wouldn't if he weren't the protagonist).

      ```

      - u/Transfuturist:
        ```
        It seems to have problems with its perspective changes. Like Worm, the protagonist is done from a first-person POV, and everyone else through third-person limited. Problems with that choice is that the perspective character still shifts within the chapter, and Shikamaru isn't actually focused on as much as you would think. When Shikamaru is focused on, there is no easy labeling the author can give the reader due to the first-person nature of the shift. You get something that's fairly confusing and feels disjointed, when chapters are supposed to be units.

        EDIT: Finishing what's there, it's actually more of a Kakashi-centric fic, as his Kakashi has stolen the fucking show completely. It's amazing.

  ```
  Ahh, this is so good. I'm already dreading the long wait when the pre-written chapters run out.

  Also, you apparently have a talent for allowing me into the head of a helpless despairing character, who's being vivisected by a merciless implacable agent. The nightmare fetishist part of me would very much like to read more of that. The rest of me wonders if this type of content really falls under the T rating, strictly speaking. Probably cultural biases and all, but I rather think that kinky sex would constitute a **more appropriate** content for teenagers, as compared to snuff.
  ```

  - u/Velorien:
    ```
    Well, there are two ways of looking at that. In terms of the letter of the T rating, I have certainly stuck within the conditions of "some violence, minor coarse language, and minor suggestive adult themes".

    In terms of the spirit, I have written nothing that I would not have been prepared to read as a teenager. In addition, it's well-established by the end of the Wave arc that this story features regular risk of violent death, emotional trauma and even Lovecraftian horror, all happening to children, so if anyone is still reading after that, they know what they're letting themselves in for.

    I do agree with you on the general point that exposure to kinky sex is vastly less problematic than exposure to intense violence, and wish that our culture didn't place these things exactly the other way round.

    (if this post was meant as a *request* for more kinky sex in LUD, your suggestion shall be taken under advisement)
    ```

    - u/AugSphere:
      ```
      I think that there is a certain qualitative difference between the usual intense violence and what you've written here in terms of impact on the reader. The "acceptable" violence for teens is usually more about slaughtering enemy mooks or villains, who the audience barely even registers as representing sapient agents. Here you've done a crack job of getting the reader to empathise with Shiina. By the time she was captured, she was firmly in my "she represents a human, I care about what happens to her" mental bucket. The emotional response to subsequent snuff is much stronger than "oh another mook bit the dust, some guts may have fallen out".

      >  I have written nothing that I would not have been prepared to read as a teenager. …if anyone is still reading after that, they know what they're letting themselves in for.

      Personally, I completely agree with you here. I think 99% of "Mature" content on fanfiction.net doesn't really deserve the label. Certainly, I would have gladly read most of it when I was a teenager and would have enjoyed it even more in those years. Still, by the silly convention of fanfiction.net, the kinky sex goes into M category and I'm pretty sure that this chapter is no more appropriate for teens than smut is.

      >If this post was meant as a request for more kinky sex in LUD, your suggestion shall be taken under advisement.

      I was thinking more of first-person perspectives of vivisection torture, but I ain't gonna say no to kinky sex either. In fact, I enthusiastically approve!

          What, just for me? Aww, you shouldn't have! 

          More seriously, I think that potentially such a scene could serve a purpose beyond just being gratuitous guro and, as such, may deserve a place in this fic. Perhaps it can be used to show that while Oro-tan is a cool dude who's all about minimising existential risks (I assume that's a direction Velorien is taking him), he does in fact have some not-so-heroic interests.

          - u/Velorien:
            ```
            I think I may be one of these too. But it's not *why* I write what I write, and I should probably emphasise that the intention of that scene was not to be "snuff".

            The original draft was exactly the same in terms of what happened, but shown from a mostly neutral perspective. But the end result came out a bit dry and lifeless, so I decided that it would be better to have the doomed ninja be the viewpoint character, and show what Gaara looks like to normal people.

            *Then* I decided that I didn't want to create a faceless mook just to kill them off, at least not when I had a clear opportunity to avoid it, so I gave Shiina such depth as I could manage in a single scene. So if adding emotional impact to an already-decided death makes it snuff, then fair cop. Otherwise, I don't think the label is accurate.
            ```

            - u/AugSphere:
              ```
              Oh, I didn't doubt that for a second. It's quite obvious that the point of the scene is to show off Gaara and I wouldn't actually want you to just write pointless gratuitous scenes of violence, at least not inside this story. It's just that I already expected him to be pretty much like what was shown. What I didn't expect is how impactful you'll manage to make the death of what essentially amounts to a known sacrificial mook. You've done a really good job of giving her enough depth quickly to make the scene really mean something on emotional level.

              > I don't think the label is accurate.

              I don't really think so either. But I know of no better label for "being inside the characters head as everything is casually taken away from them: first their freedom, then comrades and hope, then health, even any chance that Gaara will face retribution for his actions, then finally the broken, pitiful thing that used to be a person dies and no one in their universe even cares about their fate". Looks like everyone more or less understood what I meant by snuff anyway.

                It's not quite as empathy-inducing as this recent chapter, though. It's more meant to display the inurement to depravity a utopia would experience.

  [One thing that made me blink:  ](#s "'For a couple of seconds, Shiina could not process the meaning of those words.  They were not words that belonged here.'--barely seconds after she listened to him talking about how he'd blocked the cameras so he kill them without being seen.  As his words were definitely heard from her perspective, does she just have a terrible memory?  If she was instead merely supremely confident that he was lying the first time, then why not be similarly confident that he was lying the second time (until he actually started on it)?")
  ```

  - u/Velorien:
    ```
    One answer is that during the first exchange Shiina was too busy being bewildered by the other team's strange behaviour (and in fact considering the possibility of psychological warfare). The camera thing in itself could easily have been taken as preparation to use a secret technique Gaara didn't want seen by the examiners (not implausible, given the presence of Bloodline Limit ninja in the exam).

    By the time of the statement about lungs, on the other hand, she was aware that Gaara was both psychologically aberrant and fully powerful enough to do what he was saying.

  /u/eaglejarl I'm curious, did this chapter change your opinion at all regarding Sasuke's reaction after the first test?
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    It did, yes.  The prior chapter made it sound as though he was reacting the same way Sakura was -- whining about how his ego was hurt because Naruto solved the problem himself instead of letting Sasuke show off.  This chapter provides a much more sensible motivation.
