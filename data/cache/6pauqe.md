I tried it several different ways to try to eliminate confounding variables like IP address and local cookies, but it *appears* that if you google "perfectly reasonable explanation", HGPRE is 3 of the top 5 links, out of twelve million.  So *that*'s weird, huh? O_o

  >So *that's* weird, huh?

  Naw, I'm sure there's a perfectly reasonable explanation.

  Nice chapter! I like that you actually showed her following up on making a mental note to look into something; so often characters will have interesting ideas worth investigating, perhaps mention "making a mental note" to investigate further, and then the idea is never mentioned again. Actually exploring those sorts of ideas is one of the strengths of rational fic for me.

  Hopefully we get to see Minerva's science lesson next chapter, that 
  should be interesting (and another instance of the sort of plot element that might be introduced and implied but not explicitly shown in a story) :)

  That letter at the end. If I were one of Hermione's parents I'd be really worried now. What a way to tease the possible "pretty serious" things that have happened.

    Yeah...on balance, Hermione does still want to stay, and she figures a staff member will be able to spin the whole thing better than she could without being blatantly dishonest.  But she's still mildly offended by Dumbledore's suggestion in the first place, so she's not making it easy for them, if only subconsciously.

    Didn't notice any typos, but here are just a couple minor things I noticed. These are all just light suggestions; I get a little compulsive about noting things like this.

    > "Is there anything I should do - or not do - in the meantime?" He contemplated this.

    Maybe add "she asked" after the question and "Dumbledore" instead of "he". It's immediately obvious what it means, but felt like it was missing that, to me.

    >you should, again, act as you would have if I were not already aware of the situation

    "again"? I don't think he said anything about acting like she hadn't spoken with Dumbledore before this. He just said to try to act as if *she* didn't know anything about the Time magic.

    >I could've easily been killed, I can't imagine what I was thinking.

    I think a semicolon after "killed" would be more appropriate here

    >He didn't even *have* a copy of the notes anymore,

    I could maybe see her tentatively trusting that OTN is being honest on that score, but it seems odd that she's internally treating his narrative about honestly trying to dispose of all copies as established truth. He could easily still have copies.

    Don't know if it's a Britpick as such, but Morag's accent is reading very oddly to me as a Scot. Whereabouts is she supposed to be from? I know that transcribing accents is a minefiled, but we do have some more or less accepted spellings for Scots words, so maybe scattering a few of those would be better? I'd be happy to bete her dialogue if it would help
    ```

    - u/RobinDrew:
      ```
      If there's a better way, please let me know!  I'm sort of winging it based off of Cho's accent in the movies.  I think right now all I'm doing is long "o"/oi = ae, you = ye.  I wanted it to be noticeable but not offensive/incomprehensible, but when I tried to look up transliteration strategies, I mostly found slang instead which isn't really appropriate for pure-blood Morag. :-/

    > Hermione kept her eyes fixed on the ceiling and her breathing even when […]

    I guessed you meant something akin to either:

    > Hermione kept her attention fixed on the ceiling and her breathing even when […]

    > Hermione kept her eyes fixed on the ceiling and her breathing steady even when […]

    ---

    > Surely as a Ravenclaw, you know **how how** irresistible
    ```

    - u/RobinDrew:
      ```
      Fixed the doubled-words, thanks!

      On the other, even itself was meant in the sense of "continuous or regular" (steady works too), not in the sense of "even when".  But I see how that could be confusing the way it's worded.  I went ahead and flipped the timing clause and changed even to regular.
      ```

- u/torac:
  ```
  I am both annoyed and please by the fact that Hermione is socially inept. Looking forward to her response to Nott. A bit of time should let her prepare something functional.
  ```
