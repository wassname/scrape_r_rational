## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  I've spent the last month and a half teaching myself to use the Dvorak keyboard. This has been one of my worst decisions in recent memory. My QWERTY speed was 120+ wpm burst and 100+ sustained. After 80+ hours of typing I reached 90+ wpm peak and 70wpm sustained with Dvorak at which point I decided to switch back to QWERTY.

  I feel like I've wasted a significant portion of the last six weeks. Dvorak is marginally more comfortable to type with but I've never had issues with RSIs and the advantages aren't enough to overcome the enormous barrier to entry. The initial learning process felt awful. Being unable to comfortably interface with a computer made me feel literally handicapped. That, combined with the difficulty of overwriting a lifetime of muscle memory, and the inability to easily use any computer that isn't mine are what drove me back to QWERTY.

  I'm currently cruising along at 60wpm after 1 day back to QWERTY. Feels bad man.
  ```

  - u/Hypervisor:
    ```
    Past studies showed a significant advantage for Dvorak over QWERTY  only because they compared trained Dvorak typists with untrained QWERTY typists. 

    When you train both groups for the same amount of time Dvorak only gets something like an extra 5% WPM . Which isn't worth it for pretty much anyone. Only if you enter typist competitions you will actually get to have an advantage.
    ```

  - u/jaczac:
    ```
    I currently use colemak and I regret it. Its been about two years since my switch and I’m now pretty much stuck. My qwerty WPM is soemwhere around 30 and whenever I use other keyboards I have to look at the keys, not to mention my constant struggle against random applications that refuse to accept the alternate layout.

    However, my usual speed is back to normal and has increased marginally(~85 with qwerty to ~90 with colemak).
    ```

    - u/ratthrow:
      ```
      Luckily Dvorak is a standard input option for Linux and Windows so I never had to struggle with apps not accepting my input correctly. It was more the locations of ctrl+z/x/c/v that drove me nuts.

      Why did you switch in the first place? What made you stick with it?
      ```

      - u/jaczac:
        ```
        During my mechanical keyboard phase I had a summer job where I did very little on a laptop all day. I type a lot for school so I figured I'd take preventative measures against RSI. I chose colemak specifically because zxcvqw are all in the same place, which meant no problems with commands. I stuck with it because by the time I'd realized the issues with it I was honestly too lazy to switch back.
        ```

  - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
    ```
    I switched to Dvorak after getting RSI and found my fingers getting much less sweaty and tired.  The RSI never came back.  I don't know anything about speed or accuracy though, and have no impressions of increases there - feels slightly slower if anything.
    ```

  - u/sfinebyme:
    ```
    Ain't just you. I spent a huge chunk of time learning Dvorak back in the early 2000's and it was interesting, but a complete waste of time as anything other than a curiosity. I'd never go back.
    ```

  - u/I_Probably_Think:
    ```
    Yeah, lack of cross compatibility is really frustrating; I have a few friends who use it and I casually tried learning (so I could use *their* keyboards....) but qwerty is just too entrenched :(

  ```
  You are the half-brother of Mungaro, dictator of Venebabwe. Venebabwe is a third world country of largely subsistence farmers, whose economy is buoyed by massive oil reserves. Since the locals do not have the technical skills to exploit them, your half-brother signed extremely generous extraction right deals with various foreign companies.

  Mungaro was immature, reckless, and economically ignorant. Over the years he wasted fortunes on luxuries, bribes, and ill-fated public projects, until he was routinely relying on printing money to pay the bills. The result was spiralling inflation. 

  Mungaro soon grew angry at all those conniving foreigners who profited off Venebabwe's oil and debt interest and refused to accept repayment in trillion-dollar Venebabwean bills. Eventually, Mungaro defaulted on foreign loans, kicked all foreigners out of the country, and appropriated their companies - much of which were dismantled for quick cash.

  Two years later, the country was in such abject poverty and chaos that the military rallied around you, murdered Mungaro, and put you in his place.

  **How do you put your country on the path to recovery?**

  On paper, Venebabwe is a very wealthy country. But you have neither the infrastructure, nor the skilled labour to extract the oil yourself. Nor the treasury to buy your own machinery and hire foreign experts (if any could be convinced to come). 

  Normally, the solution would be to find investors. But after this debacle, nobody would be crazy enough to invest in Venebabwe without taking a HUGE cut. And that's a vicious circle of sorts: the more outrageous the cut, the more worried they'll be that one day you'll snap and declare the contracts invalid because unfair, like your half-brother did. To price in this risk, they'll need a bigger cut, and so on.

    Contracts that start out obscenely generous and slowly reduce to merely reasonable over time seem like a solution to this.

    ```
    Dollarizing isn't a terrible step, but switching the whole country to crypto might be an even better step - my main qualm is transaction volumes of existing currencies and that it'd make it harder to do NGDPLT, the main benefit is that investors have superior liquidity for moving funds in and out of your country.

    If you can liberalize business laws very quickly without being overthrown, it's not an unconvincing signal of future reliability.  Most banana dictatorships do *not* quickly adopt very good business laws on paper.

    Aside from that, if you have one good advisor, cooperating heavily with the UN development folks except where the advisor says otherwise will go a very long way.  Scott Sumner would be an obvious pick for advisor and I know various other folks who could probably do the same.
    ```

  - u/jtolmar:
    ```
    Maintain your sovereign currency, manage it correctly, and use it internally, but conduct trade in USD and keep a reserve of USD. Do not sell rights to natural resources to foreign investors; make money with exports.

    Attract talent by offering generous deals to skilled laborers willing to immigrate. You'll have a hard time to start with because your country's currency doesn't buy much, but you can always offer land. You may have to attract farm specialists first (more likely to be motivated by land) before you can get to experts who can start more exciting industries. Whoever you get will improve your exports (so you can get USD that other countries will accept) and the availability of goods in your own economy (so your currency is worth something, so you can more successfully bribe skilled laborers to relocate).

    Once you have enough money to start extracting oil (hiring foreign contractors to set up the infrastructure if needed, buying materials and machinery you can't produce in your country), do that. Your country has complete ownership of its own oil extraction, so you get the maximum possible cut. Export the oil and use the proceeds to improve infrastructure.

    Your improved infrastructure might be more oil fields (so you can export more oil, repeat). You might also decide to kickstart other industries, so your local currency is worth more, so paying skilled immigrants in your own currency is more convincing, so you don't need to pay for foreign contractors. Keep doing the math on that each iteration, because it depends on scale and the oil market.
    ```

  - u/LazarusRises:
    ```
    Depends on your priorities.

    If you value your citizens' well-being higher than Venebabwe's autonomy or your other political/philosophical ideals, just bend the knee to a more powerful country. Tell the United Provinces of Columbiana that you'll give them exclusive drilling rights to a few million acres of prime oil field in exchange for disaster relief. They'll probably make you a figurehead who dances to their tune, but they'll also install a heavy military presence (useful since obviously your current military isn't particularly loyal, and you have to be careful of any lingering cells of Mungaro loyalists) and rebuild your roads, hospitals and schools. If you don't trust them, try to broker a deal where you auction off slices of oil field to Allemany, Gaul and Bretony in exchange for oversight and their own contributions to restoring infrastructure. 

    You're also going to want to make it really attractive for foreigners to buy property and run businesses, so offer huge tax breaks. Not a huge loss since most of your big money will be coming from state coffers anyway, you mostly want the foreigners there to pump money into local economies and fuel job creation.

    Cooperate as much as possible with the UN, international monetary fund, and world bank. There are a lot of very smart people who've dedicated their lives to trying to fix the economies of struggling countries, and I'm sure they could do wonders with a cooperative absolute dictator.

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    Before anything else, I announce that the legal currency of my government will be the dollar.

    Now, since my nation has english as an official, albeit not majority language due to its history as a colony of Albion, I petition the Federated Provinces of Columbia for annexation. It's extremely unlikely to work, but it makes for an excellent political stunt cleanly separating me from my anti-globalist brother.

    From there, my fallback plan is to make myself essentially a military puppet, but not an economic puppet of the FPC as I present my nation as a staging ground for their military bases in the area. This in turn lets me reduce the size of the doubtlessly bloated and too-powerful military without fear of a coup because I'll be propped up by the FPC soldiers I've invited into my nation. This lets me invest money into humanitarian relief, development programs, and beginning the process of restarting local and regional elections.

    Now, while international observers will attest to the fact that these elections are indeed free and fair, there will be doubts over my willingness to hold free and fair elections that have the potential to replace me. To that end, I'll propose that Venebabwa become a constitutional monarchy. "What the fuck?" The rest of the world responds. But as I explain further, they see my plan. Venebabwe's new constitution will substantially resemble the FPC's system with a three-branch government including a supreme court, bicameral legislature, and first citizen. My *only* power as the Archduke of the newly proclaimed Grand Duchy of Venebabwe will be to demand the resignation of the First Citizen and subsequently an election for a new First Citizen. (To make sure this isn't a power I hold only in name, I'll make sure that, ceremonially at least, First Citizens hitting the end of their term are always "dismissed" by me, so the populace grows used to me using this power.)

    This essentially guarantees pro-western leaders will stay in power for the near future, greatly increasing confidence in my country.

    And if somehow this convoluted plan works, everything after that is just rebuilding the economy with obvious, but laborious methods.

  If you really believe that we will see AGI within our lifetime (to me it seems at least likely), it kinda devalues literally everything else a person can do in the meantime. Like, logically, isn't working on AI(or trying to get in a position where you can influence it's development) the only meaningful thing left to do?

  Do you agree? If yes, then how do you reconcile this with doing other stuff with your life? Personally, I don't have enough aptitude/intelligence to contribute to the field(I won't be making original discoveries any time soon, if ever), but I'm also having trouble finding motivation to do other stuff, that's not related to AI, because it seems meaningless.

    Some people make cases for other existential risks. AI can't be invented by radioactive corpses. But I don't imagine you're the perfect fit in those fields either.

    The truth is that most people don't have the abilities to make a useful contribution to the cause through direct work.

    So, take a page from effective altruists. Find a well-paying job you're suited to, and donate part of your income to [AI alignment research organisations](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/ai-risk#Organizations_working_in_this_space). They'll use it to hire someone to do what you cannot. 

    They're all small enough that an individual donation is not a drop in the ocean, if that matters to you.

    &nbsp;

    10% of one's income is the commonly used figure, because it's nice and round and it stops overly-conscientious people from burning out.

    &nbsp;

    (This answer applies to most people who feel an ethical burden, even if they're not on board the AGI train. Whatever your pet cause is, unless you're unusually talented in that specific field, your money typically does more good than your actions.)

    If you're having trouble finding motivation doing other stuff because it might be meaningless, what are you doing to enjoy your time in general? To take the general Existentialist position, that just because things don't matter in general that you probably have something that you personally enjoy doing even if it's not necessarily something that, uh affects the general human progression. Conversely if as you say the only thing that matters is AI research, and you can't or are unwilling to try anything about it then within that frame nothing that you do will matter, and why worry about it if your actions already don't matter?

    I also think it's likely that we'll see AGI in the next 20-100 years, but I don't agree that fact devalues everything else a person can do for a couple reasons:

    1. While I think that on many tasks task specific AI will have seriously superhuman performance, I don't necessarily think that translates to superhuman AGI. In fact I give it even odds that AGI plateaus roughly around human level.

    2. The value of what you do will always have a subjective component.

    Even without AGI, task specific AI will have a huge impact on human labor in the next few decades - so you should already be thinking about what you can be doing in that intersection of things that make you happy and things that might have monetary value. As the value of your labor drops, perhaps because of AI or AGI, that subjective value doesn't and becomes a larger share of the reason to do things. If AGI happens to roll around, then the more superhuman that AGI is the closer the share of subjective value as a reason to do something gets to total.

    If learning about AI makes you happy, I'd encourage you to continue to do do that! That's why I study machine/reinforcement learning; the expectation that I'll meaningfully contribute to the field doesn't really play a part. I never really bought into the idea that these fields have more intrinsic value though (Either the Utilitarian or the Roko's Basilisk style arguments), and if something else makes you happier you should feel free to focus elsewhere.

  In the fanfiction *Luminosity*, Bella uses a journaling technique for analysis of her previous thoughts. 

            I pinned my thoughts onto paper, 
            they couldn't escape later. Without 
            that kind of enforcement, they 
            were liable to morph into versions 
            of themselves that were more 
            idealized, more consistent - and 
            not what they were originally, and 
            therefore false. Or they'd be 
            forgotten altogether, which was 
            even worse (those thoughts 
            were mine, and I wanted them).

  Does anyone have experience with this method? Did you find it at all effective? Are their any guides to this I could read, any recommendations you could offer?

    I regularly keep a journal and it is fascinating how different our emotional states can be from one moment to the next.  It's soothing to be  to write down all these things that happened and gives me an opportunity to think about them from different angles. I'm careful not to plunge myself into maladaptive self reflection though (like power or victim fantasies about a negative social interaction) and keep things constructive. Putting my thoughts into words are so useful to keep track of them this way.

    I used to write them out, but now it's just more convenient to type them out - I can search through older entries easier this way. I'd recommend using something like evernote so you can jot down things on the go too. Every six months I archive them into an epub.

  Whelp due to an unacceptably high risk of getting cavities and after 3 of them, I got my wisdom teeth out today.

  I opted to be awake for the procedure and decided to scribble down what I felt while high as a kite in the car ride back. Already a few hours afterward I have forgotten what it felt like to be in that altered state but it's really interesting to reread what I wrote.

      Here's my notes as I was scribbling down my impressions within 20 minutes of getting up afterwards. I deliberately left in the messed up punctuation:

      >Surgery was very weird and interesting  
      >  
      >Started breathing laughing gas which smelled like rubber and mint  
      >  
      >Started tingling, was nervous but then realized that it's expected.  
      >  
      >Then the tingles spread until it was all I could feel. I could feel pressure and the coldness of the metal under armrests. And that was it.  
      >  
      >Felt happy that it was keeping from having to feel anything. Felt like the tingles ate me away.  
      >  
      >Later after drifting, I eventually saw a light and then saw two people. Thought I was feeling the medicine to feel less concerned about the surgery even though I was shifting around in my seat. Went from grabbing the armrests to the bottom of my shirt.  
      >  
      >Thought the medicine made me sleep deeply for a few minutes and then I wake up to have the surgery right now.  
      >  
      >Didn't feel like I woke up. Felt like I was thinking very hard but jumping from one thought to another without meaning to while my sight was bleeding back in with more and more details at a time.  
      >  
      >Felt like a hollow space behind my right side teeth.  
      >  
      >Felt like I was repeating my thoughts about the surgery again even as I had an increasing pressure on my bottom left teeth.  
      >  
      >Drifted off again as the tingles and numbness ate my vision away.  
      >  
      >Same thing happened again as I drifted off when I was thinking more thoughts about the surgery and then my senses slowly bleed back in again.  
      >  
      >First I see the rectangular square light then the doctors and slowly more of the room. Anything else wasn't black exactly but more like it was colored nothing. I simply didn't see the rest of the room and all there was in my field of vision was the light and the doctors as if they were the most important things in my eyes. They became less important as I slowly perceived more such as the tears leaking out of my eyes my hands still gripping the bottom of my shirt the ceiling tiles the rubber covering of the laughing gas hose and the hollow spaces behind both of my teeth.  
      >  
      >I felt like I could have gotten up but was too comfortable to get up.

      >Couldn't tell if there was something keeping my mouth open or if I couldn't feel my teeth touching (later realized it was the gauze).

      >  
      >I didn't feel like I was light headed but disconnected from the world but definitely with it and impaired at the same time. Could logic through things but not really paying attention.  
      >  
      >Asked about keeping teeth. They came out intact but it was thrown out already.  
      >  
      >Wanted to center myself and shaking hands with the doctors and hugging mom felt like I was more connected to my surroundings. Kinda like I needed a little physical contact to keeping from flying away.

      >It was such a weird experience that I wanted to type this out in the car ride back home.  
      >  
      >My mouth tastes like blood and ashes and numb as hell. But I feel pretty well afterwards. Not sleepy but don't really want to get up and move around. Just need to lie down and hope that recovery goes well.  
      >  
      >Suspect that I was awake for the whole thing but the memories never made it to long term storage so it just feels like I slept through it all.

      So yeah, I didn't have very strong emotional reactions other than the desire to hug someone. But I was incredibly fascinated by how I could clearly feel my perceptions (vision and touch mainly) being so distorted and was in a constant loop of thinking about my sensory inputs, thinking about my thoughts about my senses, and thinking about thinking about thinking about my senses.

      I was just filled with a strong desire to immediately write down my thoughts afterwards so I could read them again in a few hours when I wasn't so detached or loopy.

      The part that's really interesting is that I had novocaine and laughing gas which shouldn't have knocked me out. But I slept through most of the surgery. I wonder if I was actually awake for it all, but just forgot it and then forgot that I forgot. I wished that I asked the doctor, but forgot to check.

      Recovery's been going incredibly well with minimal pain, no swelling, and the bleeding's stopped already.

      I kinda want to try the laughing gas again. It was really interesting reflecting on my reflection in a seemingly endless loop.

  Ive been pretty successful at my job! Which is cool. But I have no clue where to start in terms of building some stability financially in terms of:
  401K
  Stocks
  Financial management
  Is owning a home a good use of money?
  Etc

  I'd love any suggestions or ideas. If you can just give me a starting point that would be great. I do not expect people to do research for me, just maybe give me a couple of ideas of what they've found personally or statistically financially good.

    /r/personalfinance has a standard flowchart in their wiki for establishing financial stability, I recommend looking that up. 

    If you're young, then that means dumping as much as possible into a 401(k), then Roth IRA, then an index fund such as Vanguard.

    Everyone likes to use rules like "houses are a waste of money" or "renting is throwing money away", but the fact of the matter is it depends on the house and the people living in it. Having a house that you own that is paid off grants you a level of stability that's hard to beat, and lets you take risks in other areas. On the other hand, if you have a mortgage that has 3% interest and you expect to make 4% in an index fund, then the money used to pay that off could have instead been making more money. On the third hand, if you expect to move frequently or want the flexibility to do so, then you're gonna get shredded on closing costs over and over, so it's best to just rent until you know where you ultimately want to put down permanent roots.

    One term to Google is FIRE, which stands for Financial Independence/Retiring Early, and is based around accumulating enough money to live off of the proceeds. In a nutshell, you can expect an index fund to return around 4% per year, so if you save up 25x your annual spending (not income!), you have effectively won the rat race and can stop working (or not, thus "independence").  Either way, it involves keeping track of what exactly you need to spend, trimming your life to suit, and then saving as much as is comfortable. See /r/financialindependence and the Mr Money Moustache blog for more.

    Conservatively: Open a Roth IRA (assuming your annual income is less than 120k) with a company like Vanguard and make long term investments in a fund that tracks the [S&P 500 index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500_Index#Annual_returns). Plan to invest a constant % of your income.

    Aggressive: Get yourself some of that sweet, sweet, bitcoin.

    Home ownership depends a lot on location, local property taxes, and your future plans. Contrary to popular belief, renting != throwing money out the window.

    Due to the non-liquidity of houses, houses are only really good as an "investment" if you plan to keep them for 7\* or more years (the non-liquidity means that the transaction costs of selling the house will often outweigh the benefits of saving a few years' rent).

    So, when you buy a house, you are 1. committing to to live in the same city for the next many years, 2. committing to live in the same *neighborhood* for the next many years, 3. committing to live in the same size dwelling for the next many years.  (Maybe you're currently single, but in 5 years time might find yourself marrying, having kids, and moving into a house based on criteria like having a suitable number of rooms, being in the right school district, etc.)

    If you are a freelance contractor, buying a house sounds like an even dicier proposition.

    \* This is the national average last I checked (which was a few years ago), but that info may have changed in the intervening time and it may vary depending on where you live.  You may live in a city that is economically ascendant, in which case you may want to buy a house there if you feel that they are currently underpriced, or you may live in a city that you judge to be in a bubble, in which case you should avoid ownership like the plague.

  Can someone talk to me about the process of getting your story on ffn and ao3?  I see a lot of stories here that use them, despite a certain lack of notification/subscription features compared to the norm on the sites some authors set up themselves (which is saying something).  Is it just that much easier to use from the writer's side of things than other services (even rr has rss)

  - u/MagicWeasel:

    The process is pretty easy, you just... put it in a text box and hit submit, basically. I was shocked it didn't have RSS - I wanted to set up RSS with IFTT and Beeminder to make me accountable to publishing chapters of my story, but I was able to hack it together with a free RSS service of some sort pointed at one of the AO3 pages. 

    I think it's kind of like facebook in that FFN has everyone there, so it's worth putting up with their crap for the audience. AO3 also seems to have a similarly high user group.

    That said I personally used AO3 because it had a slightly better copyright policy than FFN and also because everyone else was doing it and also because it looks pretty nice (FFN hasn't changed in appearance since... 2002 afaik?).

  (Literal shower thought.) Anti-abortionists should be pushing, at least a little, for more widespread adoption of vegetarianism and veganism. But not as an argument against supposed hypocrisy; rather: to reduce the rate of abortion.

  I think of an unborn child (to some approximation) as a "non-person" animal, not far removed from "non-human animal". But most every meal of every day is conditioning me to reflexively push away uncomfortable thoughts about the exploitation and death (and possible suffering) of other living, feeling beings. Beings that, were I to spend some time around, I expect I could come to differentiate one from another based upon differences in personality, as can be so easily seen in dogs and cats.

  Meat devalues sanctity-of-life. Meat, indirectly, kills babies.
  ```

  - u/JudyKateR:
    ```
    Among pro-lifers there seems to be a commonly-held (almost universally-held) that there is something inherently and uniquely sacred about human life.  (Poll pro-lifers about whether they believe in the existence of a "human soul," then compare that to the general population.)  I think most pro-lifers would: 1) be offended by comparing the termination of human pregnancy with the termination of livestock, and 2) feel that conflating the two would undermine their goals because it flies counter to their core belief that human life is uniquely sacred which is the reason that any unborn child (an "person" in the sense of having human DNA) must be protected; for your hardcore "not even first-term abortion" types, it's not about their current level of brain function or whatever, its about their inherent and immutable human-ness.

    >Meat devalues sanctity-of-life.

    Meat devalues sanctity-of-animal-life.  I think most pro-lifers would argue that conflating santity-of-animal-life with sanctity-of-human-life devalues sanctity-of-human-life.

    >I think of an unborn child (to some approximation) as a "non-person" animal

    That would probably be why you are not pro-life.  (If I'm wrong, please correct me.)
    ```

  - u/GlimmervoidG:
    ```
    Alternate case, they should be sinking megabucks into animal exo-womb technology. Meat producers would love to be able to raise animals without all the mucky business of pregnancy. Once you have animal exo-womb tech, you can get human exo-womb tech. Once you have human exo-womb tech, the minimum viable age for a fetus is the moment of conception. Once you have that, you can claw by the abortion time limit to the moment of conception, effectively outlawing abortion.
    ```

    - u/Threesan:
      ```
      So abortion would be replaceable by transplant to exo-womb. There are perhaps some lingering funding questions (state? personal? charity?) and ethical concerns (ward of the state, born as an orphan?) that aren't so clean, but that seems like it would satisfy the primary concerns of the pro-choice and pro-life sides.
      ```

      - u/GlimmervoidG:
        ```
        In practice no. I doubt there would be many such transplants. This 'plan' is mostly a legal runaround. In Roe v. Wade the SCOTUS gave the right to have an abortion up until fetal viability. That is the point where, with extensive medical help, a baby could survive out of the womb. As long as you can drop that viability down in theory it doesn't matter if people do it in practice.

        (Of course, I doubt the plan would be that simple in practice. Judges who support abortion will just refine the test, while those who oppose it don't really need fresh excuses to act).
        ```

  - u/PublicMoralityPolice:

    This particular anti-abortionist's answer: not really.  I find the pro-choice position untenable in part because it's contingent (at least in its most common form that I've encountered) on believing that our worth depends on developing a certain level of sophistication; that is, prior to some stage of development, the blastcyst/embryo/fetus/whatever doesn't count as a person.  But if we are only considering an entity's abilities at that precise moment, a lot of our attitudes towards animals in general become nonsensically inconsistent.  I've got a baby in the house right now, and as of this precise moment he demonstrates nothing that can be plausibly described as reasoning ability.  He has no capabilities beyond a few flailing motions, smiling, yelling, sucking, and excreting.  A common crow, an octopus, or a border collie easily outstrips him.  But I'm fine with those animals being shot by farmers, eaten in restaurants, or euthanized in shelters respectively, and most people wouldn't hesitate to kill ten of each to save a single random human infant.  And I don't think those people are wrong.  But I would (in theory) expect a consistent pro-choice ethic to support vegetarianism or veganism, and in fact many pro-choice people do.

    We don't value our kids because of their aptitudes.  We value them because we're programmed to protect small, fat, helpless things with big eyes (which is basically the only reason pandas aren't extinct as well).  As it happens, the point at which most people become uncomfortable with abortion is the point at which the fetus starts looking like a baby.  We'd feel stupid trying to argue that literally, so we turn to sciencey-sounding but equally arbitrary yardsticks like heartbeats or brainwaves.  The answer to this, I think, is not to try and form a theory under which all animals or all conscious things are valuable, but to accept that we value members of our own species because they're our species and it's normal for animals to love their own kind.  Each blastocyst is a unique biological instance of our own species and therefore worthy of our protection and support regardless of present capacity (generally speaking; please don't lead this conversation down blind alleys involving clones or what-have-you).  Our failure to generalize the protective instinct that far is only a sign of our limited empathy; evolution couldn't plan for this contingency.

    &#x200B;

    If we ever meet intelligent aliens, we will probably like or dislike them to the extent that their thoughts and behaviors resemble a human's, and I have no objection to pulling the plug on any number of artificial intelligences provided they are not necessary for our own species's flourishing.  We present both as sympathetic in science fiction by having them act basically human, which makes them more of a metaphor for racism or other forms of intra-human bigotry.  In short, while I don't condone cruelty to animals, I am resolutely "humanist" in this sense, and I think the inordinate love of animals is also unhealthy.

      I'm not a fan of inconsistencies in my moral values, but my own way to resolve this one is to say that no, infants don't have a ton of inherent worth either, and don't fare too well in comparison with an octopus.

      If there's someone who loves them and would be sad about their death, then sure, *that* gives them value - and that's such a common case that it's pretty safe to use it as one's default.
      ```

      - u/Threesan:

        I could perhaps see how you might consider an octopus mind to be greater than an infant's mind at the given moment. But are you saying that in a contrived save/sacrifice situation, you would feed the baby to the octopus? Even with certainty that there is no other way, no family, no one would ever know, etc, I'd guess such a position would put you below the 5th percentile of the "I value humans more than other animals" spectrum.

        - u/Roxolan:

          That sounds about right. Mind you, this makes no difference in everyday life. I'm not even vegan, though there's no infant meat I could buy to *really* test the limits of my professed non-hypocrisy.

      I disagree with several parts of this argument both in structure and meaning.  Structurally, the thesis comes at the end of the second paragraph, which means that it leaves a lot unanswered and unargued.  I'll start with the thesis, and then I have five points where I disagree with the content of your argument.

      &#x200B;

      I think the statement *"each blastocyst is a unique biological instance of our own species and therefore worthy of our protection and support regardless of present capacity"* is very definitive, but it leads to unpleasant places in the real world because its based on feelings rather than principles.  I agree with you that philosophical arguments can take things to extreme hypotheticals, so I'm only going to use real world examples.  I'm also trying to be fair, so I'm trying to not ask gotcha questions.  These questions do hammer down on a statement that I personally believe is very hard to defend, and I think the bold ones reveal the largest missing areas in your argument.

      * First off, why should we protect each blastocyst?  Because they're human seems to be your argument.
         * **Why should we protect fellow human beings?**
         * When you see a human life not being protected, what is your individual responsibility?  Is it justified to kill abortion doctors?  Why or why not?
         * Do you support taking comatose patients off breathing apparatus to die?  They too are biologically unique individuals. What about comatose babies?
         *  When a couple uses IVF and several embryos are frozen, does the couple have the responsibility to carry them to term?
         * War also involves the destruction of human lives, particularly civilian lives.  Should any war where the party entering was not directly attacked be avoided? 
         * Second, to what legal extent do blostocysts deserve protection?
            * **Do people who knowingly have an abortion deserve to be treated like any other murderer.  If not, why is there are a difference?**
      * You seem to argue, and in large part I agree, that saving human life should be compulsory.  However, there's a huge difference between saying it's right to do something and it should be forced on a person.
         * **Should people be forced to put themselves in danger to save another person?**  Obviously pregnancy is a dangerous condition.  What degree of risk should people be forced to take to save another human life?
            * Should kidney donation be compulsory?  It's worth pointing out that for a Black American woman maternal mortality 24/100k is not that far off from kidney donation mortality, 30/100k.
         * Should people be forced to give up resources to save another person?
            * Should we be forced to pay taxes to lower maternal death rate?
            * Should pollution be illegal since it has a direct and measurable harm to human life?  Cars most definitely are included in this.
            * Should all countries have taxes so that no one in the world starves or dies from lack of access to medical care?

      &#x200B;

      Onto the content, first and foremost, there's an incredible logical contradiction in your argument.  If there are no universal principles, why should other people who have different genetic codes be forced to follow your views which you feel are based on evolution?  Because it's arbitrary and sometimes tyrannical to force people to do what you say because it's how you feel.

      &#x200B;

      Second,  I think that finding universal principles to understand ethics and everything else is not only socially beneficial, it's also necessary for effective legislature.  Ad hoc laws lead to contradictions which frequently lead to injustices.

      &#x200B;

      Third, human beings *do* value sophistication.  We value it in our creative enterprises.  We value a 300 year old oak tree more than we value an acorn.  We value crows more than mosquitos and mosquitos more than bacteria, even though all could be considered pests.  Right now, there's a debate on the ethics of purposefully killing mosquitos; we do not have the same debate about eliminating diseases.  In the most extreme example, we are legally allowed to let people die once they are brain dead.  To live by this principal, I feed crows, don't eat octopi and would be fine banning its consumption, and only support euthanizing animals if they're sick or aggressive. 

      &#x200B;

      Fourth, just because we have natural instincts, that doesn't mean that following them is good for the individual or society.  Following instincts is how a petty fight turns into a blood-feud, or how a fight gets started in the first place.  Our hunter-gatherer instincts do not necessarily promote the most beneficial outcomes in an urbanized post-industrial world.

      &#x200B;

      Fifth (and final, sorry for the novel), is that you argue that it's ok to treat our own species better than others.  If you define our species by genetic code, then different animals are a significant fraction of a human being.  The problem with using Gorillas recognizably so without a microscope.

      1a) I am not suggesting that you personally need to become veg\*nism. To reduce abortion rates, it is not your own mind on that subject you would need to change, but others'. To that end, if (*if*) the proliferation of veg\*nism philosophy lead to increased compassion and thereby to reduced abortion, the spreading of veg\*nism would be instrumental.

      1b) Veg\*nism compatibility with your personal philosophy does not matter, except insofar as it allows you to predict others. A persuasive argument must be based upon the target's values and philosophies or it is irrelevant. You speak of other philosophies that you disagree with: valuing AI or alien minds, or valuing animal life. But you don't need to agree with those values to use them as a basis for persuasive argument when addressing those that do hold those values.

      2a) To me, worth does depend significantly upon sophistication. On one end, you have a human. (One could posit a more sophisticated being than a human, but it's difficult for me to conceive of intrinsically valuing such an entity *more* than a human.) But on the other end, something lifeless, inanimate, uninteresting.

      2b) A human blastocyst is a potential person, but not an actual person. At such an early stage, it is easy for me to say, where is the actual person? Where is the thing of value? Extrinsic value, yes, I would expect to find that. But I don't grant a human blastocyst intrinsic value. That is an alien thought.

      2c) Is a human infant worth more than an adult crow? I feel, yes. I suspect a non-negligible part of that is in the extrinsic value of that baby (emotional attachment, investment). However, I do place much more intrinsic value on the baby than the bird. Is that inconsistent? I think it demonstrates a strong strain of human-person-preference much like the human-preference you describe and note grows as an embryo becomes increasingly baby- and human-like. From my perspective there is no internal inconsistency. The difference between our views is, conceptually, not that great: mine is the same line as yours, but fuzzier, and in a different place, but still dividing "worth protecting" from "not", with a significant pro-human bias. And of course I fuzzily include more "other" than I guess you would -- the aliens, AI, uploaded minds, clones, engineered beings, modified humans, etc.

      3) In light of 2b and 2c, I would guess long-term suffusion in veg\*nism philosophy to, at best, shift my "unacceptably late" abortion line earlier by one week to a couple months. Nation-wide, supposing a significant impact like 2-10% less meat? I could barely speculate on the impact across the several hundred thousand reported US abortions per year.

        My intended point was that it would be win-the-battle-lose-the-war.  If I can make people modestly more pro-life by endorsing that viewpoint, but that viewpoint itself is the expression of a deeper set of assumptions which ultimately support abortion, I should not endorse the viewpoint.

      To everyone who finds this argument convincing, I bid you to consider the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2PAajlHbnU). It's from a channel called Philosophy Tube, and it presents the most compelling argument against abortion I've seen yet. Essentially even if fetuses are assumed to have the same moral worth as an adult human being, abortion should still be legal due to issues of bodily autonomy. He presents a metaphor of a dying violinist, kept just barely alive by being hooked up to another man for life support. That man didn't consent to the procedure, and would dearly like to be disconnected from him and go home. If you think it's a moral obligation for pregnant women to carry babies to term, you are just as obligated to give up your life and conveniences in order to save others.
      ```
