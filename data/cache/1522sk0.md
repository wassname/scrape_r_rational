## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

### Comments:

- u/Escapement:
  ```
  I recently finished reading Nostalgebraist's [Almost Nowhere](https://archiveofourown.org/works/8341348/chapters/19108573), a piece of science fiction. I had previously read through earlier chapters some years ago, but I sort of lost track of the intricacies of the plot and resolved to revisit it from the start when he finished writing it, rather than attempt to read each chapter as it came out. Well, he finished writing it fairly recently, so I went through the entire thing from the start.

  It's got a lot of the strengths and weaknesses familiar from earlier work like Floornight and The Northern Caves. In particular: A strong authorial voice and enjoyable structure to the writing that makes all of it fun to read on a sentence-by-sentence level. Playful, experimental, and surprising prose has always been a strength of his, and there's a lot to like here. In this effort, there is even more of a distinction between various characters and styles of narration and differing viewpoints that make them more memorable individuals. 

  From a rationalist point of view, Nostalgebraist has been fairly involved in the rationalist community on tumblr for forever, and comes at the whole work from a point of view rationalists might enjoy. It's not a work where you can by close reading work out the solution to a puzzle beforehand, like a fair-play detective story, but it's not really trying to be. It is, however, interesting, thoughtful, and engaging sci-fi.

  One of the larger influences on the story is Homestuck. An excerpt from an essay about Homestuck that [nostagebraist wrote](https://nostalgebraist.tumblr.com/post/48247840285/disappointedatgreatlengthstuck):

  >The ordinary time travel story is a story about desire – about how much we’d all love to change the past, or thwart fate.  Even in a time loop story, in which the past cannot be changed and fate cannot be thwarted, the focus tends to be on how much that sucks for the desirous individual.  Homestuck is about something less self-focused.  It’s about guilt and responsibility, and about the problem of reaching out to others in a inevitably fucked-up world where no one’s hands are clean.  Both the kids and the trolls inherit situations that were already inevitably broken before they even arrived, and both find that the blame is distributed in complex fashion, full of backfiring good intentions and Sophie’s Choices.  No one is uniquely to blame and yet individual fuck-ups are plentiful and easy to identify.  The temporal entanglement becomes a potent metaphor for life in a interconnected world, in which one feels inevitably complicit in both one’s own misfortune and the misfortune of others, and which one has to reach out to people to survive even while one wants to feel frustrated with “people” in general for collaboratively making, and continuing in every moment to make, such a thoroughly broken world.

  A large part of Almost Nowhere is taking this strain of time travel theme that Homestuck pioneered and extracting it, distilling into a higher grade of purity.  

  The biggest flaws with his works have historically been the endings, and this remains a major flaw in Almost Nowhere. I enjoyed the story as a whole, but found the ending unsatisfying. Still, I'm glad I read it.

    I really appreciated *The Northern Caves*. The first half really sells this ambiguous dread and in-character confusion. I suspended disbelief without even realizing it. It’s rare for a story to pull me under in this particular fashion. *Cordyceps* did it, as have a few other rationalist darlings. For anyone reading this who has been chasing that feeling, stop reading my comment and try *TNC*, because I don’t know how to explain my semi-recommendation without biasing you.

    ___

    It lived in my head, and given the subject matter, that was more than a little alarming. I remember thinking, I really need to discuss this with others, and >!that’s exactly what I would expect to think!<. nostalgebraist clearly intended to comment on fan culture, on death of the author, on Internet dynamics. Did he also intend to inflict this particular feeling, this >!metafictional!< engagement? If so, that is *genius*.

    We’ve seen authors like AW who have this level of understanding of the culture, of the kind of people who are in such circles. And those like gazemaize who have done an even better job of melding the work with the community. The only one I know who has successfully gotten this >!mind-bendingly meta!< has to be wadapan. (As an aside, their commentaries introduced me to the [shills list](https://recordcrash.com/). Its contributors identified something deep about, uh, the horrific memetic entanglement of reading millions of the same words for fun.)

    Sure, it didn’t wrap up like I wanted. As I talked about it more, I felt like that original promise didn’t pan out, detracting from my overall enjoyment. I find it hard to recommend on its own merits, as if I were promising something that I know won’t deliver. But in the moment, I saw the obverse face of Mundus. It’s so hard to explain why this matters, at least without ruining the immersion.

    ___

    Right now, I’ve got *Almost Nowhere* open in another tab, because someone reviewed it last week. The *Homestuck* influence is obvious, and I suspect it was filtered through *All Night Laundry*. I want so badly to go under like I did for *TNC*. Maybe having that expectation is self-defeating, because it’s making it harder to jump in.

    Ah well.

      It worries me sometimes to see random people mention the shills list. I originally made it for the Homestuck Discord but it seems to have broken containment at some point.
      ```

      - u/netstack_:
        ```
        Would you prefer that I not spread it around?

        If it helps, I think you have good taste. Not merely in fiction; in the way you approach the fiction.

        I think I discovered wadapan through *Dendrochronology*, followed by their extensive work in the Transformers domain. The comic reletters led to the author commentary led to their notes on the concept of shilling.

        Either that, or someone linked the page for *God-shaped hole*, quoting the warning, and I was curious about the rest of your site.

        Regardless, y’all spoke to something about about that memetic entanglement. About the feelings which drive us to shill. I haven’t actually read *SPAT*, because I haven’t gotten through that much of *Homestuck*, and I certainly wasn’t there for the discord. But the way wadapan (and Sein, and you…) put it, you understood.

      no spoilers: seeing the obverse face of Mundus is suddenly gaining an intuitive understanding of an antimeme that actively opposes the perception and understanding of it. this can be a transformative experience.

      does that make sense to you?
      ```

      - u/netstack_:
        ```
        It makes sense.

        I'm not sure it's what I was intending to convey. And it's been a while since I actually read *TNC*, so that may be my own mistake.

        Seeing the obverse face was supposed to signify how I bought into the premise. A similar sense of (false?) significance to what the characters, hopped up on Ritalin and kinship, were reporting.
        ```

    - u/loltimetodie_:
      ```
      I remember talking to other people online about it and finding that a stressful amount of people essentially read the story outright the way the podcast hosts in the epilogue did. As if that was the work turning to the camera and telling you how you were supposed to feel about the whole thing!

    Are you recommending all these as worth reading? Or asking for recommendations of works in the same vein as those you listed?

      The ones on this list I've actually read are pretty good.

      > Are you recommending all these as worth reading? Or asking for recommendations of works in the same vein as those you listed?

      Neither, really. My comment was intended to "inform the zeitgeist" as it were. Most of them I found via /r/rational, so I just wanted to mention what's holding my attention the most at this moment.
      ```

      - u/CellWithoutCulture:
        ```
        Which ones would you recommend? There's a bunch I like and a bunch more I haven't heard of, so I'm curious?
        ```

        - u/NnaelKysumu:
          ```
          *A Journey of Black and Red* is the best one of this great selection of works, as far as I'm concerned. 

          The only ones I wouldn't personally recommend on there are Magical Girl Gunslinger, which comes too close to misery porn for my taste, and Shadow Slave, which I just don't like enough to endorse.
          ```

          - u/ansible:
            ```
            I can't argue with your concerns about Magical Girl Gunslinger, but somehow I still found it rather moving. I would give it an actual recommendation if it updated on a more regular and frequent basis.

            Shadow Slave is definitely a mixed bag.  Some of the word choices and quite odd. As I understand it, the author is not a native English speaker, so this is understandable. There's definitely an element of ever-ratcheting-up tension, but I don't find it bothersome like I did with Wildbow's Pact. But at the end of the day, I'm curious to see what happens next, so that's what has kept me reading.
            ```

        - u/gfe98:
          ```
          Personally, I would recommend out of those:

          Shadow Slave, Ave Xia Rem Y, Super Supportive, Slumrat Rising, and  A Journey of Black and Red.
          ```

          - u/CellWithoutCulture:
            ```
            All ones I haven't read, so I look forward to trying them. Thanks for the recs

  [Arrogant Young Master Template A Variation 4](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28601/arrogant-young-master-template-a-variation-4) is a parody of Xianxia and Litrpgs. It has a “consistent” update schedule of two dozen chapters posted all at once every two years and just updated with more chapters. 

  Not quite as good but another Xianxia comedy is “[Master, This Poor Disciple Died Again Today](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/47340/master-this-poor-disciple-died-again-today)”. I think the quality degrades somewhat over time.

  For Xianxia that isn’t comedy but which has a lot of character and world building there is [Memories of the Fall](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36051/memories-of-the-fall). The magic system works on Xianxia moon logic but the politics, character insurrections, and the magical ecosystem in it are all very well written. I have only read about a tenth of the way through so far because it is massively long.
  ```

    ```
    > just updated with more chapters. 

    You gave me a mini-heart attack(of joy), followed by a medium heart attack(of disappointment). The last update was >3 months ago, and it was supposed to be followed up by 1 or more updates of equal size. The author expected to post the follow-up within weeks, then revised it to a month, and has since gone completely [incommunicado](https://imgur.com/Egry6HG). I thought that this much anticipated update is what you were referring to. :,(



    Anywho, even unfinished I strongly endorse a rec for AYMTAV4. It's not just great, but also greatly underappreciated on this sub.
    ```

    - u/andor3333:
      ```
      Yeah I am hoping they come out soon. I didn’t know about the discord but saw a review mentioning it. I was waiting to read them until all 3 batches got posted but then it was only that batch for months now. But at least it seems like the author does have them mostly ready even if they decided not to post yet. Hopefully it won’t be another 2 year wait.

  I'd like to recommend a Pokemon fanfic that has received less attention than I think it deserves: **[PokeWild](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/pokewild-pokemon-isekai.1089666/)** by JibWrite.

  The premise is that it's an isekai where the protagonist starts at the bottom. He doesn't have any cheat powers, he doesn't have a support system, and he's missing a lot of basic knowledge about how to raise a Pokémon. Just because you know the type chart, it doesn't mean you know how to properly feed and groom your Vulpix, you know? What's the difference between between teaching Ember and Will-O-Wisp? And does grabbing one of a  Ninetail's tails *really* curse you for a thousand years, or is that just a myth?

  (Note: The protagonist doesn't actually recieve anything as special as a *Vulpix*, but the overall gist is the same).

  It's slow-paced and not very empowering for the protagonist, which I think has turned off a bunch of potential readers. But it's competently written, and there's clearly been a lot of work put in on the worldbuilding side of things. Currently, the story sits at ~94k words, and sees barely any discussion.
  ```

  - u/gfe98:
    ```
    I've held off on reading that because of the slow pace. According to my impression of the pacing, I will probably wait until it reaches 300k words before checking the latest chapter of the story to see if it has gone anywhere.
    ```

  - u/Nick_named_Nick:
    ```
    Can you confirm if he only has a pidgey for 94k words?
    ```

    - u/Darkpiplumon:
      ```
      I can, and he does.
      ```
