## Time: A Rational take on time travel

### Post:

Time is the first chapter in a web serial I'm writing about a girl named Emily Arrington. She discovers an old book in an antique shop which tells her how to travel through time.

I *think* it follows the hallmarks of rationalist fiction. Every character is intelligent and acts in their own self-interest, and no one has the "idiot ball".

I'd appreciate it if you gave it a read and let me know what you think.

  It looks like there is only one chapter so far... am I missing something?

    It's self-promotion.

      I don't mind self-promotion in /r/rational . But I take exception to PRETENDING to be an independent submitter. I was hoping (still am hoping) the OP would clarify.

        I’m not intending to pretend to be an independent submittier. Time is my work.

          Cool! If it's ok, just rewrite your post if you would. As it is, the verb tenses are passive instead of active, which leaves you out of the picture, and the whole thing reads differently if it's you who wrote vs not you.  I.e., the "I *think*..." part sounds like "This author did a pretty good job doing the rational genre right!" when you're not the author, but when you are, it reads more as "I hope I'm doing the rational genre right."  And "Give it a read" sounds like a recommendation of quality from an independent source when it's not the author, but when it's the author it's more like a request for indulgence.

          That is to say, whether you're the author in this promotion makes a big difference in how people view your work going in, and is important to include.  

          Additionally, it's not a serial yet - it's just one chapter. 

          If it were me, I'd edit it to "Time is *the first chapter in* a web serial *I'm writing*..." and "*I'd appreciate it if you would* give it a read *and let me know what you think in the comments.*"  More upfront and more constructive and aware of your role of the author that way.  But, do what you think is best - I'm just an internet rando with rando advice.

    There is one chapter so far. More will come soon.

      I'm not sure it's far enough along yet to get a clear idea of whether I think it is rationalist fiction, but I think it's great that it is intending to be.

      I'm curious: one of the key elements in time travel stories (that are rational) is what the [metaphysics](https://qntm.org/models) of time travel is. Works range from "everything is immutable, and fate conspires to make this work out despite the apparent existence of free will" ([eg](https://gist.github.com/defunkt/759182/ad44c6135d168ae54503a281bb7e1a24c6c2ea0c)) to things like "time can be changed, which is simply the actor moving to a different possible path in the multiverse" ([eg](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2011/12/rudy-6-time-as-a-divergent-ser.html)). But to be honest, MOST time travel stories have a metaphysics where time travel works different ways as the plot demands it.

      What is this story planning to do?

        This.

        Best time travel stories, like "All you Zombies" or "Try to Change the Past", consider the time travel mechanism itself as important as any character or story arc.

          There's something narratively unsatisfying about the way these closed-loop type stories are causally tautological though.
          ```

          - u/ArgentStonecutter:
            ```
            Then try Psalimpsest by Charlie Stross.

  Hard to say much with only one chapter so far. There's no time stuff yet, just teenager stuff. The dating stuff is rather plain, but the asshole-dad stuff makes me sympathize with Emily.

  A few comments:

  *  Everything is center-aligned, which isn't pleasant.
  * It was weird that Emily couldn't remember which class she was in with George given she's apparently really into him.
  * There were a few punctuation errors at the ending quotes. Easily the worst offender was this one with the double-period,

  > rain.”.

    ```
    Actually doing punctuation like that (the double period example) is common in certain dialects.
    ```

    - u/Solliel:
      ```
      This is only "correct" in sentences *containing* quotes not ones that *are* quotes.
      ```
