  Read it (and sequels) over the last few days. I enjoyed it there is some rational thinking used for healing and killing. The stories are somewhat small in scope and generally well written however don't go into them to be a piece of literature.

  Overall its worth a read due to the simple writing and interesting plot that does not over reach.

  As they're releasing it free, I hope the mods don't mind if I include a [torrent link](https://kat.cr/telekinetic-a-hyllis-family-story-1-epub-t9506723.html) for those non-kindle users that want to read it.
