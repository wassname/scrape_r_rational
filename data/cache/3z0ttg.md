## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  Does anyone know something about the user writingathing? He used to write things in r/rational but seems to have disappeared.
  I only noticed because I was browsing older threads on r/rational, found one of his threads and the next day his username was [deleted].

  I'd also like to know if "Avatar Korra Punches Her Way Through the Hypothesis Space" exists or existed. It's something he wrote (or was writing) but I can't find it. 

  He wrote the parody of the chapter of HPMOR where Harry realised something important (not spoiling). So I am kind of interested.

    A google search confirms that "punches trough hypothesis space" existed, but seems to have been pulled as well. Archive.org doesnt have a copy, apparently fanfiction.net prohibits crawling :/

      > apparently fanfiction.net prohibits crawling

      Hahaaaah I can guess why. (A lot of people probably start their writing careers there and as such that is where their worst will be on display, sooner or later they're going to start to be embarrassed by it and they're going to want to be able to erase it from existence.)

      He had a tendency of deleting his old fics when he wanted to rewrite them. I have an older draft of "hypothesis space" on my ipod from back when he posted it on FF.net as "People Whom the Stars Watch". It's a shame that he pulled it down again. He's a good writer and gave me advice on one of my fanfics.

    Oh god, I was thinking about that parody today. Please tell me it still exists somewhere.

  What’s your default choice of actions for dealing with [people who consistently convey misconceptions in social gatherings?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhGuXCuDb1U)

  Engaging in a debate can be grate because there’s a chance your opponent will reveal a misconception that *you* were unintentionally holding to, tell you something altogether new that you weren’t aware of, or that you’ll simply make a new acquaintance. But this is mostly applicable to cases where your opponent’s reasoning is not a complete mess of logical fallacies and a screwed worldview. 

  With certain people, however, trying to have a well-structured argument won’t work simply because the very “laws” by which they judge what should be accepted as true and what should not differ from what you are using. If you try to disprove [misconception 1] they’ve been voicing, they can simply support their reasoning by mentioning an additional [misconception 2]. If you switch focus and target this new one, they bring [yet another one], and so on.

  More than that, even valid facts you both are aware of will often be interpreted very differently. A scientific study reporting that [mice can inherit specific smell “memories” from their parents,](http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/12/01/mice-inherit-specific-memories-because-epigenetics/) for example, can be used to leap to conclusions such as reincarnation, nations having “souls”, one nation being superior to others by default, and so on.

  Trying to prove such a person wrong will likely result in a debate that’s all over the place — even more so when the opponent intentionally drags it out to milk as much attention out of it for soap-boxing as possible. Not to mention that everyone in general doesn’t want to be arguing about anything at all — that’s not what holiday party gatherings are supposed to be about.

  The wise thing to do, I reckon, should be to just shut up and let them continue voicing their bullshit opinions. But this contains the risk of contaminating your social environment even further because [people who talk the loudest without being proven wrong are the most effective at changing the opinions of their peers.](http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2006/05/popular-opinion.aspx)

  So, getting back to the initial question: what do you think is the optimal and most effective way of dealing with these kinds of problem?

    I don't have a quote for this, but I believe in an interview Richard Dawkins mentioned how he doesn't argue with people with crazy opinions because the mere act of arguing with them gives them the(false) impression that their beliefs are valid enough to have a discussion about. However you are right that by simply ignoring them they are more likely to convince other people you know. Ideally the solution would be to convince your friends/family members of rational opinions beforehand and just trust that after that you can ignore the one person with crazy opinions but that doesn't work if you only see these people on rare occasions.

  How does this sub feel about Jules Verne? As far as I know, a lot his stories are more-or-less rational, especially for his time, so should he be considered sort of semi-rational writer or not?
  ```

  - u/Rhamni:

    I absolutely loved him as a kid. Haven't read anything of his in a decade. I remember reading that he took extra care to make all the numbers he used (distances, measurements, etc) as realistic as possible, but early translators just changed the units and kept the numbers in many places, butchering the science.

    If you haven't read it, I highly suggest *The Begums Millions*. Among other things, it's got the first instance of chemical weapons in all of fiction, in the form of projectiles filled with compressed carbon dioxide that freezes and suffocates.
    ```

    - u/ctulhuslp:
      ```
      Eh, I must have phrased my question poorly. Yes, I know that he was very precise in his books, and I loved reading him too;I am interested in whether this kind of books is considered even remotely rational and why so.
      ```

      - u/Rhamni:
        ```
        Right. Well, the characters are usually clever, and go about achieving their goals in ways that make sense, although I think it's fair to criticise a few of his villains as sometimes evil for evil's sake. The Begums Millions villain is a German racist industrialist hellbent on world domination who enjoys polluting and researching ever more destructive weapons.

          Which is, uh, less unrealistic than one might hope.

    I'd be happy to call them rational (especially for their time), though not rationalist.

  My brother claims to be a materialist Trinitarian theist. How can I explain to him exactly how insane that sounds to me?

    Socratic method?

    I wouldn't, though. It might be useful to have an (effectively)atheist near you who can wear the clothing of a theist with sincerity.
