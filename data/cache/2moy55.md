## The Olympics create Geniuses. Can we use this Template for something better?

### Post:

The TL;DR of this is that because of the competition, prestige, and money involved in the Olympics and sports in general, we are continually producing "geniuses" in those areas. 

I wanted to first talk about whether or not this is true (I think it is), and then, maybe more importantly, talk about whether or not Video Games could create challenges and games that would allow for us to create the same kind of prestige, competition, and money for more intellectual challenges. 

If an example might help: Starcraft 2 has been looked at numerous times so far for providing insight into the ability to cognitively multi-task. Here is an article on it: http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2011/12/01/how-a-computer-game-is-reinventing-the-science-of-expertise-video/

So, yeah, I want a smarter society, but humans don't seem particularly good, as a group, in just doing good, helpful things unless there is a lot of incentive, and things like the NFL, ESPN, and the World Cup are really, really great example of organizations motivating people really, really well to spend their time, attention, and money on something.

Thoughts?

  There have certainly been attempts at creating competitions for intelligence-based pursuits. In high school I was in academic decathlon, debate, mock trial, chess club, and every recreational mathematics program (not bragging here - the barrier for entry in most of those is very low, and many of them I wasn't terribly good at). In college, I did programming competitions and robotics competitions, and I have on occasion helped out with the current high school programs for the same thing.

  I think you're right that adding incentives on top of the already fairly high incentives for academics would increase interest. However, I also think that there are two big problems:

  1. Specialization is a killer. If you look at chess, Scrabble, trivia shows, etc. the biggest thing that you can do to increase your ability is *not* to get smarter, but to - for example - memorize the common openings, or memorize the two letter word list. There's a lot of cognitive effort involved, but also a lot of stuff that just doesn't transfer to other domains. This is going to be the case with almost any game you invent for people to play, and represents a problem if you want to push people towards a general increase in intelligence.

  2. Money. The Olympics are, so far as I know, revenue positive, in that it makes money for people (hosting the Olympics doesn't always work out for the host country, since it can leave a lot of dead stadiums and other problems, but that's a fixable problem). If you want a cognitive sport, you need to make sure that it too is revenue positive (or at least neutral). You *could* fund it with tax dollars or private donations, but that's a losing proposition unless you have a lot of support - and that money can probably be spent in better ways. The whole reason to do a sport is that the sport can make money and pour that money back into itself.

  So essentially, all you need to do is create a game that:

  * Increases general intelligence when played/practiced
  * Is entertaining to watch

  And if you can do that, then you can create your own Olympics organically. However, there have been attempts to do this, and none of them have been terribly successful, if only because cognitive effort is almost always internal, and cognitive sports *mostly* involve people thinking quietly to themselves with a furrowed brow.

  The number of Olympiads (~thousands/occurrence), compared to the general populace (~billions), is vanishingly small. In comparison, the number of PhD (~ten thousands/year) compared to the general populace is relatively small, but still much larger than the number of Olympiads.

  By that metric, the human race is doing much better on its +int than its +str.

  However, if we only count Gold medalist (~hundreds/occurence) as geniuses, then compared to Nobel Prizes winners (~tens/year), academics have much catching up to do.

    This is only true if a PhD is equivalent to a Olympian, which doesn't make much sense.  I could create a competition for, say, flying then accept each applicant, but that didn't mean people are better at flying than at getting PhDs, just that the qualifications are different.
    ```

    - u/firstgunman:
      ```
      Ah, the crux of trying to compare dissimilar categories against each other. What do we mean by genius anyways - what's the membership test to be counted as one?

      If by genius, we mean people whose ability in some field is so many standard deviations above the average practitioner, then I think Olympians and PhD are comparable. Thankfully, this excludes flying - since I don't think any human will do much better than the average flying animal. (Unless we have some other criterion for this camp, in which case why call it flying?)

      But the point OP brought up is that, given enough incentive (a la the Olymics), can we foster a culture where intellectuals is a widely popular aspiration? (through video games, or otherwise)

      If we ask whether incentivizing video gaming will produce geniuses at video games, the answer is trivial; but if we ask whether incentivizing video gaming will produce geniuses in the more traditional sense, I must admit my reservations. Sure, some skills might be transferable (e.g. heightened awareness, better object manipulation), but why not just incentivize those skills directly? A good marksman will still be a much better shot than a great FPS player; so marksmanship itself is a much more direct thing to promote *if you want people to be crack-shots*. We're certainly not training the next George Patton by making them play Starcraft.

      (No disrespect to video-gaming. The point is equally valid if I substitute topics such as meditation, good nutrition, or getting enough sleep.)

      So how do we incentivize being smart? I argue that the incentive to be smart is there already. People with PhDs (and MDs, JDs, etc) are more likely to have better financial security and job satisfaction than those who don't. There's also a good deal of prestige - some people consider adding to the sum-total knowledge of mankind a more impressive feat than swimming really fast. In fact, if you consider how many PhDs there are compared to Olympiads, I'd say our incentives for 'smarts' are working quite well. On an absolute scale over the lifetime of our race, the average man today is the smartest he has ever been.

        Fair enough. Your civility is appreciated :-)

  What intellectual exercises are easy to watch?

  Most Olympic events are some form of race, either literally or in the form of a score. Which player is in front, and how close they are to one another is immediately apparent with even the most rudimentary understanding of what sport *is*. The events which aren't races are typically based on distance or accuracy, relatively easy to explain the goal and then grade without much explanation.

  A tiny, but popular remainder are graded on difficulty and mastery. These are usually aesthetically pleasing in their own right, and who happens to win is secondary to the enjoyment of just watching experts play.

  In short, anybody can sit down and watch the Olympics and basically understand what the Olympians are trying to do. Ditto the vast majority of sports out there. That low barrier to entry inspires people to devote their attention long enough to start asking questions about specific rules, techniques, scoring conventions, and whatever else is required to understand a sport well.

  Unless these intellectual competitions are immediately, understandably fun to watch, they're not going to attract the sort or size of audience that supports the money and prestige of conventional sport.

    I've been watching Hearthstone (an online collectible card game) lately, and I think that it does a lot right in terms of being understandable to the layman. It's filled with lots of neat animations that make it clear what's going on, and the tournaments feature commentators that discuss the possible plays (and the reasoning behind the plays). And when some brilliant play is made, it's fairly easy for the viewer to see it after the fact, even if they didn't get there on their own. Other than the random elements involved, I think it offers a very good model for how an intellectual game can/should be designed.

      On the other hand, Hearthstone is really easy to be decent at for someone reasonably intelligent. The difference between an average player and a top-player isn't going to be that big. (Unless they changed a lot since I last played.)

      Esports in general have some really good professional commentary and strategy now.

  Poker is interesting. It is [rational if not rationalist](http://rationalpoker.com/). It got quite popular in the last decade. Money and competition is there, but prestige in the general population is not that big.

  At least it is a nice starting point. There are quite a lot of things to improve, especially with Texas Hold'em the most popular variant. [Pandante](http://www.sirlin.net/articles/designing-pandante) is an interesting descendant.

  I think our world has enough incentive to be intelligent (better jobs in general). The general assumptions about intelligence need to change. 

  People believe intelligence is genetically determined. In terms of IQ it seems to be correct. However, being smart is something you can learn and train.
