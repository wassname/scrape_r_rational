  These AARs tend to be written as if everyone helping with the war effort is male. That's utterly incorrect. Russia was no stranger to women in combat roles; they had the First Women's Battalion of Death back in the first war and the Night Witches in the second. Nursing was generally women's work, as was operating anti-aircraft batteries.

  That's only people fighting near the front lines registered under their official gender. It's never been unheard of for women to enlist under an assumed name.

  For non-combat roles in moderately safe territories, World War II was when women entered manufacturing jobs en masse. Naturally, those jobs tended strongly toward indirect support of the war. Also, computers took off in this era to calculate artillery trajectories now that there were batteries with ranges of a hundred kilometers -- and early programmers tended to be women.

  While this example only talks about the front lines, in occupied territories, women took more direct action, having no central command capable of enforcing ordinances restricting war activities by gender. One of the most successful radio operators for the French Resistance, for instance, was [Noor Inayat Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noor_Inayat_Khan).

  I realize that's a small percentage of the AAR as a whole, but it's something that grates on me. I understand that radio broadcasts and histories written in that era would reflect this incorrect data, and people often want to replicate that style, but you can alter the style just a tiny bit to make the data you're conveying more historically accurate, and at the same time you end up being less sexist. It's a win all around!

    Those are the most bad-ass names for military battalions I've ever heard! Also based on this:

    >With wireless detection vans in close pursuit, Inayat Khan could transmit for only twenty minutes at one time in one place, but constantly moving from place to place, she managed to escape capture while maintaining wireless communication with London: "She refused to abandon what had become the most important and dangerous post in France and did excellent work."

    I wonder if the inspiration for Fate from Mirror's Edge is basically Inayat Khan + Parkour.

    Thanks for the interesting info!

  For [the reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3hutyd/d_friday_offtopic_thread/cub36i7) stated in my comment from last week's discussion, I thought I'd post an AAR and see how /r/rational felt.
