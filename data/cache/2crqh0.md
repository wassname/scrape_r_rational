  Even more creative use of powers. I was particularity fond of the use weaver found for Noelle.

    Ha, I wasn't signed up for reddit at the time you made the post, but I still wanted to make this post to thank you for recommending my story! I'm glad you liked it!

    I probably won't be able to update often in the future, but I just added a new chapter (4.6) to the spacebattles thread.

  Far and away my favorite Worm fanfic. The original plot and the fact that we don't already know everything, because of the switch, makes it a great read beyond the usual fanfic.

    I was disappointed when I finished reading through the Worm time loops and there was no more. Any other suggested reading on the Worm verse?

      In no particular order, Cenotaph/Working Title, Here Be Dragons, Alchemical Solutions, Silent, Manager, and A Cloudy Path are all good.

        Thanks, I'm an addict for good worm fanfic. I'm really enjoying anything I find.

        I also found this Brennus story, not worm, but it's in a similar vein if anyone else is interested

  Read it. Liked it. Though I did feel (like in Worm proper) that I liked the [](#s "non-Endbringer") parts better than the [](#s "Endbringer") parts. Worm always felt a little too grimdark for my personal preferences, and a lot of the fanfic seems to carry that over (sometimes amplifying it). That said, the fact that it's well-written helps a lot.

  3 chapters in pretty good so far and power uses are already at a high note so that's great as well.

  Trying to read this via forums on my phone is exceptionally annoying. Every chapter I have to scroll back to the top of the post to check the chapter number before going back to the table of contents.
