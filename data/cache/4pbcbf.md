  As, I'm assuming, a parody of the usual "We beat them, and everyone lived happily ever after" ending it was interesting to read. And the "viser's" almost aggravatingly reasonable presentation was well-done, I thought. (I feel stupid now though, because it wasn't until I read the comments here that I realized "viser" wasn't the right word for what I was thinking...)

  The one criticism I would make is that the powers of the artifacts you mentioned seemed a bit low-tier and inflexible. Putting aside them being the symbols of the ruler, it's hard for me to see the protagonists using them to win a significant battle of power unless they were very capable even without them, or already had a group of people supporting them. Either of which would preclude the "viser" getting them wrapped around his finger so easily.

  This is probably just an issue of perspective though; if the heroes had other abilities, or if the grand dictator was much easier to take out than I thought he was, then everything would line up behind the scenes, though I just won't know. It also doesn't directly impact the story's integrity as a parody (though *indirectly*, it does make me think that I, personally, don't recall reading any overthrow-the-empire plots that doesn't involve a fairly thorough set of secondary characters).

    All three of the artifacts on one person would streamroll a medieval army pretty effectively, but giving each person one artifact seems silly. Your swordsman is basically useless, your armored man is vulnerable to catapults, spears, and sheer weight of numbers, and your telekinetic is just a pincushion waiting to happen.

    I think it's a pretty good combo against mundane troops.

    Armor can protect all three with the radius, TK keeps melee guys away and the sword cuts a path through walls,
    Use that to get to the dictator, then hold him in place with TK and stick a sword in.

    My head-canon says the dictator was one of the last batch of heroes who did the same, so his power was probably something silly like super-strength anyways :P
