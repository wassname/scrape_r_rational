## [FF] Portraits from the Revolution [Animorphs AU/Continuation]

### Post:

In the latest R!Animorphs thread there's been mention of some stories that are either slightly misremembered versions of mine, or really scarily similar (in which case I'd really like to know about them!). I hadn't been sure about posting this series here, but that discussion has convinced me that it might be of interest to the subreddit. 

[Portraits from the Revolution](http://archiveofourown.org/series/200554) is a Continuation/AU series where the Yeerks were not forced to become nothlits, thanks in part to Cassie's efforts. The Empire is dead and broken, and the series depicts a variety of ways that the Yeerks have responded to this and made a place for themselves on Earth. 

They are all written in the second-person point of view. Except for the first story (which has three chapters), they are all oneshots. 

[Waiting for the Future](http://archiveofourown.org/works/3176698) is written from the perspective of Yan 314, a Yeerk artist. My favorite of the lot.  

[Preserving the Future](http://archiveofourown.org/works/3215378) is written from the perspective of Wassael 413, a former Yeerk scientist. Touches on the Yeerk perspective on Andalites, among other things. 

[Apprehending the Future](http://archiveofourown.org/works/3966133) is written from the perspective of Eltel 555. Involves child custody battles. 

[Owning the Future](http://archiveofourown.org/works/3983878) is written from the perspective of Dareer 612. Touches on crime, international (and interplanetary relations), and what the Andalites may or may not be doing in the wake of the war. 

[Fighting for the Future](http://archiveofourown.org/works/4012114) is written from the perspective of Chobin 749. Another perspective on families. Kind of disappointed with this one, but going by previous reader responses I might be judging myself too harshly, so YMMV.

  Endorsed by me (for whatever that's worth).  I very much enjoyed reading brotherg's work.
