## Building a rational!fanfic... together!

### Post:

This subreddit sees a lot of talking about rational!this and rational!that. And then nothing gets done, because we're just spitballing and nobody wants to pick up the admittedly ginormous task of writing the durned thing. 

A theory which I would like to test, by putting it to action, is this: If we know that something is going to be done with it, if a story is actually going to be written up and completed by somebody, then it is possible to build a sufficient amount of interest in spitballing ideas and building the world, plot, and even outline as a group. 

When I have an outline I can write 1,000 to 1,500 words an hour. My schedule is wonky so I can do whatever I want on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and the weekend. Assuming that (1) the universe we choose to tackle is one that I am familiar with or can practically familiarize myself with and (2) we are able to build an outline, then I will have the ability to turn our world, plot, and outline into a full-fledged story. 

**EDIT**: To clarify the previous paragraph, it seems that most fics, rational or otherwise, stall at the "turning the idea into words" stage. So I can precommit to handling that if we get to the point of making an outline (and, again, it's a universe that I actually understand).

First order of business: What universe do we want to play in? 

Harry Potter's been done, and I'm reluctant to do a sequel for this project. Death Note, Pokemon, Terminator, Naruto, Superman, Animorphs, Frozen, and Twilight all have respectable r!fics. 

(So does Christmas.)

Star Wars has been discussed in other threads. So have The Hunger Games, Fullmetal Alchemist, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Star Trek, Yu-Gi-Oh, Stargate: SG-1, Fallout, One Piece, and Percy Jackson. 

Of these, only The Hunger Games and Star Trek (to my knowledge) were not discussed in the context of someone wanting to do a fic in that universe, so we might want to stray away from the others in order to avoid competing r!fics. The field is white and ready to harvest, after all. We have plenty to choose from. 

If the redditor who had the idea for rational!Anakin wasn't interested in pursuing that, though, then that is totally an idea that I think would be interesting. Still, let's just bounce out some ideas first. 

The challenge of an r!Star Trek is interesting. 

Other possibilities to bounce out: 

* The Marvel Cinematic Universe (being a lot smaller and easier to manage than the 616 comics universe)

* Firefly/Serenity

* Invader ZIM (okay, the idea is as insane as the show, but if we could do it, that'd be something amazing)

* The Mummy

  *cough, cough*

  /u/alexanderwales, /u/DaystarEld, /u/Wertifloke, "FanFicBias" on FFN (don't know zirs Reddit name), and that's just off the top of my head -- there's a bunch more that I'm not thinking of at the moment.

  That said:

  If you want it, I suggest writing it yourself.  Writing by committee is hard for everyone, and we'd all like to read something new.

  If you're going to do this, I vote Firefly.  I love Firefly.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Not to mention yourself ;)

    That's the problem with committing to big projects: there's no time for all the new and interesting projects that come up later!
    ```

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      > Not to mention yourself ;)

      Yeah, well, that seemed a little too much like bragging.  :>
      ```

  - u/callmebrotherg:
    ```
    I thought I made it clear that I am willing to write it. 

    I was not aware of any of these "Hey let's talk about what r!something would be like" threads bearing fruit, though.
    ```

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      My point was simply that, if you're willing to be the writer, then be the writer.  If you've got the chops to write a story then you've got the chops to do the worldbuilding.  

      Relying on a committee will just slow down and complicate the process.  If you want help with early-on brainstorming and then you take it and run with it, that's one thing.  If you want to have a group of people determining various things (physics? character traits?) along the way, then you're talking about an RPG thread, not a story per se.  RPG threads are cool, but be aware of which you're doing.
      ```

      - u/LeonCross:
        ```
        Quests seem to be a middle ground there. Players get input on direction, but narrative is ultimately handled by the writer.

        I actually would find it interesting to see how a quest ran by someone with chops like yours and played by R/Rational would go.
        ```

        - u/eaglejarl:
          ```
          It would be an interesting thing to do and I think I would enjoy it. I've also done enough [DG]Ming that I think I could do something fun. 

          Unfortunately I can't have too many non-paying projects right now -- I'm trying to live on my writing. If a bunch of people were willing to throw some bucks at my Patreon I could do it, but otherwise I'm afraid I need to focus on salable stuff.
          ```

- u/DaystarEld:
  ```
  To be fair, we are still seeing new promising fics pop up, like, well, The Reckoning :)

  But this sounds fun too. I'm always happy to throw more ideas out there, it's just hard to commit to anything while still keeping to getting my own story's chapters out.

  For what it's worth, Fullmetal Alchemist or Star Wars (that r!Anakin scenario sounded amazing) would be my votes.
  ```

  - u/callmebrotherg:
    ```
    Yes. The r!Anakin plot was fantastic. I'm hoping to get a feel for what would be most engaging for people before moving on to the next stage though. 

    (Also I would want permission from the person who first suggested it, to make sure that it isn't being worked on at this moment)
    ```

- u/MugaSofer:
  ```
  The MCU is already pretty unwieldy, with multiple films/year and three TV shows already.

  Why not the X-men filmverse?

  You'd need to find an excuse why Professor X isn't unbeatable; but other than that the canon is pretty clear-cut. Unlike the comics, there's no magic or anything else weird but "mutation", and there's no sliding timescale nonsense - the filmmakers took the excuse to clear up most of the issues with the original when adapting it.

  But what really makes me think this could work is Rogue as a rational protagonist.

  Rogue's powers are clear-cut and ripe for munchkinning, with their drawbacks and strict rules. But most importantly, they let her *steal other people's powers*. In a rational!rogue, you have an excuse to play with *every power in the films* - while still not being too broken, because she loses them again.

  I'd have to say star wars or FMA(shameless self plug). In my limited memory of those threads, most of the others didn't get further than general world-building (feel free to correct me on this). 

  The three main protagonists suggested for R!FMA were:
  * Winry
  * postDublinth!Al
  * someone in the future

  These three would be radically different. Al would probably start with him munchkining his new circle-less transmutation and then pretty much skipping to the boss battle with father. The random future person would just be a worldbuilding short.

  rat!Percy Jackson is still an option, but I'm not a big fan of the whole "mortals are p-zombies" bit
  ```

  - u/callmebrotherg:
    ```
    Yeah, the problem of "these threads don't seem to get past worldbuilding" is why I'm trying this approach. 

    For the record, I do not think that I, personally, would be able to do the writing for Fullmetal Alchemist.
    ```

- u/narfanator:
  ```
  Welll what if it's not a fanfic? Or, a loose fanfic - one thought that had popped into my head was trying to retell HPMOR as "original" fiction.

  At that point, however, it almost starts turning into an RPG instead, as you'd want different people responsible for the story than the physics, so that the story can investigate the physics...
  ```

- u/gregx1000:

  I would love personally to see either rational!anakin or rational!percy jackson.

- u/tomintheconer:
  ```
  Anyone who isn't op and other writers could help by making a timeline and plot points. Argue over all the rational and 'science'. You could argue over the specifics and rewrite and edit it as you go. Maybe set up a wikia page or whatever for all that stuff. If you're worried about dwindling interest just stick to short stories.
  ```

- u/TimTravel:
  ```
  One technique that would be interesting: readers are randomly split into two groups representing in-universe factions and a game master carefully controls the flow of information between them until the end. That way you don't have to deal with the very difficult task of deciding whether you would have thought of a solution after seeing it / hindsight bias / etc. For phase one everyone does public brainstorming.

  It would still be possible to cheat just by having two online identities of course, but it would prevent "accidental" cheating.

  I suggest a superpower fic that isn't fanfiction. Everyone brainstorms superpowers then the GM hands them out and everyone does a massive online collaborative RP thing.
  ```

  - u/callmebrotherg:
    ```
    Yes. That is a very good idea. I've been thinking about how to implement it off and on for a bit, since I started talking with the writer of rational!Animorphs.

  I would LOVE a rational!OnePiece fanfic. Sadly, I am a horrible rationalist. Also, ration devil fruit users would be horrifying. Rational!pikapikanomi would just destroy everyone instantly

  Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

  In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

  Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

  “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

  The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

  Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

  Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

  L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

  One idea I've been mulling over is a rational [Planet of the Apes (the original 1968 one)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_of_the_Apes_%281968_film%29).  I've recently watched it for a second time and was struck by just how pessimistic and idiotic Taylor was. I want the stranded astronauts to be scientists (something not too far fetched) that can actually figure out what to do and how to negotiate instead of cuss at the apes until they get their hands on a gun and ride off into the sunset with their mute ~~sex slave~~ love interest. 

  One of the main themes of the movie was institutional restriction of science; shown through Dr. Zaius, an orangutan who is both a religious leader and the scientific head-honcho, who is our main villain as the protagonists try to find out the truth. But the movie also argues for the restriction of knowledge by the reveal that [Really lame spoiler that's spoiled by the promotional posters](#s "the Ape's planet is Earth, post nuclear war. The humans wiped themselves out with their horrific technology.") I think this theme can be expanded upon and made more nuanced. 

  But mostly I just want to see an intelligent, rational person deal with being captured by apes that somehow have a reason to speak English 2,000 years in the future. 

  (Also the source material is only one hour and a half long move, so you don't have to watch a 15 season long anime or deal with extended universes or anything.)
  ```

  - u/callmebrotherg:
    ```
    That is a neat idea. Also totally unexpected. 

    What has your idea-mulling netted so far, if you don't mind my asking?
    ```

    - u/CopperZirconium:
      ```
      Ok, I've mostly come up with questions but not solutions for stuff to change:

      * The space ship: the ship should be a colony ship or have some explanation of it's purpose. The vessel in question is a small ship with four people in suspended animation: three males and one female, who dies while in transit. Taylor (the captain and sole surviving crew member after the other men are killed by the apes) says that the woman, Stuart, was supposed to be their "New Eve." Now this is probably just a case of Taylor being scuzzy again, because if they were actually a colony ship, then they should have more than just one female.  Also, the ship arrives on a planet 2,000 years in Earth's future, thanks to relativity. With that kind of time gap any science vessel would be obsolete by the time it could send information back, never mind that the people on board aren't scientists. So the ship isn't a colony ship and it isn't a science ship, what other reason could NASA have for sending them out there?  

      * Let's go with the remake's reason that the apes can speak and humans can't: Alzheimers cure gone horribly wrong. Will the engineered virus still be around to endanger our heroes? I'll go with no.

      * The apes speak English. While that's OK for Hollywood, It doesn't make much sense. Languages change over 2000 years unless they are dead and kept around for some reason. If the apes didn't speak English, then there wouldn't be the farce of Taylor being shot in the neck to prevent him from talking to the apes until the opportune moment. I would probably have my apes speak Old English or archaic German as an approximation of how their language would differ from that of the astronauts. I think that this is a more realistic communication obstacle.

      * I'd kind of like to see it be a "Connecticut Yanky in King Arthur's Court" sort of story with informed tech and science sweeping through the ape's society, but it has to be done in a satisfying way. Namely the humans can't curb-stomp the apes and take over their culture. Looking forward to optimizing ape society would probably be the end state or epilog. 

      * I would want to go deeper in the talks with Zira, Cornelius, and Dr. Zaius about who and what counts as a person, better proof of reasoning skills, the concept of philosophical zombies, the treatment of lab animals, and other topics that the movie only hinted at.
      ```

      - u/callmebrotherg:
        ```
        I like this. Especially the idea of philosophical zombies being discussed. 

        Would we be drifting too far to reassign the ape castes in such a way that each species makes more sense? Frex, IIRC chimpanzees would be better soldiers than gorillas even though they're smaller and less physically imposing. 

        Could the ship have been a proof of concept of some sort? Either they come from a culture or program that is REALLY patient, or it's a good thing that somebody wanted to test the design because it did NOT work as intended.
        ```

        - u/CopperZirconium:
          ```
          So the ship could be a proof of concept but was supposed to only travel for 10 years or so and some how ended up going for 2,000. Maybe it got too close to a weird anomaly that sped it up to a much higher fraction of the speed of light? 

          The criteria for the ship's function/malfunction:

          * Journey takes 2,000 years (or however long it takes to form an ape civilization, if we want to change that number)

          * Arrive back at Earth with sufficient ambiguity on whether it is Earth or not. This includes the ability to land on a planet even if it was not the original destination. (The ambiguity is maybe not necessary, but let's keep with the spirit of the original.)

          * * If the mission was supposed to go to a different planet, there has to be at least some attempt at an explanation for why they are on Earth. 

          * Crash land in such a way that the ship can't fly but our heroes survive. (To put the astronauts on equal footing when they first encounter the apes.)

          So something went wrong, but not *horribly* wrong with the ship... unless the mission was to time travel to the future to re-seed the earth after a nuclear war. (But in that case there is no ambiguity about their location.)
          ```

      - u/callmebrotherg:
        ```
        Also, there will no doubt be numerous ape nations. Choosing which one(s) to help will be very important. You don't want to end up giving a technological revolution to Ape Hitler because you didn't do a background check.
        ```

        - u/CopperZirconium:
          ```
          Good point. And if worse comes to worse, they could poach the best apes from multiple tribes. If we assume that Zira and Cornelius are not unique, I think that there could be quite a few young apes discontent with their current society.
          ```

  - u/E-o_o-3:
    ```
    Keeping in mind though, that these apes in a political Dark ages, have a repressive religious order that intentionally keeps knowledge secret ruling the world, and a caste based heirarchical society, and (though canon didn't touch on this) may well have irreconcilable psychological differences which might make interacting with them difficult for humans. There might be several good reasons for even a more reasonable version of Taylor to hate them.

    Also, it would be fun to explore the different psychologies of the uplifted ape species. We have orangutangs, gorillas, chimpanzees/bonobos (canon was written at a time when that distinction wasn't made). Canon implies that the current ape caste system has orangutangs as rulers, gorillas are military, and chimps are everyone else. The apes have to deal with a diversity of sentient species that cannot interbreed, which is more diversity than we as humans have had to deal with. This sets a nice precedent for human-ape relations actually, since adding humans to the caste tree shouldn't be that hard.

    Other questions: Is the ape technology re-discovered, or did they take human tech and gradually decline from there? Clearly they *have* scientists, so they shouldn't decline that far, but are they really as smart as humans were on average, and are they smart in the same *directions*?)
    ```

  ```
  How about a rational!Trek that takes the rights of holodeck characters and ships seriously?

  Oh, wait, that's Iain Bank's *Culture* series. :)
