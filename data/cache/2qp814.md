## Posting a rational FF when completely new to Reddit

### Post:

I completed (last year) a novel exploring the likely rational aftermath of the only ending to the Mass Effect 3 video game which permitted the protagonist a future. 

Partly this was to tick off an item ("Novel") on my bucket list, partly a reaction to the lack of closure, mostly because I felt that the scientific accuracy of opinions on the game was lamentable. 

It was posted on Fanfiction.net. A short time ago I heard about Reddit from my (scientist) daughter. The fanfic in question probably should have been posted on Reddit's /r/rational. 

While extremely computer literate, I'm yet a complete stranger to social media, including Reddit, so am asking for assistance in posting this story where it might be appreciated - for whatever it's worth:

Relevant details:
- The title is "After Dark". 
- Link to the story:

  ```
  Fanfiction.net is a good place to post fan fiction. Just post a link to your story wherever you want to promote. (e.g. here or on wherever mass effect fans are)
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  You take the link where you put it up on the internet, and you post that link to this subreddit by clicking "Submit a new link".
  ```

  ```
  You've come to the right place :) Just edit your post to include a link (or the title, or other identifying information), or post a link in a comment, and our hundreds - nay - dozens of regulars would love to check it out.

  R/FanTheories will want to see this
