## Perils of Innocence - a HP fanfic

### Post:

[Perils of Innocence](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8429437/1/The-Perils-of-Innocence) features a Harry Potter that's been abandoned by the Dursleys after he exhibited one bout of accidental magic too many. Growing up in Esperança House, an institution for children with social or psychological problems, Harry blossoms in a far more caring and nurturing environment, and the resident doctors try to help him with his inexplicable incidents. 

When two other children suffering similar symptoms - Hermione Granger and Dean Thomas - are enrolled at Esperança House, they get an opportunity to both help the kids control their strange abilities, and experiment with the limits of what they're able to do. When three letters arrive, written in green ink on parchment and delivered by owls, they raise even more questions than they answer.

The scientific trial-and-error examination of not-quite-accidental magic of the three Muggle-born and -raised children, is not always center stage in the story. Nevertheless, a considerable amount of focus is given to the research conducted by both children and adult scientists. Later on, the story raises interesting contrasts between accidental magic and wandless magic.

  I actually read this a few weeks ago. I made it around 2/3 of the way through (chapter 24) before I dropped it. The rational stuff was done okay and the first two or three chapters were pretty good, but it suffers from a common fanfiction problem of not really having a plot. Like HPMOR and many other fics, it comments on the canon events, but unlike HPMOR it doesn't really go anywhere interesting with that. Also, something about the child characters and their interactions seemed a little fake to me, but since I don't really have that much experience with children and struggle with writing them too maybe I'm not the best judge of that.

  It's fairly good.  I can't tell if my disagreements with the behavior of certain parties, especially Dumbledore, is due to a different interpretation of canon or the influence of HPMOR.  The explanation of why Dumbles would be OK with Black's treatment was both elegant and uplifting.  If nothing else, I really really liked that.
