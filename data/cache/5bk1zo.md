  Probably not secure enough. Even telepathy can be intercepted by the likes of the Other King. Beanie Baby portals are only useful if they're absolutely secure - it costs the likes of the Other King or the Drug Lord very little to make a heptagram of their own, if they know the arrangement (and can set up a trap to catch a teleporting Cometspawn). The Beanie Babies are rare and difficult to get hold of at a moment's notice, which is why the system works at all, but even so Jianxiang must expect a trap whenever she uses this method to get around.

  ```
  It's not entirely clear that hardline internet access would be a virtue inside of NORAD, and more complex ways of maintaining access to other people would work (wifi or 3G, for instance, appear to not be available).
