  Hum, rather than a succession of "it's rationalist", "it's not really", "maybe it's rational", "the original isn't"... maybe actual arguments for why it is or isn't this or that would be more constructive ?

  I guess I'll try, since I'm currently watching it (ep9)

  One thing is certain : it's not "rationalist".

  >Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of **rationalist fiction**, a subcategory of rational fiction.

  Characters from this story don't care much about being rational or not.

  Now are they and the story rational ?    
  I suppose I can see how the main character could be seen as such : there is an apparent focus on him learning how things work and trying to deconstruct those to build new things never seen before. Though that attempt is very shallow and no amount of "how" is actually explained... especially how main character's original programming skills play any role in all this, aside from "magic is like programming, I'm a super programmer, therefore, I'm a super magician, poof" => well, thanks, I'm a programmer too, I would have liked to be able to relate to that part...

  The story seems to be trying not to be too linear either, but again... shallow attempt, I'd say.

  \----

  I personally find this anime quite nice and refreshing, but not very high on a rational-meter. (though probably higher than many others)

  Could be interesting to see which anime are considered rational by the community.    
  Log Horizon is the first one that comes to my mind.

    It's been a while since I watched [*Zetsuen no Tempest*](https://myanimelist.net/anime/14075/Zetsuen_no_Tempest), but if I recall correctly, it's the most rational one of those I've seen. Suffice to say that characters behave sensibly enough, not bound by their assigned story roles. Another interesting trope is a >!Good vs. Good conflict!<.

    The highlight for me was (mild spoiler for Season 1) >!the final battle of Season 1, which consisted of four people standing on a hill and intensely arguing with each other about idiosyncratic magic mechanics.!<

    Season 2 drops the ball a bit, though, but doesn't disappoint outright.

      I can second that recommendation for Zetsuen no Tempest. Season 1 was great.

      Thank you! It looks very interesting!

      (My goal all along was to get people to disprove my "one of the most rationalist anime I've seen" by providing counter examples... so I could watch them)

    Some actually rational ones:

    \- Cowboy bebop  
    \- Suisei no Gargantua  
    \- The melancholy of Haruhi suzumia  
    \- One punch man  
    \- Mob Psyco 100

    &#x200B;

    Not so strictly rational as the above but still close:  
    \- the monogatari series  
    \- Made in Abyss  
    \- FLCL  
    \- Code Geas  
    \- No game no life  
    \- Stien's gate

    &#x200B;

    And most likely tones more I have just forgotten about since I watched them 4+ years ago or didn't personally enjoy enough to put on the list.

    Deconstructing some of the rational(ist) things I enjoyed (that was a lot of show not tell):

    * The gun type rod. Yes he has prior knowledge, but it's the obviously superior way to build something which must be aimed.
    * Using rods to fly. He would have to think this one out, his prior knowledge is simply "flying is a useful tactical advantage". Figuring out how to do that within the magic system would be more interesting with more details, but we can see how he evolved the spell from the wind blast on the roof tops, and for propelling the dwarf.
    * When the demons attack he isn't conflicted with bystander bias - this is also demonstrated earlier somewhat at his job - and while he has ulterior motives, it is borderline rational**ist**.
    * When he points out that just because robots were designed after people to begin with they are just machines, tools, and we should add the functionality we need. Changing that kind of thinking in the people around him.
      * For example a couple episodes later, one of the people he is working with repeats his own wisdom back to him and finds the solution to a problem.
    * (Elves Spoiler) >!When he learns the magic of creating the reactors, he works around the problems that limit it to elves only using the tools available to him. This is as close to a fair play munchkin puzzle as it gets from my memory, but it's at least there for like 5 minutes.!<
    * (Edit) The first real villain and counter play with the villain is straight forward. She acts rationally, and he acts rationally in return.
      * Also the trope awareness of adding keys to the machines. Basically every mech anime involves people stealing other mechs multiple times over, and they only do it the once here.

    Probably more that I forget, I only just re-watched the first two episodes the other night. It was only with the context of having re-read HPMOR recently that I even saw it as rational~~ist~~ at all. (Edit on re-watching more of it, I added some more thoughts).

  ```
  Rationalist? Not really. It's the usual shounen tropes but with fantasy mecha instead of powerlevels or jutsu. Not that that's a bad thing, it's a fun show I legitimately enjoyed. But describing it as rationalist is a stretch at best.

    It's not like there is a lot of crowd on top of the list. :D

      The Promised Neverland has an anime coming out, so does Kaguya-sama: Love Is War come to think of it.
      ```

      ```
      I'd say Hunter x Hunter is the most rationalist anime I've watched. The reasoning and mind games that characters get into is really entertaining.
      ```

  - u/LazarusRises:
    ```
    Is it rational~~ist~~ though?
    ```

- u/Dragfie:
  ```
  The manga and webnovel were both plot-hole filled irrational trash IMO, is the anime much better?
  ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    nope

    but as other people have pointed out, when you're talking about anime and manga the qualifier "one of the most rational" is a fairly low bar.
    ```

    - u/Dragfie:
      ```
      Really? maybe for isekai anime but not in general at all, things like Bebop and Suisei no gargantua is very rational IMO, close to contending with the stories most popular here.
      ```

- u/Law_Student:
  ```
  Why is there a grammar error in the title of the anime?
  ```

  - u/Noumero:
    ```
    Why not?

    Anime is produced in Japan, by Japanese people, and their main audience are Japanese people too. Most of them know English well enough to recognize and read most common words, but not well enough to spot obvious grammatical or syntactical errors. Therefore, anime producers have a market incentive to include gratuitous English in titles/names/places where it would look cool, whereas the incentive to ensure that it's grammatically correct — or, indeed, meaningful — is comparatively weaker.

    That given, there is absolutely no reason to expect anime creators to sanity-check their use of a foreign language with someone who actually speaks it before including it in their work.
    ```

    - u/Law_Student:
      ```
      It's wrong in the English audience versions too.
