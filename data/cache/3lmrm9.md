## The Traitor Baru Cormorant

### Post:

Seth Dickinson expanded one of his earlier short stories into a novel:

Edit: While looking into all his other stuff, I found this - the author himself selling the book better than I even could: http://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/sci-fi-fantasy/guest-post-seth-dickinson-on-building-a-better-evil-overlord/

I just finished reading the book and think it would be perfect for the subreddit. Characterization is superb and the narrative flows logically - the main character is an accountant and often makes strategy decisions based on economics.

For fans of GoT: Imagine a Westeros where the head of every House is Littlefinger, and the main character is Varys+Littlefinger Daenerys+Roose Bolton



For those without the time or money to read a full novel, there is a short story preceding the publication of the novel. Warning - this short is almost word for word the ending chapter of the novel, and thus is potentially a huge spoiler. That said, if you like the story, the book is still worth the journey even when you know the destination:

    [Spoilers all](#s "Agreed, I'm still reeling from that gut punch. One thing that bothered me is that if the Steering Committee wants a hold on Baru and can't get it, what protection does Baru have at all from the other members getting that hold over her or just ordering a straight up assassination? Baru is valuable and perhaps there's a sense of mutual cooperation and game that no one wants to risk spoiling, so I get that. But I don't get how Baru is suddenly so secure in her position. I don't know, perhaps I'm not accurately modeling how a technocracy with a hidden steering committee would behave. They're not Byzantine generals and there's some amount of mutual benefit and shared utility functions among the major players, but why is Baru so seemingly secure and snug in her power at the end? If she had some network of spies and assassins she built up and maintained then perhaps, but what real power does she wield as a steering committee member? Not sure, maybe I'm missing details")

      [Spoilers all](#s "Probably because she isn't. Oh, poor Baru Cormorant, the savant with half her world cut away. Oh, poor Baru Fisher, traitor to every heart and every eye. She always was prone to forgetting: She is not the only player on the board.")

    I just finished this.

    Just... goddamn. I honestly only saw it coming about 5 pages before it happened.

    Damn.

  I have the book in front of me and I'm about to finish chapter 8. I have to say, so far it is very good. The worldbuilding is impressive, and the characters impressively rational.
