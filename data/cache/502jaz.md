  Now I'm curious as to how exactly Sohu is going to die, given her supposed immortality.
  ```

  - u/sir_pirriplin:
    ```
    Sohu can ask Uriel to kill her.

    Maybe the Cometspawn will pre-commit to killing themselves and cursing their father after they invade Hell.

      I highly doubt that, the world isn't munchkinable in that way.

      When you try to skip steps you end up with a city of lsd or fallen angels

    Presumably when the universe ends. I doubt her immortality would survive the end of all things.

  ...I am kind of puzzled by the fact that the Comet King, who apparently can understand placebomancy, thought this would work.  Maybe the genre he views his placebomancy is from antiquity where spawning a massive army would be viewed as a valid strategy?  Even so, and then the invincible super army of Demihumans curb-stomped hell seems like a really lame story ending.  Plus placebomancy should make conservation of ninjutsu a thing.

    Demihumans are strictly cooler than normal humans though, so worst case scenario, the Demihumans still have a rule of cool bonus that the mundane humans lack.

  Four horsemen?
  ```

  - u/ulyssessword:
    ```
    Four Anti-Horsemen?  Sohu is immortal, hence "Anti-Death", and the others might be "Anti-War", "Anti-Famine", and "Anti-Conquest/Pestilence".
    ```

    - u/ZeroNihilist:
      ```
      So Immortality, Peace, Plenty, and Liberty/Health?
      ```

      - u/Blackdutchie:
        ```
        Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness? I feel like this might show up at some point.

  One of my greatest hopes for this sub is to produce or direct me to a story that actually uses prophecies to make the story better, rather than undercut agency, spoil plot points, and artificially entice readers.

  I'm still on board and enjoying Unsong a lot, despite some criticisms expressed by others, but this chapter ending is going to bother me for awhile. Here's hoping it leads to an ingenious twist, but it's a feeble hope, tired from repeated disappointment. And even if it does, I'll probably still think the story would have been better without it in the first place.

  God I hate prophecies. Just... so, [so much.](https://m.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2z5ooe/d_goddamn_do_i_hate_prophecies)

    Does The Lego Movie count?
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Sort of. It was one of the better inversions I've seen, but it was also more or less played straight (in that he really did end up being the person who saved the world) which leaves it in a grey area.
      ```

      - u/ketura:

        I suppose all that's left on the true-false/taken seriously-ignored graph is a prophecy that everyone takes seriously that is completely false. If it's a prophecy on the side of the protagonist, it's going to be a downer when everything falls apart. If it's on the side of the antagonist, well...what's different from the villain saying "I'm going to conquer you" and a false Oracle saying "he's going to conquer you" after all is said and done? Narratively, I'm not sure it can be useful, outside the misinterpreted prophecy trope.
        ```

    I'm suddenly interested in thinking about how prophecy affects stories.  I read Erfworld a lot, and there at least there's a depressing "the future is written" vibe where if you try to fight Fate terrible things happen, while if you try to manipulate Fate so that it turns out well within the bounds of prophecy, then terrible things happen anyway.  There's precious little to do but hope that your Fate is  a pleasant one.

     > The less you know about what is to come, about your Fate, then the easier it will be for you to get there, the less...you and others will have to suffer, to lose.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      That sounds terrible o_O Not just in the "I'd hate to live there" sense (hell we probably don't have free will in the real world anyway), I mean as a story. I know some people don't mind spoilers, but I would grow utterly bored with the books once it was clear the characters could do nothing to change anything important.
      ```

      - u/VorpalAuroch:
        ```
        Well, the main character is from outside the world, and has already broken one universal law of the world. ('No Swearing.')

        And he was summoned by a spell that wanted to find someone who fought war on war itself, to disrupt the constant state of Erf War.
        ```

  ```
  Wait, why would he stop having kids? Just because they'd die agonizing deaths? But if that increases the chances of pushing hell back, even by a bit? Wouldn't it be worth it? This seems kinda OOC to me. 
  Also, I'm uncertain about this, but it seems to me that if he had had more kids, the prophecy wouldn't come about. Or, if he pre-committed to have more kids no matter what, the prophecy wouldn't have come. After all, the prophecy was about a world where he only had four kids. I'm not entirely certain about how prophecy works, but i think if he pre-committed had more kids and keeping one in a constant coma in his palace or something, the prophecy couldn't have come true.
  TL;DR: letting a prophecy deter you from a course of action seems like a bad idea, as if you do, the negative outcome will only come to pass in the world where you were deterred, but not necessarily in the one where you continued. You have no information about the potential world where you continued with the action, so you should just go with your original decision.

    ```
    The circumstances described by the prophecy imply that the Comet King's plan will fail.  Given that implication, he decided to cut his losses.
    ```

- u/ThatDarnSJDoubleW:
  ```
  I was going to say that the protesters feel too strawman-ish, but then remembered one of the Republican Presidents in this story literally made a deal with the Devil, and the other was a robot puppeted by an angel.

  TCK was kind of casual about having kids, which reminds me of Anna and the MC being kind of casual about getting kabbalistically married. Is this a bad omen for them? TINACBNIEAC?
