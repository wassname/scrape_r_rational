  In vaguely-somewhat-rational-adjacent fanfiction, the Harry Potter / The Culture crossover [Death By Water](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/death-by-water-harry-potter-the-culture.44788/) is pretty good. The beginning couple of chapters are more than a bit rough, but it picks up and improves a lot in later chapters. If you're not into it by Ch. 7 or so, you should *probably* give up. In particular, Ch. 11's potions class is absolutely delightful and I love that chapter a lot. Also, Quirrelmort confirmed for SSC reader. They're updating at a fairly quick pace, too.

    I've personally tried to read the Culture series a few times, but I always get about five chapters in and lose my interest. I've tried starting with Player of Games and Consider Phlebas. 

    However, all the Culture fanfics that I've found (of which this is the fifth - I've seen two Harry Potter crossovers, one BtVS crossover, and one Worm crossover before) have all been high quality and very intriguing. I have yet to read this specific fic, but my priors are quite high for this being good.

    EDIT:
    The fics are:

    * (Harry Potter) https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3983128/1/Culture-Shock 
    * (Worm) https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/you-needed-opponents-with-gravitas-worm-the-culture.512650/
    * (Buffy) https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11338629/1/Collision-Course

    There was another HP fanfic, but I can't find it now.

    In searching for these three, I found a few others that I have yet to read:

    * (Lensman) http://bbs.stardestroyer.net/viewtopic.php?t=17812
    * (Star Trek) http://bbs.stardestroyer.net/viewtopic.php?t=14323

    - u/Zyphane:
      ```
      Eh, I don't think Player of Games is as great as everyone says it is. Consider Phlebas is fun, but the least "Culture-y" of all the books. I'm partial to Use of Weapons and Excession. Use of Weapons I think is the best "here's the Culture from the POV of an outsider" narrative, plus it's just a great personal story for the protagonist. Excession may be the best Culture book in my opinion, because it focuses heavily on the Minds, which are really the best part of the series.
      ```

      - u/phylogenik:
        ```
        It's been a good while since I read the Culture series but I did read it in its entirely and agree that Player of Games and Consider Phlebas were overhyped relative to my tastes. I don't think I enjoyed Excession much *because* of its heavy focus on the Minds (IIRC), in that I find the idea of benevolent mysterious superintelligences works a lot better from a distance, where you only see them performing feats of miraculous technomagic or explicitly dumbing themselves down to avatar form for interaction with humans. I think Excession showed those chatrooms that let you peer directly into the thought processes of the Minds, and they read like any old interhuman chatroom conversation, even if they occurred on the scale of nanoseconds or whatever. Focusing on the Minds just revealed the wizard behind the curtain that was Iain Banks making everything up, and Banks was decidedly not a post-singularity superintelligence. Bit suspension of disbelief breaking, that was.

        My favorites, though, were Use of Weapons and Surface Detail (which should be read in that order), the latter because it explored some vaguely interesting questions like the nature of personal identity or the moral status of simulated individuals.

  Anyone knows good Abridged Series? The ones I'm watching or watched:

  - [DBZA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nYozPLpJRE&list=PL6EC7B047181AD013) (ongoing) is a classic. Probably the most popular Abridged series there is, made by the very talented guys of TeamFourStar, including LittleKuriboh, the creator of Abridged Series as a concept.

  - [CDZA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQ0yOmtl96A&list=PLE8663CF9B6EA072E&index=1) (complete): The best French Abridged Series (that I know of). Based on Saint Seya. This the same guy who made the French Abridged Yu-gi-oh sketch for the Joueur du Grenier, for all the 0 persons who know what I'm talking about. Hurry up, 'cause it's being taken down and the creator has said he doesn't intend to fight with the Youtube system anymore (though back ups can probably be found). Again, it's in French, but from what I've seen the subs are decent and even the puns are pretty well translated (though I'm not sure how well the 90s French cartoon dub references carry over).

  - [Abridged on Titan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKHHqIF-yM4&list=PLqRvzulx5xsqvS7obEPGhsXJ2VwLWOX9A) (complete): Covers Attack on Titan's first season, made by Reality Punch Studios with Kaiserneko from TeamFourStar. High production quality, but maybe a little generic. It's basically a shorter, wittier version of Attack on Titan. The author also made Fist Master, which seems to be in hiatus now that he's working with TFS.

  - [Freeman's Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQhfkpX9bc&list=PL6PNZBb6b9LvDWpI-5CPYUxG1Rnm-vr9V) (ongoing). This is pretty long, and gets pretty high quality after a while. Covers the entirety of Half Life, and now the beginning of Half Life 2 (and launched a thousand spin-offs by other people into Portal, Opposing Force, etc, most aren't that good). Described by the author as "If I were a jackass, what would I do?" The author also did Civil Protection, a 10 years old video series that explores what life would be like working as a cop for the combine (it's smarter than it sounds), and Ross's Game Dungeon, a video series about interesting and rarely covered games (some reviews really made me want to play the games, like the one for Strife).

  - [Full Metal Alchemist Anotherhood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTKzdPCyZ9c) (complete): A different take on how the Elric brothers could have exploited their powers to reach their goals. Shorter than FMA.

  - [Sword Art Online Abridged](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6kJKxvbgZ0&index=1&list=PLuAOJfsMefuej06Q3n4QrSSC7qYjQ-FlU) (complete): There are fanfictions made out of love and wanting more of a compelling universe, and there are fanfics made of hatred and wanting to prove to the world that, *yes, you can do better and you fucking should*. SAO Abridged is in the second category. Production quality is pretty high by Abridged Series standards. As a mark of quality, features Takahata101 from TeamFourStar as Heathcliff.

  - [Young Justice Abridged](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZrqs5c9tNA&list=PLFEE5FB7BF31B8FF7) (ongoing): Started as a dub of YJ, and branched out on DC animated movies (Red Hood, Crisis on Two Earths, etc). The production quality is not as high as the others I linked and the humor can feel a bit forced (especially in the beginning), but that's par for the course for an Abridged Series. Maybe watch one of their latest Abridged Movies first to get an idea of what they're like at their best.

  - [Korra Bridged](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9yy7WxzLgQ&list=PLKC7HY2CHv4uh1TUUFe03F9_Roa9TgQ5q) (ongoing) (not to be confused with Korra Abridged, which I don't like as much): This is probably the least well known Abridged Series with good production quality I've ever seen. It's a light spoof on Korra, focused less on meta humor or plot and more on character interactions and personal growth. Season 1 is complete, Season 2 ongoing. These guys also made a Code Geass Abridged, and you can see how far they went since the first episode the original author uploaded.

  - [Hellsing Utimate Abridged](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgnIjJexut4à) (ongoing): Made by TeamFourStar. Very funny in an over-the-top vulgar way, with a lot of violence ridiculously obscene dialogues. Since this is TFS, the production quality is basically on a commercial level.

  ---

  Also, I've you're a fan of DC animated movies and you've somehow missed it, definitely check out Batman: Gotham by Gaslight. I thought it would be really tacky and stereotype-y and over-sexualized, but it's actually really thoughtful and well done and it's up there with *Gods and Monsters* among my favorite DC movies ever.

    A couple more good abridged series are Faulerro's [danganronpa abridged thing](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ2qHjL_gVN577A6Qam2V1-RghVuB8zfy) and [nullmetal alchemist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS_eWXHBYXhOWIvE3vLNauKLvpyDgzqJ9). Both have good writing and production quality, don't take themselves especially seriously, and are unfortunately dead. There is still enough to enjoy


    One hidden gem I found recently is BAC's [Bleach S](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL853Lf5HtEQwn7VaHPrxl2efFbSuBYVLk) wherein Ichigo just wants to talk thing out with whoever it is that he happens to be fighting, Orihime is dangerously genre savvy, and ~~Aizen~~Josh Groban is just as terrifying as he should be. They update regularly, and have just remade the first episode to be more representative of the later ones quality

  (Should probably make this a proper top level post, but feeling lazy)

  I recommend [Almost Nowhere](http://archiveofourown.org/works/8341348?view_full_work=true), an original web-serial by u/nostalgebraist whom we know and love for [The Northern Caves](http://archiveofourown.org/works/3659997/chapters/8088522). There was a year-long gap in updates, but the author finally starting updating it weekly once again. If you dropped the story because of the horrible update schedule, you could give it a second try now.

  What's it like? It looks like it's going to be hard sci-fi, but it's one of those stories where there's a ton of weird stuff going on and it's all told out of order, from the povs of several not entirely reliable, uncomprehending narrators, so just keeping up with the plot and figuring out what's going on is almost like a puzzle.

  Also, it seems to feature aliens who are disgusted with humanity for reasons that can only be expressed via differential geometry... or at least I think that it does.

  If all of this sounds appealing to you, you will probably enjoy almost all of *Almost Nowhere*, except maybe for some measure zero subset of it.

  I'm recommending... a Pewdiepie video.

  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_qiYc133U

  He reviewed five books that he read in January: *Consider Phlebas* by Ian M. Banks, *Brave New World* by Aldous Huxley, *Fahrenheit 451* by Ray Bradbury (spoiler: he didn't particularly care for that one), *the Picture of Dorian Gray* by Oscar Wilde, *Children of Time* by Adrian Tchaikovsky, and *12 Rules for Life* by Jordan B. Peterson. At the end he says that this month he's reading *Beyond Good and Evil* by Friedrich Nietzsche and *Life 3.0* by Max Tegmark. I'll be pretty interested to see *that* video. 

  It was interesting to listen to him talk about books. Very different from his typical videos.

  Another recommendation, the most recent book I've read is [*the Third Class at Miss Kaye's*](https://ia801401.us.archive.org/32/items/thirdclassatmiss00braz/thirdclassatmiss00braz.pdf) by Angela Brazil, it's a children's book written in 1908 about an 11-year-old girl who gets sent off to boarding school because her parents think she's too spoiled because she would rather read than interact socially with other children, so it's basically cotton candy, very fluffy and light reading, which is nice sometimes. It's completely non-rational, but you might enjoy it.

  I always eagerly await this thread but haven't contributed before, so here are some recommendations you guys might enjoy:

  (A Song of Ice and Fire / Game of Thrones top-quality fanfictions)

  [Purple Days](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/reader): awesome Joffrey Baratheon time-loop. Yeah, no kidding. The world-building, character development and existential dread in this one are unbelievable, and it pays off big time towards the latest chapters. Still in-progress, with irregular but fairly reliable updates.

  [Summer Crowns](https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/summer-crowns-au.425453/): Robert Baratheon gives up on the Iron Throne to chase after Rhaegar Targaryen, who fled to Essos after losing the war. He is followed by Eddard Stark, Jaime Lannister and the Blackfish among others. Quickly turns into the legendary tale of the Dragonhunt and the newly-formed Kingdom of Summer's war against slavery. Note: in-progress and requires an AH.com account to read, but is updated regularly. 

  [Rhaegar the Great; or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Embrace the Suck](https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/rhaegar-the-great-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-embrace-the-suck.396456/): Engrossing and very well-written Rhaegar self-insert. Shakespeare plays get adapted to Westeros, and plot ensues.. Note: also on AH.com, complete with a sequel in-progress.

  ```
  [Pop Team Epic](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PopTeamEpic) may be the weirdest anime I have ever seen, and that alone makes it worth checking out. It started off as a 4-koma strip, then became an internet meme, and now has become a show about meta-humor and pop culture references that gives the same sensation as reading dumb memes while actively producing more memes.

  Every episode I’ve seen so far has been a parade of absurdist scenes that parody animation, video games, Japanese television, and itself with no overarching thematic elements. At the halfway point, they roll the credits and then episode repeats from the beginning with different voice actors and *some* dialogue changed. 

  I can’t definitively say I like the show since it has none of the elements I usually want from comedy shows, but even when I didn’t laugh I still *got* the joke. I weirdly respect it for how it trolls the audience by violating its “premise”, makes you cringe with awkward direction, and never comes across as badly made even when poor production values are the joke.

  The show is still airing week-by-week, but I honestly think that’s the best way to consume this show, binging it would cause [kuso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuso) burnout. There’s only so much “WTF was that?” a person can handle in one sitting. I personally recommend the dub since bizarre line delivery is a common joke and, for me, that didn’t come across with subtitles.

    I've been keeping up with that, and I don't know why. I can't even say I like Anime as a medium.

      I completely agree with you. This show just **is**. I don’t know why I enjoy it, but the fact that it can make me feel that way without being annoying or frustrating is something that has never happened to me before so apparently it’s doing something right and it’s *certainly* unique.

    I just binged five episodes of it. I'm feeling like a victim of [SCP-3999](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3999) would feel, I think. It's fascinating.

    [WMG](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing) ahead, beware:

    Pipimi and Popuko are eldritch abominations similar to SCP-3999. They're nearly-omnipotent entities of pure chaos that take joy in infecting worlds of fictional stories and turning them to random, unordered directions, making their inhabitants into toys for their alien amusement. *Sometimes* there appear hints of a prolonged narrative, because "order" is a subset of "chaos", but they're always just as quickly swept away. The entire show is taking place in a desecrated carcass of *Hoshiiro Girldrop*, the first anime Pipimi and Popuko infected: that's what first episode's beginning was about, and why the next episode previews are consistently from it (of course, this "consistency" is just a sneer of Pipimi and Popuko at our pathetic attempts to find order in chaos).

    (I'm sorry, I'm just really into cosmic horror.)
    ```

    - u/trekie140:
      ```
      As far as in-universe explanations go, it’s as good as we’ll probably ever get. Hoshiiro Girldrop is actually a reference to/reimagining of a joke from the original comic strip, where the author tricked his fans into thinking he was working on an actual rom com manga and kept it going for multiple chapters until the utterly nonsensical reveal of Pop Team Epic.

  While I'm not a huge fan of ASoIaF (I read the first three books then stopped because the pacing was bad and I wasn't invested in any of the characters), I like that that type of setting - dark, brutal fantasy with low magic - has become more popular. Has anyone else read The Left Hand of God trilogy, Son of the Morning, or The Broken Empire trilogy? There's also Joe Abercrombie's stuff but I'm only just getting started on that.

  Some of it reminds me of the Drenai setting by David Gemmell, which is obviously somewhat older (also where my username is from), but that tends to have a little more heroics.

  There're quite a few rational and rational-adjacent stories that are very similar - Practical Guide to Evil and Worm are both close enough in some way that I feel like they form a cohesive group, although I'm not sure what to call it.

  If anyone has other recommendations in the same direction, I'd be quite appreciative. Also, if you enjoyed any of the books or series I mentioned and want to talk about which others are similar or are likely to also interest you, I'm more than happy to chat about it.

    > If anyone has other recommendations in the same direction, I'd be quite appreciative.

    It's not quite low magic, but if you enjoy brutal and realistic dark fantasy you might appreciate Glen Cook's Black Company series.
    ```

  - u/Laborbuch:
    ```
    I’d recommend The Black Company by Glen Cook ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Company)) ([TVT](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBlackCompany)). It follows the events of the eponymous mercenary company in a medieval fantasy setting as they’re employed by the archetypical evil empire whose original conquerer had been usurped by his wife.

    Personally I enjoyed the books, both for their grey-in-gray setting and the characterisation and their worldbuilding. The series is finished, I think, with the novels now available in the form of three omnibus editions: The Books of the North, The Books of the South, The Books of the Glittering Stone. 

    The magic system isn’t so much as explained as present, with the wizards and witches being the curious opposite of the archetypical glass cannon. The more powerful a wizard is, the harder they are to kill and the longer they live. It’s not clear if that is due to their efforts of their talents, but it remains true.
    ```

  - u/sparkc:
    ```
    Grim dark is the term that’s been coined for that fantasy sub genre. Before I discovered rational fiction it was the majority of what I read. Joe Abercrombie’s works were probably my favourites - if you’re just on his first novel, the trilogy is more than it initially seems - but R Scott Bakkers ‘Second Apocalypse’ series was great and Matthew Stovers Caine series is another I would highly recommend.
    ```

    - u/waylandertheslayer:
      ```
      I don't mean grimdark, exactly. A lot of what qualifies as grimdark (Warhammer 40k, for example) wouldn't quite fit in with the sort of story I mean.

      I think the unifying thread is that the story isn't about whether the protagonist succeeds or not - it's about the price he/she pays to win. Waylander 1 & 2 are good examples of this; on a meta level, Waylander effectively has a 'kill whoever my target is' power, but the story isn't about that.

      It's the same for Half A King, the one Joe Abercrombie book I've finished so far. Yarvi always lives, but he often pays a heavy price, or his allies pay it. In a way, a lot of these books have the same protagonist in different bodies and with different names.

      The one exception is Son of the Morning, which doesn't really have a single protagonist. It's more like Unsong in terms of the setting, but without the humour.
      ```

      - u/sparkc:
        ```
        I’m not sure I could use that definition to identify a group of works. Protagonists winning but at a cost seems like a not uncommon element in a lot of well written fantasy. As best as I can determine the Matthew Stover series fits the bill.

        I should clarify as well that the Joe Abercrombie trilogy and works I spoke about were his non YA works. I stopped his YA trilogy after Half a King.
        ```

        - u/waylandertheslayer:
          ```
          > Protagonists winning but at a cost seems like a not uncommon element in a lot of well written fantasy.

          I definitely agree with this. What's less common is for the protagonist's success to feel almost-guaranteed, but the developmental cost to him/her being the sticking point. It's in some cases almost like the issue isn't whether the character can survive a challenge, but more whether the reader will still be rooting for them afterwards, as they approach the line of 'irredeemably evil' (in the case of e.g. Jorg in the Broken Empire trilogy) or 'as corrupt as the opposition' (as in The Left Hand Of God).

          It's hard to describe what exactly I mean, especially in written form. The sort of conceptual cluster of stories I'm trying vaguely to gesture at isn't necessarily all that coherent in a lot of ways, but I still feel like there's an underlying thread that binds them together.
          ```

- u/Laborbuch:
  ```
  I fear I may have recommended this before already, but in case I did not: Robert J. Sawyer’s *Quintaglio* Trilogy, with the first volume being *Far-Seer*. If I had to give a five second pitch, it’d be: The copernican revolution on a world inhabited by dinosaurs. 

  I forgot which kind exactly, but they’re raptor-like, carnivorous, and very peculiar. For one, their hunting instinct is triggered by blood, pheromones, and violation of personal space. Their culture has many rituals and rules that govern and make allowances to this territoriality, which then feeds into and is picked up by their religious dogmas and such. It’s all very interesting, in my opinion.

  Have some manga:

  [Kusuriya no Hitorigoto](https://mangarock.com/manga/mrs-serie-100099632)
  > In the imperial court, a young woman is put into servitude, Maomao. The tale is just beginning for the woman doctor/pharmacist from the red-light district, as rumors circulate about the emperor's children's lives being short-lived. Her curious nature and thirst for knowledge pushes her to action. To satisfy her curiosity, this young doctor/pharmacist will investigate the origin! What is shifting in the imperial court..!?

  [Goblin Slayer](http://mangakakalot.com/manga/goblin_slayer)
  > A young priestess has formed her first adventuring party, but almost immediately they find themselves in distress. It's the Goblin Slayer who comes to their rescue--a man who's dedicated his life to the extermination of all goblins, by any means necessary. And when rumors of his feats begin to circulate, there's no telling who might come calling next...

  The dude kills goblins. He is very good at it, and not through any super ability nobody else has or unrealistically superhuman skill. He does not want to fight goblins, he just really wants them dead. There are no sudden powerups to match escalating adversity, just meticious planning and preparation. At one point protagonists take out goblin camp by magically putting them all to sleep and suppressing sound propagation in the area, and just proceed to methodically stab them all.
  ```

  - u/KingMako:

    So I'm a chapter into reading Goblin Slayer and I just want to mention that it does not give a single fuck about censoring atrocities. Don't read if you're at work or easily disturbed.

    - u/AurelianoTampa:

      That threw me too; definitely noped out as soon as I got to that part on my work PC. No calls from IT yet, so I think I'm ok...

      Oddly enough, having finished the rest of the available chapters later at home... the series more-or-less backs off from the over-the-top goblin rape/nudity pretty quick after the first few chapters. In one of the more recent chapters there's a scene with two women in a bath with all the tropes of mist and hair covering the sensitive areas. I wonder at the thought process... showing nudity during goblin rape is OK, but showing nudity in a bathing scene is too far? Priorities, guys...

      The goblin killing is as advertised, though.

        I think the censorship decisions is part of focusing the story. Nudity draws attention, and the author makes it easy to pay attention to just how fucked up the setting is. The character's bodies during the bathing scene are unimportant to the plot in comparison to their words.

        It might also be a reflection of the characters' perspectives.

        One of the ongoing themes with the protagonist is that he doesn't care about normal things like love or adventure, instead focusing on the stuff that's relevant to his obsession—these atrocities are signs of goblins. Seeing people in those situations is also probably impossible to not notice when you've got mental scars related to it.

        In the bathing scene, the two characters didn't care about their nudity, possibly causing it to not be the focus of the scene. If the story was meant exclusively to reflect the protagonist's perspective instead of theirs, then he also probably wouldn't care about their nudity.

        If later the story starts caring about bathing scenes—or wondrous imagery inspiring any feelings of adventure—in proportion to character development, then that may confirm the theory.

  Non-rational Harry Potter fanfiction I think people here would like, spurred by the Death By Water rec:

  [The Scarlet Pimpernel](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3784000/1/The-Scarlet-Pimpernel) is a canon-mostly-compliant story from Percy's point of view that takes place during *Deathly Hallows*. It is very cute and intensely personally relatable for the sort of broad-autism-phenotype people I think this community attracts.

  [Reclamation](https://archiveofourown.org/works/924488) is an AU in which Tom Gaunt-nee-Riddle is the Defense Professor at Hogwarts and has been for years. It's very short, so more details would sabotage the emotional work the story does itself, but I highly recommend it.

    Related to #2, have you ever read the classic fanfic Stranger in an Unholy Land?

      Tried it, but I find gritty-action-dark-fantasy HP fanfic unappealing.

  Conventionally published hard SF novel (translated from Japanese): [Orbital Cloud by Taiyo Fujii](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31140453-orbital-cloud).

  This is a technothriller set in the very near future, reminiscent of Neal Stephenson in that it builds convincing technical and scientific details into the plot and features nerdy protagonists using their expertise to achieve their goals. Definitely the kind of realistic hard SF that Stross is talking about in his [recently-discussed post about worldbuilding](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7vse2i/charles_stross_on_consistency_in_worldbuilding/).

  This has been out for a while, but the search engine tells me that it hasn't been mentioned in this subreddit yet. 

  Aside from the enjoyable SF elements, the depiction of the Japanese characters is definitely more convincing than that of the Americans who get involved later, but it's very readably translated and the characters are engaging.

  I recommend Code Lyoko. It's a French cartoon (although it has a very good English dub) that is available [on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqBBMSS2bno&list=PL8E15wc0MoOap139fhJcf-o8xL7YY416C). It's very well done. The first season is a bit formulaic since it was written to be viewable out of order, but later seasons are much less so (especially the fourth). 

  The show is about a group of middle school students who discover a supercomputer that contains a virtual world called Lyoko. On the computer, they have to fight an artificial intelligence who wants to kill humanity.

  It has a small but dedicated English fanbase and I think that it'll really appeal to the large majority of people on this sub.

  [Also, if you want to watch it properly, you might want to start with the [first episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msuusqraTIY&index=2&list=PL8E15wc0MoOap139fhJcf-o8xL7YY416C) rather than the prequel]

    Code Lyoko was good for a children's cartoon, but it's still extremely limited by the format and target audience. There's a lot of better uses for people's time, so I'd only recommend watching this if you are really into cartoons and want something original.

      I second that.

      As someone who absolutely loved Code Lyoko back when it was broadcast and posted about it on r/rational before, I have to say it hasn't aged well.

      It's formulaic as hell (and even in later seasons the show just switches to different formulas), a lot of the run time is copy-pasted filler (the kids getting to the factory, then into the virtual machine), the characters are bland and archetypal (you have the funny idiot, the serious moody guy, the serious action girl, the nerd, the emotion-driven girl, and eventually the new addition who turns out to be a traitor); even the characters with agency are kind of dumb, as in even as a kid I could always figure out what was happening way before they did ("What's this? The robot they brought for their serial killer movie is missing as the same time people are starting to disappear? Ah, I'm sure it's nothing"). The NPCs are stupid and never show any agency except to create problems from the heroes; since it's a kid show, all the adults are useless; the recurring plots are pointless and annoying (rich bully girl is trying to get with the serious moody hero who very obviously isn't into her, rince and repeat for 12 episodes), etc.

      The story itself is a Lost-type plot where the writers went "Okay, so we have this time-travelling video game computer of evil in an old car factory's basement. How did it get there? Secret government agency! We'll figure out the rest later". Re-watching this as an adult, it's very obvious the writers were making things up as they went and hinting to mysteries that were ultimately shallow. Also, as an aside, the "this technology was created by secret government agents" doesn't really work in French settings like it does in American ones. The DGSE just isn't as sexy as the CIA :P

      (another thing that bugged me in retrospect is how lame the protagonists were for a few seasons; they basically spent episode after episode barely winning fights against the Lyoko equivalent of Goombas)

      I mean, there are good things too. The 2D animation is still gorgeous (the 3D parts are very dated, but it's hardly the show's fault); there are a few cool character moments, and the sword guy and fan girl are okay. But ultimately, I think we mostly liked it because it's was the only take on "These kids are playing *inside* the video game!!!" at the time, before the concept was explored to death in anime.
