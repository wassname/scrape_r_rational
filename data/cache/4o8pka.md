**Synopsis**

*What if you really were transported to a fantasy world and expected to kill monsters to survive?*

*No special abilities, no OP weapons, no status screen to boost your stats. Never mind finding the dragon’s treasure or defeating the Demon Lord, you only need to worry about one thing—how to stay alive.*

*All the people summoned form parties and set off on their adventures, leaving behind the people who nobody wants in their group.*

*Story of my life, thinks Colin.*

*Genre: Fantasy, Summoned, Comedy, Adventure, Romance, Slice of Life, non-OP*

I’m not entirely sure this story is appropriate for this sub, but I stumbled across a discussion of my webnovel in your [Monthly Recommendation Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4modgn/monthly_recommendation_thread/d3xawk6) which I enjoyed reading, and I thought maybe people here would be interested. If it’s not the sort of thing you guys like let me know in the comments. 

Just to give a little background, the aim was to write a typical ‘transported to a fantasy world’ story, but with no powers, no ‘chosen one’ advantages handed out willy-nilly,  and a more realistic approach to being attacked by mythical beasts when you don’t have a magic sword or invisibility cloak. It’s still an adventure story, but I tried to make the MC’s actions plausible.

Bear in mind though, he is a 19 year old male with no higher education and some social anxiety issues. His views on sex and race aren’t always the most enlightened and the comedy can be crude (although that’s probably more to do with my puerile sense of humour than his). But it’s written in first person from his perspective and I think it’s consistent with his age group (source: I was 19 years old once).

However, some people have been put off by his view of the world and his behaviour towards those around him (fortunately, some haven’t).

The start of the book is a bit slow. There is a reason for this. It started as an experiment, writing a chapter a day for 30 days straight to see if that would help me build up an audience (answer: yes).

So initial chapters are very short. And it takes a while for the story to take hold because I wrote it with no outline or plan. Each chapter was improvised on the day of posting (still is, although I reduced it to posting 5 days a week). That’s why I used a premise that I was familiar with—so I could use common tropes rather than totally original ideas. I didn’t mind using cliches because I felt the MC’s approach would subvert them, or at least present them in a new light. Characters are also British, as is the spelling and some of the slang.

Anyway, I just finished Chapter 100 marking the end of Book 3. I will be on hiatus for two weeks before starting Book 4. If you’re interested, now would be a good time to catch up.

  Hi there! I was one of the people posting about it in the recommendation thread.

  Despite the flaws and criticism, please don't be disheartened. My criticism was mostly about the character because he's suuuuuuch an immature ass sometimes. But the writing is enjoyable overalland I've found myself literally LOLing many times while reading. If some of the jokes fall short, well, it happens. I very much enjoyed most of what I read. Good job!

  All that said, I wouldn't identify it as purely "rationalist." Still, it does have a lot of characteristics of rationalist writing - plus it is an original story, which frankly I find a lot more interesting than most fan fiction. It's a decent recommendation even if it doesn't really come across as rationalist.

    I don't think of it as purely rationalist either. Certainly that wasn't the focus when I started it. But that kind of approach does underpin the main theme of a regular person in a fantasy world, so I was very interested in the discussion you guys were having.

  [Meta:] Why this format?  This is the second post this week formatted in this exact fashion.

    The format I used is the one I use when posting on /r/noveltranslations which is the main subreddit for serials of this type.

  Well its definitely not rational, but holy hell the humor is on point so fucking hard. All of the little details, like the onesie and characters talking holy shit man. I am on chapter 36. 

  Amusing story, batman out of ten.

  EDIT: Just finished chapter 73. Oh my universe, the story is consistently funny and I am enjoying how you're twisting all the fantasy tropes into somethign new and awesome, screaming fish HAH!

  I've just started reading it, but I'm not impressed so far, honestly.

  Chapter 2 (did you mean scene two? Two hundred words a chapter doesn't make.) :

  >The speaker was a tall, blond guy. Ripped, good-looking, your basic alpha male. He was wearing a tee shirt for a band so cool I’d never heard of them, and knee-length shorts. He looked ready for a trip to the beach and maybe a little surfing. Girls and guys alike huddled around him.

  Like, seriously? This isn't a "Hello world, look at my finished product" paragraph, this is a "fuckfuckfuck I can't get this damned bit out properly, fuck it let's just put some sarcastic author commentary shit and fix it in the first edit pass" paragraph.

  I'll give it another few scenes, but...sorry, not impressed.

  Quick edit:

  >And, girls,” said a guy who had taken up position on Golden Boy’s shoulder, “any of you feeling scared, come see me. I’ll make you feel safe.” He was a black guy with a shaved head and a dazzling smile, wearing a tight vest that showed off his incredibly muscular arms.

  >“Me first,” said a female voice in the crowd, to much tittering.

  Nope, done. Sorry. This is the same sort of thing as I mentioned above. Pre-alpha writing.

  Have you got any more recommendations? I like this story quite a bit, it has its flaws but it is a somewhat clever setting. It also isn't yet another damn fan fic, which there is far too much of on this subreddit.

  I absolutely love this story so far. You have a knack for portraying social interactions with humor, something that I struggle with. The chronically shy MC's inner monologue reminds me so much of my own mindset when I was a teen.

  Although, the MC's apparent willingness to be ruthless really makes me queasy.

- u/Eryemil:

  Interesting so far.  

  Something stood out to me right away however. If this world is not a video game why are there natives acting like video game characters?

  But why would they give the girls weapons at all? They're at a physical disadvantage as fighters of any kind (I won't even speculate on psychological differences) and any weapom they get would provide a greater relative benefit to a boy. Specially when they can be used instead to create new monster hunters and hunter creators in turn. Even if your scruples rebel at the idea of basically forcibly turning these girls into breeding machines---which given the technological level, environmental pressures and comparable historical context the natives would be living in, they should not---plenty of these girls would readily prefer this arrangement to almost certain death. 

  In video games, male and female characters have equal stats and are equally valuable; in real life we have nearly universal division of labour for a very good reason. 

  Will continue reading tomorrow, see if the issue is addressed at all.

  - u/mooderino:
    ```
    If people were summoned simply to make up the numbers (men for fighting, women for breeding) that would imply a population issue, but that doesn't seem to be the case. There is probably another reason.
    ```

    Firstly, your comment ignores things like the ineffective briefing, supplying, and training of the newcomers and for some reason focuses almost entirely on the absence of rape-facilities instead. Your comment also ignores that the girls could’ve been offered positions like medical assistants, technical \ informational advisors, etc. 

    Regarding the rape-factory suggestion itself: 1. much of the relevant and important information is still concealed from the readers for them to be able to determine whether the host governemts’ approach to visitors is effective or not. We don’t know why people get summoned into this world and by whom, what purposes are planned for them by their summoners and their welcoming parties (if these are two different agents), what’s so special about them in the first place, and so on. And without knowing all this, we can’t also tell how effective the hosts’ current approach is in advancing *their* perceived interests.

    > your scruples should not rebel at the idea of basically forcibly turning these girls into breeding machines — plenty of these girls would readily prefer this arrangement to almost certain death.

    1\. That’s a false dichotomy. 2. Plenty of people would also agree to be raped if you put a knife to their throats, which should not be the point. 3. I doubt the moral and value systems of modern-day women would allow most of them to agree to something like this. 4. Even if “plenty of them” agreed to such conditions it wouldn’t mean *all* of them would. And I can easily imagine a person shoehorned into the position of a sex slave deciding to kill whoever they perceived as their primary abuser and\or killing themselves with a stolen and concealed knife.

      So much for steel-manning arguments. Pathetic.
