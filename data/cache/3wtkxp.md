  Now **that** was a fight scene.  This feels like a return to form with Naruto starting to utilize his Uzumaki Style of fighting again.

  With luck, Naruto will let this result take him down a peg.  Naruto had such a big advantage with those clones, combined with henging, and Shikamaru still outplayed him at basically every single point besides his last-minute surrender from Tenten.  The absolute best part of that was that Shikamaru had earplugs in the entire time, and never gave it away, which either means he read Naruto's lips when he yelled at him, or predicted how he would react with ridiculous precision.  This'll teach Naruto to underestimate his opponent.

    The earplugs thing is also great because even if he was somehow struck or caught in the range of the auditory genjutsu, he STILL was fine. He actually had an extra degree of failsafe available.

  Team Anko. :P

    This is my favorite Tenten of all fanfiction Tentens. And there are SO MANY fanfiction Tentens.

  First reaction: Yeah, I was pretty sure Shikamaru was going to advance. Was about 50/50 on whether Naruto would be outright defeated. I like the fact that while this Naruto might be much more rational, he's *not* just The Smartest.

  Second reaction: THAT'S GREAT AND ALL, BUT OUT OF NEJI AND HINATA, WHICH ONE, IF EITHER, ADVANCED???

  >As for learning a super-advanced ninjutsu like the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique without supervision… there were plenty of safer ways to gain new powers, like stabbing himself through the heart with a katana, or making pacts with supernatural beings without checking exactly what they wanted in return. Naruto still couldn't articulate what had possessed him.

    Could be, but that's thick tinfoil right there.

  Woooooow. 

  I can only imagine the mess it was to write that

    I don't think I've ever re-drafted any piece of fiction as many times as I did that chapter.

      By the way, something I forgot to ask. Are the Nara avoiding this weird mistake that I feel like they made in canon that is to wear their equipment on "standard" locations?

      I mean, in canon, during this fight, after Shikamaru gets Kin with the Shadow Repetition, he moves to grab a shuriken and obviously she ends up grabbing one too since both of their pouches are in the relatively same places. If he had just wore his on the other leg he could've grabbed one of hiks shuriken and she would have nothing. 

      Similarly, if a Nara ninja ever finds an enemy, and gets the Shadow Repetition on, they can make the enemy grab one of their kunai from somewhere, where, presumably the Nara would have nothing and make a stabbing motion at your own neck which would be completely harmless for the Nara and lethal to the enemy ninja
      ```

      - u/Velorien:
        ```
        Actually, the chapter covers this.

        It says that Shikamaru wears his kunai holster on the left while most ninja wear it on the right. During the battle, Kin also swaps hers to be on the left, thus preventing "the obvious Shadow Imitation trick" (which you've described). However, Shikamaru has a backup plan ready for this exact eventuality (draw a bladeless, "safe" kunai for himself while forcing Kin to draw a real one).
        ```

        - u/sir_pirriplin:
          ```
          I think canon covers this too. One time, Shikamaru caught Gaara with the shadow and when Naruto punched Gaara, it hurt Shikamaru as well. So making an enemy cut himself might not be safe.

          However, it can still serve as a bluff to make them surrender.
          ```

          - u/Velorien:
            ```
            I interpret that as a case of "forced movement works both ways, so if something moves the target, the feedback moves you too, potentially violently". Presumably, if you cut someone's throat, you'd immediately break the link before their death throes affected you (or maybe if you were strong enough you could hold them still even then).
            ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I think I've got a brain-boner.

  Still doesn't explain how the fuck Shikamaru thinks, though.
  ```
