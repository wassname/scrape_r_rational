  Red's argument for humans being more important assumes its conclusion in its premises.  If you're going by the effect the death has on others, why are they rating the deaths of both groups by their effects on humans, rather than rating the affect on a pokemon of the death of another pokemon?  Also, the argument defines value of a life solely as its effects on other lives, so in that system it wouldn't be immoral to kill a homeless person with no friends, or kill someone and trick everyone into thinking they aren't dead.  

  Obviously you can have him be wrong if you want, but it annoyed me.

  Typo: "Keep laughing when after I catch one" When or after, pick one.

  It's jarring to see humans and pokemon referred to as "the two species". That's definitely not the right word, but I can't think of anything better... I'd probably just go with "the two" or "they" until I thought of something.

  I certainly wasn't expecting Leaf to be a Plasma sympathizer! I see why you made her a native of Unova. That's a very good way to inject some philosophical discussion into the story, and I applaud you for it.

  I also really like the little traces of color you're sprinkling around. Sit-down restaurant, dogs welcome. Birds the size of an ultralight landing on the street, whatever. Please help yourself to the ficus. Keep it up!

    It gets a bit complicated because on our planet, "species" are defined as being all capable of interbreeding within the same classification, but in Pokemon, the way they can interbreed is very unorganized.  So you could for example say "bug species," but many bugs can also breed with water pokemon or field pokemon, who themselves are made up of practically every type in the game. But ultimately all pokemon are part of the same species, while humans are distinct from them.

  I think there were some tense shifts.

  I definitely get the feeling that there's some sort of foreshadowing or something going on in this chapter, that the traces of color Anakiri mentioned aren't just for color.

  I like the new title.

  Really good story, I've enjoyed it so far. The writing is brisk. I'm not part of the rationalist community, so I can't nitpick that part. Anyway, keep it up!
