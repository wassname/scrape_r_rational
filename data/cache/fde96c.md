## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  In my world, a few hundred years ago some irresponsible individual created a species of sea serpents much larger than real world whales, some of them over 1000 feet long. They are not immortal, but they are very tough to kill. They feed mostly off of ambient magical energy, but they are drawn to anyone using magic or transporting magical objects. If you use magic on a ship on the open sea, chances are that ship will be eaten. With no magic, ships are only rarely attacked near the coast. Further from the coast they are in more danger, but my continents are quite close together, so (relatively) safe routes have been found. Sometimes greedy or desperate people take dangerous shortcuts though. 

  These serpents are obviously massive obstacles to trade and travel, and everyone hates them quite a lot. Given mostly renaissance level tech + the ability to magically heat any metal to malleability or melting, how might entrepreneurial humans try to kill these things? Using magic while actually out to sea will just attract more of them, so the details of how magic works are probably not very important.

  The only methods I presently have people using are A) using magic on land to create things like tungsten harpoons and other mundane weapons, and B) building dams with gates large enough for the serpents to enter, then closing the gates and draining the water inside. They are dangerous animals, but not intelligent, so if they venture close to the coast they can be lured in with magic and then killed this way. This will never be enough to wipe them out, however, because most of them stick to the open seas, especially the older and larger ones.

  Once killed, there is plenty of meat on them but nothing especially valuable unless they very recently swallowed something you want back.

  So. How else might humans respond to or try to kill these things? The few trap dams that exist are mostly near the largest trading hubs, and are more to make people *feel* safe than to actually accomplish anything. Also, the occasional assassin will wait for their target to travel somewhere by ship, then plant something magical on it and wait for everyone on the ship to get eaten.

    Can you set something magical to activate with a time delay? If so you can rig up something with a nasty payload, throw it overboard near known serpent locations and time the magical component to activate once you're long gone. The serpents eat the object and hopefully you put something in there that can kill them (I do not know enough about renaissance tech to give any specifics but thinking bomb or poison in general. (Would poison even work on something that big though?))

    This doesn't help any individual ship going out, but depending on your magic system it could be cheap and thinning out numbers can't hurt.

    Do humans have ways to detect magic? If not, then killing the serpents that swim into trap dams seems like a waste. They could be used to check for magic on outgoing ships. This wouldn't work on assassination attempts if time delay activation is a thing, but I imagine there's an occasional ship loss to accidentally bringing magic items onto outgoing ships that would be prevented.
    ```

    - u/Rhamni:
      ```
      > Can you set something magical to activate with a time delay?

      Nothing that isn't a human being. A magic user is only faintly magical unless they are actively using magic.

      > Do humans have ways to detect magic?

      Yes. Anyone who can use magic can also sense it nearby. The stronger the magic felt, the further away they can feel it. The strongest source of magic in my world can be felt from anywhere, basically giving every magician an in built compass. But in general normal levels of magic can be sensed a few feet to a few hundred feet away, depending on if the magician is holding magic themselves at the time. The serpents have more acute senses, and can sense a magician using magic from miles away. Humans can only sense the serpents from about a hundred feet away though, and that's usually just a few seconds before the ship gets bitten in half from below.

      > They could be used to check for magic on outgoing ships.

      Unfortunately not really practical. They are extremely strong creatures, and keeping them around is not safe. If kept inside a dam, there is a real threat that they might attack and break the dam if not killed quickly. They definitely can't be bound or held still. They need water to breathe and will suffocate in air, but they are quite capable of thrashing around and destroying most manmade things nearby while they are panicking and suffocating. 

      Poison or explosives could hurt and potentially kill them if they were tricked into eating them. Killing them out at sea would draw in others to feed on their remains, so not *perfect*, but yes, it would make sense for most ships to have a 'lucky' barrel of poison for revenge just in case they get eaten.
      ```

      - u/Gurkenglas:
        ```
        > Killing them out at sea would draw in others to feed on their remains

        Perfect. Pack the ship with as much cheap magic (everburning torches?) and poison as you can muster, then watch as each serpent eats the remains of the previous corpse, then dies.

        Find an irresponsible individual to create a species of poisonous sea creatures with a (minor, useless?) magic ability and wait a hundred years until the serpents learn by natural selection not to eat them, then leash some to your ships as you cross the sea.
        ```

  - u/Trew_McGuffin:
    ```
    I mean build a bridge. A big honking bridge. Or failing that then fast boats. Or space magic shenanigans.

    As for killing: make a species of infertile snake hunters and release em every couple of months/weeks/days.
    ```

  - u/KilotonDefenestrator:
    ```
    "Magical flares" may be a countermeasure. You put a spell on a floating barrel and/or a heavy object and toss several overboard (perhaps using catapults) drawing the monsters away from the ship. Extra good if the object is only faintly magical until activated.

    Or perhaps countless small magical objects scattered over a wide area (again using catapults) would create a "smoke screen" where the serpents do not know what to attack. 

    Or, magic attached to poison barrels (or explosives). Or just big tungsten caltrops that mess up the serpents mouths and digestive system.

    Using magic to smelt, mix and shape metal could advance technology incredibly, to the point of fully automatic high-calibre cannons would be possible. Not sure how much time serpents spend at the surface though. 

    Steam power would also be much easier with magically forged metals. No welds or bolted seams needed. Perhaps have massive steam-powered spikes that can be fired down from the hull as soon as something bites down on the ship. The crew start the boilers at the first sign of serpents, and hope for a "good bite" that triggers the spikes but does not damage the ship.

    Other than that, hulls shaped and equipped to be as stealthy as possible might be a thing. Perhaps carrying a smaller, more noisy, boat that can be deployed, or dragged after the ship at all times, to be the target of the first attack. At which point the crew on the main ship cuts speed and drifts with as little noise as possible until the serpent leaves. Optional poison and/or bombs on the decoy boat.
    ```

  - u/Amagineer:
    ```
    How do the serpents feed off of ambient magical energy? Do they just draw it in like xianxia cultivation or do they actually actually need to *eat* the magic to feed off of it?

    Can the serpents get full? Do they get sleepy if you feed them enough magic? Can the serpents be overfed? What happens if you pump them past "full" of magic? Do they explode?

    Someone *created* these serpents, so... can they be trained? Could you teach an adult serpent that if it *doesn't* eat you, it'll get a tasty treat? I'm imagining the training here being something like: you send an unmanned boat out with a magical doodad onboard that'll fly off on a firework, or become inaccessible in some other way, should the serpent try to eat the boat, but, if the serpent *ignores* the boat, then it gets tossed a (distinctly different) magical treat. Do this for a whole shipping lane, and now you've got a collection of serpents who "know" that attacking magical boats is no good, but leaving them alone is *great* because they'll feed you.

    /u/Badewell's suggestion of using magical bait + lethal payload also work for training here (you don't even need time-delay, so long as you've got some way to control a small unmanned some ways ahead of the main craft, perhaps magic): Always float a couple of bombs or whatever ahead of you, and eventually the serpents will either learn that the magical doodads floating up on the surface are not to be eaten, or they will be dead.

    Could you steal a serpent egg and raise a guard-serpent for your boat?

    Could magical chaff be a thing? As long as there are *always* more appetizing targets than the ship, the serpents should ignore it, right? Maybe? I'm imagining like... a ring of magic toy boats that surround the ship, but with a large buffer such that there's a big "no magic" hole in the middle of them

    Is it possible to move *faster* than the serpents (even, or especially with magic)? If so, then magic speedboats are an excellent way to get around, though you do still have to deal with the fact that there may be serpents *ahead* of you.

    Is there some sort of anti-magic that the serpents might find repulsive?

    Is there some way to make the magic *irritating* to the serpents: Tune it to some "frequency" they're not a fan of? Attach a doodad to the serpents in an inconvenient location (back of its head, its tail)?

    > Once killed, there is plenty of meat on them but nothing especially valuable unless they very recently swallowed something you want back.

    These serpents *eat magic* surely they've got a higher concentration of mana within them or something, right?
    ```

    - u/Rhamni:
      ```
      > How do the serpents feed off of ambient magical energy?

      Their skin slowly drains it from the environment. This is enough to sustain them, but they want more, and so actively seek out anything with more than background levels of magic. They don't have a maximum size. They keep growing as long as they can find food. The biggest ones mostly just eat smaller serpents.

      > Can the serpents get full? Do they get sleepy if you feed them enough magic? Can the serpents be overfed? What happens if you pump them past "full" of magic?

      They can, but it won't happen without some kind of capture and forcefeeding situation. They don't get sleepy from eating, but they will prioritize safety (Rest and growth) or fighting/breeding when they have excess power to draw on. If force fed beyond reason, they can choose to stop passively feeding. At that point, you can only keep feeding them by using mind control to control them like a puppet. As with human magic users, concentrate too much magic in one body and they will eventually catch on fire and die in horrible pain.

      Mind controlling them is not realistic because you would need a lot of exceptionally powerful magic users working together to use forbidden magic, and since they are only useful at sea they would be a giant beacon constantly drawing in more uncontrolled serpents. Also all the other humans would freak out and try to kill you. Technically possible, however, and the original creator would approve.

      > Someone created these serpents, so... can they be trained? Could you teach an adult serpent that if it doesn't eat you, it'll get a tasty treat?

      Not easily, and they don't teach each other, so... you would have a hard time teaching each one, and it would be nearly impossible to prevent new ones from out at sea from wandering into your region full of tame ones. You would likely never reach a point where it would be safe to use magic at sea. For any individual trip however, I guess you could transport something magical by having a lot of more strongly magical bait in other vessels nearby. Still not safe, but it might be an option.

      > Could you steal a serpent egg and raise a guard-serpent for your boat?

      This would work, the only problem is that it would eat a *lot*. You would at a minimum need a dozen or so magicians constantly ready to feed it whenever it gets hungry as a baby. When it reached adulthood you would have to either let it out to feed at sea or you would need 100+ magicians channeling magic to feed it. I hadn't thought about this possibility, so I'm not sure how social I would say one is if raised from birth among generous humans. But if someone pulled it off, it would easily be a one snake army.

      > Is it possible to move faster than the serpents (even, or especially with magic)?

      Not without flying. The right to fly is heavily restricted because of a magical world war 200 years ago that didn't end well for anyone, but royalty can fly, and can potentially transport magical items up in the air, where the serpents can't reach them. Other magicians can learn to fly, but all the big players get *unreasonable* on the subject.

      > Is there some sort of anti-magic that the serpents might find repulsive?

      No. There is antimagic, but to the serpents it just smells like magic, and it's energy heavy and not a threat to them.

      > Is there some way to make the magic irritating to the serpents: Tune it to some "frequency" they're not a fan of?

      Not really. They aren't even turned away by what feels like superior/angry fellow serpents. The creator didn't put in any back doors to make them safe for herself, she decided she wanted to wipe out her enemies' navies and eliminate the threat of any attacks from the sea. And she was quite happy to permanently give up access to the oceans to do it.

      > Attach a doodad to the serpents in an inconvenient location (back of its head, its tail)?

      That sure would piss one off, but I'm not sure it would accomplish anything long term.

      > These serpents eat magic surely they've got a higher concentration of mana within them or something, right?

      Their skin can be treated and used as some kind of meth/super caffeine combo, but one dead serpent can supply all the skin the market can absorb for a century. They are big things, and eating the skin will kill you pretty quickly. If you desperately need to be at full strength all day all night for something though, it works. It just leaves you nauseated for a few days afterward and slowly accumulates every time you use it. It's not even addictive, it's just awful. There is some competition to produce less poisonous versions, but there is no shortage of the raw skin, just a lack of experts who manage to refine something useful. 

      The meat on one is enough to feed most cities for a few days, so there is money there, it just isn't worth creating an industry around it.
      ```

      - u/AlmostNeither:
        ```
        If the absorption of ambient magic is itself magical, all you need to do is enchant an object that draws in magic faster/harder than the snakes do, and is capable of drawing down and depleting or disrupting the innate magic of the snakes.

        Maybe this is just impossible or prohibitively expensive, but if you produced a bunch of these and toss them somewhere in the ocean, it should draw and starve snakes to death passively.  If it draws snakes fast enough, the object could even sustain its own enchantments for a long time on snake income.

        Has the interesting side effect of producing large (floating? sunken?) sea serpent graveyards/famine zones/hunting grounds as the magic of the object and its collection of dead and dying snakes starts drawing more and larger serpents.
        ```

      - u/munkeegutz:
        ```
        I think that since the problem was caused by the generation of self-propogating magic, there is clearly some promise in using self-propogating magic to fix this issue.

        Find some flaw in the serpents -- is there something out there which magically identifies the serpents from other creatures?  Produce something that absorbs ambient mana and is not very smart, but only survives if it consumes a serpent egg, say, once per year.  It doesn't sound like the serpents are very social creatures, and they might not guard their eggs very aggressively.  If you can kill them before, you can stem the problem in a few decades.  Afterwords, the old serpents will eat the younger, smaller serpents, and then the old serpents will not have enough magic floating around to sustain themselves and will die on their own after eating each other.

        Likewise, you could produce a parasite that is passive when interacting with most life, but requires a sea serpent to reproduce.  The parasite enters the sea serpent....somehow, and then feeds on it's guts/brain, producing a huge number of additional parasites.  The serpent dies and the bonus parasites go everywhere, infecting subsequent serpents, eventually killing all of them.

        Naturally, be smart this time and have some kind of fallback back-door if things go horribly wrong so you can kill off your creation.

        Of course, both of these ideas could go horribly wrong if, for instance, the parasite evolves to feed off of /all/ sea life instead of just serpents, for instance.
        ```

        - u/Rhamni:
          ```
          Engineering some kind of parasite that targets them is probably the most realistic approach to eventually wiping them all out. Not many magicians could realitically do it, but obviously over time more interesting people pop up and old magical secrets are discovered, so that could happen.
          ```

        >The meat on one is enough to feed most cities for a few days, so there is money there, it just isn't worth creating an industry around it.


        I hear that, and my first thought is that the only reason there isn't a industry around that is a lack of investment.


        Some quick searching suggests that a large city in the renaissance would be around 100,000 people, though magic could also change this. A low-end estimate for how much the average person spends on food would be 10% of their income (probably higher, historically, but again magic).


        So if a average serpent could feed 100,000 people for three days, its value would be around 30,000 average-day-wages, enough to pay 1,000 workers for a month, or a lesser number of above-average workers like magicians.


        I would expect that a creature that is this easily lured and this common could probably be farmed a lot faster than 1 per month with hundreds of people working on it. And reliable and cheap sources of food, especially meat, were a big deal in medieval times.


        The biggest issues I see are geography, upfront investment, and draining costs. For one, you're probably going to want a bay or something to do this in. Large landmoving projects were not cheap back then, so unless magic helps a lot with that then this is limited to coastal cities with a bay that has a easily dammed entrance. And upfront investment - a thick enough wall of steel ought to be able to stop a dying serpent without taking damage, but it might take excessive amounts of steel. Alternatively, you could use a bay large enough that there's little risk of the serpent damaging the dam or beaching itself and destroying buildings or killing workers, but that raises the draining costs.

        I'd want to know more about the magic in the setting before settling on a course of action though.
        ```

  - u/Buggy321:
    ```
    My first idea would be to fight fire with fire, and create a magical self-replicating creature to counter it. But other people have brought that up.

    A bigger question, I think, is how is anyone still alive when a powerful enough mage can create self-replicating magical weapons/creatures which can survive and multiply using ambient magic? What's to stop someone from making magic-seeking hornets with cobra venom or such?
    ```

  - u/Izeinwinter:
    ```
    All ships carry loads that make them a poison pill if eaten. Either a literal  poison in a hull compartment, or just a bunch of gunpowder and scrap metal. That way, if you get eaten, at least you get to point and laugh at the snake from the afterlife, and there is the hope they might eventually damn well stop. 

    variant 2 on this: Ships that are at their end of their service life are loaded up with skeleton volunteer crews (Old sailors who dont want to die in bed, the mortally ill, the irrevocably cursed) and sail off with a hull full of powder and a spell on their lips

  - u/Radiator_Full_Pig:
    ```
    If assassins plant magical objects to lure them, make a trap with a magic object in the middle, maybe it expands once heated, by say a sea serpents stomach?
    Or enough magic to melt a ball of metal that they swallow.
    Or just a eat a big ball of inert metal that poisions them.

    How valuable are your magic users? Can someone use them as bait, or maybe as a form of execusion to draw in serpents. It will all depend on the details of your magic system I suppose.

      Someone raised the possibility of raising one from birth. It would be prohibitively expensive, since you would need a large team of magicians feeding it several times a day, and magicians basically only include nobility, high ranking church people and the very richest merchants and mercenaries in my world. But, if you *did* go to all that effort, it could be tamed as well as a real life snake, or thereabout. And of course it could be made to completely terrorize specific areas, sink only enemy ships, etc. Nobody in my world will try, but logically it should work.

          Nah, I have monkey level intelligent magic snakes that work as pets, but the giant murder serpents are not among them. They were made to wipe out navies and deny sea access to *everyone*. Their creator did not put in any backdoors for others to find and exploit, and since her death nobody has been as talented or had anywhere near her resources, so nobody can realistically put any in, either.

  The Vice-Principal of Hogwarts 

  Charity Burbage graduates from Hogwarts and instead of being inspired to study  Muggle Music or Art becomes inspired to study the Muggle education system. She enrolls at a Muggle University to take a few classes. To her embarrassment she fails every class and realizes how truly unprepared she is to go to a Muggle University, not having basic skills that muggle students take for granted. 

  She decides to infiltrate a muggle school as a student teacher to learn how to be a better student. She experiences quite a bit of culture shock at just how different Muggle Schools are and later has to admit that they are superior in many ways. She stays and studies muggle schools for almost two years, pretending to work as a student-teacher and working as a substitute. She later writes a bestselling book for wizards that details her observations. Because she was very open to her opinion of the superiority of muggle schools and was very critical of Hogwarts, two death eaters show up to kill her. She barely defeats them using some chemical knowledge she studied to create a poisonous cloud that suffocates the death eaters. 

  Wounded and in fear of more attacks, she decides to go into hiding and live as a  Muggle. She goes back to a muggle college under an alias and this time she manages to graduate, becoming a teacher at an elementary school,  something she learns to love doing. Over the years becoming close friends with the principal and starts studying to possibly become one.

  After several years go by, one of her students is contacted by Hogwarts. She offers advice, information, and reassurance to the parents. She is inspired by their thanks to starting a newsletter and info packet for muggle parents while keeping a normal non-owl post for them to contact.muggle-born She answers questions and offers a place for the muggle-born to practice without issue in her home during the summer. 

  She is then contacted by Dumbledore with an offer to become the new professor of Muggle Studies after the old one decided to retire early.  To his surprise, she declines and writes him a scathing and lengthy report about how ignorant, condescending, and terrible he is at his job that cites numerous studies and sources about education, personal interviews, and her professional opinion. Before offering him a list of squibs that have lived in both worlds as a teacher. 

  To his credit, Dumbeldore takes the criticism to heart and starts to read the books becoming fascinated and admitting that Hogwarts could be better. He makes a personal appearance to her with a new offer to become the Vice Principal to help him modernize and update Hogwarts. She accepts and comes to Hogwarts with big plans to modernize and improve things the same year that Harry Potter starts there.  Hilarity ensues.

  My main issue is trying to figure out what changes a modern education professional would suggest as I didn't realize just how much thought goes into modern schools until I started researching what a Vice Principal actually does and the differences between different countries with higher ratings. But I'm not sure how much the wizarding world would really let happen even with Dumbeldore supporting any changes. So some suggestions would be helpful. Proposed Changes:

  A summer program for the muggle-born to update them to how the magical world works and to practice some basics so they are not behind the other kids.

  Hiring a school counselor squib

  Creating a club system that the school can award funding for

  Creating a PTA

  Creating an agreed-upon lesson plan for defense against the dark arts that is created by experts and will be followed regardless of new teachers

  Teacher observations and ongoing training opportunities that the school pays for

  A new agreed upon bullying plan that actually works to stop bullying

  Some type of change to the house system and points system to encourage inter-house friendships.

  Any other suggestions?

    So, I'm actually a teacher.  The field is rife with buzzwords, educational research is a minefield of inadequacy, and teaching programs don't really prepare you.  We still do much better than Hogwarts.

    &#x200B;

    Here are some things I think a teacher would actually try to implement, that are structurally problematic for Hogwarts.

    1. The dormrooms are a nightmare scenario.  Rape, especially homosexual rape, *would* happen. These kids are extremely poorly supervised.  Prefects in general could make the lives of their charges hell.  Similarly, the position would attract magic pedophiles.
    2. Hogwarts has too few teachers.  It's a school with either 280 kids or a thousand.  It has  7 core subjects and 5 electives.  (Later years may have special electives)  My school has about 300 kids and we have 17.5 teachers (one is shared).  Our student teacher ratios are lower than usual, but Hogwarts is astronomical.  Also, non-teachers don't understand how demanding it is to prep for a class.  On a great day, prepping for each class takes 45 minutes.  Average day, an hour, busy day two.  You have to prepare for your lecture, write what you're going to do on the board, write instructions for the assignment, gather materials (a real time-spender), etc.  In your extra time you have to grade and do planning.  If you're a shit grader it takes a half hour per week per class.  Better teachers take longer, and grading writing, which they do a lot of takes a long, long, time.  We see our kids every day, but Hogwarts teachers see their kids twice a week.  I seem to remember that most classes combine two houses, which means that they spend 28 hours in the classroom.  Maybe a little less.  Then about 14 hours grading.  Then about  28 hours preparing classroom materials.  That's a 70 hour a week job; you can futz around with the hours, but it's unsustainable.  It gets more sustainable if you do a shit job grading and preparing.  These teachers are ridiculously overworked though.  If you use Rowling's number, you can multiply quite a lot of this by 4.
    3. I have not, once, seen mention of a rubric or checklist.  Hogwarts assignments are Orwellian, you don't know quite what the teacher wants and get punished by many for asking.
    4. The average kid needs lessons on how to *read* not how to interpret literature until early high school.  Remember that most easy newspaper articles are written at an 8th grade level.  Students start Hogwarts at a 5th to 6th grade level.
    5. The teaching methods at Hogwarts are mediocre at best.  They do groupwork and lots of practical application.  However, they don't explain how to learn at all.  They teach no lessons on study skills.  They expect you to be able to use the library right away and have no research methods classes.  They teach no lessons on note-taking or essay writing.  Hogwarts is very much a sink or swim environment to the detriment of students.  When they do lecture, there's little class discussion.  Student learning has a sizeable improvement if you go from asking individual students questions to telling the class to talk to their neighbor.  In Snape's, I think you get punished for class discussion.
    6. There's no teacher growth plan.  Every year I do a formal plan on how to improve my teaching methods required by state law.  I also do a much more detailed informal plan that I actually follow, starting with an autopsy of last year's plan.
    7. There's no mentoring for teachers, no observations from senior staff, and no feedback how you're doing as a teacher.  Dumbledore should get off his ass and go room to room at least once a week.
    8. There are no inclusion plans for students with disabilities, magical or otherwise.  Hogwarts' attitude towards neurodifferences seems to be fuck off cripple.
    9. They *do* have some sort of agreed upon standards, because they have end of year tests.  Harry, like most students, doesn't see these standards because they're for teachers, not students.
    10. There is no formalized discipline system.  Classroom discipline is barbaric and frankly illegal sometimes.
    11. Their career counselling is terrible.  Students are magically expected to pick a lifetime path when they are 15.  You're right on track with the fact that they would need a guidance counselor and a good one.
    12. Rowling far underestimates the behavior that would result from Deatheater trauma.  You would probably have kids that literally shit themselves to get attention from adults because their parents are dead and grandmother is too dotty to care well.  Fights could get lethal really quick.
    13. They also do no bellwork.  Many teachers have work waiting for students in a stack by the door when they enter the room.  This is a great way to have more effective transition time.  As students enter, they start doing work instead of talking.
    14. The wealth disparity of magical Britain would really, really, really bother most teachers.  The idea that there's no school quidditch regulation board making sure there's equal equipment is bullshit.
    15. Sports and clubs suck.  Most teachers hate them.  It's a lot of extra work for no pay that distracts from teaching.  I doubt most would bring them back.  Debate clubs, chess clubs, and maybe some others might be organized by teachers with a natural love of conflict.
    16. PTAs are difficult with a school as small as Hogwarts.  Also, parents make things more complicated.  PTA would be Lucius vs. Molly every week while everyone else left.
    17. There's no ready option for continuing education other than career specific apprenticeship.  Magical Britons get a quarter of the training that college educated muggles do. Less so in relevant subjects.
    18. The kids do almost no-non-paper projects.  This is something fucking *Hagrid* selfishly blunders into with his skrewts.  Note that Harry and his friends do projects in their spare time, like polyjuice potion, and get a huge educational advantage.  Fred & George, and Draco are the only other students who make permanent items.  Basically they're all trained for service careers in doing spells that wizards can already do for themselves.
    19. There's no sex ed in a world where magic roofies exist.

      The thing is that Hogwarts isn't based on actual classrooms and teachers - but books written by guys like Anthony Buckeridge and Frank Richards.

      In fact, that's kind of the key to the Harry Potter and The... series - it references tropes of "boarding school life" stories that boys would have been reading for at least three generations by the time Rowling had started to read. If you want to read half the source material she cribs from read the "Jennings" novels by Burgess and the Greyfriars books like Richards. Which were written and set in the first half of the 20th century and based on institutions that started prior to World War I.

      These learning institutions were not exactly wonderful institutions of learning. Boys tended to learn the rules of the institution by being caned. You'd show up, wide-eyed and eight years old or so in a starchy new uniform with a tie and be unsure what to do. And then someone in a robe and hat with a cane with severe demeanor would hurt you, and as you were responding to the shock of being hit on the behind with a length of bamboo, THAT'S when you were told it was because you were not in Room A like everyone else is, and you're supposed to be in Room A when the bell rings whose import you didn't know because you just got there. A few canings later, each one hurting more than the last because your skin was still healing from the last one - you figured out REALLY quickly the secret to being able to sit down comfortably on a wooden bench for an hour (and if you couldn't come to the front of the class for more hits) was to keep your head down, watch what other people were doing, and just fall in.

      These places were organized to suit the needs of Victorian England, which was to produce middle managers who, between them, could act as a small organic library remembering facts and not causing any trouble. So the curriculum was about being told facts and regurgitating facts and if you didn't know those facts, come to the front of the class and bend over. If you were noticed or you failed you hurt. If you kept your head down and didn't cause any trouble and just got things moving as a cog in a larger machine and did everything you were told and figured out what you needed to do without being told, life was somewhat tolerable. You were not surrounded by parents or family - you had freezing cold dorms, dripping taps, a highly regimented life that was about doing things at certain times as opposed to what was in anyone's best interest.

      Teachers tended to be old boys of the school or people who'd been somewhere or done something, not necessarily teachers or even particularly caring about teaching - certainly not teachers according to the pedagogy you went through with the aims and goals you were taught. You just read out to the class "AMO! AMAS! AMAT! AMAMUS! AMATIS! AMANT!" and the boy that didn't keep up or was looking out the window was hauled to the front of the class by his ear and caned as an example to others.

      As for abuses by prefects or sexual abuse, that's very well documented, The film "If" with Malcolm McDowall (A Clockwork Orange, Halloween) has a particularly sobering scene in which a group of them use their Lord Of The Flies power to literally exact revenge in a particularly gruesome abuse of power. These sorts of scenes weren't put into the books but anyone who'd been to a school like that would have known about them and scenes with prefects taking boys aside or teachers ordering a student to show up to their study had a particular dark menace that's not exactly obvious to a modern reader.

      "Students would shit themselves to get attention" - the source material came at a time when trying that manoever would earn you more strikes with a cane on your backside than you could tolerate. As David Niven said in his autobiography, six was bad but tolerable, twelve was something you could kind of endure. Once in his life a teacher took real issue with a discipline problem and hit him with a cane eighteen times and there isn't a day he doesn't remember that pain.

      That's why the books based on that source material seem bizarre, barbaric, brutal, completely against what we understand about education, and arbitrary and cruel to modern readers. That was because the institutions that Hogwarts was based on were, yes, indeed, pretty horrible places.

        This is a major theme of a lot of Roald Dahl’s books as well.  Dahl was raised in this system (see his autobiography, “Boy”) and *hated* it.  He hated the system to the point where he faked illness to escape school for as long as possible as a young child and as a young adult was punished for refusing to participate in the system and for refusing to haze younger students.  He considered it cruel, barbaric, and evil.  It’s why so many of his novels (e.g., Matilda) are about children having troubles with terrifyingly crazy school systems and why all those stories involve a clever and fundamentally good child breaking the system, or at least getting revenge against it.

          This is an aspect I see too seldom when people discuss the Harry Potter books and certain 'mistakes' JK Rowling made, like the quidditch points system, how ridiculous the teachers treat the children etc.
          It is because especially in the first book, she was still finding her voice as an author and was very much going into a Roald Dahlesqe direction. So many things are playfully over the top and extreme just to be funny. The ridiculous money system, the quirky way to get into Diagon Alley, the oversized giant Hagrid who lets Dudley grow a pig tail etc etc.
          She didn't take her own story seriously at this point. And Hogwarts was clearly very much influenced by Roald Dahl's portrayal of schools.

            The ridiculous money system is mocking the pre-decimal pound.

            Fom Good Omens, by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman....

            "NOTE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND AMERICANS: .....
            Two farthings = One Ha'penny. Two ha'pennies = One Penny. Three pennies = A Thrupenny Bit. Two Thrupences = A Sixpence. Two Sixpences = One Shilling, or Bob. Two Bob = A Florin. One Florin and one Sixpence = Half a Crown. Four Half Crowns = Ten Bob Note. Two Ten Bob Notes = One Pound (or 240 pennies). One Pound and One Shilling = One Guinea.

            The British resisted decimalized currency for a long time because they thought it was too complicated."
            ```

            - u/lookmeat:

              * Farthing = 0.25
              * Ha'penny = 0.5
              * Penny = 1
              * Thrupenny Bit = 3
              * Sixpence = 6
              * Shilling or Bob = 12
              * Florin = 24
              * Half Crown = 30
              * Ten Bob = 120
              * Pound = 240
              * Guinea = 252

              Why these numbers?

              First you smelt sterling (92.5% pure) silver into a bar that is 1lb in weight.

              Divide this into a half, the each half into 10 shillings (splits by their etymology) , which you then smelt into a dozen coins. Given the quality controls and common 6 base system it made sense to split things this way.
              ```

              - u/vonadler:
                ```
                The guinea used to be 1 pound, but the increased availability of silver meant that people saved up pounds, exchanged it for guineas and then melted the guineas to sell the gold for more pounds than they started with.

                Of course, the guinea more or less dissapeared from circulation, causing problems when wanting to do larger transactions, so they reset the value of the guinea to 21 shillings or 1,05 pounds.

                The problem soon returned though, as silver continued to drop in value compared to gold, and soon the guinea had to be replaced by the sovereign, which had less gold in it.

                This is why if you see people using guineas in older books and movies (such as in Jane Austen's novels and their movie adaptions) they are flexing on people, saying they can afford to pay more for something than regular people do, using currency almost no-one has access to.

                There are pros and cons to imperial units.

                One foot for example.  A base 12 inches is divisible 2, 3, 4, and 6 whereas metric base 10 is divisible by 2, and 5.  Being able to do simple and easy division with crude implements makes for a really robust system.  And by crude implements, think a piece of string and chalk or a compass to build ships that can circumnavigate the globe.

                It is still almost universal to use non-decimal time keeping. Base 60 for minutes and seconds.  Divisible 2, 4, 5, 6, 12, 15, 30.  Base 24 (which is base 12 again) hours.  Months and such get messy because of lunar calenders and/or religious bickering over the centuries.

                Sorry its a bit of a fun thing for me.  Star Trek is fun and interesting, but even when you grant that **all** the aliens out there are bilaterally symmetrical (basically human), they all use base 10... when even here on Earth we don't all use base 10 still!

              Quidditch seems like an inherently flawed game. Especially when you bring the fact that the school awards points to the houses of these teams. And since there is no timer, all it takes is a little collusion with the Seekers purposefully avoiding catching the snitch, and draw the game out as long as possible, racking up points for both sides. As many points as they feel like they want, or just exactly enough as they both need to guarantee being the top 2 teams, and then when you've broken the gap, then rush the snitch. Oh and you win the House Cup guaranteed, until Dumbledore gives 6,000 points to someone for giggles.

                  Draws make more sense in test cricket. If it was sinply based off who scored the most runs over the 5 days the team batting second would be at a huge disadvantage as the team batting first could stall for time and leave insufficient time left for the opposition to challenge their target. That's winning by stalling for time without getting the other team out, completing two innings when their opponents didn't get to. I think in this situation the wider allowance for draws is better than devaluing wins. It's important to acknowledge that in this case a draw isn't solely scores being level, it's essentially a stalemate - no conclusion after 5 days.

                This is why sensible sports have "sportsmanship" rules.

                There was a case in Olympic badminton where a team realised that they should lose their first couple matches to  ensure easier matches later on, due to the wat "round robin" contests work. So they would intentionally serve the shuttlecock directly into the net, and refuse to return any successful serves by their opponents. This stopped working when they hit another team with exactly the same strategy, which lead to a hilarious match where both teams just scored 0 over and over again.

                The ref called over both teams and told them to cut that shit out. They continued to fuck around, so they found out - and both teams got disqualified.

                In short, if a team is seen to be fucking around, the organisers are allowed to step in and stop them.

                I think that they play round Robin and I believe most wins wins, if two teams tie then it comes down to points. They beat slytherin one year by beating another team by 180 or so.  They needed Harry to not get the snitch until they were up by 30 points.

He sends back a letter written in Rabelaisian French that only one or two of the masters can even read, obscenely trashing the school and staff.

There were series of comics like "The Beano", "The Dandy", "Cor!", "Whizzer", "Chips" and so forth that were printed cheaply on cheap newsprint and typically filled with one-page stories involving someone being beaten with a slipper, hand, or cane at the end. But the one that seemed to take the most glee in this was Cor!'s "Whacky". These sorts of things phased out the formula of "kid gets hit with a slipper or cane" around the 80s/90s when mores changed. But she's old enough to have had this sort of comic as a staple.

        The formula of these comics was kept alive by adult comics parodying the genre - this one's from "Viz" which instead of having children good at soccer or with special magic powers parodies the genre with a gifted hyperflatulent, a boy whose testicles are large enough to reach the floor, and so forth - and the ones involving child characters parody the "getting slippered at the end" trope. Most of its content isn't safe for work, but this one is, kind of because its only "not worksafe" part is reference to flatulence.

        this is probably tied into the class system of the time which didn't especially want people to achieve things based on their abilities except in a very limited cases. 

        Exceptionally bright or talented people could survive and thrive in the school system - especially those talented in sports or just very intelligent. Leaders were valuable, but you don't need very many of them. What you want for the rest of society is people who are somewhat competent, but do what they are told. The school system was brutal  - but it largely was designed to teach exactly what was required by society. A few leaders, and a bunch of people who did what they were told and had a gut instinct for what happened to those who tried to act outside normal expectations.

      Harry Potter books lack a lot in some areas, and I'll be honest I stopped bothering after that tri wizard cup thing. But I do feel it is important to note that the audience is children and from what I recall as a child in school, this seemed fairly accurate portrayal of how middle school FELT.

      Let me be clear, all the points above are valid. But as a kid, it never really felt like there was proper supervision, it never felt like class expectations were clear, we never knew the teachers had prep time, grading time, that there were teachers beyond the ones we interacted with, or that they would have their own growth plans, etc.

      Much of this is not in the books because kids themselves are entirely blind to them.

        My guess is mudbloods just wander away but pure bloods think themselves better off on the low rung than in the muggle world; especially how misinformed they are of muggle life; they likely think of it as living like a Monty Python peasant (Oh, Dennis, there’s some lovely filth down here)

          There are quite a few I think. The woman that is a witness at Harry's trial in half blood prince is one. The guy stealing from Sirius's house is another. Filtch from the school is one and even has a magic correspondence course. 

          There are different degrees of it. Harry's aunt and uncle know about magic, but can't do it. Although his aunt knows more than she lets on. The witness can't do anything but knows about magic life. Mundungus knows enough to make money stealing magical items. 

          There is an amount of base knowledge the magic users have that isn't explained. It lets harry be the fish out of water,  and the reader finds it about it through him finding out. They know what they can, and can't do. Without getting in trouble with the ministry of magic.

      To be fair, it's not like this is standard in the muggle world either, especially in the 1990s. 

      Regarding disabilities, I think it's pretty likely magic makes up for most of them, there's even cheering charms that seem to outright fix depression (the only disabled trait I remember is Moody's peg leg, IIRC? and that is likely rare curse damage judging from his lifestyle. I guess Luna counts as neurodivergent, now that I think about it.). 

      And in the books, I remember a pretty long scene where McGonagall guides Harry through the career choice process, that's only abridged because Umbridge was there to ruin the thing for Harry. What's truly inexcusable is having to choose main subjects at age 13. If you decide you want to become a cursebreaker at age 14 and you picked magical creatures and divination, you're fucked.

      Excellent post anyway.

        Hagrid's predecessor Kettleburn lost several limbs because he dealt with the Creatures about as well as Hagrid did. Dumbledore says of him, "By the time I became Headmaster, however, Professor Kettleburn had mellowed considerably, although there were always those who took the cynical view that with only one and a half of his original limbs remaining to him, he was forced to take life at a quieter pace." He retired at the end of H/R/H's second year "to enjoy more time with his remaining limbs." Enter Hagrid stage left. 

        Other than that, there are a bunch of scars that do not heal, Quirrell stuttered, and Lupin's monthlies couldn't be helped beyond the Wolfsbane potion. As an AIDS metaphor, that definitely counted as a massive handicap in their society.

Transfiguration class, because he did not achieve a high enough grade, which would limit the type of career Neville would be able to hold in the future. 

          Harry also thinks he won't be able to be an auror because of his Potions grade. Now imagine if there's any job Harry wanted that requires Arithmancy or Ancient Runes (in my earlier example, though I just learned this isn't confirmed, the latter would be required for getting that job).

        I'm at an impoverished school where I have no materials, literally not even a textbook for the first 3 years.  Assembling material alone takes a significant amount of time.  Finding movies, getting supplies for artistic lessons, setting up stations, printing out worksheets and bellwork, differentiating activities, even writing on the blackboard all takes me an ungodly amount of time.  It's gone down considerably since my first year, but then I was spending 4 to 5 hours per lesson because I had to write my own materials.  (Too poor for teachers pay teachers; the kids reading was too low for online articles.)
        ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Exactly. A brand new lesson- sure, 45-1 hour prep. But for every brand new lesson I do, I probably have 3 lessons that I’m modifying/improving from the previous year. Labs are still a bitch to set up, but for an average lesson that’s just getting an improvement, maybe a 20-minute prep.
        ```

      - u/dignified_tapir:

        I would like to think (even if you re use material) you are tailoring it to your students needs and ability. Yes you can reuse a rough plan, but, it will still need work depending on aptitude, learning styles, development of pedagogy and SEND students. Not to mention if your class has a TA.

          > I would like to think (even if you re use material) you are tailoring it to your students needs and ability.

          There are typically 20 kids per class.  That's enough for a bell curve.  So whatever you prepped the previous year would apply to the current students.  At most there will be a few more better students or a few more worse students but your previous course would have already had content for those extremes so you are already covered.
          ```

          - u/dignified_tapir:
            ```
            Where I teach there are perhaps 28-30 per class. 
            The differentiation would be more in how the students access the material.  
            For example if you had a lesson on x,y,&z you would have your 3 basic levels; higher, middle and lower.  The extra would be the personalised sentence starter for one student. Perhaps a key word list for another. A step by step check list. A selection of small tasks for students who have short attention spans and are likely to disrupt the lesson.
            Yes you would build this material over a few years but being an outstanding teacher is about tailoring the material to the students needs and helping them access it. 
            I would also hope that you would want to refresh your material every (I chose to review and refresh each year) few years to keep it up to date and relevant.

            Do you have experience teaching? If so in what context and country. I understand there might be cultural and subject differences.

        100% agree with this. I spent some time in a boarding school in the 2000s and it fits *many* of the Hogwarts "problems". Hell, even the state schools in the 1990s/2000s did. There were no PTAs, notetaking/written work was a huge part of schooling, you literally did pick a life path at age 14 when you decided what GCSEs you were going to take (and your A Levels after that). None of the American "well, we'll teach you these extra subjects too just because," I only studied four subjects for my last two years of school and good luck to you if you change your mind on your future degree once you've started that. I've never even *heard* of bellwork. And as for lessons on study skills and how to learn, lol.

        Agreed. I went to British boarding schools for most of my education, and Hogwarts is just a 'delightfully' eccentric version of the very old ones - right down to the ancient disused bathrooms that no one goes in because they're probably haunted.

      I do wonder how much of the prepping, marking, and other administrative work could be semi-automated with magic. There are not only house-elves for anything physical that needs acquiring and prepping, there are automatic quills and, most likely, branches of library magic dealing with automatic analysis of writing. Not to mention it doesn't need to go through a digitisation process first. The kids hand their essays in, they all float into a pile, and an analysis spell or artifact pre-grades them, magically marks the relevant parts for your perusal, then parades them in front of your face at your choice of speed. You make any fine-tuning corrections to 80% of the essays and their marks with a finger-twitch of your wand, then go back and put a little more time into the top and bottom 10%. And that's assuming you don't have access to mental magics which can speed up and improve the accuracy of your marking/assessment.

      Some of it, too, I imagine, might be solely due to the books being set in the 1990s. I went through school in the late eighties, and a lot of the things you mention never existed. I never saw a rubric until I hit university. Disability access plans were crude or nonexistent (we didn't even have wheelchair ramps to access half the school, let alone anything for neurodivergent students. And yes, there was a kid in a wheelchair). Career counselling consisted of a handful of posters at the back of some of the classrooms with the names of various jobs related to that classroom's subject. The first I've ever even heard of bellwork was literally your post. If there were any student clubs at all, I never encountered hide nor hair of them. And barring P.E., non-paper subjects, where they existed at all, were options and decidedly non-core.

      This was in a first-world Commonwealth country, in a school generally considered to be quite progressive and financially secure. And somehow, I would imagine that Magical Britain is not necessarily entirely devoted to following the changes in Muggle educational standards from year to year.

      And, of course, as with practically all adult institutions in childrens'/YA novels, it's deliberately bizarre and weird and at least partly incomprehensible, with little in the way of explanation for anything. As well as being a pastiche of British boarding school cliches (and magical-school cliches) from decades, if not centuries, of childrens' literature.

          Yup. Wizarding Britain is tiny, but has a lot of old money and a lot of power politics, and Hogwarts is something of a chokepoint for the education of up-and-coming wizards and witches, and thus a notable national asset to have influence over. I'm not surprised that the Board of Governors might have set all kinds of horrible requirements and policies over the centuries, interfering with the actual process of education and making sure any actual teachers certainly had no power to change or improve anything.

      I'll add a few:

      * Other than "don't use unforgivable curses" there's not a single hint of Magical Ethics training.  About the closest you've got is Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration which basically handwaves creating money from nothing thus obviating magical ethics vis a vis the economy.
      * As [Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality](http://hpmor.com) rightly points out, Hogwarts basically completely neglects every mundane subject.  The first time we hear about math, for example, is the third year **elective** Arithmancy.  At that age, they should be doing ALGEBRAmancy
      * I thought standardized testing in the US was high stakes, but dang those OWLs.  While the SAT does play into college admissions, no employers anywhere ask about it.
      * Even setting aside mundane electives, where's the MAGICAL electives for magic photography or talking paintings? I guess there's the school choir, but is that really a class or basically just show choir?

        That's what defense against the dark arts is supposed to be about.

        Because they think magic will solve everything. Mostly because it has.

        It's just a different system. They don't ask about your SATs, but they do ask about your degree, and some even ask for a GPA. The magical community in britain just set up around the OWLs.

        Probably in the final year we never got to see. That's the problem with most of OPs list, they say 'X doesnt exist' a ton of times, but we don't know that. We just didnt see it in the book with the POV of a child.

        I'm surprised out of all of the complaints u/somerando11 made, this somehow wasn't #1 with a bullet.

        It doesn't matter how good you are at making potions, you should still learn science so you know how the natural *non-magical* world works, as you're bound to interact with it on occasion.

        It doesn't matter how good you are at writing spells, you should still learn English so you can effectively communicate ideas more complicated than "expecto patronum" and understand important ideas.

        It doesn't matter how good you are at wand-work, if you aren't properly trained in math, you're bound to lose all your knuts and sickles due to poor management.

        At least in theory, you could argue that Rowling *does* at least recognize the importance of teaching history and social studies, as these could be covered in the History of Magic and Muggle Studies classes... though the History of Magic class is pretty much seen by all as a free period since it's taught by a ghost with no interest in ensuring the students learn the material, and  after Charity Burbage's death Muggle Studies was... well, "Intelligent Designed" for a year.

        Overall, witches and wizards at Hogwarts seem to learn plenty of spells and potions and whatnot, but very little in the way of basic life skills.

      If I remember the HP lore right, wizarding world and muggle world had a separated development since the late middle ages / Renaissance (caused by witch trials which forced the wizarding world to disguise themselves). It would make sense that the Hogwarts school system has so many flaws if you consider the fact, that HP wizards are a small, highly elitist and isolationist community. Groups like that tend not towards big reforms but try to preserve as much of their tradition as possible - which would explain the school system straight from the 16th century.

      It’s also not stated that there’s no adult magic education. Is there some sort of magical community college where post Hogwarts people can try and better themselves?

      Additionally, it seems like there has to be some other magical school in the UK, I just always thought Hogwarts was like the Eton of the magical world. They make it seem like you have to get accepted to the school. Where do the pure bloods who don’t get accepted go? Or is it guaranteed for pure bloods and chance for mud bloods? I think it’s more likely this is the biggest and by far the best school to the point that the other schools are treated almost as if they don’t exist which would be amplified in the mind of a kid who knows nothing about the magical world.

      Sorry to be rude, but as a teacher myself, you really have drunk the koolaid with some of these. Professional growth plans are not, never have been, and never will be about professional growth. Likewise, observations are not about feedback, they are about ammunition. I know blah blah ‘I feel sorry that you have a bad administration but mine aren’t like that’. But really it’s the same for you, you are just unaware of it.

      Average supported kids from a small community like magical Britain actually don’t need explicit reading instruction at a middle school age. They can pick it up naturally through the extensive reading and writing practice they get in normal course work. Like, outside of the ridiculous nightmare scenario that are many schools now, normal kids don’t need a reading class. Average kids don’t fail a reading test that is 4 levels below their age 8 times in a row. And you’ll see it - every single one of them fucking swims, even longbottom. 

      I would also say it’s ridiculous to say that there aren’t practical assignments since they are constantly making potions and practicing charms in class. They just get theory for homework.

      Spot on with the trauma and vulnerability to assault though. Wealth disparity ain’t to bad though - the Weasley’s are doing rather well imo considering they own a big house on a nice plot of land and they are the absolute poorest.

      No offense but it seems to me like a fair bit of criticisms you have are based on the assumption that magic doesn't exist. If you tried to recreate a hogwarts environment in the real world then of course it would be a nightmare. That's why it's a *magic* school, not a real one.

      For one, hogwarts has a lot of "staff" besides teachers. Namely ghosts, portraits, and house elves. The first two, at least, have some canonical examples of authority within the school and likely help supervise students. We don't see this much in-story because invisibility cloak.

      Practically all your complaints about time spent on lesson prep are baseless, namely because A) magic dictation, magic copying and B) literally hundreds of years of lesson plans to draw from AND C) hundreds of years of professor portraits for inspiration.

      You see no mention of things like sex ed, how to read, study techniques, etc and assume that means they don't exist. No, it means that books have focus and spending 10000 words meandering about the minutae of boarding school life is something no young adult author will do. Let me ask you this: there is no mention of any kind of shower or bath besides the ones reserved for prefects. Are you going to assume that the rest of the student body just has to go without?

      Of course hogwarts has a lot of institutional problems especially from modern sensibilities but half of those bullet points are disingenuous or missing the point.

      Others have mentioned the fact that a lot of your criticisms are actually down to Rowling parodying boarding school stories. I'm going to comment on some of the systems structures which you note.

      I teach in a system based on the pre-Comprehensive English system (Singapore, though we've further developed that system) which is another aspect of Rowling's parody and I'd just note a couple of other things.

      Your assumptions about regimented lesson planning and the like are very much an American thing (and are frankly a bit of a stereotype about the crippling bureaucracy of the American variant of the profession). 

      We tend to have rigorous planning as student teachers and beginning teachers but after that this is by no means standard. As a department head in a high school equivalent I don't really expect my teachers to document lesson plans. We have a scheme of work showing everyone where we need to be (shared with the students as well with the admin details left off) and we get on with it.

      As for choosing your path at 14, yes rhe system is much more differentiated than the American system. OWLS and NEWTS are basically O and A levels. O levels (at 10th grade) determine what sort of institution you go into next (here in Singapore a polytechnic for career specific education, a technical school for vocational education or a pre-university for A-levels which prep you for university). This is again quite similar to the pre 1970s English system (with the difference being that in that system most people would leave school after O levels). Most people do have to choose their broad path at age 16- here most of them are going to polytechnics so they're going to have to decide between business ed, electrical engineering etc. Even the 10% who qualify for the pre university course are going to have to specialise in either Arts or Sciences at A level.

      Hogwarts exaggerates but systemically it's based on a different educational structure than the American one.

        With the way wizards are ignorant about...basically anything outside Magical Britain, you could probably get away with having Dumbledore be completely unaware of the fact that Vice-Principal and Deputy Headmistress are basically synonymous terms.

        I honestly don't think it would be out of character for Dumbledore to dismiss any objection along the lines of "Isn't that Minerva's job?", since Deputy Headmistress and Vice-Principal are *obviously* different jobs. Like, Dumbledore might actually know that it's actually the same job, but want to give your character the title/power she needs to make the changes, and most of the rest of the wizards would just buy the logic that they're different jobs pretty easily.

    It's an interesting premise, but one that I think would take a fair bit of research, and a lot of worldbuilding for Hogwarts that doesn't appear to exist within the books themselves.

    * Many of the teachers at Hogwarts are portrayed within the books as incompetent, with approaches to education that do not work for their students. Snape is caustic and shows way too much favoritism. Trelawney basically doesn't know her subject matter. Binns is a ghost, and fundamentally impaired. The Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers ... yikes. If it's not possible to replace these teachers, then trying to reform them has to be the next obvious step, but I'm not sure that's possible either. A lot of it is just down to concerns that aren't related to schooling at all.
    * A lot of students don't really have a place to go for their personal problems, which is especially a concern given that they live at Hogwarts and don't have their parents on hand. Some of this is just down to the heads of house and aforementioned incompetence or personality problems.
    * There's no segregation of students by their abilities or ambitions. Everyone takes the same classes, and the students that excel are being given lessons along with the students who require a lot of attention. I don't actually know how well Hogwarts handles this, and in the real world, having Gifted & Talented programs on the one hand and Special Needs on the other isn't something that all schools have the budget (or size) for. Still seems like something to look into, because Hermione is basically being held back by being in the same class as Neville, and even expected to be helping to prop up the other students. There's at least some consideration for differences in aptitude, since Hermione >!gets a Time Turner in book 3!<, but I don't know how far that extends.
    * From what I gather, there's a testing-based approach to which subjects a student will take, which is combined with teacher advice and intervention. I don't know how well this works in the real world, but it suggests that the Heads of House are simultaneous teachers, counselors, disciplinarians, and altogether have too many hats, especially given how many of them (Snape especially) don't seem well-suited to all those roles. I don't particularly know that this is something you can change, or would necessarily want to if you could have the same system using the right teachers. There's obviously an enormous potential for abuse within the system, either intentionally (again, Snape) or unintentionally, and there don't seem to be a lot of checks and balances.

      another couple of things that are *super obvious* but I didn't realize were missing until I read Potter Who and the Wossname's Thingummy: 

      * There's no school store. Where do kids get the essentials like quills and parchment and candy from? They can't all stock up during the break, kids forget (or misplace, or destroy) things all the time. They're not allowed into Hogsmeade until like fifth(?) year, and even then it's only weekend trips. Fred and George must make the majority of their money just selling essentials to other kids, nevermind the prank materials. 
      * There's no official places to hang out, aside from the house-specific common rooms. So students resort to weird (and unsanitary) places like the second-floor girls bathroom.

    While this sounds great it is a really impractical way of killing wizards, see bubble charm. Nobody in their right minds has reagents for really deadly gases at home, and the common Chlorine gas doesn't incapacitate wizards fast enough. Maybe go with a fat splash of hydroflouric acid? But then you have the problem that everyone has been taught potions at Hogwarts so they take potion splashes seriously. (see dragonskin gauntlets in shopping lists).

    I wrote a fan fic as a teen about the idea of summer school to catch people up actually! It was not good of course but still a fun idea!

    I would add to  [somerando1](https://www.reddit.com/user/somerando11/)'s list:

    &#x200B;

    * Field trips. Kids like Harry are totally clueless about the magical world. Why do they not visit the Ministry? They could shadow wizards at work even!
    * Student exchanges - the Triwizard should not be the only way to learn about other schools 
    * Parent teacher meetings - it seems like parents only find out what is going on when there is a huge problem and then they send a howler. Parents from each house should visit for a weekend, talk with teachers and make sure kids are eating right and cleaning up after themselves and doing their HW... maybe even attend the supposedly super important Quidditch matches
    * More health focus - yes there are a lot of stairs but I would definitely have gotten fat eating Hogwarts food. There needs to be exercise and a salad bar!
    * Peer tutoring/mentoring system - the older students should be matched with the younger ones to explain things like sorting, clubs and help with homework troubles

  What are some general things I have to look out for if I'm building a world with multiple sentient species? More specifically, in a 16th-17th century technology level, with the races generally, but not necessarily, being humanoid at roughly human size, and living together in towns and cities.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    * What are the psychological differences between these people? That is to say, what "universal experiences" or "universal emotions" are they missing, if any? I think there's a temptation to make each fantasy species a [Planet of Hats](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats), which can be fine depending on what you're going for, but where I think things can get interesting is where base biochemistry is different in ways that give rise to cultural differences. An example might be a species that has virtually no sense of taste, instead relying on sight to inspect their food, which would have wildly different traditions and cultural associations with foods.
    * What are the cultural differences between cultures within the same species? No one is going to expect you to go all out, but adding in two or three major cultures to each species with ways to distinguish between them is neat, and really adds some depth to a species.

    More specifically to multiple species:

    * How and why do multiple species exist on the same world? I don't particularly think that you need a clever answer to this, but some people get hung up on it, rather than accepting it as a story conceit.
    * Where do these species collide with each other, and where are they in agreement? What traits have they shared? Can they interbreed?
    * In what ways do these species have to accommodate one another, or fail to do so? If, say, dwarves get sick from inconsistent levels of vitamin K, do restaurants print vitamin K levels for all their food? Are seats generally made to be adjustable, or do most places have booster seats for non-human guests? How high are ceilings? How high is the average step? There are a ton of little things you can add in (or specifically note) which will help sell a multi-species world. (The vitamin K example was something that I had to be aware of in real life, as I was cooking for someone on Warfarin for about six months. For real-world examples, I think the closest we have is either differences in religious observations, or disabilities.)

    Questions that are probably important to answer:

    1. Why hasn't one race killed off the other race/s? Neanderthals were either killed off or just out-competed in their hunting grounds. Even different geographic preferences didn't really save the Neanderthals.
    2. Is there a compelling reason for cohabitation? This fits in with the last question. But if the races compete for similar resources (food, territory, etc) there should probably be a good reason why they are living and working together rather than killing each other off. In different human cultures around the world, successful racial minorities have faced persecution and theft from the dominant local majority (this doesn't only apply to the Jewish people, Han Chinese, Muslims in India, etc have experienced similar problems).
    3. What is the power structure that allows for cohabitation? I have to imagine that if any race remotely similar to humans comes into power they will abuse the position to favor their own race.

    - u/Izeinwinter:
      ```
      One potential answer to this is that humans or human analogues *are not* on top of the pile, and the species which is has damn good reason to keep the rest around. For example, the dominant species is a bunch smarter than humans, but lacks hands. 

      I had a campaign setting where the elven species were ageless, and fixed in number (multiple souls, the ka reincarnates, without a spare ka, no new elf, no matter how much you try).. and this inspired the High Elves to repeatedly build empires in which they were a very small minority, which works fantastically when the average elf is north of six hundred, and consequently an arch magus that can cut you to ribbons with a training sword, but tends to fall apart when seven tenths of the elven ruling elite die fighting off a demon invasion or something, and now suddenly the typical elf is 22 and has sort of mastered magic missile.
      ```

  - u/Rhamni:
    ```
    Can they interbreed? If yes, what cultures do they have that the races haven't melded over the millennia? If no, why haven't they wiped each other out like it seems early humans did to other closely related species?

    I'm not saying don't use multiple species, I'm just saying without interbreeding or some kind of necessity to work together earlier, less civilized generations would probably not have gotten along easily if they occupied the same lands. For example, let's say you have an at first healthy city with free trade in peaceful lands. You'll have some rich and skilled human merchants/landlords/business people, and some skilled elven business people. Fifty years later, most or all those skilled human entrepreneurs will be dead, but the elves are still there, still just as talented, and much more experienced. Now, some of the rich humans will have talented children or grandchildren to take over their empire... but what about their kids? And their kids? And their kids? Throughout real world history, wealth tends to concentrate while exceptional people are alive and active, and then a generation or five later the accumulation either stagnates or is lost altogether. Meanwhile, an exceptional elf might still be making savvy business moves and investing in properties that won't be making a profit until 50 years later... The kind of social friction and racial tensions this would generate would almost inevitably lead to, at a minimum, the long lived races choosing to live in gated communities/their own cities because the shorter lived races resent their (at least relative) poverty.

    You can solve these issues any number of ways, like for example by having short lived races be militarily stronger and able to force a high degree of wealth redistribution, but the issues should probably at least be acknowledged and resolved.

  Okay, I've been working on plotting out a writing project, and I've got a small problem. It's pretty much impossible to explain without laying out all the context, so buckle up.

  The story is set in a 'magical renaissance' sort of era, in terms of tech level. For the most part, it takes place in one nation, as yet unnamed, which has a very unusual system of governance. In accordance with the will of the nation's founders, the smartest citizen rules. In practice, this is determined with two 'tests.' One functions as a 'filter,' making sure aspirants meet a basic level of intelligence. It tests for logic, rationality, and practical subjects like mathematics and science. The real determining factor is not set- it's a contest between the standing ruler (the Hierarch), and the aspirant. They must agree on a contest, typically one in which they have an equivalent level of skill. Whoever wins, rules.

  The Hierarch has a great deal of executive power. While there is a government outside of this individual, it mostly still exists because it's built into the fabric of society. If you were to dissolve the government, it would ruin the nation- but the Hierarch could simply choose to dissolve the government if they wished. Now, there are a few obvious problems. If the Hierarch has so much power, what's to stop them from refusing to accept any more challengers? The answer, naturally, is magic.

  This nation's founders laid out the essentials of this system, but they were well aware of the issues inherent within it. So they constructed three enchanted automatons, which were tasked to protect the integrity of the system. The Hierarch can do a great many things, but they cannot become a true dictator. They must allow any challenger who passes the first test to attempt to usurp them. If any attempt to do otherwise is made, the Remnants will cut them down.

  Now, we get to the actual story. To keep this post from being any longer than it has to be, it'll suffice to say the protagonist wants to become the Hierarch. Here's the problem- the one currently holding that role is clever. He knows that he can't rule forever, and that he might be beaten. So he's got a protege, who he's been training to challenge whoever replaces him. Then, he can rule from the shadows, without risking the wrath of the Remnants. So... the current Hierarch has to die.

  The protagonist can't simply kill him, though, because the Remnants will also slay anyone who tries to take power by force. And he can't take power and then kill his rival, because it will be painfully obvious who did it, and public reputation is important even if you have a lot of executive power. So he has a plan- he's going to get the Remnants to do the job for him. Maneuver the Hierarch into breaking their rules, while they're engaged in their duel of wits. That way, he'll become Hierarch, and get rid of his rival, while maintaining deniability.

  Now, here's the problem- it's very hard to write a character more clever than yourself. So I've hit a roadblock, when it comes to the question of 'how the protagonist gets the Remnants to kill the Hierarch.' Luckily, I can outsource my thinking to people who are cleverer than me!

  Rather than use a preexisting method of competition, and get the rules or details wrong, which I absolutely would, I've opted to come up with my own medium for the two to compete in. It's a board game in the vein of chess, but on a much larger board (the kind where you have to walk around to the other side of the table to move a piece over there), and with four 'armies' instead of two. Instead of black or white, they're divided into metal, glass, stone, and wood. Each 'army' has the same pieces, but there are distinct advantages and disadvantages to each. The game supports two players at minimum, and four at maximum. Glass is considered a viable option in a four-person game, where a strategy of avoiding conflict until only one opponent remains, is appropriate, but choosing to play glass in a two-man game is virtually suicidal.

  Naturally, the protagonist is going to play glass. His strategy is to use this unconventional choice to bait his opponent into making an illegal move, which will nullify the results of the game. Thus, he's free to lose, but his opponent will be killed after the match ends, and he'll be free to claim victory. 

  I don't have a set of rules for this game, and I'm not expecting any responses that attempt to create them (though if anyone feels especially inspired, I would welcome an attempt). What I'm specifically looking for, is a way in which the Hierarch can make an illegal move, not realize that he's done so, and continue the game to completion without realizing his error. 

  Some notes on what constitutes a 'breaking of the rules' for the Remnants: trying to seize power in an illegitimate manner (i.e. any way other than the system I outlined above), having challengers for the Hierarchy killed, and cheating in the contest of wits. They are not sentient. It's not possible to speak with, or reason with them. You can't exploit a loophole in the rules to 'convince' them that they need to kill your opponent. They aren't AI. Instead, they run off of what amounts to an absurdly complex internal decision-tree flowchart-thing, which their creators laid out. If they encounter a situation in which that decision tree has no course of action for them to follow, they are capable of summoning a simulation of their creators, which issue a judgement on the issue, and are then dismissed. This takes place internally, and instantly.

    What prevents a brute force denial of service attack? Have hundreds or thousands of well educated intelligent people take the first test. Now Hierarch *has* to personally deal with each person, play a complicated and time consuming game with them. This means you can take up all Hierarch's time and prevent them concentrating on anything else.

    >They aren't AI. Instead, they run off of what amounts to an absurdly complex internal decision-tree flowchart-thing, which their creators laid out.

    Um. So they *are* AI. Much of the time they don't perform AI computations, but pressure them with novel situations and suddenly they jump to human level intelligence as a simulation of their creators takes over. And this also means their creators are in a manner of speaking still alive...
    ```

    - u/PathologicalFire:
      ```
      To the first point- the initial test is difficult enough to prevent this from being a real issue. 

      To the latter- the Remnants themselves don't become human-level intelligent, they use a simulation of a human to get their 'opinion' on a novel problem. It's my answer to the problem of things like the US constitution, which was written by people who had no hope of predicting the complexity of life hundreds of years after they died. Rather than forcing their society to rely on rules that might become obsolete in a few hundred years, they left a failsafe that allows them to update the Remnants' programming if it becomes truly necessary.

        > To the latter- the Remnants themselves don't become human-level intelligent, they use a simulation of a human to get their 'opinion' on a novel problem.

        I would say that is a distinction without a difference. The Remnants are running a simulation of a human mind. The internal details and convolutions are irrelevant because: 
        >This takes place internally, and instantly.

        To any outside observer they are possessed of human level intelligence in novel situations.
        ```

        - u/PathologicalFire:
          ```
          No change is visible when they do this. They spin up a simulation, and that simulation edits their internal decision-tree instantly, and then is disabled. To an observer, they will respond to a novel scenario exactly as they would respond to something they were initially programmed to deal with.
          ```

          - u/zorianteron:
            ```
            In the limit, the decision tree is so non-permissive the simulation is invoked for every change in situation, so they're basically piloted by their creators' simulations directly.  From there, you get a sliding scale of how stupid (permissive) you want to allow the ruleset to be before the simulation kicks in.

            In the limit case, the whole system is superfluous (just have the automatons do some vague half-simulation of an impression of one of the creators' brains).  

            Otherwise, I think there's the problem that it seems either pointless or too vague/unrelated to the story.  You say it happens 'internally and instantly'.  So why do we care?  Does anyone in-universe know?  Is there any cost to running the simulation?  Because if not, why would they not make the ruleset very liable to call them up at any time, so that nobody can trick the automaton into not calling them up?  And if there is a cost... well, if we never see the change happen in the story, because it's all internal and instant, then why do we care?

            Basically, the rules around when the simulation can show up and how often/long it can operate seem to vague and in-principle powerful to game, and if you can't game it, there's no point in showing it in the story.  If you do show it in the story, you'll have to address exactly what causes an escalation and why they can't just run the simulation 24/7 for extra security.  And if you start adding in reasons like 'the simulation might start going mad/diverging' or 'power limitations' or whatever- then it becomes something we expect (want) the main character to at least consider gaming/exploiting.  If they become aware of this, they'll want to look in to it, and you'll want to elaborate on it.

            And if it never shows up, it's worldbuilding guff best left unsaid.

            Conservation of detail.  In a rational story with solutions, something like this screams out 'systems vulnerability'.  If the character isn't going through these guys (or attempting to, before giving up after finding out exactly why it won't work) then you have to make it clear they're so far beyond him that it's out of the question.

    I have some knee-jerk questions/ramblings. Please take them with a grain of salt.

    My biggest concern is that I feel the protagonist is a bit murder-happy. If he can defeat the hirearch why can't he defeat the protégé? Or otherwise counter the antagonist's plan without going straight to murder? The story needs to present a plausible and palatable reason why this is required (both why other methods won't work and why the continued rule of the current hirearch from the shadows would be so bad). And also, why the protagonist is willing to subvert the system by killing the current Hirearch instead of letting a worthy successor take the throne the established way (if he was worthy he could just be smarter and become Hirearch that way).

    And isn't it plausible that training/grooming and influencing the hirearch is not a new thing? In such a system, I feel that influential families, guilds and other factions would have their own private schools with the best tutors money can buy in order to put someone on the throne that will benefit them, either by being likeminded or by being groomed to loyalty and/or obedience. 

    If we look at our own world, and how much wealth and power plays a role in politics, candidates for the throne would almost exclusively be the result of massive amounts of resources. 

    It is hard for a poor person with a full time job (required to just put food on the table and keep a roof over their head) to compete with people that have never worked a day in their life and have had the best teachers, food, healthcare, etc. from the day they were born.

    Influencing the first test would also be a tool of the powerful; putting people in place to slant the results towards their preferred candidates, or just rules and tests that benefit their knowledge base. A little like Supreme Judges in the US are picked to some degree because they favor one political view or another.     

    I also feel that execution for getting a rule wrong/cheating in a game is a bit harsh. Any hirearch would have to be *very* careful to never give an order that could be interpreted as a forbidden action and lead to immediate death. 

    Failure to correct the Hirearch when he makes the illegal move could also be interpreted as an assasination attempt, if it comes to light that the protagonist knew. 

    Perhaps if the protagonist have extensively studied the way Glass can play in a two-person game, and have found some kind of trap that will put the Hirearch in a losing position but not immediately end the game, and trigger the Hierarch to take some kind of drastic (and obviously illegal) action to avoid losing. 

    If the game draws out accross multiple days there could be openings for assassination attempts, framing, blackmail, etc. The Hirearch has already planned for this though, having a protégé ready, so we need to know why losing power now would be so bad. Ruling through his protégé is always on the table. 

    Or, if death by cheating is a core plot point, perhaps the protagonist is aware of, or is responsible for, recent changes to the rules of the game, and knows that the Hirearch has not learned of it (or arranges that they do not). Then the protagonist only needs to put the Hirearch in a position where using a forbidden move is the rational thing to do. 

    However, a rational Hirearch would not go into any challenge to their rule without studying the contest material at great detail for as long as allowed, so any plot point relying on the Hirearch not knowing the rules is tricky (and arranging for the Hirearch to have a faulty rule book might be considered assassination attempt and punished by death if discovered). 

    Depending on who the judges are, they may or may not declare it cheating, and if pointed out by the protagonist, it may be considered assassination (he could have just said "actually, you can't make that move" when it happened, but chose not to). Or do the Remnants know the game rules and strike as soon as the move is made? 

    Sorry if the flood of questions come accross as negative, I found the premise interesting and thinkning about it led to having a lot of questions. I'm sure a lot of this is covered by material that didn't fit in your post, but hopefully you get something out of it.

    As a side note, for game inspiration, I recommend Player of Games by Ian M Banks. Great sci fi set in his Culture universe, and extra good if you are a gamer. It features a board game that is important for who holds power (although the premise is very different from yours).

      These comments are really insightful, thanks! I've considered a few of them already, so I'll try to go down the list. 

      The protagonist is capable of beating the Hierarch outright, but learning of his protege alters the 'win condition' somewhat. You're correct that there are powerful institutions dedicated to maintaining power- the current Hierarch himself is a product of such a process. He's one of the longest-serving in recent memory, and has actively furthered the cause of those interests, such as expanding private schooling (state schools have historically been extremely well-funded, but with more cutbacks under the current Hierarch), and even turning a blind eye to people putting chemicals in the water supply of certain areas, to lower the IQ of inhabitants (think Flint, MI, but intentional). That's why the protagonist wants to remove him from power, and is willing to subvert the system to make it happen.

      Again, you're correct that there are distinct advantages that the wealthy have under this system. However, as I mentioned, state schools are well-funded, and other systems are in place to ensure that everyone gets a more-or-less fair shot at the position. Even with the Hierarch trying to cut back funding for these programs, there will still be naturally gifted individuals capable of taking back power, such as the protagonist himself.

      The first test is also pseudomagical in the same way as the Remnants are. There is no human involvement in the administration of the test, and the questions can't be changed.

      Cheating won't get you instantly killed- declaring victory after having at any point committed an illegal move will. This is why the protagonist has to maneuver his opponent into unknowingly violating the rules, and keep him in the dark until the game is over. You're also correct that it would be a scandal if this came out, but the only witness will be... y'know, dead.

      The only judges of the competition are the Remnants themselves, and the populace has a culturally entrenched respect for them, meaning their rulings are almost never questioned. 

      Stretching the game across multiple days is a good idea, so thanks for that one. 

      With regards to the rules, I've thought about that a little. Since both the Hierarch and his challenger have to agree on how they'll compete, it might make sense for the protagonist to obfuscate his skill at the game, and pretend that his skill level is on par with the Hierarch (i.e. not much experience with the game). However, this seems like a fairly obvious exploit, something that the creators of the Remnants would have considered when creating them. 

      Hopefully that makes things a little clearer. Thanks again for your input!

  writing question here.

  anybody have any advice on describing fantasy cities?

  Ideally I'd be able to paint a nice visual picture of the city while implying whatever I need to imply about the city's people (wealthy/poor, open/shut-off, etc.) without saying such things outright. But i suck ass at physical descriptions. I had an idea that I would google around about architecture in various cultures and build up a vocabulary for describing buildings, but this didn't seem to help - wikipedia for example described in terms of various styles or movements that I didn't context to understand and which I can't reference anyway.

    Oddly enough, I think that GeoGuessr has really helped me with this, because you get used to picking out a general geographic location by paying attention to the most prominent features of different places. Some of that is stuff that you wouldn't necessarily want to put into prose (like the differences between street signs), but other stuff is really applicable for prose descriptions, e.g. how wide the streets are, how prevalent different forms of travel are, common features of buildings like, say, white-washed walls and blue rooftops in Greece, or the half-moon terra cotta tiles of Italy, the thatched roofs of rural England (granted, mostly in the touristy areas), different stuff like that which gives you a definite clue to where you are.

    I would suggest to focus in particular on 1) materials, which will usually be at least somewhat local 2) colors and color palette (though this is definitely related to 1, as the most common colors are going to be those that can be made locally, or are whatever natural colors the materials are, e.g. the reason that traditional American barns are red is that they mixed in rust, which was readily available and had some protective properties) and 3) architectural features (which will again relate to 1, since there are things that you just can't do well with adobe, and building techniques that are common to brickwork, and if you're doing wattle and daub construction your walls have to be pretty thick, etc.). That last is the only one that you need to do a bit of research on, but not *that much* research, because you want to keep your vocabulary right for the average reader, who won't know a cornice from frieze.

    In terms of giving a description of a city, it really depends on what needs to be set up for the plot, but my instinct is usually to focus on the geography and use that to help inform an understanding of how the city was formed, what it does, and how it works. Sometimes it's just a matter of trying to look at the city from different angles, that of a tourist, a merchant, or someone who lives there, and what they would think is important about it. Like, what would be on the postcards from the city, if they had postcards? And what would people take pride in when they said they were from there? What would make them homesick, what would they think is overrated by foreigners, etc.? And if that can be plot-relevant, or reveal character, then all the better.

    Edit: Another good one, if a bit stock, is how a city looks as you approach it.

  I am not a subscriber. I am not even sure if I correctly understand what rational fiction is.

  But can you explain that alice in wonderland joke to me?

    One of the things this sub loves to do is taking an existing work of fiction and trying to make it rational. 

    I.e. ensuring that the magic/scifi obeys coherent rules, that those have sensible consequences on the world's economics and politics, that the characters' motivations and decisions make sense etc.

    The joke, such as it is, is that doing it to Alice in Wonderland would be very hard.
