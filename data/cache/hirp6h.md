## What was the point of Gabriel Munoza in Chili and the Chocolate Factory?

### Post:

Gabe is introduced in chapter 3 as an asshole teenager building a super AI that has a very good chance of destroying the world in a fudgepokalypse.  This seems like a checkov's paperclip that doesn't really go anywhere - he shows up again at the detective's party but doesn't do much there.  Was there a larger point to this plot line or is it just a dropped thread?

  1. It was all for a gag.

  2. Chili was originally structured into three acts, and I decided to gut most of the third and slide it in at the end of the second. Gabriel and Lee would have had more relevance in the third.

  3. Gabe was my escape plan. If I decided that I didn't want to finish the story, everyone would have turned into chocolate and died. I actually wrote this ending once right after the kids entered the factory but I felt too guilty to post it.

  4. The AI does come back. Mr. Gun's shoes turn into chocolate and a dripping sound is heard when Mr. Bucket plays the audio recording of Keerthi's parents' death, which is them melting into chocolate.

    In that spoof of the HPatMoR puzzle bit what if nobody said anything to do with vaping?

      Nothing would have changed. But I was reasonably confident someone would say something to do with vaping.

    So, the first act was all the tickets getting discovered, the second was everything in the fectory, the the gutted third act was the (relatively short) finale, with the cutoff being, say, leaving the abstraction room?

      Most of the original third act would have been a fight scene between the kids and the Dahl characters against the forces controlled by the pickle sent to destroy the world. It was an overcomplicated wildbow parody that wasn't awful conceptually but I realized too late I didn't have the technical aptitude (or the desire) to pull off.

        I imagine there would have been some kind of riffs on “you needed worthy opponents,” “finally, everyone was working together,” etc?

          Take that, you pickle!

        While I'm *extremely* curious what that might have looked like, I don't think CATCF:FR was a bad length at all (it was longer than maybe most Dahl stories?) and I am anxious for you to start your OC thing so I can start throwing money at you!

  Fanfic to the rescue!

  >Mr. Gun shot Dr. George himself because he was getting sick of people sneaking into the white house, but it didn't help! The CHOCOR babies kept stealing cake!

  >It escalated! It all escalated!

  >Mr. Gun saw that his shoes were chocolate.

  >It escalated! It all escalated!

  I took Mr. Gun's shoes turning into chocolate to be the effects of the Chococlipper having obtained internet access and initiating the chocolatization of the solar system.

  To introduce the word "gazztromple" of course.

  Maybe as an aside that we're all a great deal luckier than we realize. How many calamities are near misses or circumvented by haphazard absurdity or freak accident? Someone antropically minded might say you should never, never doubt what nobody is sure about (but they'd be silly).

  The reason is simple. It is all for a gag.

  I think it was either a red herring or a dropped plot thread, just like the detective kid was.

  That being said, I wish they were at least somewhat relevant to the plot, but ah well.

- u/GeeJo:
  ```
  It's a dropped thread. Though it probably should have been picked up in the cavalcade of colliding catastrophes competing to cause the end the world in the final confrontation with the Street Pickle.

    ```
    I thought that was why Mr. Gun's shoes were chocolate at the end of that section
    ```
