  Just a FYI, you have quite a few typos, problems with capitalization being the foremost among them. I can't speak for everyone, but for me it makes the story less appealing.

  I've read the first chapter, and here are some thoughts:

  * From a storytelling perspective, it's really annoying when you use "*they*" instead of stating who "they" are. It's something I've only seen in manga, and I have to assume it's a cultural thing, because it doesn't really work in English.

  * Proofreading is a must. A character changes the spelling of their name several times throughout the chapter.

  * When you start dialogue following an action, it's always capitalized (like a new sentence). E.g. 
      * He looked at me blankly "what are you talking about?" *vs.* He looked at me blankly. "What are you talking about?"
      * There are more rules, I would suggest reading up on them since it might help clear a few things up. [Here's](https://firstmanuscript.com/format-dialogue/) a site that gives some examples.

  For some quick and easy corrections, I would suggest just copying your text into Word. I tried it, and it highlighted some grammatical mistakes.

      The thing with pronouns like "they" is that they have to refer to something. They are substitutes for nouns who are already named or understood in the context they are used.

      In that case it would be fine because you already say "a group of 12 boys and 5 girls" so we can identify "them." The problem is that in you story you don't do that. It just feels like you're trying to keep something a mystery that isn't and shouldn't be a mystery in the first place. 

      For example, 

      >He walked up to me and said, "Give it to me." 

      >He walked up to me while I was on my phone and said, "Give it to me." 

      Without indicating what "it" was it's confusing. But adding the object "it" is referring to clears that up.

      In your case, you start out with:

      >I have an ambivalent relationship with this place, I’ve lived here my whole life, although it’s been hard, I was able to meet *them*. No matter how hard it gets I can’t bring myself to completely hate it.

      >A large gust of cold wind had woken me from my stupor, and it was getting late, *they* had probably returned home already. I should get back before I ended up worrying *them*.

      First off is the emphasis using italics. In this case there's no real reason you should use it here. There are ways you can use italics (see [here](https://www.ignitedinkwriting.com/ignite-your-ink-blog-for-writers/using-italics/2017)), but this isn't one of them IMO.

      Second, "they/them" have never been identified. I would put it a bit differently, like this:

      >I have an ambivalent relationship with this place, I’ve lived here my whole life, although it’s been hard, I was able to meet **Arielle and Bryan, my two best friends and roommates**. No matter how hard it gets I can’t bring myself to completely hate it. (bolding just for highlighting)

      You can tweak it a bit, but the point is to specify who "they" are first. This way, you can use they/them because we know who you are talking about.

          Do you enjoy that in stories? 

          Personally, a lot of things done for this sort of reason just feel anoying for me such as; 
          - something in the future and then continuing the story in the past 
          - unclear refferences, not tagging perspective changes, etc
          - a historical recounting at the start of chapter on its events or for flavour.
          - any exerpt for world building or flavor not part of the story.
          - other perspectives over the same event (i dont want to read about an event twice)
          - lack of timeskips (i like timeskips and summaries of events)
          I could probably think of more but that's it for now

  If you're going to self promote, then at least explain why your story is a rational story. This subreddit isn't for spamming self promotion just to get more readers.

    This subreddit gets about two new posts a day. I have to wonder if we're shooting ourselves in the collective foot with our vigilance towards self promoters.

      Self promotion is good and fine but it doesn't make sense to say the sub should welcome all irrelevant or low effort self promotion just to inflate front page thread count. I didn't click the link because the post looked like it was fishing for readers, what with the uncapped sentences. But I did now and I think the author should've added the blurb to the OP since it does seem like a good fit.


      > Abhorrence is a planned to be long-running web serial which is set in a modern-day world and follows the life of Callum, an intelligent and hardworking 15-year-old orphan growing up with no family, only his two friends Bryan and Arielle, struggling to survive day to day life in a cruel world.
      > 
      > As a result of his awakening, Callum is thrown into a more dark and complex world scene full of moral ambiguity, he tries to stay rational and level headed on the choices he makes and how he faces the new challenges thrown at him as to not stray from the ‘right path’.
      > 
      > The side characters have their own unique personalities, goals, and roles they play beside their relationships to the main character. They are generally unhappy, and there are no winners in the story. 
      > 
      > How will Callum continue living in a world that abhorrently rejects him?

        I can see why this would make sense if we were being buried in irrelevant posts. Has this actually been a problem for us?

        - u/rizcoco:
          ```
          Do you want it to be a problem?

          - u/Brell4Evar:
            ```
            Given the alternative, I'll say *yes*.

            I'd much rather have a more welcoming attitude toward authors promoting themselves, even at the risk of having works promoted here that are not rigorously rational in nature. If this hypothetical problem ever rears its head, I will happily re-examine the need for gatekeepers.

            Until then, we have a different problem of alienating and sapping creative energy of budding authors who very likely are fans of rationalism. They're here, after all.
            ```

            - u/rizcoco:
              ```
              Then we have a difference in opinion. My preference is for the subreddit to actually serve its purported genre. We already have enough trouble defining rational fiction without throwing a filter to the winds.

              Nobody is "alienating or sapping creative energy of budding authors" by telling them not to self promote here if their story doesn't fit the sub. That's dramatic demagoguery. They can self promote in the many other subreddits or talk about their story in the weekly recommendation/open threads or Discord.

              Content moderation is an essential part of a subreddit's identity. Though the mods are already quite lenient from what I can tell.

                I think you underestimate how easy it is to alienate and discourage people. most people can't take ANY criticism, let alone comments telling them to piss off from our subreddit. 
                Not that it's a good thing.
                ```

                - u/rizcoco:
                  ```
                  One-what comments telling them to piss off? Two-if someone is alienated or discouraged because of a request to explain why their story is relevant, I can't account for everyone's sensitivity level. If an author is that sensitive, it will be hard to survive in a web platform where there is real vicious criticism.

                    Also,

                    > ... it doesn't make sense to say the sub should welcome all irrelevant or low effort self promotion just to inflate front page thread count.

                    Your baseline position in these comments is that authors aren't welcome here, are spammers, and are irrelevant to the subreddit.

                    If you look elsewhere on this thread, you'll see others asking for the author to provide rational context without the attitude of exclusivity. It's fine to insist on rationalist discussion - just try not to imply an author doesn't belong here until they prove otherwise.

                    Editing to add: The context of this entire discussion is important and bears some thought. If your comments were made in a Friday thread about anything, they'd simply be taken at face value. The fact is, however, that the comments were replies to an author offering up a work for review by the users here. What you wrote is implicitly about that author and their work.
                    ```

                    - u/rizcoco:
                      ```
                      Your interpretation is absurd. I have no idea where you're getting that I'm saying authors aren't welcome, are spammers or irrelevant. I made a simple if then statement: if you're going to self promote, at least explain why your story is relevant to the sub. My baseline position is that people shouldn't promote stories that have no relevance to the sub or make low effort posts with just a link and plea for readers. I thought that was obvious.

                      You paint my attitude of exclusivity as a negative, but that's exactly what the sub is for: filtering for rational stories. I don't see any need to tiptoe around the point. Also, no I didn't insist on rational**ist** discussion or imply the *author* doesn't belong here, just that they defend their *story's* appropriateness. I think you're projecting heavily on my words because they weren't couched gently enough for you.
                      ```

                      - u/Brell4Evar:
                        ```
                        So, the thing is - if it was just me, reading this into your work, I'd simply be absurd, projecting, or so on.

                        Others apparently agreed with my earlier comments, though, meaning they read the same tone from your posts. This really isn't about me.

        There's an entire frontier between our current trickle of posts and "too much" traffic.

      Just put in your story description in the reddit post. It's good enough as an assurance that it fits the sub and isn't a random fantasy story.

- u/MimicSquid:
  ```
  Can you give us a little bit about how rationality is a heavy influence or has pride of place within your story? The basic description you provide at the link doesn't seem to touch on that.

  Could you post to Royal Road? Reading white on black strains my eyes too much to read.

  ```
  feedback: your story's 'about' page needs to start with a quick teaser for the story, go into a longer summary (if absolutely necessary), lay out the update schedule, and then lay out a short blurb about you as an author. Key word: short. What's going to sell your story better, a few hundred words of marketing text, or actually reading your story?
