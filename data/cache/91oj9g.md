  I hate how much I enjoy Akua as a member of the Woe. She's been insufferable for so long, that I'm conflicted with how interesting she is.
  ```

  - u/Mountebank:
    ```
    Same. And the amazing thing is how it's not inconsistent at all how Akua's behavior has changed pre and post-mantling. She still has the same core philosophy and arrogance, but the only difference is that she's now on Catherine's side (pending inevitable betrayal).
    ```

    - u/GeeJo:
      ```
      And, following the line of conversation with the Dead King, a betrayal on Akua's part need not mean the end of their relationship.
      ```

      - u/CouteauBleu:
        ```
        So this is what the future looks like, huh? Akua in our faces forever, always just interesting enough that we can't get rid of her.
        ```

- u/UserAns22:
  ```
  In this chapter we learned that Cat might be a god and Akua has no problem bleeding them...
  I don't think I've ever been this excited for a betrayal.
  ```

  ```
  >*“We have our exalted,” Akua said. “Triumphant, Traitorous. The Maleficents and the Terribilises*

  Triumphant was the most famous one for conquering all of Calernia (might and ambition), Traitorous is the lethal joke character who betrays and is never betrayed (courtroom intrigue). I can see why they are the "exalted" of all Dread Emperors.

  But what are the Maleficents and Terribilises exalted for?
  ```

  - u/werafdsaew:
    ```
    Maleficent I was the first Dread Empress and created Praes.  Terribilis II saved Praesi culture by destroying the crusader kingdoms and turning back 2 crusades.
    ```

    - u/Esryok:
      ```
      Additionally:

      Maleficent II ended the secret wars with the Kingdom of the Dead and managed a highly successful military campaign in the Free Cities.

      Terribilis I appears to be the Praesi equivalent of Rome's Hadrian, third of the Five Good Emperors. Hadrian first codified imperial law and commissioned the Ars Tactica (seems like Terribilis I wrote it himself).
      ```

      - u/ErraticErrata:
        ```
        Maleficent II is considered the highest (if you don't count Triumphant, anyway) peak of Praesi influence on Calernia by most Guideverse scholars. At the apex of her reign the Empire ruled most of the League of Free Cities, sunk Ashuran war fleets repeatedly until there was an uneasy detente established and Praes controlled some of the most lucrative trade routes on the continent. It lasted long enough that there's still a bunch of Mtethwa loan-words in tradertalk by the time the series begins.

        Terribilis I is the father of most the functional aspects of Praes as a state: codified nation-wide laws, the Imperial court as proxy for the otherwise constant low-key civil wars and Ater itself turning into the largest and most powerful of Praesi cities (it was previously a toss-up between Thalassina and Wolof). His reign wasn't a golden age in the traditional sense, but it was long and stable - which is arguably much rarer, in the Wasteland.
        ```

- u/cyberdsaiyan:
  ```
  Cat encountering the Dead King's philosophy and realising that the games played on Creation are just that - Games. Closely followed by her sort of warming up to Akua... she's getting into that mindset. Although this difference in perspective might be quite hard to work with since most of her plans are relatively short term (5-10 years).
  ```

- u/haiku_fornification:
  ```
  **Stroll**

  *noun*

  1. A short leisurely walk.
  2. A victory or objective that is easily achieved.

  Chapter title game's on point, as usual. Now was it a victory by Dead King, who easily got into Cat's head; or by Cat, who'll likely get her joint war effort because he treats the crusade as a game?
  ```

- u/Abpraestigio:
  ```
  I'm not sure whether it's confirmation bias on my part, but 'Once And Future Queen' as Cat's new Name seems to be getting ever more likely.
  ```

- u/AurelianoTampa:
  ```
  >That was my mother’s lesson, dear heart. Hesitation is never a virtue: faltering is only ever the mother of agony.
  >...
  >“Do not hesitate, dearest Catherine,” Akua Sahelian said. “If you are to cut the world, it is best to have a steady hand.”

  Why does this sound so familiar...?

  >"Undersstood," hissed the snake. "But remember thiss, boy, other eventss proceed without you. Hessitation iss alwayss eassy, rarely usseful."

  -HPMOR, chapter 65.
  ```

  - u/GeeJo:
    ```
    The thing about universal truths is that, by their nature, you'll find them everywhere.
    ```

  - u/serge_cell:
    ```
    "It's a precious skill to procrastinate irreversible choices"

    antagonist in *The Stars Are Cold Toys* by Lukianenko
    ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Eh, screw them. Hesitation is a necessary and often useful heuristic.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Cat already identify akua as the sixth ranger, will she be a traitorous one? Most probably
  ```

  - u/leakycauldron:
    ```
    Is it too soon for akua to defect to the Dead King?
    ```

    - u/Sarkavonsy:
      ```
      I feel like he'd be uninterested in that - like she *tried* to get into the cool immortal club and failed.

      Then again, we've still not seen *much* of him, so who knows really.
      ```

      - u/leakycauldron:
        ```
        She's already an undead demon summoner. So is he.
        ```

        - u/WalterTFD:
          ```
          I hope those crazy kids make it work.
          ```

        - u/AweKartik777:
          ```
          Yes, but he has actually ascended to a form of godhood after his ritual done ages ago - Akua hasn't.
          ```

- u/Iwasahipsterbefore:
  ```
  >“And here you are,” I said. “The proverbial devil on my shoulder.” 

  Omg I really hope that this phrase in particular is because of my comment a few chapters back. 99% sure it isn't, but a man can dream.
  ```
