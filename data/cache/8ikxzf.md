  Wow, Cat being lonely enough to consider talking to \*Akua\* is a fairly poor sign. 

  Also, apparently goblinfire is made out of essence of demons? That has got to be an insane process\- how do you even design safe working protocols for an endlessly diverse set of creatures like that?

      Apparently, statistically within control.  The fields of Stregis which its been implied heavily used munitions was how many years ago?

      We might, have a first potentially linked fact to Chider's color considering she tossed munitions around like candy, if so I think that's where Akua learned the secrets of munitions
      ```

        ```
        We already know that sharpers frequently blow up before they ever reach a battlefield. Maybe they just need to collapse an entire cave complex with everyone inside every few months to destroy a demon-overrun factory.
        ```

          Oh I don't have doubts it's unsafe for the workers. What I'm saying it is an institution that after more than a decade is apparently not an existential threat to the empire.
          ```

      Goblins don't need no OSHA!

        The most hilarious thing is that if Black was able to control what the goblins do he would implement such a program. Or at least a evil/magical version of rules and regulations.
        ```

    As a shipper, this is good news.

    They contracted a certain Foundation to design Secure Containment Protocols for the task.

  Damnit Cat!  You're thinking clearly again!  You should be thinking that near-invulnerability is not worth insanity!  Literally 99% of Villains make that trade and **all of them fucking lose!**
  ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  > “In a finite world, one’s large cave inevitably means dead female for another. There can be no looking away when the very nature of Creation is not enough meat.”

  Words to live by.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Interesting passage to consider with respect to goblins being a matriarchy. Does female mean leader in this passage, or is it a reference to a more savage time when female goblins were not treated with respect?
    ```

    - u/Ardvarkeating101:
      ```
      It means they don't consider males valuable enough that some dying would be considered a loss.  It's only a loss if a female dies.
      ```

          ```
          ...this is actually *obvious* - If you have 100 human males and 100 females, and 99 males die - theoretically, the tribe could survive.

          If 99 females die, the tribe is doomed.

          (Unless goblin females reproduce like queen ants/bees...but goblin reproduction isn't explained in "A Practical Guide to Evil" as far as I know)
          ```

  ```
  Wait a minute, will Catherine's promise about the rules of engagement kep her from using goblin munitions, now that she's aware of their nature? or this promise wouldn't count as a binding oath?
  ```

  - u/GeeJo:
    ```
    I wouldn't think so, any more than a promise not to use chlorine to gas opponents would stop you from having salt in your troops' rations. Demons and munitions are qualitatively different, even if one is partially sourced from the other.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Only if the heroes were barred from using their angelically blessed weapons, which there aren't and wouldn't agree to.
    ```

- u/WalterTFD:
  ```
  Masego remains hilarious.  Never change man.
  ```

- u/AmeteurOpinions:
  ```
  You know, I always wondered about goblinfire. It just seemed like an overpowered phlebentonium plot device Cat or Black would use to solve tough problems. But now that I know it’s made from devil ashes, it all makes sense.
  ```

  - u/xland44:
    ```
    Your flair. Oh god, the memories T_T
    ```

- u/Zayits:
  ```
  Goblins *probably* don't have an actual demon down there to squeeze the ingredients out of, so they probably farm some kind of affected matter. Do you think they'd be able to make something out of an angel's corpse in Liesse? Masego did manage to reproduce its properties for the Ivory Globe, so it's not as potentially harmful to magic, at least.
  ```

- u/TaltosDreamer:
  ```
  Fascinating chapter.  I love getting a glimpse at what winter is doing to her.  It is also nice seeing Akua get some slapping around.
  ```
