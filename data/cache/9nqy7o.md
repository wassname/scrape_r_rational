## (Question Mother of learning [light implicit spoilers])

### Post:

Has anyone wondered who other than red robe might have damaged Zach?  this was sparked by the previous question about mother of learning, I got to wondering whether there is any evidence for Spear of Resolve attacking Zach and altering his mind.

### Comments:

  What motive would the matriarch have for altering his mind?  If she's past his mental defenses, she knows why he's looping and how the month ends if he fails.  She'd be dooming the real her and her web to destruction.

  But I agree that it might not be Red Robe; I think Panaxeth might have done it.  When they assaulted the cultists at the Hole, each of the seven had mind-control-blocking spells up, and Zorian later speculated that it was to block Panaxeth from messing with their minds.
  ```

  - u/ZeroNihilist:
    ```
    So Zach, in his typical "die killing a dragon until you succeed" way, assaults the cultists when they're attempting the summoning. He's there when Panaxeth is loosed, and gets his mind messed with.

    It makes sense, but it seems like Panaxeth would have created a better mental compulsion. Unless Zach was in the process of activating his suicide switch, so it had to be rushed? Otherwise, how did Panaxeth getting write-access to the controller's brain not result in an instant & total victory?
    ```

      There are failsafes that prevent the Controller's soul from being tampered with too much; maybe they also somewhat protect the mind.
      ```

        That's already confirmed in chapter 63.
        ```

        I wouldnâ€™t put it past Zack to do the same thing 30 times again and again until panaxeth figures out how to get past them
        ```

    I found her compelling even though she was planning on betraying Zorian, perhaps she was influencing Zach in order to use him as a tool across loops.  


    I really hope Zorian finally mans up and invades Zach's mind tomorrow.  I don't even think it's ethical to let your mind controlled/brain damaged friend tell you not to help him when his reasoning is damaged, beyond the fact that Zorian is letting his concerns over this course of action imperil a stunningly large number of lives + souls.  


    I could imagine him entering Zach's mind to find a shadow of Spear of Resolve, or evidence of her handiwork, twisting Zach away from full cooperation with Zach.  


    Weak evidence in favour of this would be slight personality changes in Zach pre and post Zorian's interaction with the aranea, which I think there is a case for.  Maybe Zach matured between Zorian's first loop and their later partnership, but I'm skeptical.  


    also, Spear of Resolve clearly figured out many secrets about the loop like a decade before Zorian did. Like, how did she know that only one could win?  Because she plucked it from Zach's head.  The only other source of knowledge might have been the Ghost Serpent, but that seems off to me.
    ```

      Why does that seem to off to you? It's the source she explicitly gives in her memory packet.
      ```

  ```
  It's possible, and not entirely out of character, though I feel like she wouldn't have done anything too drastic simply because she doesn't understand the loops' system and wouldn't want to effect it too much.

  My prefered theory is that Zach befriended Veyers early in the loops, together they eventually beat up or somehow tricked QI out of his crown, experimenting, Zach gave Veyers a marke. In the next loops Veyers learns of his limited lifespan and wanted more, so he turned on Zach and sided with QI who after some persuasion and trial was able to break the marker in such a way as to make it permanent, then Veyers learns mind magic from QI until he could sufficiently fuck with Zach's head, which he did though poorly, this made Zach's memory of the early restarts vague and removed all knowledge of Veyers from his memory, as opposed to just the knowledge of him in the loop which Zorian could do easily.
  ```

- u/Nimelennar:
  ```
  Another option: cranium rats.

  Perhaps they didn't do the damage themselves, but they could have flagged Zach for QI, who has some mind magic ability.
  ```
