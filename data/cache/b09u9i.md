  The mongauss sounds adorable but zapping your human sounds while giving it lightning resistance probably would make an animÃ© character.

  So I guess we found out what smashing a yellow orb with a sledgehammer would do - make your sledgehammer into a living creature. Maybe making a sledge dog or hammer hawk or something.

  Pretty soon they will all have their own pokemon fairly strong ones too, considering the dog could kill the snake (but then they got no orb?).

    "Sledge dog" is probably my favorite combination of words ever.
