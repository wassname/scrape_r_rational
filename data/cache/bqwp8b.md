## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  ```
  The epilogue finally came out after 10 years of **[Homestuck](https://www.homestuck.com/story)**, and in my opinion it redeemed the otherwise lackluster anticlimax ending by going full metatextual, so I'm finally recommending it here.

  While the start is filled with dated programming jokes and slapstick (arising from originally being a text adventure with commands sent by actual fans and trying to take the story in different directions) it quickly gets its shit together and honestly becomes one of the most original and engaging stories I've ever read.

  In short, it's a story about a reality-altering apocalypse-causing video game played by characters stereotyped around old internet user archetypes. Main themes are predestination (time shenanigans abound), isolation and internet social dynamics (chatlogs abound).

  Warning: it's long, clocking just over one million words, 9000 art panels and many animations and minigames. You won't finish this in a week. If you're not enjoying it by *[S] WV: Ascend*, a couple hours in, you probably never will.

    Seconded; if you're all caught up and are looking for good fanfics I recommend:

    * There are a couple of [explicitly rational Homestuck fics](https://archiveofourown.org/series/602557). Spoilers up to end of Act 5 or so, I haven't read these in a while.
    * The [Sburb Glitch FAQ](https://archiveofourown.org/works/340777/chapters/551606) kicked off the Replay Value AU setting. These works diverged partway through the comic's run, but they have some thoughtful discussion and analysis of several LitRPG tropes.

    I recommend these fics primarily on the basis of the quality of their writing and characterisation rather than their rationality:

    * [Detective Pony](https://archiveofourown.org/works/2427119/chapters/5371283), a full version of >!Dirk's!< gift to >!Jane!<. Starts comedic, develops into "a tough, emotionally draining read. But it's cathartic, in all the worst ways possible." Very meta, well-structured, and stuffed with pretentious and quotable references and wordplay. Also available in [audiobook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEqJ96p4CXY&list=PLQ8hhddV_CO3MPToD4TCoo4eKFqeQTk9l) and (soon) [puppet show](https://youtu.be/QCyK5NzagbI) format. Mostly independent of Homestuck proper, but you probably want to wait to meet the creator and recipient in Act 6 Act 1.
    * [Theatre of Coolty](https://archiveofourown.org/works/3275858) is also available in [puppet show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIavjRkRKT0) format, and has similar themes but is much shorter. *Waiting for Godot*, except it stars >!Dirk!<, >!Dirk!<, >!Dirk!<, and >!Dirk!<, sort of. Again, largely independent of Homestuck proper, but this contains spoilers up to the end of Act 7.
    * [BONES OF BLACK MARROW](https://archiveofourown.org/works/14692911) is NSFW. Extremely NSFW. In terms of the plot-porn balance, I think the Erogamer might be similar. It's an AU, the premise can be described as kind of like *50 Shades of Grey* crossed with *House of Leaves*, and includes CYOA elements. Once more, the main characters first appear in Act 6 Act 1.

    Lastly, in case you weren't aware, [Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/sweetbroandhellajeff/) exists outside of Homestuck panels.
    ```

    - u/NTaya:
      ```
      I liked *House of Leaves* and read through the very beginning of *BONES OF BLACK MARROW* because of that, and yeah, while it's a bit too NSFW for my taste (I'm no puritan, it's just this particular fandom doesn't make me want to read naughty stuff), the writing is magnificent, so it's worth checking out. However, unlike HoL, it has no physical version (that I'm aware of), so reading it on the desktop is a pain in the ass because I can't flip my monitor (so I had to install third-party software), and the text is way too wide to be comfortable on mobile.

      I'm also doubling the *Detective Pony* recommendation, even though I have nothing to add to the description.

      Finally, you have my gratitude for *Theatre of Coolty*. I enjoyed *Waiting for Godot* and considering the context of the other two of your recommendations, this should be good.

    Mother of Learning features this, although it’s not until fairly far in and it’s not a major theme, and offensive uses are more common.

    [Amelia](https://archiveofourown.org/works/3998737/chapters/8979811) (worm fanfic) features learning skills from others through 'technology'. It's not a major focus but it's there.

    [Magical Me](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8324961/1/Magical-Me) (HP fanfic) has this as a major focus but unfortunately is dead and have some weird character views.
    ```

- u/Sophronius:
  ```
  I've been really enjoying [Let me In 2](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7423061/1/Let-Me-In-2), a fanfic continuation of the fantastic Swedish vampire movie "Let the right one in", or more specifically the less impressive American remake "Let me in" (starring Chloë Grace Moretz as vampire girl).

  The movie is built upon the classic 'boy meets vampire girl' premise, though with a very original take to it and a really great execution. The reason I think this fanfic might belong here is because it features a rational, cold-hearted detective who chases the main characters as they try to survive despite the vampire's need for blood. It also features:

  1. Explanations of the vampire's abilities, with explicit rules and limitations
  2. The MC asking obvious practical questions (why not just use blood transfusions? Etc)
  3. An interest in book learning: The MC tries to learn science to become more effective
  4. Reflection on past mistakes, personal biases, and the ethical consequences of their actions
  5. Clear reasons and explanations for why the characters make the decisions they do

  I haven't finished the story yet, but so far it's been very interesting. There are points where the main characters make painfully stupid mistakes, but they are 12 years old at start so it makes sense, and crucially the story treats them as mistakes and has the characters learn from them. Also, the story has very good fundamentals, including writing skills, having an editor, powerful character moments and so on.

  If anyone else here has read it, let me know if you think it deserves its own post :)

    Do you need to have seen the original show in order to enjoy this?
    ```

    - u/Sophronius:
      ```
      It’s just one movie, not a show, and though I really enjoyed the original movie you don’t have to watch it. The author is kind enough to have the characters reflect on all of the movie’s major plotpoints when they come up. 

      Btw, I just read another chapter and it’s even more explicitly rational now. The MCs are literally learning about logical falacies and reading How to win friends and influence people. Geez, it’s like it was written just for us.
      ```

        There is a book the film is based on and it is really cool.

  Recommended (with reservations) [Made in Abyss](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bg35l3/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/eli878l/) a month ago, here to recommend another anime with far fewer reservations: [Sora yori mo Tooi Basho (A Place Further Than the Universe)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/35839/Sora_yori_mo_Tooi_Basho). Also about a group of gutsy young children on a mission to travel to a mysterious, hostile, distant land (Antarctica), but with a much more wholesome adventure / slice-of-life feel. Has some extremely light anime weirdness (graded on a curve relative to other anime). Beautiful animation and sound design, too.

  Haven't actually finished it yet, just past halfway through. But the (admittedly low sample) [IMDB scores climb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7836688/episodes?season=1&ref_=tt_eps_sn_1) as the series' episodes progresses, as do the [myanimelist](https://myanimelist.net/anime/35839/Sora_yori_mo_Tooi_Basho/episode) and [anilist](https://anilist.co/anime/99426/Sora-yori-mo-Tooi-Basho/stats) scores, so I'm pretty confident a strong start gets even stronger!

  I recently read [He Who Fights Monsters](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6942921/1/He-Who-Fights-Monsters) and was looking for something similar. This can be in several categories:

   1. Whether it be in the Rosario world

   2. Whether it is with a character having to make morally questionable choices to survive

   3. The MC starts slowly down a darker moral path (doesnt have to be for survival)

  Also, as always, looking for more Bloodborne stories to read. I've read Fear the Old Blood, Hunter, and Bloody Tinkers. 

  Furthermore, hoping to get some good Power stealing fic recommendations. I read Daddy's Girl and Claim the Spoils. Something like those would be great. Doesnt have to be Worm necessarily.

  Edit: Should add the disclaimer. It does not have to be rational, just something of decent quality.

  - u/meterion:
    ```
    [People Lie](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3745099/1/People-Lie) satisfies 2 and 3 of your conditions. It's a Naruto fic with a darker and more realistic look at the Naruto world in terms of politics, subterfuge, and of course, lies. I'm pretty sure it'd count as a rational story too (if one with a deeply flawed protagonist) but it's been a while since I read it and don't want to falsely advertise. The (seemingly) initial point of divergence is >!someone who wants revenge on the fox abducts and hurts naruto before he is rescued, and develops a close relationship with the head of Torture and Interrogation in the aftermath.!< Fic is dead, sadly, but still worth a read.

  So... I'm living Every Father's Worst Nightmare.  Last night, when taking my 10 year old daughter's phone away for the night, she told me she was using it to read.  A bit of interrogation revealed that she had managed to find a Harry Potter fanfic.  

  Yaoi Harry Potter fanfic.

  *Mature* Yaoi Harry Potter fanfic.

  **Cursed Child** mature Yaoi Harry Potter fanfic.

  I think I earned more Dad Points by being able to explain what "OTP" meant than I lost by scorning Scorpious/Albus.  And fortunately, I caught her before she got too far into the "mature" story (and the mature warning was for domestic violence, which like any normal deranged American Father bothers me less than sex).

  But to get to the point, do any of you fine folks have any suggestions for stories I actually can recommend as being age appropriate?  Ideally only about as "adult" themed as the Harry Potter books themselves.
  ```

  - u/iftttAcct2:
    ```
    Just in case she's interest in things other than fanfiction, I do have other suggestions, all around the same level of maturity as HP: Brandon Mull, Artemis Fowl, Ranger's Apprentice, Songreaver's Tale, Tamora Pierce, Jane Yolen, Patricia Wrede, So You Want To Be A Wizard, Jessica Day George, Matilda, Chronicles of Narnia, Anne McCaffrey, Nix's Seven(th?) Towers series, Diana Wynn Jones

    ...ok, sorry, I'll stop there considering it isn't even what you were asking for and if she does want stuff outside HP-verse that list'll last her a couple of years lol
    ```

    - u/SeekingImmortality:
      ```
      Seconding Diane Duane's So You Want to be a Wizard (or its companion series, The Book of Night With Moon, which stars cats)
      ```

  - u/general_enthusiast:
    ```
    I'd strongly recommend the Alexandra Quick series, which I think hits all the notes you're looking for: it's set in the same universe as Harry Potter, with a very similar feel to the magic, but set in America after the events of the original books. The writing is really fantastic, and it's no more adult themed than the Harry Potter books.

    Link here: https://archiveofourown.org/works/16927533/chapters/39772074
    ```

    - u/None:

      I love those as well. Should be pretty close to HP in how violent it gets.

    Seriously, though, there are so incredibly many fanfictions out there it's hard to recommend some without knowing more of what she's interested in. The good thing, too, is that she's so young she's basically immune to the generic, cliched fanfic.

    Best suggestion is to make liberal use of the filters available on websites and see what catches her eye. This is probably not what you were looking for and you already know all this but just in case:

    Highly recommend Dragon's Egg by Robert L Forward: it's about aliens that evolve on a neutron star, and it's written by a neutron star physicist. Has a lot of rational elements though they do have a technological "gimme" (magnetic monopoles) which they use to explain all the technology.

    I strongly, strongly recommend the First Law trilogy. The first book is "The Blade Itself". I don't know that it's particularly rational, but the author makes an honest attempt to create real characters and real situations. 
    A word of warning though - It's a dark tale, and I've never read violence that felt this real in any other story.

Lots of Asimov's short stories that have a twist ending feel similar. (Well, maybe not "twist ending"; somewhere between "twist ending" and "punchline".)

    On the other hand, I Will Inform Them doesn't feel like it has much of an ending; it left me asking the question "so what?"

  With the final episode of Game of Thrones airing yesterday, the last week or so I've watched a lot of lore and world building explanations about the world. It's not rational*ist* fiction, but I was impressed with how large and consistently interesting the world is (and the lack of idiot balls). The continent where most of GoT takes place is basically Britain next to a lot of really big other continents. If you enjoyed GoT, have a look at [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4J16GzUJ28) youtube video just going over the world map. It's cool stuff. The channel has a lot of other content about GoT as well, fan theories and in world mythology that got cut from the show, etc.

    Reading the books is maybe too obvious of a suggestion here, but, you know, they have even more world building in them. Although right now the books end at book 5 which is roughly season 4 or season 5 of the show I believe.

      Yeah, I've been trying to decide whether to read them all now or try to hold out for the next one. It's eight years since the last book came out, and if it's another two years or more until the next one I might forget little things unless I read the whole thing again. I caught up with Wheel of Time a few months before the author died, so that was fun. Luckily Brandon Sanderson swept in and saved us all.

          I can't wait. I hear Euron Greyjoy is going to try to turn himself into a Lovecraftian sorcerer god thing. It sounds really fun to read.

        Also most of the extra lore is contained in A World of Fire and Ice and in Fire and Blood: A Targyrnean History, both which are quite good, although there's a sizable amount of overlap.

  I stumbled across the music video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFS2DWgijh4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFS2DWgijh4) that uses footage from a show called Love, Death & Robots.

  Does anyone know of rational stories that have a similar vibe aside from Twig? Not as much about the big monsters fighting in battle arenas but something that explores the societal structures in such a setting and the lives of people in them.

    Have you read anything in the [Liadan Universe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaden_universe)? Is that the sort of thing you're looking for? Either way, some things to at least check out:

    * [Terminal Alliance](https://www.amazon.com/Terminal-Alliance-Janitors-Post-Apocalypse-Hines/dp/0756412749)
    * [I won a Spaceship](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16200959-i-won-a-spaceship)

  Any light, breezy reads for airplanes? Alternatively, any gripping novels that will have me in the first chapter and not let me put them down?

  Stuff I have already read that fits this description: The Handmaid's Tale (I remember when I first read it, I started reading it at midnight and keep reading until sunup), but I didn't have the same immersion in Oryx and Crake when I tried it, but if someone has another Atwood story they might recommend please do. 

  The Martian also did that for me because it was so "easy to read", even though it wasn't as engrossing/all-encompassing as THT was.

  I was recently disappointed with [Ra](https://qntm.org/ra). I felt betrayed. What began with magic being a field engineering, requiring strict technical skill, where only the most ambitious and industrious student/professor can become powerful, suddenly turned into a force that ignore them all. 

  To be frank, few chapters in, I really glad I decided to read it. For once I can feel smart: following up which character do what, accomplishing what, and deducing what next step they'll take to tap energy previously un-tap-able. Revelation that engineering-y magic being a conspiracy is where the novel betrayed its premise. It would be nice if the protagonist then use her acquired knowledge to beat the conspiracy. But no, magic being discipline is dead from that point. Her sister even took it in stride, relaxing in copy planet and all. On that point I wonder, why the author made us read that much text if in the end they became irrelevant?

  I need recommendation that can take my mind off it. Anything will do, but I guess I should list criteria which I have no aversion of,

  * Original story (not fanfic), 
  * Single POV character (soft criterium. Multi-POV usually shit, please don't recommend a multi-POV fiction if you're not impressed with how it's done), 
  * Consistent step-by-step world building (step-by-step means no exposition wall baring exceptional prose, consistent means if the story is build around untalented protagonist don't let him suddenly actually gifted several chapters in),
  * Ordinary people (no supers).

  Being in rational subreddit, I suppose it have to be a ratfic. Successful characters (leading protagonist and leading antagonist) should not be idiots, hard rules inviolable, exploits encouraged. Humorous optional, effective prose preferable.

    It's been a while since I tried Ra, I don't remember why I dropped it but what you're saying sounds familiar. 

    I would give [The Solar Clipper](http://solarclipper.com/about/) series a shot if you like sci fi – it's somewhat of a tribute to the Horatio Hornblower series, if people made money rather than war. Definitely lighter faire. 

    Traditional fantasy, but still no supers. It's been a while since I've read this one so it may be that there's multiple viewpoints but I don't recall them and I usually would since I also prefer just one: [Paksennarion](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/96278.Sheepfarmer_s_Daughter)

    Do-over time travel. One of the originals and best, IMO. [Replay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_(Grimwood_novel\)).

    I'd you wanted to try a multi-protag book, it's been a while since I've seen [A Hero's War](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War) mentioned around here. 

    Hopefully at least one of those is new to you!

  Any recommendations for traditional books, webnovels, or fanfictions where there is a strong emphasis on the protagonist learning magic would be much appreciated. Rational lit. preferred, of course, but not a requirement. Same for an interesting / well thought-out magic system.

  Thanks!

  ETA: Just the name(s) of the work is fine, I don't need descriptions or summaries unless you really want to add them - not that I don't appreciate it, but I feel bad that you're spending time writing a summary for something I may have already read. Granted, I suppose there are probably lurkers interested in the same things as me who may benefit from a summary...

  ETA 2: Most good stories don't have too much of this sort of thing because then there's little room for plot. Some works or authors that start on the path to what I'm looking for would include: Tamora Pierce's Emelanese Universe, Nuttall's Schooled series, Name of the Wind, Lightbringer series, Farland's Runelords (sorta), Spellwright, Their's Not to Reason Why, the Warded/Painted Man...

    Off the top of my head...

    - The Magicians, the trilogy by Lev Grossman is somewhat nihilistic and may be depressing, but very well written. Some people can't tolerate that the main protagonist is an asshole. Good writing and original ideas abound, if you don't demand a protagonist that is morally righteous. 

    - Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell by Susanna Clarke isn't necessarily rationalist but it is about the titular characters rediscovering magic that was long thought to be lost. It's written in a highly affected style that mimics older British writers, and is probably not for everyone. The novel is slowly paced especially in the beginning. The magic isn't exactly highly systematized, either. However, the payoff is great - it has some of the most evocative and imaginative descriptions of magic that I've ever read, and really does a good job of sellingmagic learned as unique and terrible and beautiful. 

    - LE Modesitt's Recluce books are, once you've read his stuff a lot, eventually extremely repetitive, sort of a lesser version of the problem where David Eddings had like one story for his half-a-dozen fantasy worlds. This is less of a problem if you only read a few of his books. Modesitt's stories are logical and well thought out and fairly decently written. The (very long) series of Recluce books are organizationally divided into pairs of books that tell the story of a single character per pair, and skip around a complex world over thousands of years. Reading them in strict publication order isn't totally necessary, and the first books were weaker in the qualities you are asking about. I'd recommend reading The White Order and Colors of Chaos together (the two together tell a complete and coherent narrative of a character learning and mastering his own magic).

    - Mother of Learning by Nobody103. There's been relentless discussion of it here in this subreddit, so I won't reiterate it much.

    ```
    * There's the classic, which arguably spawned the "magical school" genre (though the magical school part is fairly small): *A Wizard of Earthsea*
    * All of Brandon Sanderson's novels have interesting and well thought-out systems - be they magic or otherwise. Unfortunately he very much subscribes to the "if nothing exciting is happening, ninjas break in through the window" philosophy, which means that the main characters rarely spend a lot of time learning the relevant systems (and when they do, it happens offscreen). I'd personally recommend *Elantris* and *Warbreaker*, if you want books about people figuring out the world's magic system. 
    * Similarly, Will Wight's novels tend to have very well thought out systems that the characters learn over time. They also tend to be a lot more exotic than Sanderson's, in my opinion.
    * Wuxia and wuxia-esque novels spend a lot of time on the main characters learning stuff about their magic system and deriving insights, because that's what cultivation is. Will Wight's wuxia-inspired Cradle novels are particularly good, since they hit two of these bullet points. 
    * Speaking of good Wuxia novels, Tao Wong's new book *A Thousand Li* was pretty good, and mostly focuses around the main character learning how to cultivate. 
    * Since apparently I'm on a theme here, [*Forge of Destiny*](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21188/forge-of-destiny) is another great wuxia-ish (web-)novel focused around a character learning the world's magic system. It was originally a quest on Sufficient Velocity, so you can go over there to see the dice rolls.
