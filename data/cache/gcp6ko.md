## Can you suggest some rationalist stories about apocalypse? About zombies? Rationalist horror stories?

  Worth the Candle starts in a sorta-post-apocalypse zombie setting, but that's just the first book. It's got a plot device that "contains" multiple apocalyptic settings called Exclusion Zones, and several are visited throughout the story.

  CORDYCEPS is a horror story with some rationalist themes.
