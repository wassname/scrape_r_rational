**Synopsis**

“Even if this universe is truly nothing more than a brutal, bloody, shadowy forest, we Cultivators will burn all that we have just to give off a single weak flickering spark in the darkness!

No matter how weak each spark is, how short-lived, how small… As long as the sparks flow unabated, then one day one of those sparks will light some tinder, and that tinder shall light some fallen branches, and those branches shall set ablaze each and every last tree of the forest!

In the end, even the smallest sparks will eventually set the shadowy forest ablaze, and illuminate the whole world!”

**Nice Synopsis from /r/Rational** In FMoC, sweeping social change has changed the landscape of the Xianxia world forever. Secret sects have developed from being merely schools of kung fu to being corporation-like entities, with grandmasters and elders becoming equivalent to CEOs and Board Chairmen of modern-day corporations. Sufficiently advanced martial arts is the flavor of the setting; martial arts is interwoven into the entire world.

Schools of fine cuisine teach their chefs methods for cooking their food with magical fire and secret techniques for punching the flavor from one food into another.Universities host martial arts tournaments instead of football games. Scientists debate if the fundamental unit of Chi is a Chi Particle or Chi Wave, and have built Large Essence Colliders to test their theories on the nature of Chi. Magical physics is a study in and of itself!

The military uses high-powered enchanted swords that home in on the spiritual markers of enemy souls, rather than drone strikes, and invests countless crystal credits into researching military applications of magic.And all over the world, everyday practitioners of magic use their abilities to create new technologies, working alongside regular humans. Thanks to the integration of common humanity with the magic of the Cultivators, all sorts of wondrous things have been created, including healing pods, magical prostheses that can even replace the entire body in extreme scenarios, and even transhuman methods of capturing lost souls and bringing them back to life- all things which were once only available to the magic-users, but which have since become available to all, magic users or not. Heck, they even built a magic internet for muggles and wizards alike!

  Chapter 6 basically sets the tone for how this story deconstructs existing xianxia settings by saying 'look, your resource consumption rates are unsustainable, your society is top-heavy, it's got too many superpowered wizards that need to eat a whole city's worth of energy every single day, your society was inevitably going to collapse sooner or later.' 

  I remember rather distinctly the first time I read this chapter and how I went 'holy shit this is literally the most accurate criticism of Xianxia I have ever read, this is the perfect rational deconstruction, I need to share this with r/rational'. The way the author begins the story by challenging the entire establishment of magical society and basically yelling 'your worldbuilding doesn't work, your economy is bullshit' at the top of his lungs reminds me a lot of the first few chapters of HPMOR.

  Also, just in case you didn't notice it, the Supreme Emperor described in this chapter, who formed twenty 'Sects of Provenance' (or, alternatively translatable as 'Primarch Sects'), is, well, it's pretty obvious why the story is named 'Cultivation 40k' isn't it, now? :P

  ```
  This may be the best backstory I have ever seen in a novel of this type.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  HOLY SHIT THE EMPEROR OF MANKIND FOUGHT A REVOLUTION AGAINST SUPERINTELLIGENT QI DAEMONS AFTER CULTIVATORS CAUSED THE SPIRAL NEMESIS.

  I AM UNFUCKINGSPEAKABLY OVERJOYED AT THIS DEVELOPMENT.  THERE IS NOT ENOUGH METAL IN THE WORLD FOR HOW AWESOME THIS IS.

    ```
    I tell you man this is literally Tengen Toppa Gurren Rationality 40k. I wonder if EY's glorious mental image was as glorious as this or not?

      I had nothing but the Fermat joke.
      ```

- u/Cakefleet:
  ```
  Isn't the infant stage here the same as Nascent Soul, as used in translations of other Xianxia's?


  Why not use the same Ancient Cultivation terms as those in ISSTH, which is basically the biggest translated xianxia right now?

  Qi Gathering, Foundation building, Core Formation, Nascent Soul, and above that are the ones that seem to be different

    So the answer is... I was brain dead when translating and I never made the connection. Well I'll make the changes. :p

    That would have made my life a lot easier. I also need to find a better term for 灵根开发度 other than the literal "Spirit Base Opening Degree" for this next chapter...

    I really need a glossary /u/Drazelic
    ```

    - u/Drazelic:
      ```
      Getting on it asap. Do you have a skype or discord? If you do and are comfortable sharing it with me, send me details over private chat. Some aspects of the glossary I would like to have the chance to discuss with you in real time to ensure total comprehension!
