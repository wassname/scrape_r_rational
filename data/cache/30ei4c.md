  This Lockheart seems more competent than the original. I'm quite liking him already.

  - u/Sailor_Vulcan:

    me too. considering the original books, he's probably going to be the antagonist. Harry defeated Voldemort with an obliviate. What's Lockhart's favorite spell, again?

    Maybe Lockhart will realize that Harry is a copy of Tom Riddle or something. It's too early to really make a reliable prediction. But wouldn't it be interesting if Harry gets lured down to the Chamber of Secrets by Lockhart in an attempt to expose him as the heir of Slytherin, and Ginny has to go save him? Maybe Lockhart will make the basilisk into an inferius or something. And students who the inferius basilisk looks at get petrified instead of killed because the basilisk isn't alive anymore.
    ```

  - u/JackStargazer:
    ```
    A paper bag which could be expanded to produce a loud boom would be more competent than the original.

    This Lockheart seems *rationally competent.* To the point I may actually entertain the possibility that he actually has done what he said he has done.

    And that is terrifying.

      Competent Lockhart's are a minor theme in HP fanfic. It takes skill and knowledge to get the drop on hero after hero after all. A different sort of skill, surely, but skill nevertheless.
      ```

- u/TheStevenZubinator:
  ```
  If I'm not mistaken, Lockhart performed legilimency on Ginny when describing her eyes. 

  Also, was it ever explained why Ginny Weasley, Pureblood, Wizard-raised and naturally-inclined rationalist, seems to be the only religious person in the entire wizarding world? Not even vaguely religious, but specifically Christian?
  ```

  - u/JackStargazer:
    ```
    Possibly something for her and Harry to argue about.
    ```

    - u/TheStevenZubinator:
      ```
      That's what I'm thinking. Maybe it'll be part of her growth as a rationalist to lose her religion. If it ends up with her convincing Harry of the truth of the Gospel of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, I'll be pretty put out.
      ```

      - u/LordSwedish:
        ```
        "Don't you see Harry, the power that he knows not was the power of god guiding your wand."

        "You're right! The only true way to understand the world is to give yourself over to the divine."

    > only religious person in the entire wizarding world

    They do celebrate Christmas at Hogwarts, don't they? Trees and everything. (And they say "Christmas", not just "holidays.") I always assumed when reading canon that that was a subtle statement that wizards live in pretty much the same historical-cultural meme-plex as muggles. (Well, it might have diverged somewhere in the last few hundred years—maybe since Salem—but most religions are older-enough than that for wizards to think of them as culturally "theirs" inasmuch as muggles do.)
    ```

    - u/TheStevenZubinator:
      ```
      That's a fair point, but this fic is derived from HPMOR, no canon. I assumed that celebration of holidays were a sort of hangover from the muggle world. At the very least, no one in HPMOR discusses religion except to say that it's comforting lies and not held seriously by anyone of importance. No one is seen expressing a concern over what God thinks. 

      I can get behind the fact that this author has a divergent point and can write whatever they want, but it seems to really jar with the spirit of its predecessor.
      ```

      - u/derefr:
        ```
        Alternate explanation: *smart people of academic raising* (like Draco, Voldemort, Snape, and even Dumbledore) are very commonly atheists in magical Britain. The meme is still around, perhaps even with a majority of salt-of-the-earth wizards, but the kind of people who send their children to a magical boarding school (wizard Harvard) instead of, say, homeschooling them, are the kind of people who "know better than to believe in silly superstitions like that." Meanwhile, people-who-grow-up-reading-books (like Harry and Hermione) are very commonly contrarians (and therefore atheists, for one thing) no matter where they're found. Together, that's every character whose opinion we cared about in HPMOR.

        Whereas the Weasleys are the kind of people I'd expect to cling to faith (if just for the "community experience" of churchgoing), even in a culture where most people are atheists.

  I like it.

- u/daydev:
  ```
  A fine hero Hermione is, especially with her enhancements. I suppose, Harry taught her well about the distinction between PCs and NPCs.
  ```

  - u/Tholo:
    ```
    Hermione and Harry's first and foremost responsibility in this situation is to make sure nothing happens to the ring. Harry is out of the Biz, Hermione was making sure that things stayed that way.
    ```

    - u/daydev:
      ```
      It may be understandable as an immediate reaction, but it appears that the attack was ongoing for some time. So what, they were just sitting under the Cloak for some minutes, because Harry is so precious now, you must call an orbital strike if someone so much as sneezes in his direction?  

      Edit: That 'no consequences' criticism raised against HPMOR also totally applies. Harry and Hermione *presumably* screwed up? No matter, let's obliviate a whole room of people for convenience of our heroes, and carry on with the Status Quo. Lockhart is a scum, of course, he rewards Ginny for an outright *betrayal*, so it's a lesser point, but still.
      ```

      - u/Jello_Raptor:
        ```
        That is one of the few things I think was reasonable about this chapter. Lockhart is, after all, the man who has made his name betraying hero after hero. That he thinks it's a legitimate tactic is reasonable. admitting it is somewhat less so, but if Lockhart is a Slytherin I can even see that working out in his favor.

        Less reasonable is the cloaking, at this point is be very surprised if both Harry and Hermy can't cast good protegos, or go with my personal reaction, and get everyone to spam ma-ha-su as fast as possible. (When you're a tiny pixie a punch would hurt, and friendly fire is a minor issue. Well that unlucky got who gets hit with 50 would be sore , but alive)
        ```

        - u/Lugnut1206:
          ```
          Remember that ma-ha-su hits the target you're *looking at* not the target your wand is aiming at.

          As I understand it, that should help prevent friendly fire.
          ```

- u/Drazelic:
  ```
  Man, I was not expecting the Nundu to be redefined as a conglomerate of Dementors. (In canon, the Nundu is basically a big magic leopard.) That was pretty much the most jarring thing; whereas the dragon weakpoint thing was cool and the idea of lethifolds being baby dementors seemed reasonable, totally redefining what a Nundu is really doesn't work for me.

  Maybe make up a new magical creature name? Nundu doesn't even sound particularly entropaic or deathly.
  ```

  - u/Jello_Raptor:
    ```
    Actually it was the opposite for me. The redefinition of nundu and leithifolds made sense and the idea of death having a lifecycle from mere physical death to soul death to minor apocalypse is cool.

    The dragon thing though broke immersion. Dragons are basically daleks now? Small weak creatures controlling a much larger body :/
    ```

    - u/Drazelic:
      ```
      I prefer to think of them as giant organic mechas.

      You might be able to tell by my flair that I like mechas :P
      ```

- u/JackStargazer:
  ```
  Does Hermione not have a phoenix? 

  I thought that was the whole point at the end of HPMOR with Harry making her think she could still die before going to Azkaban.
  ```

- u/jalapeno_dude:
  ```
  The wizards-with-religion thing is really beginning to bother me. I hope it ends up playing a role in the fic; if not, it's just a grating difference between it and both canon and HPMOR.
  ```

  - u/brandalizing:
    ```
    Heavily seconded. The mentions keep catching me off-guard and breaking the flow of the story for me.
    ```

  - u/E-o_o-3:
    ```
    Wizards are religious? They believe in an afterlife (both for canon and hpmor). They celebrate the same holidays (though I suppose that could be muggle influence). There's clearly something at least nominally religious going on even if canon never brought it up. 

    Going off Merlin, we can assume Wizard culture gradually split off from Muggles during or after King Arthurs time and gradually became more insular, which means they should show signs of roots that are somewhere between pagan and Christian - as they, in fact, do. (Yule ball, etc).
    ```

    - u/jalapeno_dude:
      ```
      W/r/t canon, fair enough. I had internalized "wizards aren't Christian," but this is mostly fanon. See [here](http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/16058/are-there-practiced-religions-in-the-wizarding-world) for a good discussion--it seems more accurate to say wizards in canon are as religious as the UK in general in the 1990s (that is to say, not very).

      In HPMOR, on the other hand, wizards are at least much less religious, if not totally areligious, and explicitly not Christian. (See e.g. Minerva's mention of "Muggle religion" in Ch. 61).
      ```

      - u/E-o_o-3:
        ```
        Ah, I just interpreted that as disdain. Obviously, Wizards would grow to somewhat dislike "Muggle religion" which they associated with witch burning. "Muggle religion" the same way we laugh at primitive people who don't allow us to take pictures for fear it will steal their soul, or worship cargo cults, etc.

        There is a sense that they're areligious - There's no obvious theology mentioned and also they don't seem to have religious rituals. But then again they have *actual magic*. They *live* in a world of real, actual magic and rituals. Why would they feel the need to make them up? The psychological need for ritual to make sense of things would be fulfilled by living in that reality.

        Edit: 

        >it seems more accurate to say wizards in canon are as religious as the UK in general in the 1990s

        Yeah, I suspect the real reason is that Rowling wrote them in her own image and her own culture - instinctively spiritual with respect big beliefs about souls and afterlives but not publicly religious, with a few kooks who believe in tea reading hanging around the peripheries. And I'm guessing she drew more from Wicca and stage magic than actual pre-Christian practices in designing world mechanics.

        Relevant WoG from Rowling. I guess Rowling thought the "enclave" effect was limited to technology.

- u/E-o_o-3:

  Best chapter yet.  I think it's gonna be good. I just noticed the spell says "Pesky Pixie pester no me"

  How does Lockheart know it's the True cloak?

  ```
  Am I the only one at least moderately floored by how Lockhart *invented a spell*??
  ```

    ```
    Or stole it from someone else.
    ```

- u/Noir_Bass:
  ```
  The only thing that bothered me about Lockhart's speech was how it basically made Quirrel's sound stupid and/or incomplete only because the author added a bunch of new v2.0 magical creatures. Pretty sure Quirrel would've mentioned something like Nundus if they existed in the original story. Still pretty cool though.
  ```

  - u/LiteralHeadCannon:
    ```
    That's another justification of mine for connecting Lethifolds and Nundus to Dementors - it justifies Quirrell's not mentioning them, because they could be considered a subset of "Dementors, nature's second most perfect killing machine".  Dragons felt a bit more like a cheat to me as I wrote them, I'll admit - though still plausible.
    ```

    - u/Noir_Bass:
      ```
      Yeah, that does make sense. Really liked the thing with the dragons, btw, fits with the rest and makes them an actual threat.
      ```

- u/aldonius:
  ```
  That speech... was truly beautiful.
  ```

- u/kaukamieli:
  ```
  Noooo! Don't nerf the killing curse like that! It's specifically said that you cannot block the killing curse, EXCEPT for the patronus v2.0. Why don't all wizards run around with armor? They have non-living clothes on, why doesn't that protect from killing curse?

  edit: Also, Dementors are death is a public knowledge thing now? Wtf?

  edit2: I'm pretty sure Nundu isn't officially formed of dementors, and if it was, why the fuck would they keep all the dementors at the same place? Do they want to form Nundus? I think this fic takes too many artistic freedoms.

  edit3: Lockhart knows Hermione has the true cloak of invisibility? And he tells that to the whole class? Seriously? Ah, he didn't, and he somehow found out at a glance, and told the whole class who couldn't have figured it out themselves anyway... Aaaand he obliviates everyone. Wtf.

  edit4: Ginny didn't figure out she could make a bookcase or something shine, but had to make everyone else a target? That's pretty bad.
