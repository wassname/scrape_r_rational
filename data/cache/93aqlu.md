(note that the 'net score' is APPROXIMATE: vote fuzzing is in full effect and if you reload the thread a few times you'll see the vote counts swing back and forth.  This is not an actual representation of people currently voting, this is Reddit's anti-bot behavior and means that no one is ever able to truly tell the exact number of votes.)

We can see here a cluster of four submissions within ten votes of each other;  I don't know enough about range voting analysis to interpret the results, but at first glance it seems relatively close.  There really was a lot of good work put into each of these submissions, and it shows; I applaud each of you who donated your time and talent to putting our collective thoughts into words.

So where do we go from here?  As you might suspect from the previous thread schedules, this is as far as I myself planned for, so we're at a bit of a pivot here.  I see a few main options:

* Put up new voting threads and narrow selections down further until a more clear winner is reached
* Begin the solution discussion anew with the top four solutions as a baseline
* Run with the top entry and begin iterating on it (or as suggested by /u/AlexanderWales, put the winner up temporarily in the sidebar and begin experimenting with it)
* Something else

      Like I said: a sidebar post should be short and sweet, a high-level overview, not a wall of text.

      That first paragraph there is too wordy and [needs slimming down.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/196309529850281984/474362120964800514/unknown.png)

      I'm going to work on a rewording of the post right now. I'm all for a link to a subreddit wiki article where we post the full content of your proposal though.

      Edit: Assuming you haven't read this post yet, here's my tweak of the first paragraph: 

      >In "Rational" fiction, a character's intellectual agency is always put above tropes. Characters pursue their goals consistently, and the consequences of their actions are realistic within the world and the story's plot.

      Original:
      >    "Rationality" is a specific quality of any fictional work, independent of genres and settings. It describes the extent to which the work explores thoughtful behaviour of people in honest pursuit of their goals, as well as consequences of their behaviour on the fictional world or the story's plot. In highly-rational fiction, realistic intellectual agency is put above established literary tropes, and all other aspects of the narrative.
      ```

      - u/Noumero:
        ```
        Hmm. 

        >a character's intellectual agency

        Shouldn't refer to only "characters". It's meant to apply to background agents as well, to people who don't appear in the story, but whose existence is implied by the worldbuilding. A perfectly-rational story would model them as rational agents as well, which is meant to enforce consistent worldbuilding.

        What do you think about this?:

        >Rational fiction aims to explore realistic intellectual agency and its consequences on fictional worlds and story plots, valuing it over all other narrative elements. 

        >All fictional works are "rational" to an extent. *Highly-rational* fiction could include one or more of the following features:

        ><...>

        It's a bit shorter than yours, and I think hits more points. I'm not entirely satisfied with the wording, though.
        ```

      - u/ArisKatsaris:
        ```
        This doesn't merely reword but completely omits significant aspects of the definition, like 'thoughtful behaviour', or that the story *explores* this behaviour and its consequences.

        I also feel it goes against the spirit of the definition since one of the aspects of Noumero's definition is that it treats 'rationality' as a quality that can be higher or lower, rather than a specific category.

        I would thus vote against the particular tweak.
        ```

- u/InfernoVulpix:
  ```
  I voted for the winner, so my perspective is a little biased, but I don't think I'd want to repeat previous steps.  I'm okay with tweaking the winning solution to better fit the sidebar (maybe create a discussion thread for tweak suggestions, with the understanding that the core ideas and concepts are set in stone) or maybe trying to combine the three winners into one compromise solution.  And of course, running with what we've got as the winner sounds fine to me.

  One last discussion thread for tweaks does sound like a good idea, I think.  People with criticisms can make more precise observations now that they're dealing with one solution in specific, and we can try to see if the phrasing can be improved in any way without losing clarity (brevity is important for a sidebar, after all).
  ```

- u/best_cat:
  ```
  **Run with it**

  The winner is a bit wordy for my taste.  But it hits the key notes. 
   And, if nothing else, we should have a bias towards action.

  And in the spirit of 'bias towards action,' I'd vote that we give flairs to everyone who put up a well-formed proposal.  Even if they didn't win they put up a non-trivial effort.  And that should get encouraged.
  ```

  - u/ketura:
    ```
    I actually really dig the flair suggestion.    


    If we do run with it, how should we go about iterating on it?  Start a new weekly thread series on just that solution?  Put it as-is on the sidebar and revisit it in a month or two once people have had time to focus on this particular proposal?  Set it in stone for the foreseeable future?
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      I'll add flair either tonight or tomorrow, shouldn't be much work so long as I can find something appropriate.
      ```

      - u/oliwhail:
        ```
        Maybe /u/Noumero gets "The Definition of Rational"? :D

        Myself, /u/ArisKatsaris, & /u/LieGroupE8 can be, idk, "Sidebar Contender", while /u/Vivificient, /u/ElizabethRobinThales, /u/Sailor_Vulcan, /u/ishaan123, and /u/0Gitaxian0 get "Sidebar Contestant"?

        What y'all think, tagged folks?
        ```

        - u/ArisKatsaris:
          ```
          Or "Definer of Rational", perhaps.
          ```

        - u/LieGroupE8:
          ```
          Flairs? Cool! Wasn't expecting that, but I'm good with whatever you all decide. "Sidebar Contender" is okay with me.
          ```

    - u/oliwhail:
      ```
      > Put it as-is on the sidebar and revisit it in a month or two once people have had time to focus on this particular proposal?

      Dis one
      ```

      - u/ArisKatsaris:
        ```
        I think I also approve. Put it there, let people see how it feels to them.

        A month or two from now, we can have a "Suggested Tweaks to the Sidebar" discussion, where people can discuss suggested tweaks, minor or major. Then we can put said specific tweaks to the vote again, (or perhaps some tweaks will be minor enough and uncontroversial enough that if there's no objection from either the community nor Noumero himself, a vote might not even be needed).
        ```

        - u/LieGroupE8:
          ```
          I, too, like this suggestion. It will be good to beta-test the winner. In the "suggested tweaks" post, we should account for feedback from people outside the community. They're the ones who can provide the most information about usefulness.
          ```

- u/blazinghand:
  ```
  All these threads were kinda a lot of action, and for a relatively low activity user like me it was pretty opaque where and when to come in with my contributions. It would be a big drain and just a lot of action. As a result, I ended up not taking part in this. Probably there weren't a lot of people like this, so I wouldn't worry about it too much, but I may not have been the only one. Overall, it seems not to have mattered as we got a good outcome regardless, but hopefully this feedback helps.

  This is not an attempt to shit on u/dwood15 or any of the other people who took part in this process, or anything like that, just a personal experience that may be a useful data point for future things like this.
  ```

  - u/ArisKatsaris:
    ```
    I invite you to share any contributions you have right now and here, if you so want. They may be helpful in influencing future tweaks.
    ```
