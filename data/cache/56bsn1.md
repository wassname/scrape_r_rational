## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  In [this very interesting discussion](http://archive.is/msyTF), the denizens of 4chan's "/v/ - Video Games" board dispute the definitions and connotations of various words that are used to describe users of magic--`wizard`, `sorcerer`, `witch`, `warlock`, `shaman`, etc.

  Can a person truly be called a "fan" of a work if he doesn't like the *entirety* of that work? How valid is the position of *[Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644)* as my favorite story if, as [this argument](http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/54bz8l/q_recommendations_similar_to_mother_of_learning/d80kjy3?context=2) revealed, I've largely skimmed its lewder sentences in *each* of my *six* readings of the book? How valid is the position of *[In the Blood](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6207715)* as my second-favorite *Naruto* story if I skipped *most* of the epilogues on my first reading and omitted not only *all* the epilogues but also *the entirety of Arc 5* (which makes up eight percent of the story's chapter count, epilogues and author's notes excluded) from my second reading? How valid are the positions of *[Atlas Shrugged](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/662)* and *[The Fountainhead](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2122)* among my favorite stories if I've always neglected to read the vast majority of each book's climactic speech? (And so on.)

  Of course, more clear-cut instances of this phenomenon do exist. I gave up on *[Wharf Rat](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12097887)* at the end of [Chapter 19](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12097887/19),\* on *[Trump Card](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10894754)* at the beginning of [Chapter 20](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10894754/20),\* and on *[Chunin Exam Day](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411)* (on all readings after the first one) at the beginning of [Chapter 35](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411/35)--so, for those stories, I can very simply say, e.g., "I like the first half (through Chapter 34) of *Chunin Exam Day*, but it's my opinion that the second half sinks too far into bashing and harem shenanigans to be enjoyable." Where, however, is the line drawn between "I like this story, with a few negligible quibbles." (e.g., *Time Braid*) and "I like this *part* of the story, but hold only indifference or dislike toward the *rest* of the story." (e.g., *Chunin Exam Day*)? After what particular percentage of the story has been discarded does the overall *shorthand* opinion shift from one position to the other? I, at least, think it's an interesting question.

  \*Or, more precisely, I *read* one or two chapters past that point, but bothered to *download* only the chapters *before* it.

  ---

  If you haven't read them, by the way, I do highly recommend both *[Chunin Exam Day](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411)* and *[Partially Kissed Hero](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4240771)*. *CED* starts to get bogged down with boring harem shenanigans in [Chapter 22](#s " (in which Naruto marries Hinata, Temari, AND Tenten, before starting to bring them and other females into the loop in Chapter 33)") and descends into pathetically-petty bashing against Sasuke and Kakashi in [Chapter 35](#s " (in which Naruto uses Mind-Body Switch to ruin Sasuke's reputation by making him soil himself, among other things)"), while *PKH* veers closer to the ["crosses the line twice"](https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Crosses_The_Line_Twice) end of the spectrum [as it nears its "end"](#s " (Chapters 83 and 84 feature a procession of the denizens of Wonderland from Trafalgar Square to Buckingham Palace, while Chapter 99 contains the nuclear destruction of the entire Muslim world)")--but both stories contain many *extremely*-cool ideas.

    There's [an argument](https://web.archive.org/web/20130525211228/http://plover.net/~bonds/objects.html) that fandom (as opposed to general appreciation/enjoyment) may even *require* a work to be flawed.  If a work isn't a mixture of inspiring and flawed, then the appreciators and the detractors aren't sharpening their memes against each other, and (so goes the theory) it'll be difficult for some elements of fandom, such as fan identity, to form.

    (While hunting that article I found there was [an LW discussion of it](http://lesswrong.com/lw/z4/do_fandoms_need_awfulness/) as well.)

      I have no idea whether that article is brilliant or idiotic. On the one hand, humans do congregate into social groups as a defense mechanism and there is evidence that implicit loyalty gave us an evolutionary advantage. On the other hand, I find the author's extreme simplification of the subject to be insufficient for something as complicated and unexplored as the psychology of taste in fiction.

    I can sympathize, especially since I have a tendency jump ship on long running stories earlier than other fans agree they jumped the shark. I wanted to stop watching Supernatural and Fringe halfway through despite how much I liked the characters, I only recommend the first seasons of House of Cards and Penny Dreadful even though they're only part of the story, I thought Daredevil's second season paled in comparison to the first, and as much as I loved the first 10 or so episodes of Death Note I still pretend the rest never happened.

    Of course, there are a few examples where my perseverance paid off. I was disappointed with season 2 of Sherlock only for 3 to blow me away, the middle third of Young Justice season 2 was bland and generic but the rest turned out to be awesome, Madoka Magika failed to resonate with me until the ending made me feel something I never had, and I even thought HPMOR was going downhill near the end with Harry angsting and getting no help from even his parents yet I found the ending satisfying.

    There are some other stories that triggered less dramatic feelings in me, though. The first book in the Night Angel Trilogy was the best by far, I liked the first half of Code Geass significantly more than the second, Sgt. Frog is one of the funniest things I've ever seen but failed to deliver after the first season, and Kenshin is still my favorite manga despite a ridiculously long and dull epilogue after Shishio.

    I guess in the end you just like what you like and get what you can out of what you can. A lot of what we like is imperfect, which makes it difficult to recommend to those who may not share our feelings toward it. We all have our own masterpieces and want others to love them as much as we do, but they frequently don't. As someone who is WAY too self conscious about what I do and don't like, this is something that shouldn't bother us no matter how much we relate to people through shared fandoms.

    this is an interesting way to look at stories. most stories i read are not super good only partway through. Either they are very good throughout or they are subpar throughout. Or they start off decently but not amazing in the beginning and either get slightly better or slightly worse as the story goes on. I've rarely if ever read a story that started out really really good and drastically deteriorated as it progressed. The only example I can think of that really comes close is the Bleach anime, and that was only because it kept increasing in filler and fighting without enough plot and character development to make up for it, not because of anything inherently worse about the story or the storytelling itself.

    You must be very skilled at finding high-quality novel writing if you can even find that many novels that have high quality beginnings and low quality endings, in addition to overall good works, despite sturgeon's law.

      I haven't found *that* many. *Wharf Rat*, *Trump Card*, *[The Wizard of the Kaleidoscope](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6995114)*, and maybe *[For the Price of a Soul](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9265719)* and *[The Unincorporated Man](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4025200)* are the only individual books that come to mind. For series, the drop from *[Vapors](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9855872)* to *[Clarity](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10552144)* qualifies, as well as perhaps the ever-expanding cast of the series begun with *[Austraeoh](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/25966)*.

      (I also have vague memories of being disappointed in *[The Golden Transcendence](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/632753)* after greatly enjoying the first two books in [the trilogy](https://www.goodreads.com/series/41545), many years ago. I was quite surprised when, just a few months ago, I read in *[Rationality: From AI to Zombies](https://intelligence.org/2015/03/12/rationality-ai-zombies)* that Mr. Yudkowsky himself shared this opinion, and that the drop in quality was soon followed by the author's conversion to Christianity.)

  Weekly update on my rational pokemon game, which for now is work on the data creation tool Bill's PC ([previous threads here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EUSMDHdRdbvQJii5uoSezbjtvJpxdF6Da8zqvuW42bg/edit?usp=sharing)):


  This last week has resulted in a lot of designs being hammered out.  The new Obedience/Attitude stats replace the old Respect/Loyalty system, which has been moved to the individual pokemon (and not their species definition.)


  [A grand list of features has been started](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13e4bMBgsvshUBFShes2bG3RGXIzVYh16EPboqDTdpfA/edit?usp=sharing).  This will later be reorganized into a roadmap, but for now it lists all the things we’d *like* to see in the game, to help me understand how each system needs to be built. 


  Work has begun in earnest on the Move Making tab.  As part of this, [a spreadsheet was put together](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sPZPDEohBhm8y4gbdfGHPv5T1yF7rXnxAzNDpTuLqWA/edit#gid=0) for figuring out what moves from canon can be used in their current state.  This spreadsheet unfortunately does not differentiate between moves whose mechanics will be used and moves which merely have a good name that will be reassigned, but this is the first draft.


  A lot of the types were shifted around as a result of this:


  * Dragon has been redefined as a damage type to represent *raw energy manipulation* and as an archetype to represent *rage*. Hyper beam is more than likely a Dragon-type move for both reasons.

  * Fairy has been given a purpose: it is a type that has to do with *Light*, both in the use of optical illusions and photonic blasts.  Dark types are not immune to these illusions as they do not affect the mind.

  * Bug has been salvaged and redesigned as a damage type that centers around *infestation*.  Parasect spreads a rapidly-growing fungus while Beedrill injects Weedle larva, both of which deal Bug-type damage as they atonomously consume the target inside-out.

  * Ground has found itself more or less gutted. The majority of its signature moves are either earthquakes (Earthquake, Magnitude, Fissure), not related to the ground at all (Bone Club, Bonemerang) or actually found to be more rock-type.  The type itself looks like it's going to be more of a defensive, ferocious, bulky Beast type, with the various true earthbending moves moved to Psychic as a subset of telekinesis.  As a result, the more 'pure' ground-types (Diglett, etc) will probably be given partial Psychic typing and a high affinity for those moves.


  Fighting is also currently under debate.  It seems to me there is no *fundamental* reason that something would be hurt by Karate Chop significantly more than it would by Double Slap, so my current idea is to roll most physical Fighting moves into Normal, with Ki-based and Aura moves staying as the true manifestation of Fighting.  I am recieving backlash on this, though, so we're still working it out.


  If you'd like to chime in for the debate, feel free to list your feelings here or [on the #pokengineering channel of the /r/rational Discord server](https://discord.gg/sM99CF3).


  We also had a certain amount of brainstorming for a name for the project, which IMO was mostly fruitless.  I personally like the "Pokemon Renegade" suggestion the most, but even that seems a bit off somewhat.


  This week I aim to finish hooking up the move tab, get a solid release build out, and continue hashing out the type debate.  Once the move tab is working nicely, Bill's PC will be in a good enough state to be able to start working on the game itself, though I will need to come back to add things such as map support, quests, NPC editing, and so forth.

    Have you considered ditching the "pokemon" theme entirely, for the main engine?

    Call the game engine "Ketura's combat monster engine", and then release pokemon themed data files, as a separate entity.

    This makes it a lot easier to respond to intellectual property claims, and keep you branding intact throughout.

    Nintento asks you to take down pokemon renegade, but fans still know to google "Ketura's combat monster engine" for the latest news about where to find data files for the engine.

    >Dragon has been redefined as a damage type to represent raw energy manipulation and as an archetype to represent rage. Hyper beam is more than likely a Dragon-type move for both reasons.

    Yep, this is basically how I'm imagining Dragon Types so far :)

    >Fairy has been given a purpose: it is a type that has to do with Light, both in the use of optical illusions and photonic blasts.  Dark types are not immune to these illusions as they do not affect the mind.

    I approve, and this is how I headcanon Fairy moves being resisted by Fire and Steel, though why Poison resists it is still a mystery. (Poison is just a nonsense type in general, when it comes to its weaknesses and resists).

    >Bug has been salvaged and redesigned as a damage type that centers around infestation.  Parasect spreads a rapidly-growing fungus while Beedrill injects Weedle larva, both of which deal Bug-type damage as they atonomously consume the target inside-out.

    This is a really neat way to conceptualize what Bug types attacks are as a distinct physical trait, rather than the emergent-property-types idea of bug pokemon themselves being what matters most. I like it a lot, though presumably this doesn't include things like Signal Beam and Bug Buzz? Or are those going to be re-Typed?

    >Ground has found itself more or less gutted. 

    Why not just make Ground pokemon be pokemon that are more reliant on being on earth/soil, either for mobility or as part of their substance? Bone Club/Bonemerang definitely need to be re-typed, but what Ground moves are more like Rock moves? Most that I can find are earth, sand, or mud related.

    >Fighting is also currently under debate.  It seems to me there is no fundamental reason that something would be hurt by Karate Chop significantly more than it would by Double Slap, so my current idea is to roll most physical Fighting moves into Normal, with Ki-based and Aura moves staying as the true manifestation of Fighting.  I am recieving backlash on this, though, so we're still working it out.

    To me, Normal attacks that use fists or hands are just blunt damage. What makes Fighting moves Fighting is the intent and strength behind them: basically a Hitmonchan can use a Normal attack like Megapunch by just hitting any part at random, whereas a Karate Chop is a direct attack against an enemy body's weakpoint, like a joint or neck, since you wouldn't Karate Chop someone's face or chest. Kind of like the distinction between Scratch and Slash.

    A cheeky name suggestion.  

    If Pokemon (ポケモン) is short for (ポケット・モンスター) Pocket Monsters, then perhaps Pokeron (ポケ論) could be short for Pocket Ron (ポケット・論), or pocket argument, debate, discourse.  It doesn't really fit semantically, only phonologically*.

    If you want to be really cheeky, make it Pokemon Gōri (or Gouri)（ポケモン合理）for bastardized Japanese literally translating as Pokemon Rational.  If you have a clever design you can hide the 'ri', maybe in an exclamation point where the lower case 'r' comprises the left half of the upper portion of a rounded exclamation point, and the 'i' hugs the right side creating the appearance of an exclamation point but still clearly spelling 'ri'.

    As a separate note, if you're creating a developer's brief or prospectus, you might wish to send it to your local Nintendo chapter to frankly put open up discussions on what it will take for them not to sue you.  Put tactfully, to open up discussions as to how both you and Nintendo can benefit from moving forward on the project, possibly meaning Nintendo lends QA to the game once complete and gets a majority or large share of profits, depending on existing or past arrangements of a similar nature.  Or, if lucky, gain official license to proceed with a free fan game if that's your intent.

    *I think there's a better word but a brief search can't find it.  Please correct me if you know it.

  We've frequently discussed superheroes here, so it's shocking just how little anyone has brought up Wonder Woman. Each member of the DC Trinity is meant to represent a different idea, and her's may be the one most relevant to rationality. Batman is Justice and Superman is Hope, but Wonder Woman represents Truth. She forces people to confront uncomfortable truths about the world and themselves, which is why she's a feminist icon. At least when she's written well, that is.

  I admit I didn't really like Wonder Woman at first since I found her to be rather generic in the Justice League cartoon. However, in the comics I have seen her act as the Amazon's official Ambassador of Peace, maintain a charitable foundation instead of a secret identity, and talk both super and mundane villains down as often as fight them. Though it contains none of those things, the best introduction I've seen to Wonder Woman's character and mythos is the animated movie, which isn't very long and can be watched [here](http://kisscartoon.me/Cartoon/Wonder-Woman/Movie?id=15274) for free.

    Huh, I'm not really into superhero comics, and have found the ideas of some mainstream superheroes compelling, but never Wonder Woman (she always struck me as a token female character).  This post is the most intriguing description of her thematic/symbolic significance that I've ever seen; could you elaborate at length?  Wonder Woman is such a well-known character that I figure that any general attempt to intelligently, rationally reboot DC's lineup would have to include her, but she's never seemed compelling from what little I've seen of her.
    ```

    - u/trekie140:
      ```
      Unfortunately, I haven't seen much more that you. I learned that I was wrong about Wonder Woman from Atop The Fourth Wall's very detailed reviews of bad comics, which included examples of good moments. I found the film by accident and it convinced me she was a character with depth and the feminist themes were well executed. I've heard that Gail Simone's run on the comic series was great, but the best example I've seen so far was in JLA: Tower of Babel where her interplay with the rest of the team showed off her personality and how effective it makes her.

      In a story that otherwise felt like an excellent episode of Doctor Who, Wonder Woman ended up stopping a terrorist attack all by herself just by talking to a suicide bomber. He didn't even have a name, he was just a minion for the real villain, but it ended up being one of the best scenes in the comic for how seriously it addressed the situation and everyone emotions surrounding it. She had plenty of other awesome moments in the comic, but that one stood out to me.

      I've heard from fans that Wonder Woman actually has one of the smallest rouge's galleries in comics simply due to the fact that she ends up befriending most of her enemies. Don't get me wrong, she's still a badass who's slain hordes of monsters without breaking a sweat, but she's just as much a diplomat as a warrior. There's even a [pretty damn good fanfic](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3061070/1/Probationary-Member) I've read that features the characters going to a women's shelter she runs.
      ```

      - u/Nighzmarquls:
        ```
        This is not actually surprising to me, if I recall she was written/invented by a psychologist who explicitly was trying to create feminist icon. He had some stuff that came along for the ride that other people found problematic, but over all she was created with almost the same kind of impulse/desire as a rationalist reboot of any other piece of fiction.
        ```

        - u/trekie140:
          ```
          Comic books have really surprised me with how rational they can be. Superman's reboot in the 80s explained that no one knew he was Clark Kent because everyone just assumes the flying man on tv with no mask doesn't even have a secret identity, while also playing up how Superman is really just a mask Clark wears when he wants to be a good samaritan. Marvel arguable started the trend even earlier with Spider-Man and X-Men turning genre conventions on their heads.

          I have more experience with superheroes outside of comics, but I still think many of the stories have shades of rationality. Daredevil is about how hard it is for a street vigilante to fight organized crime, Jessica Jones is about sexual abuse and dealing with PTSD, Superman vs. The Elite is largely a drama about the moral use of power, and I can sing the praises of Young Justice all day long. Seriously, go watch it on Netflix so we can get a third season.

    Ugh, that movie annoyed the hell out of me. Steve Trevor goes to the United States with an Amazon, an ambassador of a forgotten people who have decided to connect with the outside world again, and the first thing he does is... take her to a bar and tries to get her drunk? HOW ABOUT GETTING HER TO THE FREAKING WHITE HOUSE ASAP? Like, you can make all the points you want about sexism and gender equality and how society shapes your role, if the only non-evil male character in the movie is a stupid, immoral jerk, I'm not going to feel very touched.

    Otherwise, I liked Wonder Woman in Justice League, but in retrospect I have to admit she was a bit generic. She was the calm, ruthless, no-nonsense character in a team which already had Batman, John Stewart and Hawkgirl.
    ```

    - u/trekie140:
      ```
      I didn't say the film was rational and the story does feel abridged due to its short runtime, but the fact that Steve is an ass at first plays into Diana's character arc. She is completely right to think he's sexist, but realizes she was mistaken to think he was inherently like that and couldn't change. He admits that it was wrong to treat her the way he did and promises to do better, which goes against the Amazons' ideological justification for living in seclusion. 

      However simplistic the presentation may be the theme is still about the importance of fighting prejudice without going too far in the other direction, which shows that the basic moral conflict Wonder Woman is built on is not oversimplified. For a character who is meant to idolize the empowerment of women to acknowledge that her own society has encouraged prejudice against others and resolved to do better is exactly who should be a feminist icon.

  Tiny tiny idea for Worm fanfic: Rachel's understanding of human psychology is bad. Probably to the point where it's worse than the average dog's. A house pet can tell when someone's tone is threatening or happy, and won't react to a smile from a human as though it's a threat. So what if she kept a dog with her and read the human's psychology via reading the dog's psychology? Sort of like a translator.

  - u/sir_pirriplin:
    ```
    She is not worse than the average dog. She is as good as a dog, maybe even better. It's just that dogs aren't expected to socialize with humans on the level Rachel has to.

    Dogs never have to form complex coalitions, keep track of favors, etiquette and fashion, possible betrayals, romance, irony and sarcasm. All those things that Rachel hates.

    But Rachel does have the same innate understanding dogs have of human body language. She could tell when Taylor was upset from body language alone, even though Skitter's costume has a mask that hides her facial expression.

  If my sample of two is anything to go by, dating websites suck (I tried Once and OkCupid).

  The way I understand it, dating websites basically take the same problems you have with real-life dating, only you're dealing with them by typing on a keyboard. So women receive a huge quantity of messages, the majority of them going from poor quality to "ey u wana sho me ur tits", which incentivizes them to never make the first step and send an unprompted message, and means they're unlikely to commit to any given conversation. And on the other side of that wall, men need to send lots and lots of messages to maximize their chances of getting an answer, which incentivizes them to send poor-quality, quickly written messages (or even copy-pasted ones) too reach as many women as possible. So on one side you're flooded with attention, often from very unsavory, immature people. On the other side you spend your time sending messages and getting ignored. This sucks.

  So I guess I'm done with dating websites for now, unless someone here has a recommendation. I'd also be interested in other people's experience in that domain.

    Here's a list of my "outcomes" from every single in-person meeting/"date" I had:

    - Boyfriend ~8 months

    - Friendship (was mostly looking for a friend), still maintained as a casual/peripheral sort of friendship

    - Conspiracy theorist 9/11 was an inside job/etc. No second date.

    - Boyfriend 4.5 years (ongoing, very high chance marriage / etc end-game in this relationship)

    My advice: 

    - be very picky with who you message - do the screening BEFORE you waste time, energy, resources meeting up. Women get a lot of "hey what's up" , so rather than sending 10 really low quality messages, send 1 good message to your top candidate. If I get a message from someone with a match % in the 80s I basically don't bother to reply. 

    - If you aren't excited by any of the women you see on the site, don't waste your time. Come back every month or so and see who the new flock of single people are.

    - Ensure your profile (especially your photo) is high quality. /r/okcupid is good for this, or I'm happy to have a look. Note that you are trying to sell yourself so don't highlight or even mention your flaws. They don't need to know that you have debilitating OCD that is controlled by medication until they've known you a few weeks.

    - Some people are shallow about height so if you're below 5'8" increase your height by an inch or so. (Actually, increasing your height by an inch or so above your real height is probably a good idea regardless.)

    - If you're interested in someone and messaging them, don't pressure them to meet right away, but you want to have an in person meeting in the two weeks to one month range or else it might never happen.

    - Gently hint to your friends / family / colleagues (as appropriate) that you are looking for a partner, and see if they will introduce you to anyone.

    Other comments: 

    - The size of your metro area is really important here. I had a really tough time when I lived in a city of ~300k but there's several good candidates in a city of ~1.8m. If you live in a small town you might want to look at nearer larger cities, or resort to traditional methods (friends of friends)

    - Different dating sites have different specialities. OKC is more associated with the young / alternative / poly / short term relationship type scene, though there's obviously normies there. Eharmony and similar are more associated with the "I need to find someone to marry" type scene. There are others that are more associated with the casual sex / hookup type scene too.

    Theoretically, [Bumble](https://bumble.com/) addresses this problem. I've never used it and therefore can't really recommend it, but it was designed to be a solution to this problem. The woman has to message first. It could go too far in the opposite direction, but because it's so contrary to the norm, it doesn't seem to. In other words, men don't seem to get flooded with unsavory attention and women don't send tons of messages and get ignored. Again, no idea how well it works, but I thought I'd mention it since it does seem to be at least *trying* to solve the problem you described.

    OKC does have a section where they publish their statistics and glows. You'll notice that for a guy, information about personality and having a good profile are considered important.

    I know that women don't initiate conversation, but they do read profiles recommended to them, and search for people with certain filters. Being prepared for that with a fun, engaging profile with interests listed is a great idea.

    If you are a guy with an engaging profile, a DP that makes you look good(not too good though, apparently nudes don't work for men) and are someone who can send fun messages, you'll find a quality partner (short-term or long-term).

    Don't give up!

  How to munchkin the housing market:

  1) Get a [compressed earth brick maker](https://youtu.be/0EEF9RxQG70?t=99). 

  2) Get a [robot arm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcrO8ONcfY) for laying them down.

  3) With your free building materials and free labor, [build free homes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl7lZZP21c8) for people indefinitely. Free humanity from the drudgery of having to pay rent.

  Does anyone else think this is a workable idea, or is it too pie in the sky? I simply can't see myself working for 4 more decades, so I'm looking for alternatives.

    This doesn't solve the problems of land, infrastructure, fittings, and furnishings. I'm not convinced that the remainder is a large proportion of the cost of a house, even if I love compressed-earth construction.

    Well, the obvious bottleneck is real estate.

    Beyond that, houses are more than room-shaped piles of bricks. You need support beams for the walls and the roof, especially if your house is going to have multiple floors (which is better if you want to make cheap housing). You need plumbery and electricity at the very least, as well as windows, telephone or internet access, gas, some sort of heating contraption (I don't know how well compressed earth insulates), and maybe an elevator.

    All those things need human labor for now, and are absolutely required if you're going to live in a metropolitan area. On the other hand, technology is evolving, and I think (don't quote me on this) that mass-produced building parts are getting a lot more frequent.

    That's not the solution I'd go with, personally.

    I want to copy "space inflatables". Mylar fabric (ir reflective) double-walled tents. Mylar is generally very cheap. They're portable, and I think everything could fit in a steam trunk.

    Where everything includes some way of generating electricity, pumps to keep the tent inflated, water-filtration, water-purification, water-pumps, etc.

    I think portability is important for people that don't already have houses. You need to be able to pack up your life, and move off-grid, or move to your cousins property for a few years, or move to a different municipality, etc.

    You still need land plots to build houses.  Utilities to be too code. Water, electricity and Internet to make it so anyone who wants to live there willing. And sources of food/work in the vacinity.

      Affordable housing is more about being forbidden to build rather than construction actually being expensive.

        [This article](http://www.sightline.org/2016/09/06/how-seattle-killed-micro-housing/) on the microhousing situation in Seattle was linked somewhere on Reddit fairly recently.  

        It basically backs up your point with a specific example.

    This reminds me of the buildings I saw as a result of relief work in Guatemala.  They were basically a cement pad, cinderblock walls (with window holes and door frames, but no windows or doors), and a tin roof.  

    IIRC, they costed <$1000 each, and were about 16' x 20'.
