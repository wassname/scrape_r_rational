## [Q] What do you (dis)like about Worm?

### Post:

Something I've noticed recently: I don't remember ever seeing a criticism of Worm. They are probably out there, but every time I see it mentioned it is solely in positive terms. 

What do you think the good and bad parts are of Worm? What was it that made it stick so hard in the memesphere of our community and adjoining communities?

### Comments:

  ```
  The good: 

  * The setting is interesting and reinvigorates the idea of a world populated by super-powered costumed hereoes and villains. The idea is a bit inherently silly but suspension of disbelief holds up.

  * The characters are varied and well-realised and their powers are diverse to the point of there being no exact duplication - not an endless parade of "Dudes who can shoot energy beams and punch stuff". 

  * Also on powers, a lot of them require some genuine creativity in their application, and not everyone is a tank capable of trading heavy hits, so there's some subtlety to the fighting rather than levelling a city block in every encounter because the only way to make a point of hitting someone *hard* is to throw them though a building.

  * The plot is moved along mostly by people doing stuff for their own reasons rather than people doing stuff because the plot needs to move along. 

  * The action moments in the big fights are suitably intense, but there's also some good down-time and character fluff and humour in between them. 

  * Our protagonists seem intelligent and relatable but not overly perfect, and the antagonists aren't just evil for the sake of evil - they have their own stuff going on which we occasionally get to see through interludes. Mostly. Not always. Some of them are just psychopathic assholes.

  * Speaking of interludes, interludes are pretty awesome as a change of perspective - either to see the villain's side of things or explore some backstory, or occasionally to be shown a decidedly *different* kind of mind. 

  * Similarly, there are some chapters that feel like Wildbow was daring himself just to see if he could take something that's difficult to render into prose and make it *work*, and it generally *does* and that's pretty cool.

  The bad:

  * At times the 'intensity' of all the fights hits the point of oversaturation, and can become hard to follow when you're reading at the pace the text feels like it demands... this is somewhat a criticism wrapped in praise, since it's generally a sign of something good when the inherent pace of the text is able to make me read faster.

  * Examples of the above would include the first 8 arcs where it seems like they're fighting every other group in the city one after the other without much pause, and also some of the arcs leading up to the end... I need to re-read those some day because I really didn't manage to follow the details of where they actually *were*, to be able to picture the setting beyond "underground tunnel" or "generic research facility".

  * The time-skip is abrupt and jarring and weird and leaves us in an odd place where we're *told* that Taylor has been with her new team for longer than the entire rest of the story before that point, so now she's theoretically closer to them than the Undersiders, but we never got the opportunity to make that journey with her and really feel as close to them as we do to the "good ol' days", or to develop the same understanding of who they are as characters. I mostly just kept wanting her to go back to the old team ASAP.

  * I have real trouble keeping the giant character-roster and their respective stories/powers straight in my head. Although that doesn't actually impact too badly on reading the story - if it's plot-relevant then there's generally an easy reminder and then I go "Oh, it's *that* guy".

  * Power/scope creep is real. I found it *fun* (if I'm honest I'm torn as to whether this is a bug or a selling point), but looking back on it, it's kinda ridiculous just how far things escalated, from running into some genuine difficulty with taking on a handful of young capes in the process of robbing a bank, to defeating a whole *swarm* of cloned S9 members without really seeming to break a sweat, and then having to basically fight God.

  I'm sure there's more to say on both sides (I'll probably think of more and edit it in) but this is what came to mind first.
  ```

  - u/Iconochasm:
    ```
    As a devout Worm-lover, two criticisms of the "bad".  It's pretty explicitly said that Taylor *isn't* close to the Chicago Wards.  Except for Golem, it was all a working professional relationship, and even with him they weren't so much "close" as "on the same page".

    And as regards the S9000, the 9 of them were battle-hardened, veteran cape psychopaths, with years to decades of experience. The 9000 were phlogiston and b-roll memories cobbled together with secondhand tinkertech.  Considering the forces of "basically everyone" arrayed against them, it didn't really break my suspension of disbelief at all - on the contrary, I found those segments as suspenseful as anything else.  At least the parts actually shown, I think most of the slaughtering happened off-screen.

    But I do have to second the time skip criticism.  I think the story really needed another 1-3 arcs fleshing out that transition, expecially with some more breathing room.

      Seeing it put so explicitly, I finally made the connection: they're [machine-made](http://www.mariowiki.com/Machine_Made) S9!
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I agree with the bad completely. Thankfully all those issues can be fixed when Wildbow either finds an editor or does it himself.

    Also you missed that Weaver's team is shit. Their powers and personality are just meh. Everything related to the timeskip is so awful.

    That.

    It's like reading early Doc Smith (except without the racism). If you've never read the Skylark series, every couple of chapters there's a new super-science power-up.

    [spoiler](#s " The final book ends up with Seaton and his nemesis duQuesne teaming up to destroy a galaxy full of chlorine breathers by lobbing another galaxy full of stars into it through hyperspace.")
    ```

    - u/JackStargazer:
      ```
      There is actually a term for that based on a different Doc Smith series.

      [Lensman Arms Race.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LensmanArmsRace)

      >The Trope Namer comes from E. E. “Doc” Smith's Lensman novels. Over the course of a decades-long struggle (that was only the surface of a deeper, eons-old war between cosmic beings using mortals as pawns), Civilization and Boskone went from ordinary starship battles to star-powered lasers, antimatter bombs, *planets* used as missiles, *antimatter planets* used as missiles, *faster-than-light* missiles, ***faster-than-light antimatter planet*** missiles...
      ```

      - u/ArgentStonecutter:
        ```
        I know people like to use Lensman as an example, but Skylark did it first and harder, with Seaton or duQuesne getting a new power-up every few weeks.

        [spoiler](#s " Weaponized galaxies beat mere antimatter planets")

    - u/Shurane:

      Heh it sounds kind of fun almost. Would you recommend the Skylark series?
      ```

      - u/ArgentStonecutter:
        ```
        It's mind candy, and very pre-sixties in its outlook, but a fun quick read. And there's a couple of bits that are kind of insightful in a SFnal sense. There's one scene where Seaton is totally schooled by one of the Valeronians about the importance of taking advantage of software driven automation ... written before there really was such a thing.

    Definitely agree about the time-skip, which is why I'm so happy about wildbow having said that he'll write that part while editing the story for publication.
    ```

    - u/FuguofAnotherWorld:
      ```
      Yeah, I was looking forwards to seeing her work with the wards so much and then it just kinda... didn't. Even worse was that the skip happened halfway through an Endbringer fight which we never see the end of.
      ```

- u/Kishoto:
  ```
  A criticism of Worm that I’ve heard before, and can somewhat agree with, is that it constantly escalates with little to no breaks in the tension. Aside from a few (and I mean very few) miniscule happy moments in the earlier sections, it all just kind of goes to hell. And keeps descending. After the Leviathan attack (not that things were that happy before) things just keep getting progressively worse and there’s little to no relief, barring the end. And even THAT comes with its own baggage and hangups. It’s less of a “Happily Ever After” and more of a “Well…at least we’re not all dead?” sort of vibe. So yea. Worm isn’t a happy story. And unlike other stories that aren’t happy ones (mysteries, horrors, etc.), Worm is especially massive in length. It’s a long time for things to just be depressing all the time. I believe that’s the main criticism people have for Worm.

  Overall, Worm is wonderfully gripping. It’s deep, thought out, was updated at a RIDICULOUS pace (Seriously, I wonder if Wildbow wasn’t some sort of AI, he’d write 30k words in like 2 days!) packed with action and superpowers, in a unique way. It’s just…you never feel like the main characters are winning. At least for more than a chapter or two, because an even bigger threat rears its head almost immediately.
  ```

  - u/ProfessorPhi:
    ```
    Agreed with the lack of downtime. That being said, I loved the pace, there was never a dull chapter. 

    One thing I really loved reading from other characters perspective. It made the world seem more realistic and interconnected as opposed to a single playable character. The other viewpoint chapters would usually be the highlights of section.
    ```

- u/alexanderwales:
  ```
  I am going to assume that this thread is spoiler scoped for Worm.

  One of the big things that made it stick was length. Worm is 1.68 million words, which means that to get to the end requires a very, very large time investment. People are a lot more apt to talk about things that they've spent a month reading than they are to talk about something they read over the course of five minutes. Worm wouldn't be nearly so popular if it could be read over the course of an afternoon.

  Worm also does characterization well. The interludes are all fantastic, and for every character you get the sense that they were fully fleshed out and thought about - from the skinheads to the PRT.

  The powersets of the characters are also really well done. They have enough flaws to be interesting, and enough variety that each one that gets introduced is their own little treat.

  Things that I *personally* didn't like:

  * Every character is holding the Conflict Ball. This is explicit to the setting.
  * The time skip isn't any good. It bypasses too many important things while at the same time not changing the status quo *enough*.
  * The setting limits itself in certain ways that I find displeasing - the Manton effect and the nearly complete lack of mundane utility, and the fact that the world has been designed to resembled comicbook worlds instead of growing into that organically. It's a lot of clever ways of getting to a Superhero Kitchen Sink world, but taken all together it feels false to me. Tinkers are one of the biggest offenders here.
  * It's too dark and grim, without enough spots of light or breaks in the action. The edit will probably fix that.
  ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    > Tinkers are one of the biggest offenders here.

    Them and Endbringers. Remove endbringers and suddenly heroes are allowed to be a lot more ruthless with villains, worldwide productivity gains are not overshadowed by wiped-out cities, and tinkers with idealistic goals are allowed to make a lot more progress towards utopia without being murdered. And when you learn the Endbringers' rather unsatisfying origin story, you can't help but see them as a contrived plot device to keep the setting from straying.
    ```

    ?? What did I miss?

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      Wildbow is doing an edit of Worm, presumably in preparation for releasing it as a massive ebook (or a bunch of small ebooks). I think the pacing problems and the lack of hope are two of the things he's knows are problems with the text.
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        If he's smart he'll release it as a series of novellas. On kindle store standard price for 5-15k words is 2.99. Standard price for a novel it only a couple buck more.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          He could release it as a series of full-length novels. It's almost as long as the Wheel of Time.

          - u/eaglejarl:
            ```
            > He could release it as a series of full-length novels

            Short version:

            It's not in his best interest.  This is going to be a giant wall o'text, but the tl;dr is:  given how Amazon has structured their payments, he will make way more money if he sells it as novellas where each novella ends on a cliffhanger and has a line at the bottom saying "Story continues in the next book, 'Worm part 4007a'!"

            Long version:

            Here's what I've learned about publishing ebooks on Amazon from having done it:

            Standard price on Amazon for a novella (~15k normally) is $3 USD (well, $2.99).  Standard price for a novel (~80k words) is about $7 ($6.99), plus or minus $1.

            There's something called "Kindle Select"; it's an opt-in thing that puts your book into the Kindle Unlimited / Kindle Online Lending Library program.  If an author has opted-in to have his book in KS, then a reader with a KU subscription can either buy the book for the indicated price or borrow it for free.  (There are some restrictions on KU, but they don't matter for our purposes.)  For simplicity I'm just going to call this "opting in to KU", since the distinction between KS and KU is moot.

            The amount of money you make for a borrow is a little complicated.  Every month Amazon sets aside a pot of money; this month it's currently $3mm, and last month I believe it was the same but they added $6mm at the last minute to make $9mm.  At the end of the month they take the total amount of money (M) in the pot and divide it by the total number of borrows (B) to find a number P that is how much you'll get paid for a borrow.  (M / B = P) Last month P was $1.34.  So, if you got 100 borrows total over the course of the month, you'll get paid $134.  Notice that P is completely unpredictable for the author and is also completely under Amazon's control.

            The last trick here is that **you only get paid for a borrow if the user reads the first 10%**.  That's extremely important.

            The amount of money you make from a sale also isn't simple.  There are two royalty levels you can sign up for: 35% and 70%.  35% is the default; you can only get 70% if you opt-in to KU and therefore allow your books to be borrowed for a price P which, again, is completely unpredictable and completely in Amazon's control.  (There's also some restrictions on the 70% but they aren't relevant here.)

            If you are in the 70% club you don't pay the delivery charge.  If you are in the 35% club, you pay a delivery charge of $0.15/M when someone buys your book.  A normal cover image would be 2-3M unless you take some effort to shrink it down, in which case you can get text+image down to about 0.5 - 1M.  

            [EDIT: I don't know what I was thinking, but I wrote the above backwards.  Th 70% club pays the delivery costs, the 35% club does not.  I've corrected everything from here on.]

            Here are the scenarios:

            Not in KU, therefore you get no borrows and you only get 35% royalties:

            * 80k novel, $7, 35% royalties, no delivery charge.  On a sale you make: 7 * 0.35  = $2.45
            * 15k novella, $3, 35% royalties, no delivery charge.  On a sale you make: 3 * 0.35  = $1.05

            In KU, so you get 70% royalties, you get borrows, and you pay the delivery charge:

            * 80k novel, $7, 70% royalties, 1M file means $0.15 delivery charge.  On a sale you make: 7 * 0.70 - 0.15 = $4.75
            * 15k novella, $3, 70% royalties, 1M file means $0.15 delivery charge.  On a sale you make: 3 * 0.70 - $0.15 = $1.95
            * Borrow:  ??, but let's say it remains at $1.34  (that's been relatively consistent for a few months)

            Not everyone has a KU account, so obviously you make the same number of sales from non-KU people regardless of whether you're in it or not.  People who are in KU are probably there because they read a lot and don't want to spend a ton of money, so they are more likely to borrow than to buy. Clearly, you lose sales on this group but you get borrows from them instead.  This is important:  you are much less likely to sell to a KU user.  They are much more likely to borrow if they can or pass if they can't.  (They are also voracious readers, so they are more likely to borrow you for that reason than a non-KU person is to buy you.)

            Okay, having a NOVEL in KU means:

            * Sales to people who are not KU get you $2.30 more than you would have gotten if you weren't in KU.
            * For people who *are* in KU, you make money that you wouldn't have made otherwise off the borrows.

            Having a NOVELLA in KU means

            * Sales to people who are not KU get you $0.90 more than you would have gotten if you weren't in KU.
            * For people who *are* in KU, you make money that you wouldn't have made otherwise off the borrows.

            It is strictly better for an average author to be in KU.  The only people for whom it maybe doesn't make sense are the very top-ranked authors with so much star appeal that even KU users will buy their stuff.

            Finally, if you put up a novel (again, 80k words), then you **only get paid for borrows** if the user reads 8,000 words -- about 24 pages by Amazon's estimation.  If you put up a novella (15k words) up, then you get paid if they read 1,500 words (about 4 pages).  If the user gets tired of the book or distracted from it and doesn't hit the 10% part, you don't get paid, so you want that 10% to be as small as possible.


            With all that setup taken care of:

            If you have a novel (80k words) you can sell it for $7 or you can break it into 5 installments of ~15k each and sell each installment for $3.  Either way you want to be in KU.  Worm is *already* written in installments and (I think) has a cliffhanger at the end of each installment, so doing the novella route is easy.

            Most people that I've seen around who have started Worm have either finished it or at least read to the ~30-50% mark. Let's be conservative and say that someone who gets tired of it will stop after 10%, meaning 167,000 words.  That's 2 novels or 11 novellas.  Two novels nets you $9.50 in sales, 11 novellas nets you $21.45.  You will also make more money on the borrows if your format is novellas, because the users are much more likely to hit the 10% mark in their reading.

            So, yes, if you break a novel into novellas, you make a ton more money given how Amazon has structured their payments.
            ```

            - u/Zephyr1011:
              ```
              Surely breaking it up into novellas will reduce the number of people to buy Worm? Breaking it up into novellas means that Worm as a whole costs a lot more than if it were broken up into novels. If people are buying it, then wouldn't it be more off putting if it was in the form of novellas where they have to spend far more, rather than as novels?
              ```

              - u/eaglejarl:
                ```
                Even if we assume that's true, you will still make more money on the borrows than you would have on the sales.
                ```

  Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

  In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

  Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

  “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

  The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

  Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

  Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

  L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

      I found the darkness in Worm just dark enough to be edgy without crossing the line for apathy inducement, but Pact on the other hand...
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Yep. I've said it before, I'll say it again: I didn't even realize how "grimdark" Worm was while reading it until afterward when someone mentioned it and I thought back on the story. Taylor is such a strong, active, and oddly *optimistic* character, even when she doesn't seem to be, that I never have time to wallow in the darkness of it all.  No matter how bad things get, she just powers through in a heartening and sometimes heartbreaking way, such that the few times she has moments of self doubt, I'm just like "Don't sweat it girl, you got this."

        No matter how bad things got, I knew Taylor would never, ever give up. That was the light at the end of the tunnel that kept things from seeming as bad as they were, for me.
        ```

      - u/Kodix:
        ```
        Mostly with you on that. The darkness in Worm was tiring for me, but I could live with it. I stopped reading Pact halfway through because the main character was *always* the tortured underdog, it seemed like.

        On a side note, I'm enjoying Twig far more.
        ```

        - u/Vwyx:
          ```
          Yeah, Twig is doing better for me, because Sy always seems to have a plan, or is at least able to tweak his enemy's nose. We get the feeling that even if the odds are against him, he knows more than he lets on.

          Blake, on the other hand, almost never had any idea what was going on. This is a plot gripe, not a character one; it was entirely reasonable to be in the dark when he was thrown into a new world without any guidance. I *liked* Blake, maybe even more than Taylor and Sy -- Taylor seemed too inconsistently ambitious and passive for me, and Sy is a little too nonchalant about everything except Mary, which hurts my idea of what's at stake. It's just that even Blake's temporary victories are usually framed as defeats. I think that the only time in the entire story that Blake had an unambiguous win of his own that didn't foreshadow doom and didn't involve an extreme sacrifice of his future happiness was the fairy with Sephiroth's sword at the beginning, and even then, the lawyer's presence was kind of tainting that.
          ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        It crossed the line for me after [Worm spoilers](#s " the new endbringers showed up"), and it only partially recovered for the final fight.

        And yeah, Pact was just a constant decline into that territory.
        ```

  - u/ArgentStonecutter:
    ```
    It also suffers a bit from Swiss Family Robinson/Skylark syndrome. Taylor keeps finding and developing plot widgets and super-competently taking advantage of them a little too frequently, forcing her opponents and companions to power up at a comparable rate to keep the story balanced.

    Some of that may have been planned from the start, but it produced a bit of a feeling that the author was barely in control.
    ```

    - u/elevul:
      ```
      > but it produced a bit of a feeling that the author was barely in control.

      Why is that a bad thing? If the story reaches the point at which it's so alive that it escapes the control of it's author, shouldn't it identify just how good it has become?
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        It doesn't take a good author or a good story to have a loss of control. A story escaping the control of the author is sort of like a car escaping the control of the driver. Sure, it might result in some momentary excitement and a rush of adrenaline, but there's a big risk of a crash and burn. Worm never really crashes, but it does teeter wildly out of control in a few places.
        ```

  ```
  (I'm at 47%, but don't mind spoilers. Taylor drove the Slaughterhouse 9 away and is struggling with Coil.)

  The universe and world building is amazing. Creative and rational in the sense that Wildbow tries very hard to keep things consistent. The characters seem realistic, although I cannot empathize with Taylor's constant guilt-depression. Probably subjective.

  I would prefer more celebration and moments of awesome without a depressing overtone. E.g. there should be a heartwarming party after Leviathan is gone. Humans need such consolation even after depressing catastrophes. The Undersiders should celebrate after successfully robbing the bank.

  Too long, but that might just be due to the "web serial" format. It should be split into 10-20 books with clear endings and only minor cliffhangers. Compare Harry Potter.

  I found a lot of worm really good, it scratched a lot of itches I had at the time.

  As a criticism I think it kind of drifted from 'OH GOD NO!' moments of horror which I'd call good to "NO YOU ARE AN IDIOT WHY?!" which is on the edge of 'bad'.

  It however has the BEST example of a villain defeating a 'hero' with a witty quip I've ever seen.

      The one from scion. An excellent example of how terrifyingly potent information of your opponent in a fight can be.

  I think this is largely a selection effect, where people who don't like Worm don't finish and therefore just don't talk about it first. This was my experience--I simply found Worm to be Just. Too. Wordy. I have tolerance for very long works of art, but Worm just exhausted me in a way that, say, Homestuck or [Prince of the Dark Kingdom](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom) didn't. I've tried to start Pact and Twig and given up for the same reason.
  ```

  - u/philip1201:
    ```
    Curiously, Homestuck was too wordy for how little I got out of it (I lost interest during the (t)rolecall, while I just spent 30-80% of my awake time binging Worm for one or two weeks.

    Worm has progression, Pact seemed to just get worse all the time, and Homestuck moved *kata* towards more complexity without resolution.

  I've heard a lot of people say that Worm is too dark to really enjoy. I might have felt that way at first, but after some time I became fairly secure that Taylor and her allies could take whatever came at them. This was obviously shaken a few times, but a story should do that.

  In terms of what I don't like:

  To me, Wildbow's writing style seems too suited for the serial format. Some stuff feels very rushed, he sometimes slogs on in a scene for too long, and his descriptions of locations, complex concepts, or action can be a little too limited for me to get a clear picture. Taylor's goals seem a little all over the place, and it really seems like the Undersiders are destined to fight literally every group they hear about. 

  On the other hand:

  What I like about Worm is what makes it different from other stories. Worm kills off major characters at a rate that keeps things interesting without becoming predictable (I'm looking at you, George R. R. Martin, and your once-a-book slaughter). It keeps the stakes high and holds a reader's attention. Obviously, the worldbuilding is top-notch, and the power use on the street level is amazing. Those are its real selling points, and it does them just about the best I've ever seen. On top of that, Wildbow made me care about his characters, and his picture of a frightened young girl trying to cope with a shitty life and a conscience at the same time was really captivating.

  In Pact, Wildbow improved on his descriptions, though the esoteric nature of what he was describing was so out there that it sometimes made it just as hard as Worm. On the other hand, it was like watching your college roommate get into an MMA fight with a 250-pound 'roided-up Krav Maga enthusiast, then get wheeled out, broken and bleeding, only to have his girlfriend spit on him and break up. 

  It was just the tiniest bit difficult to read, is what I'm saying.

    The "too dark" was definitely part of my problem, now that you mention it. It kinda wallowed in the dark - the web design didn't help - and I never got any thrill of hope or excitement. It was just too stressful and depressing, and I eventually dropped it.
    ```

- u/robobreasts:
  ```
  The timeskip, I didn't like the S9000 much because the Slaughterhouse 9 was so horrific, and I really didn't want to revisit that.  But probably my least favorite of all was taking such a long break from Taylor's POV to get the entire backstory of the Travelers.  I did not care that much about them and certainly not so much to be happy reading about them while Taylor's stuff was unresolved.

  There needed to be a bit more downtime than have every chapter be a cliffhanger, I know it was serial fiction but if it ever gets edited I'd want some more downtime to process events.  If Taylor actually got to a plateau or mini-resolution, and was stable and happy, maybe THEN take a walk down memory lane and spend so much time on the Travelers.

  My main complaints are that the timeskip chapter was rushed and confusing and that the final arc kind of negated everything before it and bordered on DarknessInducedAudienceApathy.

  ```
  The fact that the source of powers alters people's decision-making means that, in general, these people aren't really... ''legally culpable'' for their actions, they are not ultimately responsible for how they behave.  

  Was \[Blank\] brave, or was their ''passenger'' making them act that way?  

  People are a lot less interesting as characters when they are not (fully) responsible for their choices.
  ```

- u/None:

  Worm has an eventually compelling main character, some good arcs (16-23), a lot of cool, neat powers, a ridiculous update schedule, frikkin endbringers, and, like, lots of bugs. It's smart and tense and you always want to know what the next guy's power is and how they're gonna get out of this one. As far as serial fiction goes, it basically does everything it should, constantly ramping things up, introducing new characters and plot elements and powers, always ending on a hook, never giving the characters any time to rest. It's probably better read as serial fiction chapter-by-chapter than in big chunks.

  I think it suffers from a lack of clear motivation in its main characters. Before we find out about the shards, it's unclear why the Undersiders are motivated to fight other parahumans rather than use their powers to make money or just live a normal life. That seems like something an edit would have a hard time addressing unless it wants to reveal more about shards early on. Also: character voices and personality types are too similar and limited, probably something the edit will struggle with as well if that's just how Wildbow writes his characters.

    That's curious. Do you often find protagonists unsympathetic? How about people or 'losers' in general?

    I've only had that happen once with Walter White. I explained that as a (morally) reprehensible choice too close to choices I face for comfort. (As opposed to The Godfather or House of Cards, which seem fictional).

    So, why do you think you dislike her?

    The fight scene and everything else gets to be long because the reader is supposed to be invested in Taylor at that point. Similarly you're willing to buy some weird worldbuilding. It seems like she could be your single point of failure.
