## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I'm looking for more examples of different ways fiction handles post-scarcity societies, or ideally societies on their way to complete post-scarcity.

  To provide a few examples:

  - *The Expanse*: Half of Earth's population subsists on basic assistance, where they get bare minimum quality food and accomodations. People fiercely compete for entry into vocational programs that lead to employment, work in grey market jobs, or just give up and watch Netflix.

  - *Star Trek*: It seems fairly inconsistent between shows and episodes, but replicators make most basic goods effectively free. There is private property ownership and some degree of scarcity though, eg. Picard's family owns a vineyard in France, and in DS9 various rare metals are used as a medium of exchange. 

  - [*To the Stars*](https://archiveofourown.org/works/777002/chapters/1461984): A really interesting fusion of a sort of UBI-like system in Earth, with a command economy run by AI coordinating an interstellar war effort, while remote colonies tend to run on more of a standard capitalist model.

  - *The Culture* (Iain M Banks): Fully post-scarcity thanks to AIs running everything, which will accommodate everything except completely ludicrous requests.

  I personally find the intermediate states more interesting, as the problem is basically solved once a society reaches something on the level of The Culture.

        Note that glowfic is often unfinished, is dialogue driven and thus sometimes/often a bit or a lot lacking in action. 

        This is pretty much the foundational story for much of this: https://archiveofourown.org/works/9809486

        After that you have a number of different stories with these people going on. I believe this is a pretty good intro to the series! https://glowfic.com/posts/2310 basically finished, story, cute characters + worldbuilding gets established from a fresh start, but its not the traditional form of scarcity they are trying to solve.

    [Hollow World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19084955-hollow-world) by Michael Sullivan features a post-scarcity society far in the future. It's been a while since I read it, but it came down to three revolutionary inventions. The first was an energy generator. The second was a fabricator that could use the energy generator to make more fabricators and more generators. The third 'invention' was a series of extensive genetic modifications. The main character is a man dying from cancer who travels forward in time from the present, and his viewpoint is contrasted with the society he finds himself in.

    [Winning Peace](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/winning-peace-me-pre-contact-si.22643/) is an Inspired Inventor Mass Effect fanfiction where one of the SI's goals is to transition humanity to post-scarcity, with mixed success. One of the obstacles he's struggled to overcome is humanity's tendency towards social stratification. Also, >!nuclear holocaust!<. Currently on the brink of first contact in a galaxy with enough AU elements to promise significant deviations from canon.

      For all that it's basically a power fantasy (no shade, power fantasy can be fun), Winning the Peace has some very interesting ideas.

      The debates about the sensibility of >!private starship ownership (something we all take for granted in sci-fi, but then you realise that the average joe having access to a relativistic missile that could end all life on earth if he got drunk behind the wheel is a little...)!< come to mind and made it clear that the author has actually put quite a lot of thought into his setting.

    - u/suddenly_lurkers:
      ```
      Yeah, it's pretty dark: https://expanse.fandom.com/wiki/Basic_Assistance

      It seems rather unrealistic though, because the people on Basic are completely excluded from the formal economy and have to transact via barter. Any rational government would want to switch them over to cash to measure and tax that economic activity, as well as use the huge amount of untapped labor to fill in potholes or build infrastructure.
      ```

      - u/Bowbreaker:
        ```
        Tax what economic activity? The barter is for stuff that the government is already handing them, so they'd just be taxing the welfare, which is even more inefficient. I guess it would be a good job creation program by hiring a ton of bureaucrats to play rigmarole, but if the government actually cared about that then Earth wouldn't look the way it does in the first place.

        No, the serious economic activity is driven by exploiting the belt and by megacorps in industry and software. The bread dole and cheap entertainment is enough to prevent revolts and keep the populace from interfering with the capitalists money games and the politicians popularity games and everyone's war games. If you actually start pressuring Earth's poor (who outnumber everyone else in the solar system by orders of magnitude) into productivity you risk them aligning themselves with the economically necessary and simultaneously controllable (due to dependence on air and water) Belters.

      I've never seen (read?) the Expanse, but I actually expect this will be the future within our lifetimes.

      1. Companies adopt AI to mass-automate jobs: intellectual/creative jobs in 10-20 years, physical jobs (much?) later (depends on progress in robotics and a lot of other small things).

      2. Advanced countries have 30-50% of their workforce employed in purely intellectual/creative jobs. Some might involve *a bit* of movement, but that's much easier to solve than independent robot plumbers or even sysadmins. 

      3. After a couple of years of almost half the country being out of work, companies using the AI workforce notice that their profits are sharply plummeting as tons of people are going broke. If Company A is smart, they would want to implement some UBI—so other companies have to pool in and give people money which people would bring to Company A again (since profits *were* high before, they know it's possible).

      4. UBI is implemented. There are still no jobs. Almost half of people survive on, idk, free money equivalent of a minimum wage. They *want* to work, but the market is exceptionally competitive.

      Cue the OP's description.
      ```

      - u/plutonicHumanoid:
        ```
        I don’t see why the companies would willingly pool money for UBI, since there’s no guarantee of any of that many returning to any one of them. I could see some hypothetically lobbying for UBI in some scenarios, but ultimately I would think UBI would have to be run by a government.
        ```

        - u/NTaya:
          ```
          Yeah, I didn't mean literally pooling money. I meant specifically lobbying for UBI or for higher taxes on *other* companies, so the jobless population can give the Company A money once again.

        It kind of only works if one has the misconception that the number of jobs available are set by God. So you can have beliefs that any immigrants no matter how skilled will steal from this limited pool.

        If people don't have enough stuff, they will spend their time making more stuff. You can imagine scenarios where they aren't able to make stuff as efficiently as they could because of inequality, but it makes no sense that they want to work but cannot. Or maybe North Korean levels of government coercion.

          ```
          > It kind of only works if one has the misconception that the number of jobs available are set by God. 

          No? The number of jobs is proportional to the number of people needed to perform a certain task.

          > If people don't have enough stuff, they will spend their time making more stuff. 

          This honestly sounds ridiculous. Do you see many homeless people who can't get job due to their homelessness "making" food, or "making" clothes? Do you see destitute people "making" devices with Internet access, which would possibly help them with the search for better opportunities? Do you see fresh college graduates "making" anything while they apply to literally dozens of positions, only to get turned down for the lack of experience?

          We have examples of people willing to work but unable to work *right now*. (Wasn't unemployment in Spain, like, 20% not so long ago?) This happens without any widespread automation or jobs-being-taken-by-immigrants. To think it's not going to get worse is idealist if I'm putting it mildly.

          - u/iemfi:
            ```
            > jobs is proportional to the number of people needed to perform a certain task

            And the task is generally to produce enough stuff for everybody. And what's "enough" keeps going up as productivity goes up. 

            I hope this doesn't veer into political territory. Not saying that it's unrealistic to have terrible exploitation and inequality and people being left out. Obviously that's already happening, and probably will get worse. The unrealistic part is the combination of everyone being poor but without the exploitation.

            Spain if I'm not wrong actually has lots of migrant workers. They just have labour regulations which cause this official unemployment rate.

              There's nothing that stops certain humans from being fully excluded from the economy, just like pets are. If a human is neither skilled enough to be of more value than some alternative, nor rich enough for others to cater to them then a job opportunity with a livable wage won't spontaneously materialize for them. And as automation advances, "skilled enough" will shrink. Then it's either welfare, starvation or revolution. And you can starve/exterminate some people who are out of sight and out of mind, but at some point we will reach critical mass.

              The bread dole worked for Rome, when much productive labor was otherwise done by slaves. Why would it not work on a larger scale when our slaves are AI?
              ```

              - u/iemfi:
                ```
                The difference is that pets are not able to provide for themselves? People might not be skilled enough to work in some future service job but we know for a fact that people are more than skilled enough today to live well above poverty. 

                Like my example of North Korea. Even with private enterprise punishable by imprisonment or worse there is still a thriving secondary market. So like you could imagine some world where severe government coercion causes borderline starving humans who aren't allowed to work, but that is what it would take to cause this.

It's more that access to certain medications for chronic diseases is an inconsistent crapshoot.

                        Take the access to medicine thing. There are something like 4 doctors per thousand people today. How do you make the doctors so efficient that you have too many of them yet at the same time also not have proper medical care for half your population? You can't both have too much demand and too much supply at the same time.

            Combination of many homeless people being *very* low skilled, and regulations about stuff like licensing and industry standards. Without government intervention preventing it or requiring burdensome paperwork, I'd expect you would see a lot more people in poverty opening part time businesses cutting hair or sewing clothing or selling garden vegetables or what have you. Those regulations exist for a reason, but they also kill a lot of potential productivity as a side effect.

        >UBI is implemented. There are still no jobs. Almost half of people survive on, idk, free money equivalent of a minimum wage. They want to work, but the market is exceptionally competitive.


        This doesn't really make sense. If there's tons of almost literally free labor available, because UBI is already sustaining them, it would be used. Both by people offering it almost for free and by businesses seeking to use the free resource. The pay could need to be 1 cent per hour to beat more robots, or there's 4 robot watchers/oilers at 1/4th the pay instead of 1 now, but that would happen. The government would also lower/remove barriers for this, because industry and people both would want people to be able to sell their labor cheaply.


        If you think of a stereotypical economics cost/consumption graph, livable UBI makes the floor of cost basically 0 and as the cost approaches zero... Especially for such a useful resource like human labor. It only makes sense if greater than human AI takes over, and they'd probably still give us stuff to do.
        ```

        - u/NTaya:
          ```
          If the pay needs to be something like $0.1 per hour to beat the AI, it still wouldn't really solve the issue. That might happen *instead* of UBI or *together* with it, doesn't really matter—a significant portion of population would become much poorer than it is right now because it can't find a "real" job, and competition for "real" jobs would by real fierce. In OP's example, it kinda falls under the "gray market" part of things—something that wouldn't give an actual vocation, but something that allows you to *just* survive and get by.
          ```

        - u/Dragongeek:
          ```
          But free labor isn't possible, which is exactly the issue. Even if you paid the workers absolutely nothing, it would still cost the company money to keep them working if the value that they generate by their work does not cover these negative factors. For example, even before you have salaries you have factors like:

          - If you have human employees, you need administration, HR, and management. Sure, maybe you can have an AI do the role of HR/Admin/Management, but this HR-AI still isn't free and costs money to operate in terms of hardware and consumables (electricity, network bandwidth, etc). 

          - If you have humans, they need a human-compatible work area. Even if you decide to throw OSHA out the door and do away with all PPE, proper railings, emergency exits, etc you still need to make sure that your manufacturing space is fundamentally safe for humans to work in like providing ventillation, or generally survivable working conditions. This is a cost. A purely automated robot operation can do with far less safety, and again, hiring humans would incur costs. 

          - Training and equipment. Sure, it might not be difficult to be a robot-oiler, but the robot oiler still needs an oiling can and the knowlage of where to point it. Furthermore, they need to be smart and trusted enough not to fuck it up. If they made a mistake and instead of dropping a couple drops of oil into the machine, simply dropped the entire oil can into the machinery, this might require an expensive repair and thus risk cost for the company. 

          Today, depending on country, it costs a company about twice that to employ someone than they actually take home in salary. This is because of factors like these but also beneifts, PTO, etc but the point is that even a worker who takes home $0 still costs to be employed. 

          EVEN IF you can somehow make "senseless" jobs work where people are essentially working a stupid job and getting $1 an hour while the company or someone is taking a loss, there are many that wouldn't do this because working a job is also associated with costs on the worker side. For example, someone working all day has a higher caloric requirement, and needs to buy more food and they have a higher chance of becomming injured. 

          The upper class of "real" jobs would be those where employing the right human actually earns the company money.
          ```

          - u/RetardedWabbit:
            ```
            Great point on additional costs, I was just thinking about the UBI allowing an almost zero floor for labor cost paid to labor = zero labor cost, which is incorrect.


            >Even if you paid the workers absolutely nothing, it would still cost the company money to keep them working if the value that they generate by their work does not cover these negative factors.


            I didn't consider this, but I still think it's still absurd to think the value of labor can't overcome these costs. It gets funky at the edges of the graph, but today's rule of thumb 2x salary cost as true cost of labor applied to $1/hr would only be $2 an hour total cost. Also that extra 100% would likely be less in this world, as it includes healthcare(covered by UBI?) and taxes that political pressure could remove/reduce or are already baked in to support the UBI.


            The sci-fi work environment is interesting, but I think the UBI and public/political will also covers a lot of "how do you stop people from getting hurt and train them" by saying you don't. I'm imagining just sending people into the Amazon auto-forklift racks frogger style, "just hop in the rack if one is headed towards you",since the government pays for injuries (?) and unemployment is already paid (UBI) so only catastrophic sci-fi level injuries would be concerning. Also throw people into suits for most environments or have them on monitors.

    You might take a look at:

    - Becky Chambers's writing. The Wayfarers books aren't \*exactly\* post-scarcity, but they are well into the territory where the basic necessities of life are provided to everyone for free; the Monk & Robot books are further along that path and from a much lower tech standpoint.

    - Graydon Saunders's "Commonweal" books. Again, the post-scarcity is for basic goods and services; they certainly do have \*some\* scarce things in the Commonweal (one of which is, like, not getting your brains eaten by weeds, oops; the world is horrific especially outside of the Peace Established! they call it the Bad Old Days for a reason). The first book of the series is a military fantasy novel, the second book is sorcery school, the third is a unicorn/sorcerer romance, then it's back to military stuff. Truly a civil engineering manual lost in a fairytale, or possibly the other way around.

    - Elizabeth Bear's "Ancestral Night" is quite similar in this regard to the Wayfarers books.

    Walkaway by Cory Doctrow is a fascinating book on the intermediate state. Post scarcity technology basically exists but the majority of society is still highly capitalist. So you get groups of people “walking away” from society to form no ownership communities. 

    Of course the richest people in the capitalist society are threatened by this and act accordingly. I thought it was a really fascinating look on what that transition could look like

    If you can read German, I found Andreas Eschbach's latest novel, [Freiheitsgeld](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freiheitsgeld), quite fascinating. The story is set in the mid 2060ies. After increased industrialization, the government in Europe had to implement UBI to prevent riots from mass unemployment.  
    The story is quite critical of the idea, examining several particular problems that our current society would definitely run into if we tried to implement it today. While I personally don't agree with the author's conclusions, I found it very well reasoned and intellectually stimulating to engage with.

    I super strongly recommend *Blindsight*, btw. It's way better than most published books I've read. 

    Also, I've made some bets on such markets before, and it very much makes me want to open a similar market for my own to-read list. Maybe I'll even link it in the next thread!

      I don't particularly enjoy the prose and I disagree with some of its speculative evo psych, which lessen my enjoyment, but I do like the parts with actual alien interaction.

      Same. I talked a bit to the market creators and I think when you're making it, you have to be careful to provide useful information to predictors for them to actually know your preferences, so they aren't just giving generic recommendations, to be careful about how you decide which books to read(if you just read the top predicted books, you'll never get to the low rated books, so you'll never resolve the low rated books, so people aren't incentivized to vote no, as one example), and to be careful about what sort of recommendation you're asking for, e.g if you're asking for 10/10s, 8/10s, books that you'd want to recommend to other people yourself, or whatever.

        Evo psych was also kinda 50/50 for me, but I liked the prose. To each their own. 

        > Same.

        I have a very specific plan for this. You can be my sanity check, if you don't mind. 

        I currently have 130+ works in "To Read" on RoyalRoad. I also have *a lot* of free time on my hands until I'm out of the hospital (won't happen any time soon). I tried to start working through my list but took too many detours; I want the market to motivate me to read stuff I *actually* wanted to read, not what my ADHD-esque mind finds shiny at this particular second. 

        I planned to comb through the list and remove all stubbed entries. Then, create a market with the remaining ones, with a long description outlining my tastes. 

        I plan to include: 

        1. What I like to read in general and what is an insta-NO for me. 

        2. A list of my favorite fiction with explanations why I liked it (if possible). 

        3. A list of specifically RoyalRoad stories that I liked.

        4. A list of popular/well-known RoyalRoad stories I disliked, also with some reasoning. 

        Regularly (current plan is once in 2-3 days), I would pick the stories in the following order: Highest % – Most Activity – Random – Again Highest %, so the cycle starts anew. 

        I drop most stories I dislike almost immediately. I also tend to drop stories I liked. So, to make things fair, my resolution criteria are as follows:

        YES: I've read at least ~15k words (that's ~35 A4 pages or ~65 book pages). Even if I drop the story somewhere down the line, I would consider any recommendation to be good if it managed to hold me for so long. 

        NO: I dropped the story earlier. 

        N/A: The story was stubbed or deleted while I was getting to it (I'll do my best to clean out stubs before starting the market). 

        Thoughts?

          The first problem I see, which is an issue of Manifold's lack of ubiquity, is that I doubt most users will have any familiarity with most Royal Road stories outside a handful of the most popular like Worth the Candle and Mother of Learning. When I was looking through the already existing markets, it seemed like most people were fans of mostly traditional sci-fi hits and the very biggest internet hits.

          If you're in any royal road reading discords and can convince people to sign up to bet on your markets, then I expect it'd work better.

            Hmm. I'm not aware of RR Discords, honestly first time I'm hearing of those (but I'm on r/rational Discord at least). So yeah, I'll try to engage people familiar with RR. Post a link here, for example.

              I'm not familiar with any RR discords either but it's the sort of thing I'm sure exists.

              Asking /r/rational discord members to predict would probably be just as good

              /r/ProgressionFantasy/ apparently [has a Discord](https://discord.gg/H24geDdpzV) and so does /r/litrpg -- [link](https://discord.gg/Z67QGuErJt).

    I'm one of the people person backing Graydon Saunders' novels, and The March North is probably not the best place to start for rationalists

    - u/DM_ME_YOUR_HUSBANDO:

      I'm reading the next one too. It definitely feels like more of a first book than The March North despite being second in the series

  Reread [joe6991’s](https://m.fanfiction.net/u/557425/joe6991) two works, An Unfound Door and Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time. I don’t really “get” the post-Atlantis bits of Wastelands (and didn’t feel the need to read the sequel, Heartlands of Time), not sure if it’s writing style fatigue or just me not fully committing to trying to understand it, haha. 

  I think everything up through when Harry and Dumbledore go down into that library is really gripping, style and all. I have less thoughts on An Unfound Door, just that I really liked Hogwarts in this fic. Writer’s style and the school combine really well IMO!

    Fwiw I really enjoyed most of Wastelands of Time but also hit writing style fatigue near the end - actually just at the start of the Atlantis expedition - and then saved the fic for later and haven't come back to it. N=2 and whatnot.

    Dropped Wastelands of Time after five or six chapters. I basically disliked it across the board.

     * The writing style is pretentious without the ability to back it up.
     * At least from early chapters, the premise seems to be AU to the point that I'm not sure if this still has any significant relation to HP. (The key elements appear to be Atlantis, some Time-related antagonists, and some future cataclysm.)
     * The combination of only having vague memories of previous loops, together with down-to-the-second timing is incongruous.
     * There's this "Harry walks into Gringotts and says some magic words to bend the goblins over the barrel" trope, ugh.
