  I don't have any particular attachment to the original Ghostbusters film. I enjoyed it despite it predating my existence by several years. I vaguely recall finding it funny, but my memory is hazy since it's been over a decade since I saw it. I'm not really evaluating the remake in terms of the original because of that haziness.

  The trailer for the remake made me laugh once, at around [1:26](https://youtu.be/w3ugHP-yZXw?t=86) with the "Let's go." joke. The trailer was clearly intended to be funny but all the other jokes fell flat or actually irritated me (notably, the part where the joke is "look at that violent irrational black woman").

  I didn't care about any of the other complaints some people raised, like the CGI or the "four scientists" line or the cast. Remakes and translations from other media get that sort of thing wrong all the time, and is usually inconsequential compared to the script, acting, editing, etc.

  The trailer has done it no favours from my perspective, as it doesn't inspire any confidence in the latter categories. That's not to say that I think it will be a bad movie. I'm reserving judgement until reviews come out and I'll probably see it if they aren't too negative.

  Personally, I think the problem is the cuts used in the trailer. If a joke got a lot of laughs during the test screening, the people producing the trailer probably tried to include it but may have contextualised it poorly.

  Looking at Paul Feig's other movies, they seem to do relatively well and have terrible trailers (I haven't seen Bridesmaids or The Heat, so I can't say how much I like them). I also looked at a few trailers from comedies I really liked and didn't laugh much at any of them. The few times I did laugh, I was remembering the scenes from actually seeing the movies.

  Based on that anecdotal and brief test, I'd say that comedies are poorly represented by their trailers. In fact, you can see a recut of the Ghostbusters remake trailer that removed most of the jokes, which was substantially more popular with fans of the original.

  **TL;DR:** I propose that trailers for comedies are usually much less funny than the movies themselves. The Ghostbusters remake could merely be another victim of this effect.

  I don't think this was a very good analysis. Honestly, the green curtains don't always have to represent the main character's jealousy. Sometimes they're just green. In this case, people are rejecting the trailer - and by extension the film - because it was a bad trailer. The jokes fell flat, the plot was basically a rehash and didn't seem interesting, the actors didn't look to have the comedic timing necessary to make things funny, and the comedy itself was largely slapstick which I find boring. 

  Further, they didn't show us what kind of people the characters are, instead they just had a woman tell us what each of them is good at and from what I can tell they all seemed to be hackneyed stereotypes. She was basically talking to the camera, and from the looks of it that scene is going to be in the full movie which gives me serious doubts about the writing quality. 

  From my perspective, this video stated an obvious conclusion that no-one would argue with (that the trailer was bad and people were angry about it), then stuck in a bunch of random psychobabble in front of it. You could replace that explanation with almost any random thing and it would still be pretty much the same video, it didn't add anything or make things more clear. I don't feel like I understand the human condition any better as a result, which is a good sign that this was just fake wisdom.

  People don't like it when they're got high hopes for a thing and it turns out to be bad. The greater the distance in quality between the new thing and the old thing, the more extreme their reaction. If this guy wants to make it more complicated than that, he should come up with a better theory.

  You are posting a *lot* of links to the storyBrain channel.

  I think you're crossing the self-promotion line.

    Huh, really going with the scattergun approach, isn't he. Same video, slightly different thread titles, 8 different subreddits.

  On a meta level, I sort of hate this video completely independent of the actual point it was trying to make. It reminded me of a lot of the RedLetterMedia criticisms of the filming style of the prequel trilogy of Star Wars. Namely, the creator is shoving so much shit on the screen that it actually becomes distracting and makes me lose track of what's going on. A busy, complicated frame can work, but simple scenes that show one thing well are much better than complicated bullshit showing five things badly. This was just excessively poorly composed. I don't know if the creator is trying to be ironic or something and making a bad video on purpose? 

  The actual points it was trying to make seemed facile to me, but I have no emotional investment in the original ghostbusters and this was the first I heard about the trailer for a new one (or, in fact, that there would be a new one).

  For me, the reason I'm not excited about this remake is because it's a palette swap.  The writing process seemed to be:

  1. Open script of original Ghostbusters
  2. Search and replace all names and genders
  3. To prove that it's not plagiarism, insert some hackneyed (attempts at) jokes about crazy black women and how women love hats.

  If you're going to write fanfiction, the first rule is not anything about Frodo and lightsabers.  The first rule is "it must be different in some significant way from the canon."  If you retread the exact same steps with different names you have contributed nothing to the reader's experience.

  That was pretty good, pretty clear look at some of things going on when people see remakes. He told a story that fits really well and is insightful. 

  Would have been more rational/convincing to me if he had talked about why he thinks these are true, or that competing ideas aren't. Hard to do though, especially in a short video.

  Ah! Fascinating, thank you! I didn't have any problems with the trailer, and now I think that was in large part because I hated the first GhostBusters. The hero obviously should have been Egon. Instead the movie focused on this asshole Venkman who I couldn't stand, who is shown in his very first scene to be a terrible human and basically an anti-scientist. (in general I hate all of Bill Murray's characters, with very few exceptions) So I guess I was kinda glad that the remake was doing away with all that crap. Which is exactly what everyone who liked the first GhostBusters will hate. Insight acheived!

  Recognizable brand grabs people's attention, bad quality makes this attention negative. It has disadvantage of being comedy. Action movies can defend themselves with decent action scenes in trailers. But when jokes doesn't work in comedy, there's nothing left.

  It's also really hard to joke about unfunny joke. Way above level of typical internet humor. Normally few jokes and memes would defuse tension. Simple jokes like "Terminator: Genisys - Revenge of Dyslexic". But without them things that are mostly upvoted are complains.

  Complains generate more complains. Bashing bad movie is social activity. People are connected in how much they don't like it, they try to outdo each other how much they hate it. That way we end up with huge backslash.
