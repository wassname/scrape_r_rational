  Huh. Out of all the HP fanfictions on here, this was the one I least expected to start detailing the underpinnings of HP magic. It always seemed to revel in being gratuitously nonsensical. I guess that's what happens when a story matures.

    I particularly like Lucius musing on Ritual Magic, and the ups and downs of it. The fact a 17th Century bunch of people could use a artificial language in their spells before it was even invented is quite curious.

  It's great to have more story, but this chapter felt awfully short. Most of it was exposition and unnamed characters reading off secrets that aren't relevant to the story...Milo didn't even get a mention until most of the way through. 

  Ah well. There will be more soon, and I'm looking forward to it.

  Milo is a level what of a Rainbow huh now?

    It appears to be a [prestige class](http://dndtools.eu/classes/rainbow-servant/). I cannot recall it ever being mentioned before now, but I see people mentioning it in reviews and stuff way before this chapter. Perhaps he demonstrated Rainbow Servant abilities a while ago but it wasn't explicitly stated?

      It hasn't been mentioned in the text before, but Sir Poley keeps an up to date character sheet online (the current version of which can be [found here](http://www.myth-weavers.com/sheetview.php?sheetid=1026861)).
      ```

      ```
      It's a prestige class with a huge payoff. When he hits level 10 of the class (15 overall), he will add every single cleric spell to his spell list.
      ```

      ```
      So...so Milo can grow wings and fly now? Dude...*Buckbeak.*
      ```
