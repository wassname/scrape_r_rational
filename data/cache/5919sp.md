  Holy *shit*. They figured out how to use mutually assured destruction against a foe that cannot be destroyed.

    They figured out how to use mutually assured destruction against a foe that cannot be destroyed *and has a utility function inverted from their own*.

  >ICKM â€“ the inter-continental kabbalistic missile

  Now that was just too good, and I didn't see it coming.

    I'd have left it ICBM since the B stands for "ballistic", which refers the the manner of delivery, not the kind of explosive.

      That would work too, but this way we get the fun wordplay of adding "KA" at the start (letters 11 and 1) and removing "L" from the middle (letter 12), resulting in no net change.

        It's kabbalistic, not kabalistic, though. Two Bs, not one.

  So, I've always wondered whether the Comet King was actually *the* messiah, since there were other valid candidates. Knowing that there are actually two, I'd like to state for the record that I think Sarah is either the Messiah ben David or God.

    Have we met anyone named David? Over at r/unsong,  /u/Fluffy_ribbit says:

    "David means beloved. David is also a child who takes on Giants. David is also a king. The child that David has dishonorably dies in the womb, but he repents and afterward, his son unites Isreal and Judea." 

    So, Someone who is beloved, someone who takes on powerful forces, and a king. Hmm...

    Someone who takes on Giants as in the corporate giants ie. our main characters?

    Ana, who is beloved by Aaron, or Aaron, who is beloved by Sarah?

    Aaron relates to Aaron and Moses, who was the high priest, and thus ruler, and thus King?

    I predict Aaron is the Messiah ben David.

      One problem with that is that Aaron has been unfailingly lame since the book started. His everyman position would be ruined if he had a secret ancestry.
      ```

      - u/NotACauldronAgent:
        ```
        So his child? Sarah will unite the kingdoms? I admit, this really is a reach

  Of course mad is holding Thaumiel back! How on earth did I forget the Cold War?

- u/scruiser:
  ```
  I wonder if Thamiel realizes that Reagan is just a puppet of an angel? It seems like he doesn't given that he views Reagan as a puppet of the Comet King instead.
