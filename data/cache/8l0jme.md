  I suggest [Dungeon Keeper Ami](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/). It puts a character that fights for good and truth and all that and puts them in one of the most evil and hated roles in that setting, a Dungeon Keeper. Ami has to keep making compromises - like hiring minions and fighting off the good guys and the bad guys who keep attacking her - just to stay alive. While she's still trying (and mostly succeeding) to stay good.

  And in true Dungeon Keeper fashion, a lot of it is building up dungeons (which keep getting destroyed), managing minions and so on.

  There is also a hilarious amount of power creep, but it's well earned. This story is long. The current arc has Ami, by herself, accidentally taking over an entire city. She just wanted to negotiate for them to maybe stop attacking for once, but they kept fighting her, actually trapped her and things escalated.

  [A Hero's War](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War) fits the bill, more or less.

  I dont know how rational people consider this and it could be less rational than i remember, but i enjoyed reading common sense of a dukes daughter and it 100% fits the genre. If i remember right its about a modern accountant/economist who is super talented that gets sent to a medieval world and takes over the body of a noble girl. It is all about her trying to manage a medieval dukedom with the advantage of knowing modern technologies and economic principles.

    Piggybacking on this, If you don't mind reading less rational and Isekai works, I recommend:


    [Release That Witch](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReleaseThatWitch)

    About a Chinese engineer who gets sent back to fantasy Europe and recreating modern techniques to revolutionize their world. There's also witches, thus the name. Read it [here](http://volarenovels.com/release-that-witch/rw-chapter-1/) as the qidian translations are trash.


    Also if u haven't read or heard of A Heroes War then I also highly recommend it, however that's quite unlikely as it is quite popular on this subreddit.

      Or you could go for some of the more defining works of the sub-genre, like [The Cross-Time Engineer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/765081.The_Cross_Time_Engineer). No, dammit, the defining works! How about [A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/162898.A_Connecticut_Yankee_in_King_Arthur_s_Court)?

      >Read it here as the qidian translations are trash.

      Too bad that translation is dead, and the other translator that picked it up after that one also dropped it. Qidian is the only option if you want to read anything past 378 :/

  ```
  [Release That Witch](https://www.webnovel.com/book/7931338406001705/Release-That-Witch) is very enjoyable, if you can see past the subpar translation quality.

  It's a rpgmaker game, not a serial, but [The last sovereign](http://the-last-sovereign.blogspot.com) actually fits what you're looking for pretty well. Lots of empire building, economy and logistics especially later on in the game. Plus you get to make  decisions that have pretty well-thought out consequences later on. NSFW if that's a concern.

  [Cruel to be Kind](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/cruel-to-be-kind-si-multicross-rehost.3509/) might suit you. It's been a while since I read it, but from what I remember I would call it fairly rational (though not rational*ist*). 

  Plot-wise, it's a multicross/SI fic about a guy who ends up bonding with a bit of sufficiently-advanced xeno-tech that allows him to travel almost anywhere in the multiverse he can imagine, but never back to the dimension he was born in. So of course he does the obvious thing and uses it to create his own interdimensional empire.  It definitely fits your criteria though, with a heavy focus on creating a society from scratch, securing technology, resources and manpower from different dimensions and all the trials and tribulations of running a growing sovereign nation.  

  It hasn't updated in about two years because of various personal problems in the author's life, but he is still around so he may still get back to it someday and there's quite a lot to read, just with what's there already.

  [Look to the West](https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/157898) ([epub](https://www.dropbox.com/s/slmtifbu8uf3xjt/Look%20to%20the%20West.zip?dl=0)) is an alternate-history book framed as a series of excerpts from *actual* history books.

  The old Star Wars Extended Universe had some books on that theme post Star Wars VI. It was less "building the New Republic" and more "constantly keeping the Republic to collapse into bloody anarchy" though.

  Perhaps Civilization-based fan fiction?  For example ...

  A recent one I have discovered is [Genjitsushugi Yuusha no Oukoku Saikenki](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/genjitsushugi-yuusha-no-oukoku-saikenki/) (Alternate title "How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom"). Isekai genre, but focused on economics and logistics.

  Have read the 10 chapters of the manga so far, and I am going to tackle the translated light novel.
