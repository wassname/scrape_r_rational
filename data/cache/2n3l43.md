  Please note that chapter 72 was changed to have completely new content.  I would suggest rereading that first, although the order doesn't really matter.
  ```

  ```
  I really, really hope they're doing an alignment check prior to putting people through FLEA and POPE - it would just suck if they accidentally created a whole horde of evil folk with the standard set of magic items.

  They've made a whole host of things that make it very very difficult for people to die, and it would thus be at least moderately difficult to stop/kill an evil person who got upgraded.

  Then again, a Helm of Opposite Alignment Engine stationed near the Detect Evil Engine would work - you can always choose to fail a save.
  ```

- u/ulyssessword:
  ```
  Ring of Heal Every round cost:  6 (Spell level) * 11 (caster level) * 2000 gp (for use activated magic item) = 132,000 gp.

  Belt of +6 to all stats: 6^2 (ability bonus squared) * 1000 gp (cost for ability bonus) * ( 1 + 0.75 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5) (six different abilities to boost) = 135,000 gp.

  They're already nearing the 200k gp limit for non-epic magic items.  If they want more power they'll have to make more restrictions, such as making them only work for Good characters (30% cheaper) or something else.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    I haven't really been worrying about item costs to date.  I suppose I should.

  I am just going to assume that they have some big signs up about not putting a Portable Hole in a Bag of Holding or vice versa ...

  That said, I'm a huge fan of vignettes, and enjoyed both those chapters quite a bit. I'd be quite pleased if Book II was more like an extended epilogue.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Bag of Holding / Portable Hole:  Yep.  Actually, I think they're just recalling all Bags of Holding, destroying them, and replacing them with as many Handy Haversacks as the owner wants for them.  You can put a PH in a HH, and you can nest HH's in each other -- they are strictly better than a BoH.

    I'm glad you like the vignettes / extended epilogue structure.  I'm pretty sure that's how it's going to play out.

      It kinda reminds me of the Worm Interludes. Definitely a welcome thing.

  ```
  Wuhu, welcome to the era of post-XP-scarcity! Let the mass resurrections begin! Muahahaha *benign laughter*
  ```

  - u/Chronophilia:
    ```
    Why benign laughter? Evil laughter is much more fun.

    >"You're too late!" cackled Lucifer Von Fiend. "Nothing can stop my Engine of Eternity now!"

    > "Drat!" cried Max Powers, struggling against his bindings. "Without my gadgets, I'm helpless to stop you from... hmm. By the way, what does your Engine do?"  

    > "You don't know?" The lava's glow reflected off Von Fiend's furrowed brow as he pondered. "Hm, I could have sworn I'd mentioned it earlier. It makes everyone in the world immortal, eternally young, and immune to all injury and illness."  

    > "... wait, so why was I trying to stop you?"  

    > "How should I know? I assumed you had your reasons, it seemed rude to ask."
    ```

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      *hilarious laughter*
      ```

      - u/Chronophilia:
        ```
        *cryptographically secure laughter*
        ```

        - u/eaglejarl:
          ```
          *cryonic kitten laughter*
          ```

- u/Gurkenglas:
  ```
  Ooh, are we gonna find out more about how Calvin will go through the FLEA and try to apply ever more desperate hijinks to escape his nightly torment? Maybe find out more about this maid's past...

      ```
      Well, Suze has proven herself to be the Queen of Rules-lawyering.
      ```

- u/aeschenkarnos:
  ```
  Hmm. Judging by her past actions, Suze was probably good or neutral. Capturing and torturing someone is an objectively evil act, by RAW. (So is creating and commanding undead.) She's risking her alignment here, but maybe that's *what usually happens* to gods of death.

  Calvin does deserve a comeuppance. To be tortured by a god seems a bit *excessive*, and unworthy of her. Which, in the end, is why we don't torture people - they might or might not deserve it, but the consequences *to us* are not worth it.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Suze is Neutral Good and yes, torturing someone is not typical for her.  Then again, she's 19 and she was just handed virtually limitless power.  More specifically, she was handed the power of *Death*...gods are shaped by their portfolio (i.e., by the beliefs of their worshippers), and most people's view of Death is not a positive one.

    She's got a tough row to hoe if she wants to hold on to her alignment.
    ```

    - u/aeschenkarnos:
      ```
      Are you familiar with the [other Neutral Good goddess of Death](http://wallpapers87.com/wallpapers-n/death-Sandman-philosophy-Neil-Gaiman-_256222-55.jpg)?
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        Ooh, good point.  Hadn't thought of her.  Thanks for the pointer.
        ```

        - u/VorpalAuroch:
          ```
          Also might be useful to look at Pathfinder lore; their goddess of death, [Pharasma](http://pathfinder.wikia.com/wiki/Pharasma), is true neutral and hates the undead.
          ```

    - u/puesyomero:
      ```
      it does seem like gods are above that pesky alingment absolutism of mortals. like shalios giving the other nightly torture to the paladin (and he looks like lawfull good) then again is it really torture to visit the good afterlifes? XD
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        > is it really torture to visit the good afterlifes?

        Nope.  I don't think Calvin's going to be seeing many of those, though. ;>
        ```
