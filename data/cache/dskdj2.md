## [RST][C] "The Story of Emily and Control" by Scott Alexander: "There's an old joke about a statistician who had twins. She baptized one, and kept the other as a control. Laugh all you like. It'll never be funny to me. I know the true story."

  >>!What if the next morning, I had found Control dead?

  >>!And if I saw her the next morning, bright and lively as ever? Oh God, how much worse that would be! It would mean scientific proof that no matter how wearisome and unpleasant life become, what awaited us beyond the grave was far, far worse. It would mean living in fear of an eternity whose content was unknown, but whose dreadfulness was incontrovertible.!<

  That's one heck of a false dichotomy here.

    and all based on the premise that ouiji boards are a reliable way to communicate with the dead. That she may have gotten *no* message not even considered as a possibility.

    Enjoyed the yarn at first, but that ending, oy, disappointing to me.
    ```

    - u/Nimelennar:
      ```
      I'm not even talking about that.

      I mean, even if you accept the premise that Ouija boards work, it's a false dichotomy.

      Let's change out the "destinations" here.

      >What if the next morning, I had seen Control at the airport? Then I would know with all the certainty of science that it was better to travel than to live in New York; that life in NYC was empirically and incontrovertibly pointless, that those who traveled were the lucky ones compared to us condemned to remain in NYC.
      >
      >And if I saw her the next morning, bright and lively as ever? Oh God, how much worse that would be! It would mean scientific proof that no matter how wearisome and unpleasant life in NYC becomes, what we would find by traveling was far, far worse. It would mean living in fear of a world whose content was unknown, but whose dreadfulness was incontrovertible.

      It's reducing the entirety of existence to the dichotomy of "If Emily thinks [A] is better than [B], then [B] is pointless; if she thinks [B] is better than [A], [A] must be superlatively awful."  It ignores the range of outcomes between "[A] is better than the best possible experience of [B]" and "[A] is worse than the worst possible experience of [B]."

      And then it leaves it there, with either option being a source of existential dread, but *not knowing* is fine, which might be the bigger crime against rationality.

      If there's a question where the decision you make based on the answer will be the same *regardless of what the answer is*, then you *don't need the answer to make your decision*.

      So, if either answer leads to existential dread, he should be experiencing that *regardless* of the choice Control makes, and even *in ignorance of* the choice she makes.
      ```

      - u/GopherAtl:
        ```
        I did get that, but to me it seems just as egregious that the two answers he considers and wants to avoid are both based on the assumption that there is, indeed, an afterlife, and that Control is absolutely able to actually communicate with her dead sister *in* that afterlife using an ouiji board.
        ```

        - u/Nimelennar:
          ```
          Eh.  That falls more into "suspension of disbelief" territory for me.
          ```

        - u/Bowbreaker:
          ```
          Even if ine accepts all that, it could simply be that the afterlife is better/worse for someone in Control's current situation.
          ```

    - u/Inimposter:
      ```
      The ending is that she's not just very eccentric but batshit insane and started unraveling out of functional state.
      ```

      - u/GopherAtl:
        ```
        and if *that* had been why he decided to nope the fuck out, it would've been anticlimactic but not actually intellectually offensive.
        ```

        - u/SleepThinker:
          ```
          When he noped the fuck out it was actually what I thought was going on. I too would want to stay far away from someone who would make coinflip for suicide as an experiment, next thing she might consider to kill me in my sleep as an experiment.

          As for ending there, I can't even think of better description than 'intellectually offensive'

      The thing is, the protagonist met Control in the bar six months after her sister killed herself. So from the story we are to surmise that they _have_ been communicating for a few months (or else she would stop trying?). Unless Control is so struck with grief that she keeps trying, even if it is to no avail.
      ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      And another possible reason for her to stay alive would be, "The afterlife is great, but it's even better if you don't rush." Let's suppose you like the workforce better than school; you're likely still better off finishing school first, rather than dropping out to find a full-time job early.

  Ooh I like it. Definitely a rationalist-creepypasta kind of vibe. A subgenre I didn't even realize I wanted.

    Then I can recommend "Blindsight" and "Echopraxia" by Peter Watts. Highly intellectual, deeply terrifying science fiction. The guy has a PhD in biology and actually has extensive references at the end of each book.

    [Blindsight](https://www.rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm) has been released under creative commons since.
    ```

    - u/Arruz:
      ```
      Always glad to see people mention these books.
      I'm not saying Blindsight gave me an existential crisis but had I been unfamiliar with the subject it might had.

  - u/Rice_22:

    I would think rational horror stories should involve a lot of adult fears (e.g. children acting out bedtime stories with real life fatal consequences) and unnerving or disturbing implications. Like a "road to hell paved with good intentions" kind of thing, or the ending of the monkey's paw where only the vague shape of the horror can be discerned. Fear of the unknown, a feeling of claustrophobic paranoia, that sort of thing.

    As others here mentioned ITT, it was a big leap in logic and a suspension of reader belief to think Ouija boards work in that story, without any prior set-up. Otherwise, it just feels like the guy is trying to escape being associated with an ex's possible suicide attempt.
    ```

    - u/amizelkova:
      ```
      I totally get what you're saying, that's why I described it more along the lines of creepypasta-- it's not a rationalist horror story from a writing perspective, it has plenty of problems, etc. But creepypasta as a genre is very bare bones in worldbuilding and is more about an atmosphere or evoking specific fears emotionally. The dread itself that the story is aiming to evoke struck me as rationalist in its themes. Does that make sense? So, not rationalist fiction, but creepypasta evoking rationalist-adjacent themes.

    That reminds me, [this](https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/Genetic_Memory) is the only creepypasta I ever found scary. It doesn't have ghosts or murderers, just deduction.

      Hah I hadn't seen that one before, it's cool. The only two that really get me are the one about [the pale woman](https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/White_with_Red) and the one about [the angry paintings](https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/The_Portraits). Both have that "OH NO" realization at the end where there's nothing supernatural\* or even dangerous, just creepy as hell! (\*The linked version of white-with-red has ghosts, but not all do, it's a pre-internet campfire story so there's a million versions.) 

      The fact that they're both about >!realizing people were staring at you !<probably says more about me than the stories themselves, lol. 

      Also [Local58 on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuoMasRkMhlj1VNVAOJdw5w) does some great creepypasta short films. [Contingency](https://youtu.be/3c66w6fVqOI) really gets me because I like stories that translate historical events in a way that makes an emotional connection. Sure, this isn't going to happen in modern America, but the general events *did* happen in plenty of places historically.

- u/None:
  ```
  I mean... *I* would date Control even knowing about the full story...........It's really not that scary to think that "death might be better than the alternative." If so, why not still live life first (since by default you will die) and if it's the reverse, then the rationalist idea of trying to "defeat death" is the right way to go about things. I don't really see the problem the protagonist has.

  Good story though.

  - u/GopherAtl:
    ```
    Believing she can communicate with the dead using a toy patented by Hasbro would be a bit of a sticking point for me.

    That's along the lines of my main anti-suicide position.

    The universe has been around for billions of years, which is a really long time. And, according to current theories, will be around way, way longer than it has already.

    If you want to be dead, that's fine, you may have good reasons to desire that.  But compared to the universe, you're only going to be around for a small blip of time. **There is plenty of time to be dead, later.** Try to make the most of this unique opportunity you have right now.

      Absolutely agreed. That's the position I also hold.

  I do enjoy creepy identical twin stories.

  For a while I was sketching out a story involving a mad psychologist with twin children, testing out the common fantasy trope of "twin telepathy" by raising them to believe they were one individual with two bodies. Like sharing the same name, having them do everything together, having the same possessions etc. I didn't know how to expand on that beyond them eventually going mad and trying to swap body parts, though.
  ```

  - u/Argenteus_CG:
    ```
    Hmmm... if I were that scientist (and had the capacity to perform unethical experiments on my own children to roughly the extent a very rich person really could, along obviously with having no morality), my thought would be to try and make that "twin telepathy" a bit more literal by implanting a chip in each one's brain somewhere (where specifically would depend on exactly what you wanted to accomplish) connected to a wireless control system such that when there's a lot of electrical activity in the brain region around the chip for one twin, the other twin's chip would generate matching electrical pulses, meaning the chips would basically coordinate to synchronize activity between the twins in that area of the brain. Ideally including some way to inhibit activity in that region too so that it can be adjusted in both directions. Maybe that gives you some ideas?
    ```

    - u/CCC_037:
      ```
      It doesn't need to be implanted in the brain; there are nerves in other parts of the body. [Kevin Warwick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warwick) had a chip implanted in his wrist, allowing remote control of and feedback from a robot arm; a similar system could be used to provide electronic communication, in theory.
      ```

      - u/Argenteus_CG:
        ```
        I mean, sure, but I feel the results would be a lot less dramatic and interesting. It'd allow (if complex enough) SOME degree of sensation of sharing bodies, maybe, but it wouldn't allow the sharing of the mind itself to any real degree.
