## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  About 3 years ago there was [a pretty nice list of isekai rational fiction that focused on the MC becoming isekai'd as a minor character in an established universe.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/btn19h/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/ep0wsae/). Just recently I re-read [The Calculator](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11221623/chapters/25072989?view_adult=true) and that has gotten me interested in this sub-genre again. Any new recs to add to the list? I particularly like those fics that keep the worldbuilding while staying away from canon plot threads (especially railroads).
  ```

    Here are some that I recently enjoyed:

    [The Scorpion and the Frog](https://archiveofourown.org/works/34804690/chapters/86665126) SI as Itachi's twin sister. This is completed and has really good pacing compared to other Naruto fics I've read.

    [Friendship and Magic](https://archiveofourown.org/works/23139346/chapters/55373800) Harry Potter SI. It's pretty fun after you get past the first chapter.

    [Someone Else](https://archiveofourown.org/works/23723560/chapters/56968486) Dragon Age SI. Fix it kind of fic for dragon age that doesn't really follow canon.

    [Spiral](https://archiveofourown.org/works/6429253/chapters/14716783) SI into an alternate universe of Naruto.

      This one is very sad. I cried at the end. 

      (I'm not sure if the main character's decision-making is anything to write home about, though.)

      - u/Anderkent:

        ```

    A few that I can think of off the top of my head:

    [Pound the Table](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/pound-the-table-an-x-men-self-insert.951637/#post-77387485) Involves a SI inserted to the Marvel universe, but focuses on law and the legal system. 


    [Gaming the System](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/gaming-the-system-worm-gamer-si.894445/page-29#post-87606882) has been updating recently, it’s an SI, and hasn’t interacted with Worm Canon. It does explore the wider Brockton Bay Area and is pretty good. 


    [A Gamer in the South Blue](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/a-gamer-in-south-blue.19722/) Has just gotten to canon, and explores an area that I don’t think is very explored in One Piece. 


    [A Ghost in the City](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ghost-in-the-city-cyberpunk-gamer-si.1046809/#post-87661261) Is another Gamer story- this one is set before Cyberpunk Edgerunners and Cyberpunk 2077. It’s pretty enjoyable.


    Edit: I want to say that none of these stories are super rational (except maybe A Gamer in the South Blue and Pound the Table) but they do fit the bill, they’re all competently written, and I’ve enjoyed all of them.

      > Gaming the System has been updating recently, it’s an SI, and hasn’t interacted with Worm Canon. It does explore the wider Brockton Bay Area and is pretty good. 

      Since this is /r/rational, I should add that the protagonist is a self-described "stupid careless idiotic moron" who is intimately familiar with the Worm canon, but forgets about its most important event.
      ```

      - u/Krakenarrior:
        ```
        Yeah I’m gonna put an edit in that says as much. None of these stories are really rational but they fit what was asked.

      ```

    - u/Revlar:
      ```
      Is Gaming the System a rewrite? Not sure, but my original criticism of the story still seems to apply. The beginning is an endless bottle episode of grinding. Does it ever get past that total lack of human interaction or extrinsic motivation?
      ```

      - u/Krakenarrior:
        ```
        I don’t think it’s a rewrite? I think the author picked it up after a long hiatus, but I’m not sure. Eventually it picks up slightly but honestly it’s too early in the story to tell if it’s gonna be more focused on grinding or on human interaction, but I don’t have my hopes very high for it continuing much further. 


        If I have to give an estimate of % of story focused on grinding and % focused on human interaction I’d say it’s 50/50, or 60/40 with more of a focus on grinding, especially in the earlier parts.

  [The Fist That Opens the Heart](https://archiveofourown.org/collections/RatFicEx2022/works/42044196)by Conradin

  I read the short stories of the Rational Fiction Fest 2022, and this is my favorite. It was good enough that I recounted the story over cocktails (on a WEEKNIGHT!) to a couple of friends: a great kung fu hero invents a technique that solves his enemies psychological problems. He fights an Eastern sorcerer and breaks his enemy's urge to feel powerful. Crunch. Now the sorcerer is a peaceful teacher of the Nine Precepts. Then the hero turns his power on the narrator of the story. It's a cool premise well-executed.

  The ENF System
  https://www.scribblehub.com/series/605269/the-enf-system/

  Yes, this is rational relationship-centred smut. Plot is strongly distinguished by the consistent deliberate and mature behavior of the actors . I'm serious, I've never seen a relationship in a fictional novel develop with so much discretion and caution. And yes, a game system based on embarrassed naked females. In fact, sex itself takes very little screen time, so everyone can enjoy this work. Still NSFW, though.

  ```
  I know this is a bit odd request but anyone knows any good stories dealing with multiple characters who individually are put in reoccurring situations in which they have to respond to other character's action even  unknowing that their predicament was a result of another character's action. It doesn't have to be a main theme but a reoccurring one. Or perhaps individuals responding differently to a situation from different points of view.

  Bonus second request: any good stories( any form of media) about life long experience, like how people grow and change over time. Perhaps even reincarnation( like a dog's purpose, cloud atlas).

    It's not quite what you're asking for, but you might enjoy Nick Harkaway's "Gnomon" - it has some of the feel of Cloud Atlas and some of the shape of your first request. Also, again not *quite* exactly what you asked for, but for the watching people changing over long spans of time thing, check out Adrian Tchaikovsky's "Children of Time".
    ```

  - u/Dragongeek:
    ```
    For your first request, maybe the movie *[Moon](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt1182345/)* would fit? It's not *exactly* multiple characters depending how you look at it, but definitely involves reoccurring situations and consequences of previous actions. 

    The "twist" is a bit predictable if you're the type of person who hangs out on /r/rational, but I still found it enjoyable.
    ```

    - u/buckykat:
      ```
      That predicable twist bothered me because it managed to be predictable and also suspension of disbelief breaking at the same time. >!The baddies have FTL comms, they can launch a moon mission on a couple days' notice, and they built a moonbase that's >90% backup by mass, but they use all this to make their entire energy infrastructure reliant on one guy!<

  - u/Radioterrill:
    ```
    Repeating a previous rec of mine that might fit:
    > I recently read Royal Flush, a Game of Thrones fic. The part I enjoyed the most was the switches between the PoV of the Starks and Lannisters. Each time you get a feel for how the viewpoint character's position is untenable, up until some clever intrigue allows them to turn the tables, and then the narrative switches perspective back to their opponent who's now the one in a bad position. As those tricks compound, they end up with an outcome that neither side had planned on.

        Thanks for posting. i really enjoyed the beginning, where it really feels like each victory is earned through the characters perceptiveness and the escalating move and countermove felt earned.

        Later on i kind of feel the story went off the rails into wish fulfillment territory, like >!Jaime entering into a frictionless polyamory throuple with maegery and Brianne, Robb Waking the Wolf where he's super strong, super badass, super alpha, super sexy, super perceptive, basically a werewolf fantasy haha, Cersei likewise can't help her lioness attraction to the werewolf and they have hot animalistic hate sex, talisa turns into a clueless wimp who clumsily is written off so the authors favorites can bang, etc!<

  Anyone got any gladiator narratives? Fantasy, scifi, historical fiction. As long as it's tracking the life of a gladiator on the sands, I'm here for it right now.
  ```

  - u/WhispersOfSeaSpiders:
    ```
    [Phobos VII](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/phobos-vii-complete.10791/) is a fantasy story about a gladiator's journey as he joins a new gladiator school in the big city, although the scope expands a bit.

    It's by Hyposoc (who seems to have an interest in Roman culture/philosophy)and technically in the same setting as their other works; IIRC it was written last year for NaNoWriMo.
    ```

  - u/GeneralSpoon:
    ```
    I wasn't going to reply with my suggestion originally, but you don't seem to be getting much engagement and it fits the gladiator theme, so what the heck.

    [Heroes Die](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/311864.Heroes_Die) is a novel by Matthew Stover about Caine, an assassin in a fantasy world who has had a long and rather successful career of assassinating people and doing adventuring stuff. Why am I suggesting a novel about an assassin when you asked for a gladiator? Because Caine is known by another name, Hari Michaelson. Hari is an actor on Earth in a dystopian future with a caste system. He is sent to the fantasy world regularly by technological means, where his experiences are recorded to provide the masses with VR entertainment.

  I’ll make my Monday recommendation *on Monday* this time. I only have 5 chapters posted online, but I have a lot more in backlog. (Let me know if you want to beta read!)

  [Cleric of Little Faith](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/59849/cleric-of-little-faith) Is a fantasy novel following the story of Jin and Sage. Jin is a mage who finds that an experiment went wrong, and now she’s been shot forwards in time to her civilization in ruins. Strangely, people have been calling her a Cleric and say her magic is a blessing from the gods. They also say that the gods were responsible for just about everything that’s happened, but she has little faith in these claims.
  ```

  - u/degenerate__weeb:
    ```
    I've only skimmed the first chapter, but I personally find present tense to be awkward/offputting to read.
    ```

    - u/Andradia_:
      ```
      Oh? That's interesting! I've personally found present tense to be preferable, since it allows me to quickly dip into past tense to clearly define when events happen. But! That's a writer's preference. As a reader, past tense is *definitely* more common; I can imagine the unfamiliarity being off-putting.

      Is it just the vibe of present tense that you don't like? I don't want to accidentally push readers away! This is some of the first negative feedback I've gotten, and I'd like to be accommodating, if possible.
      ```

      - u/degenerate__weeb:
        ```
        It's probably a familiarity bias, yeah. Most fiction I read is SF/Fantasy which for the most part is written in past tense to my recollection.

        Can you give me an example of when you need to "clearly define when events happen"? I'm not sure of situations where the grammar tense would be switching often enough for it to be a problem. In the case of some flashback, there's usually a horizonal rule or linebreak or other delimiter in the text (paragraphs in italics?) to denote time shifts.
        ```

        - u/Andradia_:
          ```
          Coincidently the chapter I’ve been editing starts with both tenses! There’s a (very) brief skip in time before this chapter starts since it would be way to repetitive to explain what Sage talks about twice in a row. 

          “
          Jin tilts her head, looking between Oak and Sage. Oak has been standing stony faced with his arms crossed, and Sage the opposite, bouncing around and gesticulating wildly with her proposal.
          “

          It then moves on to solidly being present tense. While technically I *could* use past tense for all of that, I think I prefer the instantaneous clarity that the swap offers. Plus it feels more natural to describe some scenes this way, since I describe them *as* the characters are experiencing them. If they happen to note something that *did* happen before what’s *now* happening, I want that to be instantaneously obvious. Like, “They approach with glee and song, but they aren’t aware that the town was destroyed.” “She sees the water rising and knows she has only moments of air, but the tunnel she came through collapsed.”

          idk, it’s not a major reason for present tense as opposed to past, but it makes sense to me while I write. If nothing else, it helps *me* keep track of it all. 

          I wonder why past tense is so much more common? Present seemed an obvious choice to me at the time and honestly I didn’t think much about it at first, but this is now the second comment I’ve gotten on tenses (the first time it was a side note of surprise). I’m starting to think *I* might be the weird one. Which. Isn’t a surprise, actually.
          ```

          - u/SpeakKindly:
            ```
            Because past tense is so much more common, it is the neutral option; if your story were written in past tense, this would be unremarkable. To a prolific reader, the use of present tense is immediately noticeable and hard to ignore; it disrupts immersion somewhat. 

            If you're going for a specific effect with it, it might be worth it. For me, it creates more of an effect of immediately observing the scene. This is good if you're giving lots of descriptions from a neutral point of view: you can make observations the main character doesn't notice, say that something is common knowledge, describe how an action would look to a bystander, and so forth. I think the following line does work better in the present tense than it would in past tense, for example:

            > While she does not know the giant sky rock is called an asteroid, she does know that most objects stuck in the rings of the sky aren’t nearly as brilliantly white as this one.

            It is worse if you're going to be getting into a character's head and relating their thoughts, and it looks like you'll be doing a lot of that.

            It's also easier to make mistakes with present tense, because using past tense is an instinct that's hard to ignore. Just in the first chapter, there's several places where past tense is used, even though the verb describes what's happening at the same time as the present-tense narration:

            > The woman peers down another street block, scanning the rubble and side streets for any sign of movement. Not that she **expected** danger, but better to keep the habit up.

            > The woman always thought the juxtaposition of the ruins and the sky had a strange beauty to it. She **paused** to take in the view, her eyes tracing from the horizon up.

            > A small chip of rock **shot** straight up, **slowed**, and only **made** it halfway to the floor before freezing mid-air.
            ```

            - u/Andradia_:
              ```
              Mm, I see what you mean. 

              I'm already at ~35k written so I don't believe I'll be changing the tense I use, but I will be sure to add tense usage to my edit checklist.

              I appreciate the feedback. Present tense never felt odd to me; I didn't realize it's something a lot of people have opinions on, beyond consistency of use. Guess I'll just have to make sure I flex it's strengths as much as I can!
              ```

          - u/abhorrentaberration:
            ```
            “ Jin tilted her head, looking between Oak and Sage. Oak had been standing stony faced with his arms crossed, and Sage the opposite, bouncing around and gesticulating wildly with her proposal. “

            “They approached with glee and song, but they weren’t aware that the town was destroyed.” 

            “She saw the water rising and knew she had only moments of air, but the tunnel she came through had collapsed.”

            I’m honestly not sure what the difference the tense gives to clarity to me. It’s probably because I personally read past tense as being in the exact moment of transition from present to past. Present reads like audio description of shows to me, very cold and precise. Perhaps that’s the reason I dislike it, there’s more room for ambiguity in the past tense but the present is always the present.

    ```
    [Mother of Learning](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21220/mother-of-learning) - A classic. Original Fantasy Setting. Fairly rational. (The early grammar might be a bit off. The plot is good).

    [Reroll](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37103/reroll) - Original Superhero Setting. Not strictly rational.

    [Re:Monarch](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37951/re-monarch) - Original Fantasy Setting. Haven't actually read this one. 

    [An Infinite Recursion of Time](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/43761/an-infinite-recursion-of-time) - Very NSFW. Worth the Candle-inspired setting. Not strictly rational.

    [Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid) - Naruto fanfic. Very NSFW. Late story has >!strong BDSM themes!<. Not strictly rational.

    [Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/utsuro-no-hako-to-zero-no-maria/) (available online) - Light Novel. Not Rational. Very unusual. Not like any time loop you've ever read.

    [All you need is kill](https://archive.org/details/manga_All_You_Need_Is_Kill/All%20You%20Need%20Is%20Kill%20-%20002%20%5BKissManga%5D/page/n17/mode/2up) - Light Novel (All You Need Is Kill [VIZ][Kobo].epub). Has a film adaptation titled "Edge of Tomorrow". Not Rational. Classic, well-written story.

    [Steins;Gate](https://store.steampowered.com/app/412830/STEINSGATE/) - Visual Novel. Not really what you asked for, but one of the best stories (with or without time-travel shenanigans) I've ever read. There's also an anime if you'd prefer. Not Rational.

    Definitely read the classics if you haven't already -- Neuromancer, Snow Crash, etc. Something more recent I liked was Daemon and Freedom, by Daniel Suarez. And fanficwise I enjoyed [The Unconquerable](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-unconquerable-transubstantiation-cyoa-multicross.16353/#post-4841308), which starts off in Shadowrun.

  I’m looking/wondering if there are any long-ish running web serials that are more solidly crime than anything. It needn’t be *necessarily* rational (though that would be of course a bonus), but overlaps with other genres are okay. 

  A friend of mine is a voracious crime reader, a genre I rarely enjoy, so my usual recommendations are of limited value.
  ```

  - u/thequizzicaleyebrow:
    ```
    [A Journey of Black and Red](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26675/a-journey-of-black-and-red) is to some degree this; it follows a fledgling female vampire in 1820's America, and is by far the best vampire story I've ever seen.  It's a coming of age/progression fantasy, where the protagonist advances through different stages of being a vampire, which tend to coincide with different levels of being a criminal, from starting out as a enforcer, to taking on more of a leadership role, ect.  Of course, the protagonist is a full flown vampire, so ordinary criminals pose basically no obstacle; however, the author does a good job using other supernatural elements to keep stakes somewhat high.  Definitely isn't focused on only crime, but features a lot of it, as our protagonist grows and has to deal with bigger stakes, which often times requires setting up or joining relevant criminal organizations and/or governments. 

    &#x200B;

    All in all, it's a long, competently written, somewhat dark story, about one vampire's rise to power that manages to mostly avoid the tired cliches while still using classic vampire lore.
    ```
