  EeeeeeeeeeeeeEeeeeeeeeeeeee...

  (That's about the sounds coming out of my mouth right now. I mean, I mostly like Saint, but I love the shit out of Rumena.)

  The Proceran prince said the battle would be decided at dawn but two hours before dawn seems way too early to kick off the battle if they're counting on dawn. They seem to know about the Drow weakness since the Drow "are accounted for" so it's very likely that dawn is their big play. The coalition would have to assume that Callow has planned how to manage half their army being incapacitated  at a set time. 

  Could Pilgrim be planning to bring the dawn early to negate Callow's strategy to cope with dawn? It would fit with Cat's well being about blocking the sun. A tug of war over the sun has narrative appeal.

    Well, if the lunatic conspiracy theories about Cat either having a new name or the ability to transition into one because she still had the 'bones' of Squire underneath first Winter, then Night, next chapter is the time for her to reveal it and the aspect that lets her no sell dawn.
    ```

    - u/CoronaPollentia:
      ```
      She needs no aspect. All is Night.
      ```

- u/Mountebank:
  ```
  So if the Choir is worried, then there must be a metaphysical threat to them, right? Is it just Sve Noc, or is it whatever story that Catherine is planning? And shouldn't Pilgrim be alarmed that the Choir is worried, or has he learned to think separately from them?
  ```

  - u/RynnisOne:
    ```
    The Choir can normally flip though peoples' minds like you would a book, picking out the vital bits of info and finding out what their plans are.

    Now, two evil crow-like gods are punishing them for doing so, and they find that without that ability, there's not much they can do.  Normally, the Grey Pilgrim must rely upon them for wisdom.  Now *they* must rely upon *him* for wisdom.

    So, yeah... they're a *bit* worried.  And they should be.

    And yes, while Tariq might be good at predicting and defeating your standard villain, genre-savvy villains like Black and Cat are on a whole other level.

      I love that about Cat and Black, everytime I hear in this sub about how PGTE isn't actually rational and that the characters act completely irrationally is kind of odd to me, because I think it's kinda obvious that *rational* in our world is not equivalent to rational in theirs, in the guideverse, Narrative is rationality, and Black and Cat's understanding and manipulation of the Narrative is their rationality, they even go about it in very different ways, with Black's mechanistic understanding, and well thought out planning and Cat's off the cuff and out of the box thinking and ability to fuck everyone over if she is losing. It's all just delightful.
      ```

    ```
    Not necessarily a threat to them, rather a threat to their *plans*
    ```

  - u/dandon223:
    ```
    I think they are anxious because hierarch will show up and judge them.
    ```

    - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
      ```
      Yeah theres no way Tyrant and the Heirarch aren't going to come and try to fuck up everyones day.
      ```

- u/Academic_Jellyfish:
  ```
  If Rumena dies, we riot.
  ```

  - u/narfanator:
    ```
    As far as I can tell, being properly snarky is one of the best ways to stay alive in PGtE.
    ```

    - u/RiOrius:
      ```
      Didn't save Ratface... :(
      ```

      - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
        ```
        gotta be on-screen snarky
        ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    RIOT WE SAY ! RIOT!
    ```

- u/Rorschach_And_Prozac:
  ```
  My prediction is that night will continue until Grey Popcorn is forced to intervene. At that point, he had shown his hand and is no longer able to counter Cat.

  Though I think there is something even more glorious in the works that will give the readers a much needed relief from all of Grey Porridge's self righteous bullshit.

  He's a well written unlikable character, in my opinion. Super hypocrite.
  ```

  - u/ClintACK:
    ```
    Totally agree about Pilgrim, but 'hypocrite' isn't quite the right word. It's not that his actions conflict with *his* stated beliefs and goals, it's just that they're at such conflict with the way the Dominion folks fall all over themselves about how he's a living saint and the most decent and good person ever to exist.
    ```

  - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
    ```
    I dunno, I reckon Cat's gonna have a plan thats going to subvert his goals. EG: he sees Cat engaging first as a key to victory, but Cat's going to do something that makes this tactic play into her strategy.
    ```

    - u/ClintACK:
      ```
      Yep. Like Cat never engages on the battlefield between the armies. At all. I think she's off doing something entirely different with the Wild Hunt -- whether it's kidnapping Proceran Princes to use as hostages or nabbing the Rogue Sorcerer to get Black's soul or something to deal with the League army.

      The Dominion commander called for the retreat on the first day because Grey Pilgrim's foresight told him Cat wasn't going to fight. It really seems like he's just going to sit there and do nothing unless Cat engages.
      ```
