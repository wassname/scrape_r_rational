## Recommendation Request: suggestions for people who liked Time Braid

### Post:

I enjoyed the Naruto fanfiction, "Time Braid". Specifically, I liked the badass protagonist plus terrifying villain combo, the fun with mindscapes, the computer-like multiverse, the interdimensional political scene that was initially way above the scope of the characters' interest and plot but gradually became relevant, the fact that the plot didn't follow canon, and the clever ways everyone used the story's magic systems. Does anyone have a recommendation for like stories, both fanfiction and otherwise?

I'm seeking a good adventure, not necessarily a "rationalist" story. I ask here, because it seems fairly popular among this crowd. (Let's avoid an argument about the merits of Time Braid itself - suffice to say it is rather polarizing, many enjoy it, and many others find it offensive.)

  [Mother of Learning](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning) is an original story that's very similar to Time Braid. The main character is stuck in a time loop and does everything he can to learn about what's causing it and be prepared to deal with the antagonists. There isn't any computer-like multiverse though. I think that was just a crossover with Oh My Goddess in Time Braid. And unlike in Time Braid, the main character gets involved in the main plot early on because it starts in a really obvious way with the antagonists attacking his city. There is still a lot of time spent on "sidequests" though. The prose is pretty rough and there are some grammar issues but the story is fun and the main character is pretty clever.

    Yes, as Timewinders says, they imported some of Oh My Goddess's multiverse for Time Braid. However, I don't suggest reading OMG if you enjoyed Time Braid's depiction of it - the canon (both TV and manga) is a rom-com/sit-com that is attenuated to the point of madness and made a bunch of very infuriating plot points / plot decisions. I can't really recommend it that highly over others in the magical girlfriend genre; the only fanfic that I've seen of it is, well, firstly Time Braid and secondly some of [Davner](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/17993/Davner)'s stuff - see Scordatura, Amants, and Haloes, and a few others, though his work is much more romancy things and less into fighting/combat, it tends towards doing romance well and also having really good comedy segments at times. Scordatura especially has a funnier zombie apocalypse than *Shaun of the Dead* and is just really great in general. 

    A few other things like Time Braid that came to mind. 

    [Ra](http://qntm.org/ra), by Sam512 technically fulfills a bunch of your stuff pretty well. It just ended recently and reactions to the ending are severely mixed to say the least. The praise for the earlier sections is a lot more uniform, at least - a few people didn't like it but most enjoyed it a lot. 

    The computerlike multiverse and mindscape stuff isn't present but most of the others are in multiverse crossover fic [Sleeping With The Girls](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5792734/1/Sleeping-with-the-Girls-Vol-I-Fictional-Reality) and sequels; this is a SI fic where a guy wakes up after every time he falls asleep next to a different character from various anime in various universes, and while that premise sounds *amazingly bad* it is actually pretty good. However, the fic is probably extremely dead/discontinued without an ending, which is sad. As a bonus, features an Oh My Goddess segment that is sort of neat.

    Another discontinued/unended fic that might qualify, especially in early to mid segments of it, is Brian 'Durandall' Randall's [Kyon: Big Damn Hero](http://soulriders.net/brian/fanfic/kbdh/), a Haruhi fic. This fic had a lot of neat stuff along the lines you are interested in, but ultimately became too stretched out and overlong for what it is and lost focus and failed to progress any major plots at a reasonable rate, and the fic is extremely dead (the author took his own life...). In this case the source material (The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya) is actually pretty good and itself possesses some attributes not entirely unlike Time Braid at times, so you could do far worse than checking out either the light novels or the anime adaptation (which is really well done, both in technical quality and overall merit - I prefer broadcast order for watching these but opinions vary. Also, there is a definite long section of the second season which you will know when you reach it when you will want to skim and skip through parts; I urge you to indulge this desire). 

    Peter Hamilton's [Void Trilogy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_Trilogy) has a bunch of stuff you may be interested in as well if you liked certain aspects of Time Braid. I don't really want to spoil a bunch of major and important plot points but it's got a lot of stuff in it that reminded me of good bits of Time Braid, and a slice of it manages to almost deconstruct Time Braid which is an especially neat trick considering that the majority of the trilogy was published before Time Braid was a thing that existed. The rest of Hamilton's work is rather a mixed bag, I liked his standalone Fallen Dragon and his Commonwealth books (that are technically prequels to the Void books, but the two series can be read independently) but Hamilton's Night's Dawn stuff is hopelessly self-indulgent, too long for what it is, and is very silly in central conceits.

      Yes, I wouldn't recommend watching Oh My Goddess either. I have read [this](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6537873/1/Oh-My-Geass) hilarious fanfic of it though. It's a crossover with Code Geass.

  The movie Edge of Tomorrow, also known as Live, Die, Repeat, provides a very competent depiction of a time loop. It falls apart a bit at the end, but is overall very good.

    True! I was expecting a mediocre mindless action flick, and was surprised by a rather decent mindless action flick!

      If you want something far less mindless and WAY more Japanese, I recommend the novel or manga: All You Need Is Kill. Very fun.

  Here's a recommendation:
  [Hard Reset](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362/hard-reset), a good MLP time-loop, which I enjoyed despite having only watched 4 episodes of the show. Like Time Braid, it starts off Time Loopy, then shifts its focus to new and interesting magic and plot mechanics. (Read: it doesn't spend 50,000+ words in loops with no permanent threat to the heroine). As a bonus, Twilight's characterization would greatly appeal to HPMOR/LW fans, and I had the impression that the author was already part of the community. Come to think of it, I would safely categorize it as a "rational" fic.

  Totally out of left field here, but the good adventure, badass protagonist and similar themes to the locked up in your own head parts of TB, I would recommend [When a Lioness Fights](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2162474/1/When-A-Lioness-Fights). 

  The romance is more central, and certain sections need trigger warnings, but it is a well written story with a smart (if not rational ... but probably rational?) protagonist.

  If nothing else I remember thinking most of the story was as well crafted as Time Braid, although perhaps TB had a stronger ending.

  Most of those are met by the two excellent stories below.  I'm not sure why both focus on Ranma - except that that canon is all about excellence in combat - but I'll leave it here, where I can give both a 10/10 recommendation.

  [Right Moments](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/764256/1/)

  > Ranma must discover what he wants and who he loves in a neverending day that is a spiritual journey to maturity. What might he do with boundless time?

  This would be the best *Time Braid*-like fic I've read - it's old, but good.  Ranma 1/2, with original extensions to the setting.

  [Haigeki](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892672/1/Haigeki)

  > His friends kidnapped by magical girls, Ranma is pushed beyond his limits to retrieve them.

  Ended a genre for me; it's that good.  The definitive "someone gets turned into Sailor X" story, and it is *epic*.  Draws beautifully on alternative concepts of excellence.

  Stumbled on this again: If you haven't seen it elsewhere on this sub, [The Fall of Doc Future](http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents) and it's sequel [Skybreaker's Call](http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/111819789111/skybreakers-call-contents) share the focus on the whiz-bang flashiness of really clever characters confronting ridiculously powerful obstacles. (There are some other similarities as well; sex is all offscreen, but 'how do overpowered people manage sex without doing massive harm to their partners?' is a question that is given screen time.)
