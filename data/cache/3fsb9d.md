## The Gamer - a manhwa that is, if not rationalist, decently rational and full of munchkinry. MC discovers that there are people with all kinds of weird magic abilities. In his case, it's the ability to treat real life like a game, including grinding, stat points, finding random loot, etc. It's good.

  It's actually kinda crappy, but I still read it for some reason.

  I don't like when it says "games has this and this thing" like it's some universal law and I have never seen anything like that. Like in chapter 6, "There is something called wall-hitting in games. Monsters won't attack you if you have a wall behind your back."

  It would be way better if the character said there is this thing in a game he plays and checks if it works here, but that shouldn't work too often either.

  The guy is a bit stupid too. Continuing school feels pretty stupid when he doesn't have to actually study anymore, it's mostly a waste of time he could use grinding and he could meet the guys elsewhere.

  His friend says stupid stuff too, like in chapter 8, "If you want to live a normal life, don't train your ability anymore. If you plan on training, be prepared or else you might be killed." He has lots of stuff he can train without anyone noticing. And getting stronger makes it harder to kill you.

  And he said you'll get killed if you win a lottery with your powers, but apparently his family can win all the sports competitions they want.

  He should also really talk to his mother...

  He's also said to be addicted to gaming, but how many times have we seen him play any?

  The sister of the friend in chapter 10 checks if he is a fake with a hit that should crush his bones...

  I did like that the guy started with melee before going to magic.

  Another thing like this is Tate No Yuusha No Yariagari. It's actually a novel, but it has manga too, but the novel is way further. I think writing might work better for these kinds of works. The writing is a bit crappy both in that and the gamer, though.

  edit: also, dlc? seriously?

    Thank you for the comprehensive warning. This sounds like I would get brain damage from all the wallbanging.

      I just reread it today. It's not all bad and is actually kinda entertaining. He does improve his wisdom a lot later, parts of that might be attributed to low wisdom score.

      That fanfic in top comment looks better though.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        can confirm. i think the fanfic is better.  The Gamer manga makes me think the mc is a fucking moron at times and at others that he has never played a video game since like 1990s.  he's too naive
        ```

        - u/kaukamieli:
          ```
          I've been reading the fic nonstop now with only sleeping in between. It's definitely the best thing of the genre I know.
          ```

          - u/Rhamni:
            ```
            Same here. It's great. I mean I'd be much more cowardly in his position because "can't risk my life now when I'll be so much stronger in a year", but it's great.
            ```

            - u/kaukamieli:
              ```
              Shitfuck. There is disc five. I've still been reading nonstop, and thought I got it all, but those fuckers locked the thread and there is more!

              I'm ofc glad, but I should study, but apparently not going to happen today either.
              ```

            - u/kaukamieli:
              ```
              But the thing is, if he'd be cowardly, he would advance at far slower rate. Danger is a shortcut.
              ```

              - u/Rhamni:
                ```
                This is true. However, it's possible to strike a balance. Before 'big mission 2', he thinks to himself that the *safer* way to speed level would be to have daddy take him out somewhere dangerous and guard him while he fought Grimm. That would certainly be much slower than what he does do, but he is young. What does it *really* matter if it takes 2 or 10 years to catch up to the baddest badasses in the land? It's more enjoyable to read this way, it's just not paranoid enough considering how useful he'll be if he survives a few years.
                ```

                - u/kaukamieli:
                  ```
                  It matters if something really big happens in five years and our main character isn't strong enough to end the apocalypse. :)

                  Though he has been leveling damn fast lately, doing those quests isn't apparently the fastest way to get power.
                  ```

    - u/FuguofAnotherWorld:
      ```
      It's not *bad*, I enjoy it when I read it, but I enjoy the genre it spawned more.
      ```

      - u/kaukamieli:
        ```
        Yea, it's definitely the genre thing, though I don't think it begun the genre. Tate no yuusha no yariagari is a novel with over 300 chapters I think. Does the genre have a name yet even?
        ```

      - u/Transfuturist:
        ```
        Uh... what genre is that?
        ```

        - u/FuguofAnotherWorld:
          ```
          Gaming genre. Basically, pick a character in a series and give them ungodly power creep according to RPG rules.

          I find it forces structure and progression onto the story. While few of them are truly great, few of them are bad at the same time. You can generally be confident you're in for at least a reasonable time.
          ```

          - u/None:
            ```
            what are some truly great ones if you dont mind me asking?
            ```

            - u/FuguofAnotherWorld:
              ```
              Well there's The Games We Play that was recced higher up in the thread. Naruto: The Gamer Files was... decent as well. In retrospect I may have overstated the number of great ones out there.
              ```

              - u/FeepingCreature:
                ```
                I'd count Dungeon Keeper Ami, which may actually compete with TGWP for total length. (And is apparently "not abandoned". Make of that what you will.)
                ```

  - u/literal-hitler:
    ```
    I'm temporarily rage quitting from him not [Chapter ~44 spoiler.](/s "trying to get more skill books when he saved that one chick's life.")
    ```

    - u/Rhamni:
      ```
      He also never visits a library. It's downright criminal. Still, I think the series does get better and better.

  Good rec. I've found that I'm enjoying the crossover fanfic [The Games We Play](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/rwby-the-gamer-the-games-we-play.306381/) more than the original Gamer manwha. Reliable daily updates for just over a year probably have something to do with that, but it seems to do a better job of scaling up the periodic challenges to the exponential power of the protagonist's ability.

  Another manwha you might enjoy if you liked *The Gamer* is *Dice: The Cube that Changes Everything*, which is along mostly the same lines.

    I was reading this fic on ffnet but it seemed abandoned. Am I to understand the space battles one is updated daily??

      Yup. At midnight EST, about.

    - u/None:
      ```
      Also, it's gotten really awesome lately. There's a ridiculous amount of bts worldbuilding
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I stopped caring about that fic due to..well..how do I say it?

    Power induced apathy? 

    Also, apathy related to the numerous twists and stake raising.

    Is [this](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/rwby-the-gamer-the-games-we-play.306381/#post-14816773) the first entry in The Games We Play? It feels very much not an opening, so I'm thinking maybe I missed something. I'm familiar with the Gamer concept from other fanfic and enjoy it, but would prefer to start at the actual beginning.
    ```

    - u/GeeJo:
      ```
      The post above, with the table of contents, is the first entry.
      ```

      - u/Rhamni:
        ```
        This was surprisingly easy to miss. Like ej, I just assumed it started with the first linked chapter, rather than having one immediately under the table.
        ```

  - u/t3tsubo:
    ```
    I've always skipped it as well since I've not watched RWBY. Is it readable without?
    ```

    - u/GeeJo:
      ```
      Yep - I caught up with it without having watched any of RWBY, and didn't particularly feel as though I'd missed anything. It convinced me to watch the show, in fact.

      I mean, there's only about 5 hours of total content in the whole of the RWBY canon, counting trailers and the background-webisodes, so there's not a tremendous amount to miss in the first place. The lore of *The Games We Play* is significantly more extensive.
      ```

    - u/kaukamieli:
      ```
      You _should_ watch it though, at least one ep. But the first season doesn't take much time, the episodes are short and it's 16 eps. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sGiE10zNQM

      I rather like knowing what those flying things look like and I didn't get blake being a girl too early and it's nice to see what the grims look like. Not to mention our main character.
      ```

  - u/kaukamieli:
    ```
    Everyone who is going to read The Games We Play, I suggest you check [RWBY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sGiE10zNQM) first. At least one episode, 12 min, to get some kind of hold of the world.
    ```

  - u/Gworn:
    ```
    It's not bad, but the introspection, grinding and many fight scenes should be cut by more than half. Otherwise it becomes a slog to get through.

    I recommend skimming large portions of many chapters to get to the good stuff.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      but all that stuff you suggest skipping consists of a LOT of world building and character development
      ```

  - u/literal-hitler:
    ```
    I've always skipped over it, but I might have to give it a read after I finish this. I just saw RWBY last week too, there was a lot less of it than I thought there's be.
    ```

    - u/FuguofAnotherWorld:

      I very much enjoyed it, and would definitely recommend it to read.

  I don't know that there's a lot of munchkinry. 42 chapters in and I'd say he's just overpowered. The system doesn't have rules that need to be munchkined (beyond something very basic), the rules are just very much in his favour...
  ```

  - u/eltegid:
    ```
    Ok, there's some munchkining later on. The game still seems rigged in his favor.
    I don't have a problem with the lack of munchkinry, and I am enjoying it. There are some points where he ignores OBVIOUS solutions to problems, and that does bother me.
    ```

  - u/kaukamieli:
    ```
    He just feels overpowered because he keeps fighting sucky mobs.
    ```

    - u/FuguofAnotherWorld:
      ```
      And also because according to the rules of the world he has the most powerful and awesome possible type of power.
      ```

    - u/eltegid:
      ```
      No, come on. He needs to fight to level and his power allows him to create the mobs to fight, at the appropiate level. He also progresses much much faster than anyone in the world, just because (think of when he grinds Vit and Str, he gains in weeks what others gain in years).

      Also, a power like this /could/ have limitations, like 'you cannot create your own skills' which is commonplace in games. But fuck it, it doesn't!

      All in all, in two months he gets power levels that are on par and above people who've been training their whole lifes. I think it's not unreasonable to predict that in a couple of years he could be at the 'top' level in absolute terms. So yeah, OP as fuck.
      ```

      - u/kaukamieli:
        ```
        Yes, he _will_ be overpowered. But he is not yet. Yes, the ability is OP, yet the guy is not yet.

    - u/Nevereatcars:
      ```
      I hardly ever see games where you can level individual skills like that. The closest I can think of off the top of my head is Skyrim, and Skyrim's perk system is tied into its main leveling system so it's entirely different.

      And existing skills mutating into new skills once you've hit a high enough level in it? Never seen it before. Maybe I should start playing Korean RPGs.

        There was similar system of skills in old DOS rpg - Betrayal At Krondor. They were improved by usage, and often weren't combat related.

  The main character spends time grinding, and reading it feels like grinding after a few chapters too.

  Thing that annoyed me the most: assuming Gamer's Mind, why the hell is he continuously flustered when dealing with girls? That makes no sense at all.
