  Oh my god, this chapter was goddamn amazing. The wait was worth it. It was funny at the right moments and intense in equal measure. An appropriate for chapter for my most favorite piece of fiction of all time.

  >He nervously fingered the cube given to him by the angel he summoned, wondering if he should–

  >No. No, this wasn't the right time. Using it now would be a mistake. Something in the back of his mind insisted that this was true.

  From my reread a few weeks back, don't psychics sometimes have some amount of precognitive power? Because that's what this looks like. And it also looks like Zorian before he learned about his empathy but trusted his instincts in reading people anyways.

  ---

  Question, since I don't remember it being specified. I presume a normal soul is seated in the physical body. Where is it when you have many simulcrums like Zorian does? I think his simulcrums are vulnerable to some soul attacks, right? This whole area isn't entirely clear in my head.
  ```

  - u/rman320:
    ```
    With simulacrums the soul is still located inside Zorian but they can still access it because it has been shown that Zorian can contact his simulacrums using telepathy through the soul. It is unknown if soul attacks on simulacrums affect the original because no such case has happened in the story so far.
    ```

    - u/Ardvarkeating101:
      ```
      I think it's more like stretching out the soul to encompass the simulacrum at creation, through the connection that constantly feeding them mana to maintain their form provides.  As long as you keep feeding them mana, the connection is maintained and they're still a part of your soul, so soul attacks would work and technically your soul is in all of them.  Your mind, however, is always in your original body.

      Unless you're Zorian.
      ```

      >It is unknown if soul attacks on simulacrums affect the original

      They do; confirmed on, iirc, the worldbuilding blog.

      Ah, here it is: [https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2016/08/07/golems-and-undead/#comment-209](https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2016/08/07/golems-and-undead/#comment-209)

    I'll be "that guy" and disagree; this chapter was really boring. Nothing pivotal happened. Nothing surprising happened. No character development. There didn't feel like there was any real challenge or loss. It was just tracing the plot from point A to point B.

    *shrugs* I'm sure things will get better soon. But I would not be suprised if, once all is said and done, this chapter is effectively able to be summarized in 3 paragraphs.
    ```

    - u/Golden_Magician:
      ```
      I also didn't feel very invested in the chapter, and reading your comment made me realize why. Yeah, I feel the same way. There has been an incredible amount of build-up to get to this point, and yet so far it hasn't felt too different compared to most of the latest time-loop battles. I know there should be a sense of finality coming from the lack of time loop, but I'm just so used to Zorian stomping through all opposition without any real set-backs by now that I'm not really feeling it.
      ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      Eh, to everything there is a season. There's a time and place to have your main character get thoroughly pranked by a version of themselves from a few hours in the future, when the earlier self doesn't yet know Time Turners exist. There's a time and place to have your characters face the terrible choice of whether or not to go into a burning, structurally unsound building in an effort to save people trapped inside. And there's a time and place for the Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        But USoUD was entertaining :P

        (I suspect this is just a taste difference, but again, my point is not "big, complex action scenes are bad," it's "repetitive and predictable action scenes without stakes are boring.")
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          Perhaps if we saw a clash where RR's simulacrum, with its surprise super strength, was able to disperse Zorian's simulacrum and wipe out the associated task force?
          ```

          - u/DaystarEld:
            ```
            Yes, that would have definitely helped. Two wins and a loss at least feels a little more like the final outcome is less predictable.
            ```

    - u/boomfarmer:
      ```
      Nothing happened? We learned more about the combat capabilities of the enemies, and far-flung events were relocated to Cyoria. Plus the fiance's family got some characterization time.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Those combat capabilities were by and large all things we've seen before, and nothing shown had any impact. The heroes faced no setbacks and suffered no losses. It was all superficial.

        I don't see any characterization in the fiance or her family we didn't really know before, either. They weren't particularly interesting before, they're not particularly interesting now? What exactly do you see as new here?
        ```

    - u/hallo_friendos:
      ```
      Eh, I don't care much for detailed fight scenes, but I'll admit there had to be one. Final battle and all that.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        The problem wasn't that it was all fight scenes at all; the problem is that the fight scenes felt empty. As someone else mentioned, it was just Zorian and Pals curbstomping the opposition without any sense of stakes.  I expected the fight to escape the timeloop to signal an end to these.
        ```

- u/signspace13:
  ```
  RR's distaste for Firearms is interesting, he calls Zorian Honourless for using one, while his own abilities are founded on the betrayal and exploitation of someone who trusted and believed in him.

  What is Zorian betraying by using guns? Some form of nebulous mage integrity?
  ```

  - u/Ardvarkeating101:
    ```
    They prolonged the splinter wars and were (along with the Weeping) the reason that Houses like Jornaks were wiped out and/or almost wiped out but heirs like Jornak were left with nothing.  Which he is really pissed about.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    [deleted]
    ```

    - u/signspace13:
      ```
      Oh yeah, I understand his social dislike of them, I'm wondering as to why that wording? Why Honorless? It is just such a specific early to word it, Zorian is honestly a rather honourable fellow, he isn't one to betray his friends and he has a pretty strict code of ethics that he has yet to properly break. Its more of a nitpick than a question or a discussion point.
      ```

      - u/Therosfire:
        ```
        Probably the general disdain for ranged weapons seen throughout history. Sure on paper firing a gun isn't any different then throwing a firebolt at someone, except the firebolt is something you did yourself. While the gun is using help to fight for you. Anyone can pick up a gun and fight not anyone can put in the effort to throw fire bolts.

        Or it could be that he just sees guns as beneath wizards, a peasant weapon that true mages to wouldn't dare use.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          Not just *beneath* wizards, these are the weapons that basically *dethroned* wizards. To use them is, in a noble's mind, to side with the people who killed off the majority of mages and is thus a gross betrayal of the whole of wizardkind.
          ```

          - u/Tur4:
            ```
            Pretty much this.  The introduction of fire arms wrecked mages in the splinter wars which led to many noble houses either dying off or being dramatically weakened.
            ```

      - u/sibswagl:
        ```
        In addition to what others have said, I think he probably sees using guns as cheating. Previously, when two mages fought, the one with more magical power and skill won (excepting prep time, environmental factors, etc.). But guns level that playing field; 10 normal soldiers with guns can beat even a strong mage. It’s the equivalent of using an aimbot in a FPS tournament or PEDs in the Olympics.
        ```

        - u/RynnisOne:
          ```
          Yeah, I can imagine a guy that 'knows' he's better at magic than the other one would be pretty upset when the 'weaker' guy pulls out a gun and makes things more even.

          I mean, how dare those inferior mages use something other than magic to defend themselves against their betters?
          ```

    - u/Menolith:
      ```
      > I'd wager the introduction of rifle corps pisses off mage houses, who previously probably held noble status thanks to being walking artillery barrages/ rifle + fireball volleys.

      I think this much is just canon. Mage families used to be the top of the pyramid thanks to the extreme preference of quality over quantity, but firearms upset that balance enormously when suddenly a militia of average Joes with ten hours of training could rival the effectiveness of someone who's spent their life and a mountain of gold in honing their skills.

  Tense switches from past to present-perfect and back to past. A bit hard to read.

  What I don't understand is how could Red Robe get so powerful? Our duo has done nothing but improve their magic over the time loop while Red Robe was trying to get politically savvy and stuff on top of amassing personal magic. But he goes toe to toe with Zorian / Zach? I guess being tutored by our favourite Lich helps a lot? 

  A lot happened this chapter but no real progress was made on Zach/Zorian's end. Nobody really died except for goons. I guess we're in for a long battle sequence which is good. 

  Zorian going ultra hive mind with multiple bodies was cool. But yeah he is becoming less human each day. Dr Manhattan style. He will be in a lot of 3somes with himselves and his future wife lol. Just hope he doesn't use a golem body when that time comes.

  It is not mentioned that Zorian is using a disguise.  Now a looot of people saw his face and there is no way as hell he will be able to protect his identity from interested parties. Secret is out amigos. Just set up the Avengers and be done with it.


  Where is the aranea?
  ```

  - u/TheBobulus:
    ```
    The Zorian replicas are using golem bodies, both because it's more mana-efficient and more durable than using ectoplasmic bodies. Presumably all those human volunteers are seeing is a blank golem face, not Zorian's?

    On the other hand, I wonder if the reason Red Robe is staying cloaked is that he's hoping to keep his identity secret from the authorities. He didn't replace his non-time-loop form, he's in a fresh body. Whether he succeeds or fails, that second form that's just a down-on-his-luck lawyer is still out there, and RR might prefer his alternate staying free of government persecution. If RR loses, Zorian and Zach would probably show mercy and not report him, since, you know, he hasn't technically done anything wrong.

    On the other hand, we also know that the red robe itself is covered in high-level wards and stuff. Maybe my speculation is wrong and he's just taking advantage of that so he didn't have to spend time the month making new ones.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      Is he really Jornak? Zorian thought so, and RR was happy to let him, but there's been no proof that I know of.
      ```

  - u/interested_commenter:
    ```
    Red Robe spent much longer in the time loop than Zorian, and he had help from Quatach-ichl, who is, in addition to being really skilled, is also an actually good teacher. He should be a really good mage, but he still isn't a match for Zach or Zorian.

    We never see him go toe-to-toe with Zach, but we're told Zach has beaten him before.

    We do see Zorian and Red Robe fight (several times), and Zorian wins. Zorian is clearly an archmage at this point, but direct combat is one of his weakest skills. He definitely shouldn't be able to dominate Red Robe, the fact that he's winning at all implies that he was much more effective at taking advantage of the time loop.

    Zorian was also doing other things besides self-improvement. He spent a lot of time investigating the invasion and finding the imperial artifacts (each of which people have spent years searching for).
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      We also know that QI has enhanced his avatar bodies. Remember when they first seriously fought him, and he jumped like a grasshopper to reach and smash the anti-teleportation ward? Whether that was a permanent enhancement, or unstructured magic, that kind of boost could explain these punches.
      ```

      - u/interested_commenter:
        ```
        QI's bodies are black skeletons that are incredibly hard to damage, regenerate themselves (Zach cuts his arm off and all QI does is touch it to his shoulder and it heals), and he has several of them. I think that is a function of the bodies themselves and a result of the necromancy QI used to construct them. I think it's most similar to Zorian's simulacrums having the strength of their golem bodies.

        That wouldn't work for RR. My best for his physical strength is that it's because his body was created by Panaxeth. The cultists originally wanted to summon him to reform their bodies, and he remade Silverlake as a young woman. There's no reason he couldn't give RR a body that is perfected beyond what's humanly possible. (And he has the incentive to do so, since it would make his escape more likely)

        It could also be that he doesn't have enhanced strength, he just has a way to make his simulacrum stronger than his real body. He is a soul mage, and we've seen Damien create a giant body around himself, so making a physically enhanced simulacrum should be possible.
        ```

        - u/bludvein:
          ```
          Whatever Red Robe's enhancements are, he had them in the loop. Remember when Zorian shot him soon after he booted Cyoria's aranea out of the loop? He barely reacted outside of shock. This shouldn't come as a surprise.

          It could be just a thing with his simulacrums, but I would not be surprised if his real body was just as strong. There are plenty of ways to get inhuman physical power if you are willing. Just look at the mayor and his shifter patchwork. Though that was a bit of a failure, Red Robe could have easily stolen the idea and perfected it.

            I assumed that was either a personal ward or the robes (which we know are pretty impressive defensive magic items), hadn't considered that it might be connected to his strength later.

            I was thinking that a regular permanent enhancement was unlikely because exiting the loop would break it (like how Zorian's unraveled) and he attacked Zach and the aranea immediately, but maybe Panaxeth could prevent that issue.

    - u/mrasiteren:
      ```
      I don't think so. Zach had the upperhand when they fought 1 on 1 in the time loop. I remember Zach lost some loops while in soul damage coma but not after Red Robe mind raped him. I might be misremembering this but I'm sure even if Zach lost some loops after the mind rape it was a few months at most not years. And Red Robe spent some of that time experimenting with political situations and getting intel on world governments. 

      Red Robe left timeloop not long after that and Zach and Zorian spent years (including time chamber and army of experts) furthering their magic. And when they leave the timeloop he is still their equal. I think he should still be powerful but not like this.

        I’m pretty sure we just saw Zorian curb-stomp RR.

        Sure, the first couple strategies didn’t turn out that effective (the gun or fireballs).

        But eventually Zorian figured out something that worked, and he was able to pull it off despite RR’s hand through his golem’s chest
        ```

        - u/RynnisOne:
          ```
          > But eventually Zorian figured out something that worked

          This is the key part.  Red Robe had a specific attack method planned to take out Zorian ahead of time, tailored to his opponent.  Zorian had a bunch of different attacks to handle multiple situations, but nothing *specifically* designed to take out Red Robe.  Still, in the middle of a fight with the equivalent of Superman, Zorian figured out a successful counter on the fly.

          Zach might curbstomp Red Robe due to sheer overwhelming power and skill differential.  But  Zorian did it more by creativity and adaptability, all the while being far less powerful than his opponent.
          ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          Nah, it's not a curb stomp when he lost valuable resources and almost sacrificed an avatar. But it was a clever win.

          Curb stomp is what happened to the worm controllers.
          ```

  - u/Nepene:
    ```
    Zach probably had easy access to the imperial artifacts due to angelic aid, and so Red Robe did as well. The ability to bring in loopers, teleport anywhere, recall everything, store everything, kill people in the loop, all that meant that it would be very easy for Red Robe to ramp up. 

    Plus he has primordial secrets and bonuses.

    I'm most excited when reading Quatach Ichl ambushed the duo at a tavern in broad daylight. But I don't think it would make a very exciting illustration, unless the artist is REALLY good. Their escape from Royal Armory on top of skeletal crocodile would make very exciting illustration, but it has little relevance to the whole story. Hmmm, how about when the duo try to initiate a negotiation with Quatach Ichl while flaunting his snatched crown? A wheat field scarred and burned, a Hydra much too big than it has right to be, bodies strewn, and eagle mounted troops can only watch in frustration from afar. Epic scene that I can't begin to understand how to pour it into a 2D scape.

        The kind of magic Zorian does is usually very subtle, although this chapter makes me rethink that.  

        Like, mental magic, invisible magic missiles, and a bunch of prep work don't make for a cool action scene.  

        However, him with his golems, or throwing an invention or potion, or just riding Princess would be interesting.

  Really?  Really?  That title for this chapter?  Goddamn it.  

  Still, unless this battle goes on a lot longer then they've pretty much won.

  Aside from the free mana though, I wonder why they transported the mansion there.  I mean, they had a portal in the basement they could use to get back to Cyoria, so unless they're worried they can't teleport their sacrifices out of their own underground Cyorian base for some reason, then I don't see why they teleported the entire mansion there.  I mean, I get why Sudomir would want to preserve his housewife (geddit), but why would moving to Cyoria help anything?

  And finally the million dollar question: Where is RR and QI?
  ```

  - u/Luck732:
    ```
    It's possible that since Zorian killed the RR sim, Zorian was threatening the gate.  If Zorian shuts off the gate from Cyorian side, team RR can't get the shifter kids to the ritual anymore, which might be an instant win Z+Z.

    Teleporting mansion to Cyorian might have been their only option.
    ```

    - u/Ardvarkeating101:
      ```
      Yeah, but it looks like Sudomir only did it when his house was threatened by Zorian's golem curbstomping his skele-dragon (which, like literally every other scene this chapter, was fucking awesome) and leaving his wife open for a pounding, implying that this would save his house in some way.
      ```

      - u/Luck732:
        ```
        Maybe, but since it brought the Golem with it, I don't know why it would have been a reaction to that.  Unless this is a killzone set up by QI and RR.
        ```

        - u/Ardvarkeating101:
          ```
          > Maybe, but since it brought the Golem with it, I don't know why it would have been a reaction to that. **Unless this is a killzone set up by QI and RR.**

          ........Oh fuck.
          ```

  - u/signspace13:
    ```
    They are almost certainly in Cyoria, though I wouldn't be surprised if RR showed up at Both personally, he seems like the kind of sadistic asshole that would take hostages *personally*. The reason they teleported To Cyoria was for support from the rest of the troops, QI included, likely also to benefit from the better battle conditions, something makes me think dragons are much better at casting with Ambient Mana than humans so Cyoria is kinda a great spot for them, not to mention Sudomir's wards also draw from ambient mana.

    This also begs the question as to what was teleported *out*.
    ```

    - u/Ardvarkeating101:
      ```
      > This also begs the question as to what was teleported out.

      Either Noveda Mansion, Imaya's house, or Zak's favorite bar.  All out of spite.
      ```

      - u/signspace13:
        ```
        Imaya's house isn't tactically important enough at all, I would say the same for the Noveda estate but I think it's the most likely candidate, it's pretty central and has enough space Iasku mansion to fit.
        ```

    - u/-Fender-:
      ```
      The space they warped to would have been connected with the mansion ahead of time. Wards, spell formula circle, all the works. It would have been a very involved process, to make sure that it would warp smoothly without damaging the mansion and its contents. So I find it unlikely that it would have switched with Noveda mansion or something. It's probably a random spot outside of the city.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:

    It was mentioned earlier in the chapter that ZZ wanted the battle to take place somewhere that the enemy would need to be worried about collateral damage.

      well since this fight needs to last at least a day, it likely needs to be linked to ibasa or so they can keep getting reinforcement. theres also still the one in koth, but each one has shown some ability to hold one steady by itself. it also should help to have all areas in need of defense in one area to keep from spreading too thin.

        ```

        - u/bludvein:
          ```
          Simulacrums don't have a separate regen, but they do all share Zorian's soul and mana pool. It stands to reason if he had a simulacrum set aside to focus on refining mana that his regen would increase. Considering how efficient the golem simulacrums are, it might surpass upkeep and be worth it.
          ```

          - u/sambelulek:
            ```
            Simulacrum refining mana? Where did that come from? In-universe, mana regeneration tied to the soul. Without soul, no mana regen. Soul can regen more mana if the ambient mana is rich, up to four times as fast compared to poor environment. Think of it this way, if Simulacrum heighten mana regen, why not Zorian cast 100 Simulacrum and place 90 of them in Cyoria, dedicating themselves to mana regen.
            ```

            - u/bludvein:
              ```
              One of the exercises Xvim taught him was how to meditate to refine ambient mana into his personal mana reserves faster than a passive regen. This speeds up regeneration, but the amount isn't that exaggerated.

              As for why he doesn't make a bunch of simulacrums to cheat the system, I would guess that's because the soul has limits. It makes sense. There's only so much ambient mana his soul can process at one time, regardless of the amount of bodies.
              ```

              - u/sambelulek:
                ```
                No no no. The meditation Xvim taught him is the limit of four times I talked about. The number four, BTW, is not  checked. Just me has faint memory about it. You can check on Worldbuilding site (wordpress one) about mana well. It's not on the chapter.

                And the soul has no limit as to how many simulacrum one can cast. The limit is mana maintenance. Cast too many of them, their cost will soon overwhelm your mana regeneration. Cast even more, your mana pool get exhausted. If the caster has no more mana to maintain a simulacrum, then the simulacrum will fizzle out of existence. 

                I wonder where you read about soul-limit and simulacrum refining mana. Well, I can suspect you derive mana refining from chapter, um, 94? When Zorian enchantment get unraveled. But it's not improving mana regen, it's calming down his mana pool due to soul damage.
                ```

                - u/bludvein:
                  ```
                  I never said there was a limit to how many simulacrums a mage can cast, but that there is a cap on abusing mana regen because they all share the same soul(and that soul has a limit no matter how many bodies it's spread over.) As for the meditation exercise Xvim taught him, i will have to look because I don't remember which chapter it was in.
                  ```

            - u/dinoseen:
              ```
              Zorians simulacrums are linked by the soul, stands to reason that they would all have some kind of regen.
              ```

              - u/sambelulek:
                ```
                Even if linked, the soul is just one. Simulacrum has no soul. The pool a simulacrum can use, and consequently a regen a simulacrum can enjoy, came from that one soul. If mana regen is tied to mental capability, it's possible for simulacrum to improve regen. Simulacrum spell has a thinking construct in it after all. But it's not. Hence, simulacrum does not improve mana regen.
                ```

                - u/dinoseen:
                  ```
                  Having multiple bodies means taking in more ambient mana though, so regen is actually improved. It's just not pure soul derived regen.
                  ```

                    ```
                    This is getting ridiculous. If you insist it works like so, fine, I will not spend another minute pointing out where your logic is faulty. This is just a fictional work anyway. The author might even adopt your view as emergency solution if relevant Plot Hole happened.
                    ```

                    - u/thrawnca:
                      ```
                      This has been discussed before and firmly resolved including word of author. The simulacrums *can* use his meditation techniques to maximize ambient mana assimilation rate, and that boost is greater than the cost of a single simulacrum. However, the bottleneck is the soul's ability to accept it, so putting multiple simulacrums on the job gives no additional benefit; one is enough. And it's boring, so even one simulacrum might not be keen (though he has mental focus techniques now).
                      ```

                - u/Nepene:
                  ```
                  The author has mentioned that Simulacrums can be hit by soul attacks, and that they can do regeneration stuff, but there's a cap that can't be exceeded by making them.

                  Suppose the max he could absorb is 4 units of mana, converted for use in his body, if he had one body dedicated to absorbing that mana he could absorb 4, or if he had 4 simalcrums which each had 1 mana absorption focus he could absorb 4, but 4 is the max.
                  ```

          - u/Nepene:
            ```
            If most of his simulcrums are in mana rich areas their combined mana regeneration may be enough to max out his regen.
            ```

        - u/Bramble-Thorn:
          ```
          Mana is produced by a soul. But there is also environmental mana welling up from the dungeons. (And from what we learned recently, may be produced by the World Core artifact in the center of the world.)

          One of the first things beginning mages learn is how to filter ambient mana into personal mana in their mana pool. This effectively increases their pools mana regeneration, but the increase is dependent on the concentration of ambient mana in their immediate area. (Higher level mana well = better regeneration, but there is a cap. A Level 3 Mana Well can let you use the techniques at full efficiency, and stronger wells just let more mage refill at once.)

          And seems to be passive most of the time, and could be done while walking around and doing other things. But Xvim also taught Zorian  an active version that is more like meditation and takes concentration and effort but is even more effective.

          Simulacrums have a link to the original soul, so they can feed ambient mana at their location into the souls mana storage. One Simulacrum concentrating on filtering mana into the pool would give all the other simulacrums (and original) more mana to work with.

          But multiple simulacrums (past the first one) doing the same thing wouldn't help because the soul can only filter so much ambien mana at a time, and they are all sharing the same soul.

        Nah. It's someone here who really like the idea that final chapter should coincide with author username. Author himself did not plan the whole thing to go over 100 chapters. But as you know with authors, the required amount of chapter always double their prediction. (and you double it again to be safe)

  Erm.  So Zorian spent a long time putting runes all over the city, the leading theory being that they would help fool Zach into believing everyone died and thus fulfilled the contract. But now there's a large hole in his network due to the mansion teleport. I wonder how that will play out.

  Dragon battles yay!  I wonder why there was so much focus on the bee attack, chances are it will be important later. Ironbeaks are super unreliable. I figure the mansion got teleported near the rift and the summoning ritual is already set up and ready to be cast as soon as it can.  Having all the prep work and  defenses done beforehand is the only guess I have as to why they teleported it.  I wonder if the dragon mage will care that one of his students died, or if it will piss him off. I was expecting him to be more offended by the skeletal dragon but I guess they aren't very social creatures.

  Fun stuff, thanks nobody103!

    There really wasn't much focus on the Taramatala estate battle. It got some discussion, but that section was shorter than any of the other things Zorian had simulacrums doing. I think the point of that section was basically to help show the "Zorian is fighting a war on multiple battlefronts at once". 

    Zorian cares because that's where his family is, but its overall irrelevant to the Panaxeth summoning, which is why it's a short section. The mention that they are trying to capture the gate is relevant though, and could solve Damien's issues. If the Taramatala capture it and use it to branch into intercontinental trade, that solves his Mother's concern.

    I don't think there's that large a hole. He believed he could cover the whole city with his mind sense putting the sigils up physically, even accounting for graffiti and city authorities ruining some of them. That puts the range of each sigil at maybe a radius of 500 metres, at least? Assuming he put up 200 of them and the city's area is roughly 50 km^2. (Not sure if that's a reasonable estimation though, I'm not too certain how to extrapolate a good number for the city's size and I might be underselling it by putting the number of sigils at 200.)

    I seem to recall that Sudomir's undead dragon wasn't literally a dragon corpse, but rather a recreation made in their likeness with various bones. I could easily be wrong, mind you. I've read a lot of different stories and might be confusing a few and misremembering the chapters where the dragon was actually introduced.
    ```

    - u/RynnisOne:
      ```
      Pretty sure the living dragons would think a 'fake skeletal dragon' would be amusing or pathetic.

      Instead, they seemed to actually be *angry* at its existence, so I'm going to go out on a limb and say it probably *is* made from dragon bones.

  Have we ever learned how Red Robe managed to stay in the loop longer than six restarts?
  ```

  - u/interested_commenter:
    ```
    Nope. Current best guess is that either Quatach-ichl or Panaxeth modified the temporary marker.

    Zach could have used the crown on RR, who then went to Quatach-ichl, who modified it. Jornak had connections to the cult, so if Zach stole the crown (likely by brute-forcing strategies over many restarts like he did vs Oganj), the RR could have gotten in contact with Quatach and offered the crown back if he would adjust the marker.

    The MOST likely possibility would be that Zach and RR originally found the Sovereign Gate and entered it together. They might not have even needed the keys to do so (the gate was barred because RR left, if might have been unbarred originally). If Panaxeth made the offer to RR to release him in exchange for modifying the marker and a way out, RR would have taken it. The reason we dont see Panaxeth make the offer to modify anyone's marker later is that there was no reason to. RR had already optimized the invasion, leaving Silverlake inside the loop would just create the risk of Zach preventing her from ever leaving or of Zorian mind wiping her. Modifying Zorian's marker (when Panaxeth makes the second offer) would be even worse, since they're so close to being able to leave on their own. Giving Zorian extra time would just take away the only leverage Panaxeth had.

    Speaking of, that offer to let Zorian with no strings attached in exchange for mind wiping Zach was a terrible deal. Panaxeth would be much better off with only Zach escaping than only Zorian escaping.

      >Speaking of, that offer to let Zorian with no strings attached in exchange for mind wiping Zach was a terrible deal. Panaxeth would be much better off with only Zach escaping than only Zorian escaping.

      Zach is bound to prevent release or die. On the other hand Zorian can potentially cut his loses, grab his friends and flee wherever. And without Zach contract there was no reason to contact angles that would have threatened him with pseudo-contract.
      ```

  - u/hallo_friendos:
    ```
    Not specifically, but I'd guess either Panaxeth tampered with the marker somehow (in Ch 90 he claimed he was causing Zorian to continue getting controller privileges, so he probably would have been able to give a temporary looper controller privileges as well) or Quatach Ichl was able to manipulate the divine energies the right way.

    They did, this is a full day before the festival.  The planar alignment is perfect on the night of the festival, but it is still quite closely aligned in the days leading up to it.

    Regarding why they didn't act a week or more before the festival, that was the original plan, but once the Zach Contract issue came up, Zorian decided to delay so he could work on that problem.

        She didn't know anything about the time loop. She was just being an asshole for her own amusement. Even after they killed the grey hunter and showed they knew about the (unconstructed) "doorbell" to her secret house, she still didn't believe them about the time loop. (Didn't believe them until they mentioned that it was related to the primordial prison, which she was then able to verify herself). She definitely wasn't giving him impossible missions because she suspected.

  Since the last chapter had ended with cliff about family/siblings, I was expecting that this one will be calm-before-storm chapter. Search for shifter brother would also include revelations about Zorian's  own brother ( and stuff like why Fortov kept pushing the girl into creeper bush). 

  Now it seems it will be a part of after-glow. Hopefully most of the loose ends from school arc will be tied up in them.

    The Fortov pushing the girl into the bush one was answered: >!she was too infatuated with him, borderline stalking him, he took the creeper harvesting task to avoid her (since it sucks), she took it anyways to follow him and forced herself on Fortov, and he pushed her away into the bush, iirc.!<

  ...Why on Earth did Sudomir move Iasku Mansion to the place he's trying to obliterate with a primordial? Only makes sense if he left his wife's soul behind, but you'd think there'd be an easier way to do that.

  Also, it's pretty much confirmed that Zorian has an angel or something living in his head, and it wasn't just a coincidence that he was included in the time loop. Maybe they put one in the time loop with Zach as a contingency, and Zorian was just in the right place with Quatach Ichl's soul meld.

  >He nervously fingered the cube given to him by the angel he summoned, wondering if he should–

  >No. No, this wasn’t the right time. Using it now would be a mistake. Something in the back of his mind insisted that this was true.

  It's been pretty heavily implied, but now it's pretty much guaranteed.

  Also, where are Red Robe and Quatach Ichl? They're absence is pretty glaring. Maybe they teleported the children away to the ritual site. But you'd think Z&Z would have someone there just in case, so probably not.
  ```

  - u/signspace13:
    ```
    An interesting conclusion, that wasn't what I felt was the case, I feel like an angel would have made itself known if it really did exist, such as when RR mind raped zach and erased himself from his mind. I think it is either Zorian's own latent precognitive abilities working much better outside the time loop than inside, and possibly the angels putting a finger on the scales in that regard. I don't think an angel of any particular strength could be present on the mortal plane for an amount of time that would be needed for this endeavour.
    ```

  - u/-Fender-:
    ```
    Remember that Zorian seems well on his way to capture the Ibasan base, which would mean that the invasion force would lose their connection between Cyoria and Iasku Mansion. They still need to take the shifter children from the mansion to the ritual site, so they need a way to get there. If they can't use the warp gate anymore, then the solution is to bring the children directly closer to the city. but I agree that it's a huge gamble on Sudomir's part, considering that his wife and his life's work reside inside those walls and he wants those to remain intact.

      Don't forget that if the portal closes, he doesn't get souls from Cyoria into his big soul tank anymore.

      - u/-Fender-:
        ```
        He's close enough to Cyoria now for that to no longer matter. Plus, he already got all the souls he needed to make the wraith bombs, so that's no longer an issue in the first place.
        ```

  - u/None:

    I bet it has to do with the soul trap. Wouldn't be surprised if red robe helped him find some use for it during the loop.

  - u/mellowanon:
    ```
    RR has to fight near the primordial since they have to protect the ritual. yhe only problem is that the primordial's release will destroy everything around it. So the mansion could be a safeguard. You teleport all your forces to the city, and then teleport out just before the release.
    ```

- u/thrawnca:
  ```
  So, any bets on what the angel will do?

  - Reinforce the primordial prison, buying ZZ a few vital seconds to break the bridge?
  - Teleport away, following QI's connection to his phylactery, and smash it, causing him to drop dead at a critical moment?
  - Slay all the demons that appeared this time around?
  ```
