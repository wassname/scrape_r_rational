  I just caught up on Mother of Learning. This seems less well followed... but it is long, and I like that. 

  Can someone give me a one or two sentence review/spoiler-free-summary?

    Two people summoned into a fantasy world, each try and change the world for the better. I like it especially because of the tech uplifting by Cato.

    A more realistic approach to economics than usual.

    sorry to deviate, are there any other similar ones (to  Mother of Learning and  A Hero's War Chapter ) (other than paultwister)?

  ```
  Caught up, 20 hours of reading and 3 days later.

  I'm sucker for competence porn, so even if the story has some issues, as others have said, I enjoyed it a huge lot.

  It is very unpolished, though. Once it's finished I hope the author will go through a good editor and then publish it.

  ```
  I like Morey. He's humble and smart enough to acknowledge Cato's contribution to the cause.
  ```
