    I read the first book about three years ago, and I've been meaning to go back to it. I'm sad to hear it's dead

  A man from Earth is taken to a fantasy world. There's a pretty standard fantasy plot about stopping the evil wizard and whatnot, but the parts that interested me were his attempts at uplift, such as spreading knowledge of germs and trying to rediscover the myriad innovations throughout our history.
