## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You have been transported to a different world. Rather than [how it usually goes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInAnotherWorld), this world is pretty minimalistic: it has one indestructible flat surface for a floor, inexhaustible quantities of air, and featureless white sky providing some illumination.

  You're not alone; in fact, a virtually infinite number of people found themselves in this situation alongside you. The entirety of this world is crowded with them, four people per one square meter. Their selection seems to be a sample of general population: some elderly people, some children, mostly adults. Miraculously, they all speak the same language you do.

  (You may also assume that cannibalism-related diseases are conveniently decommissioned.)

  What do you do? Is long-term survival possible?

  ___

  I've found this idea in [a Russian creepypasta](https://mrakopedia.org/wiki/%D0%91%D0%BE%D0%B6%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9_%D1%8D%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82) of all things, and thought that it's an interesting challenge to take on.

  Original story included some munchkinry in the form of convincing people to hold hands and pass on a message to do the same to the person behind them, which created a long chain of people. Using this chain, hand-written messages were transported. It helped organize people, and collect information about the world beyond the horizon (namely, that it's all the same there). Later, similarly-constructed spirals were also used.

  Some additional information: 

  * Yes, there's more than seven billions people speaking English (or whatever your preferred language is). Original story used what is for all intents and purposes are procedurally generated people created for this very occurrence to explain it.

  * People have whatever objects they remember wearing/holding before being teleported there.

  * The story also hinted that people were selected/created for this such that they have basic impulse control and rationality, so that they're more likely to cooperate with organizing efforts and less likely to make idiotic decisions. Of course, it stops mattering after several days, when stress and hunger start driving them mad, but may be important at the beginning.

    Relevant [xkcd](https://what-if.xkcd.com/8/).

    Simply put, if you're unfortunate enough to be in the middle, you're screwed, there's no hope of survival. Only the people on the edges can escape the bloodbath in the center.

    For long-term survival, you will need some way of growing food, otherwise you would simply eat up all the other humans and then starve to death. But the ground is indestructible, so plants can't grow on it (their roots wouldn't be able to penetrate the ground). Luckily, you have plenty of human bodies to turn into soil and manure, and blood to turn into water, which you can then try to grow plants on... and since people arrive with whatever they are carrying, there are pretty decent odds of finding some seeds or grains.

    But that brings us to another problem: there is no sunlight. All you have in this world is a featureless white sky providing **some** illumination. It is unlikely to be enough for growing plants. 

    Hope you left some engineers alive, because you're now going to need them to build some tools and systems. 

    (**Light System**) 

    Build solar panels to collect the dim illumination of the featureless white sky over a massive area of land, so you can convert it into electricity, which you can then use to generate enough light to grow plants on a much smaller area.

    This is actually pretty doable. Since people arrive with whatever they are carrying, that will include a LOT of metals. Keys, wallets, cell phones, iPads, laptops, etc. So if you find enough engineers with the right knowledge/skill sets, they can change those metals into the required solar panels and artificial lighting systems.

    (**Water System**)

    The world contains inexhaustible quantities of air. Question is, what's in the air? Is there water vapour? Is there hydrogen that we can burn with oxygen to create water? If so, then you can use the electricity from the Light System to extract water out of the air so you don't run out of water.

    Otherwise, you're going to need to build a large, airtight dome around the survivors, to keep water from evaporating into the air and diffusing out far away until you have no more water in your new home. You're going to need a lot more building material for this, but luckily, it doesn't have to be made of metal this time. So you could probably use anything from books to clothes to human flesh, after a lot of processing to break them down and turn the raw materials into airtight walls.



    ----------------------------------------

    Once you have these two set up, you're good. Your odds of long-term survival may actually be better in this new world than the old one, since you have inexhaustible quantities of air (mass), a constant source of light (energy) from the featureless white sky, and an infinite amount of space (otherwise we would have been crushed to death by all the infinite air on arrival). So we wouldn't have to worry about entropy or the heat death of the universe.

      Very interesting! I think it may work out in theory.

      What about the practice? How do you manipulate people to go down this road, convince them to listen to you, organize them, ensure that you stay alive?

      Developing all of this and waiting for the plants to grow would probably take several months, during which you would need to ensure that the engineers and the infrastructure aren't threatened. How do you do this, since engaging in cannibalism for at least a short period would probably still be necessary, and the skilled ones are a minority?

      Same questions to u/SvalbardCaretaker, as to someone with a similar answer.

        I am pessimistic for any sort of organized play of this. The people who I give best chance of surivival are military command structures. Soldiers carry weapons, food etc, if you have a pioneer platoon you get a ton of tools. They are used to order, able to fight, and have the survival mindset drilled into them. 

        Other people will survive because they were adjacent to those islands of ressources.

        The composting phase is going to be a huge problem. Without all the specialized flora/fauna corpses rott from bacteria alone, dry out and mummify. The stench is unbearable.

      > Simply put, if you're unfortunate enough to be in the middle, you're screwed, there's no hope of survival. Only the people on the edges can escape the bloodbath in the center.

      It was my understanding of the prompt that there *is* no edge, and the world is either a completely populated sphere or an infinite flat plane.
      ```

      - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
        ```
        It can't be a sphere, there is an inexhaustible quantity of air, so if the land is finite, we would all be crushed to atoms by the air pressure on arrival.

        This means the land has to be infinite, suggesting an infinite flat plane. Then, since the population is only "virtually infinite", as opposed to literally infinite, there has to be an edge to the swarm of people.

      > Once you have these two set up, you're good. Your odds of long-term survival may actually be better in this new world than the old one.

      The odds of you personally surviving for more than your natural lifespan are very close to zero. There are probably going to be a few  scientists that survive the carnage, but it will be a long time before they can start focussing on life extension research and without facilities or access to the collected knowledge of the people left on earth it will take much longer to get there.

      Humanity as a whole does have significantly better odd of surviving long term in this world, though. So I guess that's something.

    80% relevant webcomic, finished: http://unicornjelly.com/uni001.html

    If there is a featureless white sky it gives light that is conducible to photosynthesis, even if its not at sun strength. 

     And if *everyone* from earth is transported there, that means we have a supply of seeds/mud from farmers/gardeners and worms (from fishers). The first seed cycles would be incredibly rough, but it should be possible to get something longterm going. 

    You also imply that there are many many more than the 7 billion people from earth - virtually infinite people! So that means cannibalistic survival is possible until you run into a fundamental limit. Not the 7e9 down to one person limit, but: 

    When people/food density gets low enough that you cannot travel far enough in the additional time one person gets you. Thats kinda hard to estimate, how fast does meat spoil etc. But probably less than 250km before you hit The Wall,  if you are really good with food conservation about 1000km maybe? 

    Unless of couse you secure yourself a more efficient vehicle! Bicycles, skateboards, inlineskates, garbage cans, bureau chairs, child strollers all have wheels and should be plentiful. And the one good thing about living in a featureless infinite plane is the fun to be had on wheels. So your limit stretches. 

    You might even get some form of car going - couple solar cells and electric motors from power tools, hair dries, kitchen mixers etc and you are good to go.
    ```

    - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
      ```
      Cont: 

      So far we thought that food would be the problem, but drinking water is actually the bottleneck. You need to kill and drink about one person every 48 hours! Blood doesnt keep, so thats the actual hard limit. 

      Now lets talk about short/mid/long term "planeology". Water: in 24 hours the entire plane is covered in urine. If the lightspending ceiling has a low finite height in a finely calculated range, we might get some sort of weather pattern and a water cycle with clouds/rain... If the infinite air does *not* contain enough water and the ceiling is too high, all the water in all the humans just evaporates and never comes back. 

      Depending on if there is a heat sink and wether its in the plane or the ceiling, we also get amusing outcomes:  no sink means everything gets as hot as the light emiting ceiling, **sink in the bottom means we actually get perpetual ground fog!** Only sink in the top has a chance of normal cloud pattern.
      ```

      - u/Noumero:
        ```
        This is getting more and more fascinating.

        Wouldn't no heat sink mean that the air would be getting hotter and hotter with time? It's not an issue with an unlimitedly-high ceiling, but would cause problems otherwise, in my understanding.

        The ceiling in the original story did have a finite height, yes (building a hill of corpses to reach for it was a plot point). You're free to assume the same for my prompt.

        I suppose the density of the fog/the clouds depends on the ceiling's height, yes?
        ```

        - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
          ```
          yeah, no heat sink means stuff gets hotter. I am too lazy to do any math but yes, too high of a ceiling means no clouds at all. Too low isnt any good either.

    Survival is possible. It is not worth while. So talk to people until hungry, then suicide.
