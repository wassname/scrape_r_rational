## [D] Some blatant issues in American Society. Thoughts?

### Post:

Just curious, are there any blatant issues in American Society, or Western society in general, that you can see? And, if so, how do you think they could be fixed? Or is there some other reason for this issue, that most don't think about, necessitating its existence?

For example, one of the biggest things that concerns me in the USA is the cost for tertiary education. The cost for tertiary education in America just seems very high, in general. And some people may say "Oh, go to a community college, they're cheap!" but then you have to look at how much worse off you are in competing for jobs, depending on where you graduate from. 

It's not impossible to succeed without a degree, or a substandard one, but on a country wide basis, statistically speaking, there's a clear correlation between salary and the prestige of the school you attended.

This high cost gets even worse, if you need to go further into law school, or medical school, or grad school. Which seems counter intuitive, considering the importance these sorts of positions play in our society today. 

In Europe, costs are marginally lower in a lot of countries. Yes, I know this is usually balanced out by significantly heavier taxes, but it still seems worth it. Despite our capitalism, I think we can all agree that systemic dissemination of the wealth would be a lot fairer, overall. Implementing that is, and always will be, a great challenge though. 

Anyway, I'm rambling. Please comment freely, I intend this to be a discussion thread. :D

  For examples, look at how other members of the G20 or G30 do it. If more than two thirds do it in a certain way, and America does it differently, and particularly if America is the *only* member to do it differently, it might bear further examination.

  For example, the concept that health insurance and employers should ever be allowed to have anything to do with each other, instead of being kept as far away from each other as possible.

  Or the concept of having prices in stores which are not what you pay at the register, because that would generally be considered fraud.

  Or the use of imperial measurements.

  Or medical treatment not being free to all, thus meaning that the citizenry don't need to actually worry about it constantly.

  Or 'news' channels which are effectively pure lies and propaganda being (a) allowed to exist in the first place, and (b) being allowed to call themselves 'news'.

  Or megachurches.

  Or the lack of a national education curriculum.

  Or the blithe acceptance of the existence of American military bases in other countries, without corresponding foreign military bases on American soil. Is there any argument whatsoever which could justify this other than "America is #1 and the best and you have to do what we say or we bomb you"?

    Unfortunately for USAians, there are a surprising amount of issues handled one way, or somewhere on one spectrum of ways, by most G20 countries, and an entirely different way in the United States for the sole reason that America refuses to ever enact *anything* by a clean move from one state to another, instead preferring to force itself to occupy every single possible intermediate state along the way.

    Which also means that where a "hole" or other discontinuity in the topological state-space of policies occurs, America *never* manages to make the jump *at all*.

    You know, like parliamentary democracy, or public funding for elections, or regulatory bodies that *actually do something*.

      Yeah, but the United States is a collection of states with their own independent constitutions and governments. The founding document deliberately makes it hard for federal changes to happen, and the whole thing is sort of held together with bits of wire so that it will actually work.

      In my opinion, the United States of America is more analogous to the European Union than it is to any one other country. People keep referencing America as this monolithic thing, but it was never built to behave like a country in its own right. Giant swaths of federal policy are held together with the interstate commerce clause and some court decisions. And this is probably never going to change, because of Constitutional fetishism.

  The American congress's science committee doesn't get science. It turns out that the jerk who made the infamous "legitimate rape" comment was actually a part of said committee when he did so.

      Sexism, racism, classism all heavily institutionalized. Nationalism/patriotism held as a virtue and taught to children. Regulatory capture. Poverty traps. Widespread harm inflicted on non human life for no good reason other than inertia. Environmental pillaging. The exportation of suffering to fuel growth. The apathy to horrendous but solvable ills in the world, like famine and preventable disease. The deification of gut thinking and the sneering dismissal of careful deliberative thought.

      The fact that *every fucking thing* in our society is a competition, when most social games can be set up to be positive sum. The fact we even see competition as an inherent good, rather than a social tool like any other.

      Maybe we are the least worst option, but it staggers me that /u/eaturbrainz was downvoted in this sub for that comment.

        No.  Sorry, but no.  That would imply that neither Germany, Australia, Canada nor any similarly rich-but-not-American country is the least-worst option.  I'd have to run a bunch of numbers to nominate a specific candidate, but for a simple heuristic, who's got the lowest infant mortality rates, the highest scientific literacy, and the longest expected lifespans?  It isn't the USA!

          Speaking about western democracy in general.

          And even then it may just be that we have had the longest time to get rich, off the backs of colonial subjugation. The rest of the world is catching up pretty fast. Will be interesting to see what form of social structure can overtake the legitimately amazing gains in health, wealth and security we have achieved.

          On that note, even taking USA as the worst of the best on many measures, it is still orders of magnitude better than the best of the best a few generation earlier.

          I think "best achieved to date" is fair, but golly there is a way to go.

      All the things /u/rumblestiltsken said.  But wait, there's more!  The United States makes an ideological fetish of a bloody-minded refusal to solve problems in any way *except* hill-climbing via small steps from the status quo.  It is, in effect, a nation of people who don't believe in evolution, and yet refuse to use anything smarter than blind evolution to optimize their own society.

      Then let's add:

      * Configuring the economy to maximize rents and financial pseudo-profits rather than industrial and informational productivity.
      * The competition fetish has given America a *death and suffering* fetish.  To wit, you are talking about a nation which, when given the option to house the homeless cheaply or jail them expensively, often chooses the latter.  Ditto ditto on many cases of the sick lacking health insurance), and *triple ditto* on the War on Drugs versus legalization (or *at least* a repeal of mandatory sentencing laws and partial decriminalization, leaving it to the good judgement of *trained professional judges* how to deal with offenders).  I repeat, much of the country sincerely believes the cheap and efficient way of keeping order is *just too damned altruistic*.
      * Basic science on ecological issues is treated as tribal and political.  COME ON, PEOPLE!  GAME CALLED ON ACCOUNT OF EXTINCTION RISK!
      * The perverse act of trying to educate more and more scientists and engineers and then *leaving free productivity on the table* by refusing to actually *employ* them at any reasonable rate.  America brain-drains the rest of the world to fuel its research laboratories, and then tosses out the large supermajority of those trained researchers once *actually proven themselves competent* by getting their PhDs.
      * Treating double-digit percentages of the population as *discarded stock* by keeping them in both urban and rural ghettos, neither training nor educating them nor making them productive in *any way at all*, but still paying large sums of money to beat them up for feeling bad about it.

      These are just the ones that come to mind for me.  I think points (2) and (3) are *actually* the strong ones, really.

      My overall complaint is: America really seems to think it has no problems that need solving, nor glories that beckon, larger than bickering over whether Teslas or Hummers are nicer.  As a matter of fact, there are both important problems to tackle around the world *and* awesome glories to be reached, and running an entire society as a single overgrown status contest *instead of handling all those problems and glories* is just a little too "pre-evolved" for me.

      Simple thought experiment, right out of the LW imagination: imagine Fnargl has some goal he wants accomplished, on the scale of a new Manhattan Project.  How does he do it?  Well, why do we keep *deliberately choosing* to run our society more stupidly and *even less humanely* than Fnargl would?

  Democracy is a wonderful philosophy, but in my opinion would never be as effective as a benevolent dictatorship (or similar). Add to that, what most of the 'democratic' world has barely even qualifies as democracy at all.

    Yes, well, that'll be a lovely insight the next time you find a benevolent dictator in your closet.

        Excuse me, I think we need to play "if by politics".

        * *If by politics* you mean organizing the material substrate of society so that everyone can live their lives efficiently, FAI can do that.

        * *If by politics* you mean actual social relations between people, FAI *shouldn't* do that.

        Disentangling those two is going to be tough -- people have a lot of their lives tied up in using bits of matter to relate to each-other.  Besides which, FAI is a long way away.  The most I've seen done to bring it closer was Bostrom releasing *Superintelligence*, which seems to have raised the Very Serious Issue status of FAI from "those cranks at LessWrong think that's a thing" to "that's a thing".

        I'm such a novicey novice at this that it'll take years before I can say, "oh yeah, a specific viable indirect-normativity design would generate an agent that would solve the problem *something like this way*", and even that would be a rough sketch, since you're talking about not only optimizing based on massive amounts of information about society *and* well-approximating lots of computationally hard problems.  An eventual FAI would probably have an advantage in both departments, but I'd bet we'll be surprised by some social problems that really do turn out subject to some hard complexity constraints.

    I don't think moving away from democracy is the way to go, but certainly things could be done much better. I think democracy would work much better if, for one thing, we forced all full time politicians to wear cameras that recorded what they do all day. They'd be allowed to turn them off to go to the toilet or if for some reason there was a genuine national security reason, etc, and the lines would have to be argued about, but just killing privacy for politicians I think would go a long way towards making it easier for people to see who they are. It would also require a pretty transparent bureaucracy, obviously.

    Other measures could include forbidding legislators and regulators from working *for* the companies they have worked *with*, as well as having publicly financed elections and a complete ban on receiving political donations once you qualify for such  support.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      The trouble with "cameras that could be turned off to go to the toilet" is that then whenever politicians want to do smoke-filled-room type things, they will hold those meetings in bathrooms.

      The trouble with "for a genuine national security reason" is that if you allow anyone with any stake in the issue to classify what "national security" is, the scope of "national security" will be steadily expanded to ensure their job security. Furthermore, the act of obtaining a national security clearance (to be able to be a person who can judge what is a national secret) is itself a process that creates stakeholders: the people who can decide what the classification level is for information themselves have clearances and are in well-paying national security jobs. Which puts us right back at the beginning.

      Publicly financed elections are a good idea, I think, on the average - the main trouble is that then you have a sensitivity/specificity problem on the lower side. Yes, the main Democratic and Republican parties (this post was labeled for American issues, so I'll keep assuming American perspective) will field candidates who are shoo-ins for getting money, but what about third parties? How do you set the third party bar low enough to be responsive to new upswellings of public sentiment, while high enough to not give money to frivolous campaigns?

      I'm not disagreeing with the general direction of your suggestions, but there's a decent amount of exploitability here that needs to be grappled with - or at least acknowledged - before I'm willing to declare them the best of all ideas.

    An interesting observation! Of course, a benevolent dictatorship has nothing on a benevolent democracy (or similar) where everybody can agree on the bestest, most benevolentiest leaders to run the country by general agreement and the system is innately resistant to usurpation (due to it's aforementioned "benevolence" attribute). But let's not abandon our inferior non-benevolent democracy just yet! We've still got to examine the very best and most effective of governments: The benevolent anarchy! 
    This is where everything just works out because everyone is already benevolent and government is unneeded in any form. The most effective solution to your government woes.

    Parents can be benevolent and are consider dictators for a good part of their child's life, but that doesn't mean they always know what is best for their children.

    So I think it would be better to have a benevolent, mentally flexible dictator who has both the resources, time and cause to always strive towards making a best choice.

    Ideally it would be a group of dictator/best buddies. People who can make decisions but have enough persons around them, with whom they share trust, ideals and power.
