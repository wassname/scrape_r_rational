  I love this SO MUCH.

  e: By the way, hold on, is that meant to be "marital arts" or "martial arts"? Because in context it could be either.

    I assumed it was clever wordplay & will be disappointed if it was a typo.

    Thank you! It was originally supposed to be martial but I added that in as a pun now.

  >>!I looked down at Kiddo!<

  Why?!  I mean, yes, I get the reason why she'd be useful, but >!you've already had her in much the same position, with her daughter as a hostage, and she attempted to murder you.  Yes, you have her imprisoned, but that has never done more than briefly inconvenience her before.  Why wouldn't she escape and do it again, now that you're in a significantly worse position?!!<

  This violates a whole bunch of Evil Overlord rules, most especially #16.

  Also, handwaving away the part where >!she gets recaptured!< seems both like a wasted opportunity for something badass, as well as a real challenge to maintain suspension of disbelief.  The idea of Bill not dying due to a technicality is one thing; the idea of >!a bunch of mooks standing any chance against the force of nature that the Bride showed herself to be in the movies!< just renders the whole thing nonsensical without some sort of explanation.

    She's the only person who knows the technique.

      As I said, *I get why she's useful*, but honestly, >!this feels like about two scenes in the movie, *maybe* three if there's a flashback explaining how she acquired the skill to do it, before she murders him.  Again.  More painfully, this time.!<

      He has a *very* long time, presumably a lot of money, lots of loyal followers, and the memory of what was done to him, to use to figure out how to replicate the technique himself.  It's a stupid, unnecessary risk to keep the person who >!knows his weakness, has shown an ability to overcome any obstacles between herself and revenge, and *has every reason in the world to want to murder him*, including *keeping her daughter from her* ***again***, in an easily-escapable trap near where he sleeps.!<

      Congratulations, Bill.  You had the chance to become functionally immortal, and instead, added a half hour (at most) to the movie's run time and gave it back its original title.
