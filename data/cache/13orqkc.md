## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  The webcomic [Seed](https://www.webtoons.com/en/sf/seed/prologue/viewer?title_no=1480&episode_no=1) has almost concluded.  All that is missing is the last of three epilogue chapters, set to be released five days from now. It's a very well written AI story set in the near-ish future and it has been recommended by multiple people on this subreddit in the past. You can read it comfortably on the Webtoon app, if you're into that.

  Just did a reread of [Pale Lights](https://palelights.com/), easily one of my new favorites. Found it on rising on RoyalRoad, now I'm giving Practical Guide to Evil (which I had trouble getting into) another shot just because I enjoyed Pale Lights so much.

  Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys death game/survivor type stories with a large cast that quickly gets whittled down, lots of scheming and everyone having stands.

  An interactive fiction game where you connect to what is basically an alien's organic web server, that also stores memories. The story gradually reveals the aliens' unusual life cycle and why they came to Earth. The art style is very cool, but the 3d websites only render correctly on Firefox. Also, I appreciated the commitment to all the buttons being diegetic, but I was "stuck" for quite some time figuring out how to advance to the next chapter. It turns out, once you've visited all the sites needed to get to chapter 2, you need to scan a small barcode that appears in the top left corner of your UI and click advance.

  I read 3 of the Star Wars crossovers that were [recommended in last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/13i96zf/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/jk9mehx). Here a short review for each of them. (All 3 are incomplete but ongoing.)

  - **God Save the Queen**: one of those "worm crossovers" where Taylor gets put into another story but the character isn't recognizable as Taylor at all – rather, the MC is basically a self-insert. The story itself is... okay.
  - **Count of Serenno**: this gets my unhesitating recommendation. The writing is great, the characters are great. It's a Youjo Senki crossover, but the story spends a lot of time with the other characters and fleshes them out well. My only worry is that the plot is moving quite slowly and the author might get burned out before the big things happen.
  - **Overkill**: this is Taylor Hebert thrust into Star Wars done right – she gets dumped into the middle of the Tatooine desert by Contessa and has to fend for herself. The first 19 chapters are really great, but once the immediate danger has passed, the story kind of loses direction and becomes a little generic. A bit sad.
  ```

  - u/Dragongeek:

    >The first 19 chapters are really great, but once the immediate danger has passed, the story kind of loses direction and becomes a little generic. A bit sad.

    This is, unfortunately, a staple of RavensDagger fiction. They have a knack for interesting starts but they quickly lose focus and descend into similar/generic themes a couple dozen chapters in.

    ```
    Oh hey, speaking of Worm/Star Wars crossovers, [The Weaving Force](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-weaving-force-worm-sw-pseudo-post-gm.1058679/) exists.

    Five characters get pulled from parts of Worm's storyline and dumped into Star Wars. Miss Militia from the start of canon after Lung's first arrest, Alexandria from just after she died, and Clockblocker from just after he died in Gold Morning are the first team, with Victoria Dallon right after the bank robbery stuck with post-Khepri Taylor. Pretty interesting so far, some fun butterflies too. First two dozen chapters are the characters finding stability somewhere, followed by a three year timeskip covered in three multi-PoV interludes. Updates pretty frequently too, like every week roughly.

  I've seen it here before, I'm re-reccing it now.  [Slumrat Rising](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/65801/slumrat-rising)

  The setting is a  mish-mash of cultivation, sci-fi, western fantasy, gnosticism, and several other elements.   The story starts out with a young man living with his abusive parents in the slums, desperately struggling to become a low-level employee of the mega-corporation running the nation in order to save his siblings and himself from short and brutal lives.  Things quickly move past that into a direction that I won't spoil too much, but I'm happy with where it's going.  The published summary and title don't really do it justice.

  Other features:

  * Characters actually have character.

  * Dialogue and narration is funny without subtracting from the grim reality of the situation.

  * Setting elements are hinted at long before they are explained, meaning exposition feels like payoff.

  * Action is handled well, exciting without dragging.

  * Many mysterious elements to the main character and setting that are slowly being peeled back in interesting ways.

  * Con: grammar and spelling isn't perfect, especially in the beginning.  But that's a tradeoff you get with...

  * 5-day-a-week update schedule.

  Edit: I forgot to include one of the main points people here might like!  The protagonist actually thinks about his own thinking, noticing underlying issues in his thought process and acting to correct the issue.  He doesn't magically fix his problems this way, but it's nice to see that kind of thing actually portrayed well. It also doesn't happen so often or for so long that it gets navel-gazing.
  ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    I recommend this too! The setting is one of the more unique things I've seen in progression fantasy and litrpg. There's a cyberpunk dystopia using magitech for all its tech, summoning demons and angels is a big part of the setting, but there's also a weird metaphysics underlying reality that we get small hints of here and there. Really, really cool. This is by the same author as [To The Far Shore](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/50836/to-the-far-shore), which is like Oregon Trail in the post-post-post apocalypse with radiation based cultivation.

    I really liked the beginning, but it started going off the rails a bit and jumping from scene to scene too much once he >!joined the military!<. Has it started to get back on track or is it still bouncing around everywhere?
    ```

    - u/steelong:
      ```
      >!Back on track, more or less.  There are further sections that are a bit like that to a lesser extent, but the "main" story is more structured once you reach it.

    Maybe someone can help me out here. There was a fanfic based on Star Wars: The Old Republic, which featured a guy who was isekai'd as a slave who was Force-sensitive.  Gets inducted into the Sith Academy.  He's not exactly Sith, but also not very nice either.

    You could try [Godclads](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/59663/godclads-monster-mceldritchcyberpunkprogression). Protagonist is a ghoul with a taste for flesh, especially flesh that struggles. He has a real hard time not inflicting cruelty on his opponents in the beginning, and from what I hear the story is a progression in the protagonist's morals than just power.
    ```

  - u/steelong:
    ```
    This might be wildly different in tone from what you're going for, but [Speedrunning the Multiverse](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46319/speedrunning-the-multiverse) has a protagonist that fits the bill.

    In a cultivation world, Dorian reached more or less the absolute peak of what one could achieve, ascending to become the Godking of Time.  Other Godkings will relax in luxury at this point, but Dorian thought this was boring.  The rise to power is what he loved more than power itself.

    As a Godking, he was able to reincarnate himself as a mortal while his original body went into a kind of hibernation state.  If he died as a mortal, his real body would be fine.  Reincarnating in this way means finding a body and kicking out their soul, replacing it with his own.  Essentially, he kills a child each time he does this.

    He used this power to do "speedruns" of cultivation, reincarnating and seeing how long it took for him to become a Godking all over again.  Most runs end in death, but he's reached this goal over a dozen times by now.

    While the story starts out with a speedrun like any other, the stakes eventually become much more real.

    Evil and callous is an understatement here.  Aside from having killed hundreds of children through the reincarnation process alone, he takes the "exploit any possible resource to the limits of your ability to exploit it, then move on" approach to cultivation.  If you can make cultivation aids for Dorian, he will get you to make them for him one way or another.  If you can be *turned into* cultivation aids for Dorian, he will turn you into them.  If wiping out a city will let Dorian advance a bit faster, that city better hope Dorian doesn't find them.

    Once again, this is all purely for his amusement.

    Its a more comedic tone than many other "evil protag" stories, but maybe you're into that.

          In terms of translated Chinese webnovels I would only wholeheartedly recommend Reverend Insanity and Lord of the Mysteries.

          Shadow Slave, The Oracle Paths, and Sword God in a World of Mages are also pretty good. I think those aren't translated and just get posted in the same spaces as translated novels for some reason though.

      The protagonist is kind of an asshole, especially in the beginning, but after the first few chapters I wouldn't describe him as callous or evil. If anything, he has a strong sense of empathy guiding his actions even though he's a self-professed misanthrope.
      ```

      - u/kraryal:
        ```
        I mean... he does have empathy, but he also runs down an enemy with his truck *over a several mile chase* and isn't particularly bothered by the mental torture there, and Immolate is still one of his go-to spells even later on. 

        He's got plenty of empathy for his friends and well, designated charity targets, sure. But if you are not one of those, watch out.

  [Valkyrie's Shadow](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/39336/valkyries-shadow) is a story about a Society adapting to a new and powerful Overlord. It follows the lives of a few minor nobles now under the rule of the Sorcerer King a great necromancer. Religions are adapting and undermining traditions In an attempt to be relevant to the populous for the social fabric is being reforged.

  But this all plays within the rules of a fantasy world with bloodlines bringing power, different races existing and new philosophy reflected in daily life. As such, this story holds quite an approach to equality or human rights. It is not that they are dismissed like in a cruel xianxia novel, but the multiple approaches to life that our characters gravitate towards are influenced by the society that they live in.

  In addition, this novel is quite long winded in its descriptions.It does not skim on any Descriptions no matter how truly Relevant. In the extreme, a group of demi-humans get 30 chapters of their Societal Connexions, Economic stimulus and other facets of their community described only to be Massacred. As such, it gives you great insight into what is lost for every Tradition extinguished.

  This is an overlord fic and with more than 2 million words one of the best fics i have ever read. The source material is not required but it helps understand the actions of the movers and shakers. For Overold readers, this is not just more overlord. This can best be seen with how the story treats Ainz Ooal Gown, the comedy of the source material is replaced by tension everytime the story involves him. For minor comments by him can change the lives of millions and this story follows with diligence how one of his musings can change the lives of his citizens for good and for bad.

  It's quite a good story and you should at least try it.

    I tried reading this a few years back. Got about 40 chapters in, just before the end of arc 2, then realised I didn't actually care about the protagonist in the slightest and put it down. Didn't find in particularly engaging beyond someone trying to assemble the background of Overlord into a coherent system, which was kind of novel but not enough for me by itself.

      For the latter request, maybe [Never Die Twice](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32067/never-die-twice). The MC is a necromancer who doesn't shy away from doing necromancer stuff but I wouldn't call him evil.

  Looking for Xianxia recs!

  I'm currently reading Reverend Insanity and fervently praying it goes somewhere, Cultivation that works off mind-raping grass type Pokémon only goes so far as a concept 🙏

  I'd also appreciate it if the so called villain protagonist did anything villainous of note, barring being a snob and stand-offish.

  I really enjoyed 40 Millenniums of Cultivation, and was merely ok with the other work by the same author.

  Ideally I'd like recs that have half-way decent translation, sadly nobody seems to be going around and giving older MTL novels a do-over with say, GPT-4.

  But I'm mostly new to the genre and willing to read whatever is worthy!

    Cultivation Chat Group is my favorite comedy xianxia novel. The translation is pretty good as well. Bit of a slow start, stick with it.

    I also like A Will Eternal for a more typical (but still comedic) xianxia story.

    I'll also tentatively recommend Release that Witch! with a caveat that the translation is DOGSHIT, literally just slightly cleaned up MTL - but I really enjoyed the story.
