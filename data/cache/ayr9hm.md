## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  I'm just really happy that [r!Animorphs will be completed in the next 3 months](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7v232u/it_has_been_48_days_since_ranimorphs_chapter_44/dtrh3ej/). Apparently. Unless *someone* was wildly optimistic, and failed prey to some sort of fallacy involving planning.

  (yes, I remembered that; I'm that annoying)

  My SAD light seems to be doing some good; I've just finished a first draft of a quickie 6k-word story. Is anyone here willing to give me some private feedback on it before I make it public? If so, let me know and I'll send a private message with a link to the GDoc. (Genres: hard-SF, at least in the general direction of rational, and abstract horror.)

    I'd be willing to look over it and give feedback. I usually love anything that you write!

  I am doing a master in mathematical models, which broadly speaking means translating real world problems into math and implementing said math to optimize, analyse, or predict something, and as part of that I will be doing a half year research project. Do you guys have any suggestions to related to that concerns rationality?

    Not sure what your university is like but from my personal experience in my bachelor's I think the topic you choose is not as important as your supervisor: which supervisors are known to be good supervisors, which are known to be bad? Ask around with past students, they will have opinions. 

    I chose a bad supervisor for my bachelor project because he was a good lecturer and regretted it because he wasn't very supportive and didn't review my drafts in a timely manner. A friend chose a bad lecturer and I was shocked at his choice and he said that the reason she was a bad lecturer is because she focused all her attention on her students and as a result was a really good supervisor. 

    Of course I'm now thinking that if this is a six month research project you might not get a choice of supervisor and it might just be more like a paper that everyone in the class submits to the professor? Anyway, maybe someone else will benefit from this advice.

      Thanks for the advice. To be more specific this is a master thesis which have an entire semesters worth of time dedicated to it. While I appreciate the feedback I was really looking for suggestions for ideas for projects.

    I looked into it and the consensus on the "as seen on TV" laser hair removal tools is that they don't work very well and are basically a scam. The thought that convinced me was if those cheap, handheld devices worked every nail salon would have them and try to upsell you IPL with a pedicure. Even the one you linked below, the reviews are *very* subjective and seem to mostly be from people who have only used it a couple of times: plenty of time for the placebo effect. 

    I had IPL done (I think about 7 or 8 treatments) and ~4 years ago and my hair is maybe a tiny bit thinner but not noticeably or conveniently so. I think it's because I cheaped out and got a groupon rather than going to a reputable place: a friend of mine is transgender and she got good results on her face with IPL. Also if you google for IPL horror stories you can see that people end up with horrible burns occasionally due to improper use of the equipment. 

    Basic things about the suitability of your personal hair for removal also need to be considered: the darker your hair and the lighter your skin the better results. I have dark hair and light skin and was not happy with my results, FWIW. 

    I've heard that getting electrolysis is really the only way to go for permanent results, but it's a lot more expensive and extremely slow (as someone basically uses electric tweezers to kill each individual follicle).
    ```

  - u/RetardedWabbit:
    ```
    Any reason you're going the laser route as opposed to electrolysis? 

    From my research at-home is far less convenient (more pain and required repetition) and worse results. Unless you're intending to do very large areas, such as legs, I think the time to learn and inconvenience outweigh the cheaper cost.
    ```

    - u/electrace:
      ```
      Honestly, I had only heard of electrolysis in the [scientific sense.](https://www.britannica.com/science/electrolysis) I'll look into it, thanks!
      ```

  ```
  I recently came across the term "**cognitive revenge economics**", probably in one of the podcasts I’m listening to. 

  Could someone explain what that is? I have a vague notion, but can’t really put that into words…
