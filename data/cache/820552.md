## [D] Interplay between magic system and scientific method, and it's influence on worldbuilding

### Post:

After reading a lot of works featuring some magic system and protagonist trying to take advantage of it, I have noticed that most works don't explore the trait of the magic system which significantly influences the setting - namely how much magic system susceptible to scientific inquiry. 

This is an attempt to roughly classify magic systems by that characteristic, and explore possible consequences for worldbuilding of using magic system from specific class.

* Magic system which is fully susceptible to scientific inquiry or in other words magic is based on some physical laws which is not present in our reality.  Consequences: world where magic and technology are blended. Potential issues: theory of evolution tells us that there is likely to emerge some animals/plants which take advantage of magic, but considering that humanity survived them, humans have to have some additional evolutionary advantages compared with humans from our reality. Example: Mother of Learning.

* Magic system which is susceptible to scientific inquiry, but has varied effects on different humans. Consequences: systematic study of magic is possible but much more costly compared to technology, leading to world developing technology instead of magic. Possible issues: human with/without different powers can produce viable progeny which implies that they are not so different, but on the other hand varying powers give us evidence for there being several different homo sapiens species. Example: Worm.

* Magic system which is not susceptible to scientific inquiry and is separated from the rest of the world which is susceptible to it. Consequences: civilizational split into adherents to science principles and adepts of magic. Potential issues: magic affecting physical laws of nature imply that either magic is just manifestation of unknown physical laws and can be studied with scientific method or scientific method is wrong and everything humanity has discovered with it is nothing more than coincidence. Example: Harry Potter

* Magic system which is not susceptible to scientific inquiry and not separated from the rest of the world. Consequences: scientific method is wrong so setting cannot have any modern elements. Potential issues: lack of scientific method in the setting impair ability of readers to come up with reasonable explanations for any rules in setting, necessitating a ton of worldbuilding. Example: Lord of the Rings.

  Keep in mind that even in the best case, in our world, humans only managed to even begin to really exploit the rules beyond the basic capabilities our species was equipped with.  Basic tools and basic tribal organizations and crude spoken language is all that nature really equipped us for.

  It took hundreds of thousands of years before we managed to accrete enough precursor techs for the industrial revolution.  

  And we still are nowhere close to what the rules imply is clearly possible.  The rules imply that ship of thebes style immortality* and matter recompiling is eminently possible, we just can't do either.

  (matter recompiling - that is, we have a machine that can start with any old rocks and sort it to elements then produce any exact atomic level schematic we want, including additional instances of that machine)

  So a universe with the first type of magic, but magic users just lazily use basic spells or even just spell like abilities is totally possible.  (SLA - crude instinctual uses of magic for basic, cantrip level effects.  like a character with the bloodline of a D&D sorcerer doing nothing with it but occasionally a bit of burst of flame or some slow regeneration healing ability)

  The HP fic I'm working on - I'm trying to do this.

  I wrote a laws-of-physics for the magic system, and then conjectured on why both magical creatures and mundane creatures exist, and why the universe does not look magical.

  Then I went back and tweaked the laws to account for that.

  Having applied the derived evolutionary biology conjectures to humans, I then contemplated how this would affect the development of social structures.

  This then feeds into rewriting and reconciling history from the first civilizations to about 2000 years ago or so.

  Then, I considered how the first attempts to understand magic would have possibly gone, drawing from similar things with regard to IRL science and math.

  This then applies itself to the development of cultures as per the last paragraphs.

  This then gave me a plausible history-path for the development of anti-non-human-sentient-prejudice, and anti-mundane-born prejudice, as well as how the wizarding economy 'works', why the statute of secrecy happened when it did, why Horcruxes are particularly knee-jerk abominable even to 'Dark' families, etc.

  How does Worm count as the second one?

  Not going too deep into spoiler territory, but the "magic" in Worm became a part of the setting in a modern era, after science and technology was already well established with existing natural laws.

  If the "arrival" of its magic happened in, say, prehistoric times, odds are that technology (or even humanity) would exist in modern times.

    > How does Worm count as the second one?

    Because magic in it based on really advanced science and therefore susceptible to scientific inquiry, and each parahuman has unique power.

    > "magic" in Worm became a part of the setting in a modern era

    I am aware of that, but nowhere in my classification I made any assumptions on how and when magic emerged.

    > If the "arrival" of its magic happened in, say, prehistoric times, odds are that technology (or even humanity) would exist in modern times.

    I don't see how that relevant at all - can you elaborate on what you mean by it?

  I'd say that Dresden Files is probably a better example of the second case than Worm, since we don't actually see anyone making headway into understanding how powers do what they do in Worm, and given the way the entities work they probably resist anyone trying to understand them: putting them into the third category for all practical purposes. Anything that operates on some basic rules (eg Harry Potter's say word get magic) is subject to scientific inquiry, and that applies to most magic (otherwise it's just random noise). The meaningful distinction here is whether people can actually make headway in understanding the basic causes behind effects.

  Randall Garret's _Lord Darcy_ series treats magic as the science of the world, and we see glimpses of attempts at dealing with magic scientifically... and also a glimpse of (he's a murder victim, so he's already dead when our heroes arrive in the scene) a psychically blind experimenter trying to develop a purely materialistic science.
