  I wouldn't mind reading a story about Wiley working incredibly hard to exploit the physics of Looney Tunes somehow in order to secure his dinner. Also available for discussion: the ethics of eating fully sentient beings when you're a carnivore, metastuff about how he's clearly a fictional character being tormented by dark Gods for their own amusement.

    [http://qntm.org/coyote](http://qntm.org/coyote) goes sort of in that direction, but it's only a single chapter.

      That is EXACTLY what I had in mind. Amazing. Very sad too. I want a continuation now. Thanks for the recommendation!

    Is roadrunner sentient? He seems very animal for a cartoon.
