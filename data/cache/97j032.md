## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  A fan of portal fantasy and former Boy Scout has decided he'd like to "be prepared" for stumbling into a radically different universe / planet / time period.

  1. What skills might he make an effort to learn or knowledge memorize in the event of a "reincarnated into a new body" scenario where all he can bring along is his mind/memories? (assume he is already a certified lifeguard and has wilderness survival and emergency preparedness skills sufficient to earn the respective merit badges, and is a High School graduate)
  2. What items might he make a habit of carrying on his person at all times for dealing with sudden transport (no time to grab a bag)? (assume he usually wears cargo pants but doesn't want to pack the pockets full enough to be "uncomfortable")
  3. What items might he keep in a daily carry bag/briefcase? (assume the bag also has to carry a laptop, various cords, and any normal day to day stuff for a student/job seeking recent graduate which will supplant anything less immediately useful in real life)
  4. What items might he own for this purpose but not keep readily at hand (at home, in his car trunk, etc)?

  In all cases items that have day to day utility or would also be useful in a more mundane emergency/survival situation are better than anything that's only useful in an actual dropped unprepared into an exotic time/place scenario. 

  Note: this isn't a muchkinry exercise in that the character doesn't actually expect to go to another world so it's less about hyper-optimizing and more about the character might reasonably do without going too far (intentionally ambiguous) out of his way to do so.

    This reminded me of the story of the woman with a repeating dream that she turned into a superhero. [So, at the age of twelve, she made a list of the necessary skills.](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/508/superpowers-2013/act-two-0)

    I haven't put much thought about this, but what about a charger that runs off either fire or sunlight to charge electronic goods, and a USB full of basic textbooks and survival manuals.

    I suppose I'd want to prepare for 3 scenarios: solo survival in the wilderness; survival in civilization where I have a tech advantage; and survival in a civilized, but alien, environment.

    For the first two, I agree with /u/genericaccounter about the kindle, cellphone and [emergency charger](https://www.emergencykits.com/emergency-supplies/radios-and-communication/multi-function-radios/multi-function-emergency-radio-ep-emr1000/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI2JjOlIzw3AIVD5J-Ch0aoQEEEAQYAiABEgIWwvD_BwE).  The radio would let you tell if you're truly alone, or if you're just a ways away from civilization.

    I'd wear long sleeve button-down shirts, with a saturated dye, and a [stitched pattern](https://www.indochino.com/product/eastleigh-navy-dobby-shirt).  If I'm alone, it's nice to have long sleeves to protect me from sunlight and bugs.  If I end up in the past, the unfathomably-expensive stitching marks me as a prince from some undiscovered country.  If I appear in somewhere foreign, I'm wearing civilized, somewhat-decorative clothing.

    I'd avoid tactical knives in case I end up somewhere civilized.  Instead, I'd go with something like [this](https://www.rei.com/product/884528/opinel-no8-beechwood-handle-knife) which is useful but non-threatening.

    For miscellaneous other survival stuff, I'd carry a metal, non-insulating water bottle.  A hat, some sunglasses & sunscreen, a water filter, and a couple space blankets.

    If I was truly paranoid, I'd have a tiny bad with some modern, domesticated plant seeds forgotten somewhere in the backpack.  It would take basically no weight, but having access to modern wheat, potatoes, carrots and the like would be astoundingly useful if I found myself doing long-time survival away from earth.

      Some good stuff here.

      Is the idea behind the non-insulating bottle so it can be used as a kettle? That seems oddly specific and I'm not entirely sure I didn't miss some otehr reasoning there.

  So here is a question regarding weather these creatures are either too dangerous or not particularly dangerous. In this world a number of types of spirits exist each drawn from part of humanities soul. Undead are drawn from life, the animating force, fae are hopes and dreams, angels and demons are selfless and selfish nature respectively. But those aren't the important ones. The final class of spirits, call them wills for now, through that is a placeholder, are drawn from our intellect. Each one is formed within the realm for these spirits. Once formed each one has one utility function. They will complete this at all cost. They are perfect rationalists, and cannot be turned aside or persuaded. However, the following downsides are possessed by each of them. The larger they are the greater amount of intellect they can devote to their task. This tops out at around the level of a moderately smart human. This pretty much means that they will only implement plans that can actually be thought of or understood by me with a sufficient amount of time to consider the problem. They have no other powers. They cannot self modify or merge together to become bigger.They can update their models and metamodels in the event of new data though. They look reasonably human but can always be identified by the appropriate tests. All the information presented above is well known amongst the people who deal with spirits, but since they are the rarest spirit, it is not necessarily understood by regular people. Would these creatures be not as dangerous as regular monsters or horrifying destruction levels?

    They sound less dangerous than humans IMO.

    They aren't any smarter than humans and if you can figure out what they're optimizing for you they become more predictable than humans. They'd also be easier to deter from behaving badly with threat of consequences. So the law should work pretty well for keeping them in line.

    The biggest risks I can see would be people trying to exploit a will and doing it badly (the will that cleans your house was assured by your heirs who hate you that they can cover up it's involvement if it smothers you in your sleep and it knows from observing them they are much less messy than you are), and people mistaking them for a more common type of spirit it's behavior superficially resembles (it turns out the "angel" helping out around the hospital was a "bandage maximizer" and it's been re-opening wounds so they'd need to be rebandaged because it "doesn't count" if you just manufacture unused bandages).

    Mildly worse than zombies, but not as bad as mountain-lions.

    My first comment is that I'd replace 'utility function' with 'goal'.  Utility answers a question like "how happy are you right now?" and goal (/'target function'/'time discounted sum of future expected utility') tells you what you want to have happen in the future.  

    Everyone has goals.  But I'm assuming that these will spirits focus on some specific and clear-to-people outcome.  Like, "dig a hole" or "bask in the fact that this rock is moving at exactly 0.35 MPH".

    Next, I'd note that, while I don't mind golf, I can't convincingly pretend to care about golf anecdotes for more than a couple minutes.  And, like all [normal human people](https://www.reddit.com/r/totallynotrobots/), I'm hard-wired to enjoy conversation.  But wow, extended golf anecdotes are terrible.

    The Will-Demons don't like golf.  They don't care about social interaction.  So, they'd have an even harder time coming up with reasonably comments to fake interest.  Only, Will-Demons would hate *every* conversation topic (+/- one) as much as I hate talking listening to someone's rambling, 30-minute story about almost losing their ball.  

    This would make it pretty easy to spot them, even if they looked perfectly human.  The lack of social interaction would mean that they have resources on the order of a crazy-hobo, or a mountain lion.

    The first couple might get away with some impressive property destruction, but it shouldn't take more than a half-dozen property-destruction incidents for people to hear about them.  And, I expect that the public reaction to dangerous, human-impersonating monsters is that everyone starts carrying pistols.  From I'd expect the backlash to kill way more people than the demons.

    I guess it depends on what their goals are, but I think they're a lot more dangerous than humans. They're as intelligent as a moderately smart human, but they also have perfect rationality and pursue their goal at all costs? They're clearly more competent than humans. Like, I'm pretty smart, but I don't have much willpower, there are many skills I could learn but I don't because I don't find them interesting. That's why I'm not starting a company and taking over the world or whatever. It sounds like the Wills don't have this problem, they'd just go do whatever they needed to do, learn whatever skills they needed to learn with no compunctions for morality either. And I have to assume they'll be good at hiding what they are from everybody else. They sound like super-sociopaths, or something.

    They are intelligent, they would be able to avoid anything which would require them to take one of those "tests" that could reveal them (as being revealed would obviously be contrary to their goals). If they aren't excellent actors by default, they would be able to practice and become so.

    So how dangerous they are depends on what their goals are.

    The other responses right now seem to imagine Wills that are acting very sub-optimally or predictably and would thus be easily defeated. But the Wills are described as perfect rationalists, so the Wills would just choose to... not act like that.
