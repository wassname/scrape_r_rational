## [D] Sunday Writing Skills Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Sunday thread for discussions on writing skills!

Every genre has its own specific tricks and needs, and rational and rationalist stories are no exception. Do you want to discuss with your community of fellow /r/rational fans...

* Advice on how to more effectively apply any of the [tropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic)?

* How to turn a rational story into a rationalist one?

* Get feedback about a story's characters, themes, plot progression, prosody, and other English literature topics?

* Considering issues outside the story's plain text, such as titles, cover design, included imagery, or typography?

* Or generally gab about the problems of being a writer, such as maintaining focus, attracting and managing beta-readers, marketing, making it free or paid, and long-term community-building?

Then comment below!

Setting design should probably go in the Wednesday Worldbuilding thread.

  So, I'm writing a yaoi vampire story and I've realised that I'm missing a heck of a lot of stuff at the beginning that actually makes the couple falling in love, well, realistic / feel "earned". Does anyone have any tips about this sort of thing? 

  The advice I found online seemed to be for the stories where the couple gets together at the end, so it was advice on how they should act during their adventures together and whatnot. But I want my couple to get together at the *beginning*, and the rest of the story to detail how their relationship develops and changes? (Particularly with the difficulties of the human being in love with a vampire / slowly going through supernatural transformations until (spoiler!) ultimately he becomes a vampire himself).

  Also I have no friggin' idea what to use for a title. General tips? I haven't googled that yet so feel free to let me wait until I've actually looked into it a tiny bit.

  In other news I met my beeminder goal, which was an awesome achievement!

    Sounds like a difficult proposition.

    Actually buying into two characters falling in love usually takes a certain amount of legwork; for Readers to even care about the relationship, much less believe it.

    It might behoove you to consider easier options:

    * Characters fall in love offscreen and relationship is fleshed together through a mix of subtext and/or flashbacks (Doesn't seem to work when your characters have a very sparse history. Also requisite of a certain amount of non-chronological storytelling or omission).

    * Characters are forced into very co-dependent situation without yet having much emotional attachment. Like say handcuffed together and forced to work together for survival (Doesn't seem like it'd work for your current situation).

    * Characters fall actually fall in *love* throughout the events of the story. Can begin with intense adoration on one end and inordinate fondness from the other, maybe even mistaken by both to be 'actual love', which bridges into Love somewhere down the line.

    Personally, when I think back to the stuff I enjoyed, Love rings most true when partners have a clear, transformative effect on each other. Actions change, thoughts expand, motives and life views are questioned and re-evaluated.

    Which is not to say it has to be anything monumental. Love is wide confusing spectrum of emotion. Love can be a brisk summer infatuation, an evolving partnership, a lifelong selfish obsession.

    In your particular case, I think to really sell it, you might want to put your Reader in the head of your Lover at a point of inception.  That explosive first impression. That moment of realization. That initial flash of respect, curiosity, or awe. 

    The spark of interest. The *fascination*. 

    * Watching her bury a dead squirrel in the pouring rain.     

    * The way he barely smiled, edge of his mouth twitching a little, as he offered you a chocolate bar under the table.

    * Climbing a telephone pole to claim a pair of sneakers.

    * A quiet hour alone on a bus stop. Shared glances. A nod, a smile, and a note.

    That kind of moment, done right, can sell you on the rest. Frames and buoys it all with a surge of contextual interest.

      Thanks for that - a lot to think about.

      The big problem is that it's a vampire/human relationship, and the vampire obviously has a *very* different cultural context than the human does, and I think if I wrote from the vampire's point of view so we could see what he was *actually thinking*, the relationship would look *awful* purely because a 1500 year old vampire does not see a three month relationship the same way as a human does. 

      The reason for this being an issue, specifically, is because the vampire is the one who has the immediate attraction, but the human (POV character) slowly gets swept off his feet....

      I also am pretty sure my "first scene" doesn't have the type of immediate magnetism that you're talking about. I do a lot of time skips and most of the action happens six months after they get involved, so I don't want to dwell on the courtship more than appropriate.

      I hope you don't mind me thinking aloud here (and if you feel like offering more specific advice, I'd be very grateful!).

      Point of View Character: Red, an American deserter from WW2, scraping together a living doing odd jobs in Rome.

      Love Interest: William, a 1500 year old vampire, once Clovis I, king of the Franks; now, a vampire doing vampirey things. In Rome to view an opera by a famous vampire opera-writer-person. Vampire operas have intricate plots and usually go for days, sometimes even weeks.

      William meets Red when he's working, and offers him a job. William's motivation is that about twenty years ago his last servant died or quit or whatever, and the opera was about a vampire and a human falling in love, and that romantic notion appealed to him so he was like "maybe I should give that a try" and then he saw a handsome human and was like "yes, I am going to try with this human". Red's motivation is that he needs the money. William starts giving Red odd jobs, including something that is important to vampires - scouring market stalls for rare, valuable, or interesting items that can be used as part of their odd gifting culture. Red is very, very good at it, he feels like he has a purpose, and is proud of himself. 

      William is odd; William's friends are odd; but William makes kind gestures (cooks him meals, I want to add a scene where he rents him a room in the same hotel when he finds out that Red is living in a run down place, and another scene where they walk through Rome together and William gives him a sort of tour.) Kind of want to call back to the "tour" after the vampire revelation, with Red being all "So the reason you knew so much about Rome is because YOU WERE THERE?" and William is all "No, it was a great, ancient city when I was young. I finally went here about four hundred years ago and learned all this from a tour guide."

      Another romantic gesture of William's: Red screws up a ceremony, badly, with another vampire. The vampire is well within her rights to have Red killed. William begs her not to, and ultimately kidnaps one of her servants and "declares war" (really: a ritual gifting exchange) on her, which is a big sacrifice for him. 

      Since this is already super long, for reasons I won't get into, they end up breaking up, Red returns home with his sister, and just finds himself drawn to markets and trying to buy the best items he can, as well as realising how settling down and getting a wife and kids is not the life he wants when he could be with William. William had of course decided he couldn't live without Red and had gone to the USA looking for him, they are reunited, happily ever after. (Red becomes a vampire in the third "volume", in c.2017)

        I think I was a bit unclear. It didn't help that my examples tended towards the melodramatic.  

        I was talking more about the scene in which the initial interest is established. That *could* be a first impression, but it could also be years after knowing someone, when a certain event or twist in perspective incites the first bit of interest or curiosity. 

        But feel free to disregard the importance of the above. I think it still holds, but is much less crucial if it doesn't have to be so immediate.

        From what you described, it seems like you'll have enough of a buildup/buffer to establish a rapport and relationship before the dramatic gesture. A lot of which can be established with shifts in their understanding and expectations of each other. 

        To be overly simplistic, ill use hypothetical cut-outs to avoid using characters I'm not familiar with.

        Vampire **A**; Boy **B**.

        **A** can go from seeing **B** as:

            A puppet meant for a self-aggrandizing fantasy -> an endearing pet -> a useful servant. 

        Likewise **B** can go from seeing **A** as:

            An eccentric rich employer -> confident mentor -> mysterious vampire -> elderly lecher. 

        I doubt any of these possibilities are things you haven't considered. But more important than the ways the characters change in regards to how they see each other, is 'how' it happens. 

        I think a sense of natural progress is the most important thing to make the relationship/gesture feel 'earned'. All the better if there are smaller conflicts of personality and misunderstandings that lead to shifts in dynamics.

        Like to use your example of William renting Red a room in the hotel after seeing his run-down situation.

        **B** could be flattered, and see the goodwill of what's being offered, but it could also smell to him of pity. Feelings of defensiveness could grow into resentment when confronted with the daily personal experience of opulence. A sense of distance, the chaff of dependence, and a sense of being subsumed into a life greater than his own.

        When this is expressed or sensed by **A**, he finds it adorable, then annoying as it fails to subside quickly. A thinks of his fantasy of loving a human, and goes out of his way to maintain the relationship far beyond where he'd usually cut **B** away for the insult. 

        **A** offers gesture after gesture of affection, finally opting to give him gifts of the more traditional sort, filled with spiteful affordances and symbols. 

        **B** realizes (because of the reaction of his peers or because of his understanding of his job depending on where this fits into the chronology) and sends back equally biting and sarcastic gifts in turn. Cobbled together from a combination of his meager resources and the materials from the **A**'s gifts to him. 

        **A** is surprised by **B**'s skills, and makes a genuine effort to understand what is going on with B instead of just playing the playful role of a romantic lover. He expresses admiration for **A**'s skills. **A** is surprised, expecting punishment or censure. There is communication/understanding. 

        Situation resolves with **A** paying for his own room and board by his own deserved means, rather than off of his boss's generosity (maybe moves to a less upscale residence). Both ending in different circumstances with rather different views of the other.   

        In any case, it looks like there is plenty of space for the relationship to develop, and tt doesn't seem like they have to be fullblown loving each other by the time the ritual war exchange takes place (which looks to me to be the main point where the question of anything feeling 'earned' might come into question. Like where legitimate sacrifices and vulnerabilities are required). 


        (Sorry if this is mostly unhelpful. It might not even really be what you asked. At a certain point I was kind of just using it as an excuse/exercise to try and explicate my own thoughts for my own sake rather than to help.)
