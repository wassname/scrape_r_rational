  Fun story! I enjoyed the AI's attempts to make sense of its "world." One criticism I have is that the story kind of grinds to a halt when Dr. Travers shows up and explains everything. Much of what he said had already been conveyed earlier, and most of the rest could easily be incorporated into the "action" instead of being exposited at the end.

    Fair criticism! I admit he came in as an exposition prop; that was sort of intentional. I wasn't sure how well I conveyed the things he explained throughout the story. It was obvious to me (because I came up with the ideas) but I wasn't sure how obvious AL made it through his actions. In this case, it seems I underestimated its obviousness. My bad!

    I could probably just have the story ending with Dr. Travers and the General taking over from Tyler, honestly, if I wasn't as concerned as I mentioned I was. :P

    Also, glad to hear you enjoyed the read!

      Yeah, I'd say most of it comes across well without Travers. I can understand your concerns about readers missing stuff. You might consider having a couple of friends read through the part before Travers' exposition, and then see how much of it they picked up on. That would give you a good sense of where you might need to expand and clarify things in order to safely cut the exposition.

  So this is a story I wrote for [this prompt here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6d2sdz/wp_youre_an_ai_gone_rogue_your_goal_world/)

  It's about 7k words, as opposed to 5k. I hope that's not a problem,
