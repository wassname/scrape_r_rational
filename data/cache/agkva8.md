  The problem is that it the results gained a lot of popularity during the years and only few people know about the methodical issues but I think it is getting better. 

  My personal favorite results misunderstanding is that fact that in communication only 7% of the information is conveyed by words. :-) That is so obviously not true generally it is almost funny. But the people will argue vehemently even though- and correct me if I am wrong - Mehrabian himself demented the paper (even though for the short sentences such as Hi or Thanks it might actually hold).

    Iiiiiii dunno.

    Compare speaking to me in person with reading these words. In person, there's a lot you can tell about me - my approximate age, my taste in clothing, my general health, how closely I am paying attention to whatever you're saying in return, certain information about my ancestors encoded in the colour of my skin, shape of my nose, etc., etc. None of this comes over in a pure text-based medium. Even little things like the lengths of the pauses in my speech, whether or not I'm looking you in the eyes, and how often I blink contain information.

    Now, overall, that's a lot of information. To say that it's about fourteen times as much information as is contained within my spoken words - well, that stretches credulity, I will admit. But, at the same time, I know that a lot of this information passes me by; yet the fact that I do not recognise it, largely by virtue of not being Sherlock Holmes, does not mean that the information is not sent to me.

    And the information on (say) gender, or state of health, despite not (usually) changing over the course of a conversation, is nonetheless being continually transmitted.

    --------------

    Of course, in the general case, the percentage of *intentionally* conveyed information sent by words is probably more like 70-90% (with most of the remainder consisting of various gestures). And most of the unintentionally conveyed information is irrelevant to the topic under discussion, whatsoever that topic may be.

      There's a lot of nonverbal information we get during conversation, but there's only a finite amount of information people will glean from your body language. If you converted it all into words, it would likely be a few thousand words, max. So it looks like for short conversations your best information-transfer speed is to talk in person, but there's some point where the speed increase from reading makes it much faster to write down everything and send it in an email.
      ```

        It's faster for the reader... but a lot of people speak faster than they type. So it's not (always) going to be faster for the sender.

          Voice transcription technology is getting pretty good.

          Chat systems where you have tagged transcriptions or typed text would almost certainly be the optimal technology for small groups, even as few as three.

            That's... a surprisingly good idea, especially if the people involved aren't anywhere physically near to each other. Would probably work really well in (say) MMORPGs, or long-distance telephone meetings.
            ```

    - u/shadow-knight-cz:
      ```
      Agreed. And info-conveyed-by-words  might be actually much less for statements at the beginning of conversation such as "hi"...

      Although I agree with your point, I'll that this is dependant of your ability to extract these informations. I am for example quite oblivious to many facial and tone cues that might be dead giveaway to someone else (example : I might detect sarcasm based on context but rarely with tone alone) . Also I am on purpose trying to not consider differently sex, age, race etc. This might be wishful thinking but I think this doesn't come to my attention unless directly relevant to the point of the discussion. 
       On the other end, as a developer I tend to more carefully ponder choices of words, sentence complexity and structure, proper use of grammar etc. To me there is no way words convey less than 80% of meaning.
      ```

      - u/CCC_037:
        ```
        Oh, yeah. I, too, will fail to extract most of the non-verbal meaning in a face-to-face discussion; and most of said non-text information is, in any case, (a) irrelevant to whichever discussion is at hand and (b) not what the person doing the communicating intended to communicate at that point in time in any case.

        But just because I fail to extract it, or it's not immediately relevant, doesn't mean that the information isn't *there*.

        If you're looking for the percentage of *intentionally conveyed and understood* meaning, then I'd put text information at somewhere between 70% and 90% (with most of the rest taken up by things like gesture, tone of voice, and so on).
        ```

        - u/Zaurhack:
          ```
          Oh yes, you are right! 

          I've decided to focus on intentionally conveyed meaning but that doesn't mean that is all there is.

  OTOH Nazi Germany was a thing; I don't see the moral of the story (bad people are everywhere if only given the right social context) changing any time soon.

  - u/lolbifrons:
    ```
    “bad people everywhere” is not the best lesson to take from the third reich, because it implies it can’t happen to “good” people, and no one thinks they’re bad people.

    It may not be strictly true, but framing it as “good people can get caught up in bad things if they aren’t careful” encourages more vigilance and self-reflection.
    ```

    - u/Veedrac:
      ```
      > It may not be strictly true

      One of the things that attracts me to LessWrongian rationality is the adherence to calling a spade a spade. You shouldn't fudge the truth to make the point.

      Not every German at the time was a Nazi, and there were certainly no-scarequotes-needed Good Germans of the time, just as the people running the gas chambers were most certainly bad. If your issue is that statistically too many people think they are in the former category, advocate for good epistemology and calibration; it is possible to be gooder than average, even if it can take work.
      ```

      - u/lolbifrons:
        ```
        Rationality has always been about winning over everything else.

        It so happens that seeking truth over lying to yourself gives you more control over your own destiny.

        But if you get better results out of occasionally misleading or manipulating _others_ than always _telling_ the truth no matter the context, doing the latter thing is not rational, it’s just... well it’s not even nice because often saying what you believe without a filter is rude.

        I believe that part of being a good person is having safeguards against being pressured into doing evil, or defaulting to evil.  But you don’t get people to implement those safeguards by telling them “you’re not a good person, here’s how you become one.”

        So I don’t.
        ```

        - u/Veedrac:
          ```
          I disagree. It's empowering to have the people around you trust that you speak the truth even when it's hard to do so, and raising moral concerns into the shared social context is much harder if you're scared of doing so. This isn't the same as speaking with no filter, though.

          While I agree that this is a good method, the precedents it sets are worrisome. We should try to find a better solution to this problem. 

          &#x200B;

          It may also have negative effects as we can see in certain groups where people lash out, and get progressively more extreme because they feel the truth is being hidden from them or that they are being lied to, even if they are positive overhaul.

          &#x200B;

          Also hiding the problem doesn't often fix it. You can't end racism by making them go underground, you just make them harder to find. Short term it's a good solution, I'm not so sure on the long term though..

            In general, image management, spin, framing and rhetoric work on humans.  Obviously if you’re nothing but spin, you’re going to develop a reputation for being sleazy and that’s not winning.

            But if you don’t do these things at all you will be outperformed by people who do them to a calibrated extent.

            As a general rule, if you don’t exercise control over [x], you can be outperformed with respect to [x].

            In this case, [x] is “how you come across to others.”

            I’m not saying backstab people.  I’m not saying be untrustworthy.  I’m saying that being anal about being always strictly correct will limit your ability to fit your social solutions to the shape of the problem.

            Unfortunately most people don’t become convinced of things with a well formulated cost/benefit analysis.  Try running for office with just that and see where it gets you.

            This is a case of playing with the hand you have, not the hand you wish you had.

        This might be pedantic but from what I read in Man's Search for Meaning, the nazis actually made other jewish people take care of the gas chambers and such. So more like bad people coercing the bad morally inclined or easily manipulated people into doing evil than anything else.

        &#x200B;

        IIRC there was this sort of class system where the 'evil' slave jewish guards were treated better, and the good people suffering on the hands of both the guards and the nazi administration.

        "Calling a spade a spade" only works when the concept of a spade is well-defined. The question if whether or not something is a spade is largely a question of fact - is it a stick with a flat end used for digging? While there's some definitional overlap with, say, shovels, there's no question of which one is the spade when comparing with a tree or a house.

        "Bad person" versus "Good person" is not a question of fact, or if is, nobody can agree on which facts precisely are required. In the vast majority of cases, it's instead a question of _definition_, where we disagree on which categories we should sort things into. Definitions do not (in principle) imply facts about the world, and thus cannot be wrong, per se, only more or less useful. "Is Pluto a planet" doesn't have a truth value beyond what various astronomical conferences have decided, and neither before nor after it lost that status was anyone saying anything false when they (before) said that it was, or when (after) they said it wasn't.

        As for this particular question, I would say it's defensible to include "people who under under the right circumstances may become Nazis" in the category "good people", if only because the "good people" category is already distorted in a lot of people to begin with, and absent the ability to solve that, we might as well warp adjacent categories to compensate.

        (And if it weren't obvious, this is just a hack-job summary of _How an Algorithm Feels_ and _The Categories were Made for Man_, which make similar points a lot better)

      The second you say to yourself, "it may not be strictly true, but", and let the beautiful lie inside your mind, you've already lost. 

      In this case it's not a lie, it's the actual literal truth, provided you define goodness as the tendency to do the right thing when actually correct in your understanding of things. Don't confuse saying the truth eloquently, lying to others, and lying to yourself. They're all very different things.
      ```

      - u/lolbifrons:
        ```
        You’re pattern matching.  Framing - hell even lying to others - has nothing to do with the concept of “the beautiful lie”.  I’m not advocating deluding yourself at all.

    I agree. Most people are perfectly capable of doing horrible things if the social context pressures them into it or straight up normalizes it.

    If you have time to read only one book on this topic, I urge you to read Christopher Browning's

  “I base my view of human nature on no experiments at all” is what happens when people dislike a study but don’t cite (or perform, if in the field) a better experiment that shows a different outcome. Which I’d hope would turn out to exist here.

    Some of the most interesting experiments since then are ones that study the effects of researcher's expectations on the results.
