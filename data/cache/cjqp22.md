  Trigger warnings: innuendo, ponies.

  Status: complete.

  It’s a story about Twilight ascending to godhood. It’s one of those rare gems that’s incredibly well-written, sufficiently ‘rational’ for this subreddit, and still puts the characters and story ahead of any didactics. It also doesn’t treat immortality as a curse, either explicitly *or* implicitly, which is quite a feat, especially while still acknowledging that downsides exist.

  Mostly, I put this here because I read it and I think it’s good fun while also being intelligent enough that the people here won’t just sneer at it because ponies.

    It always cracks me up that ponies are trigger warning :D

      Kiiiind of diluting the importance of trigger warnings, but whatever.

          > Trigger warnings suck anyways, they're either a spoiler or obvious from the title/blurb

          "rated R by the MPAA for terror, violence, and disturbing/bloody images"

            To be fair, that is totally a spoiler if it's attached to something that derives a lot of value from appearing NOT to have those things at the outset.
            ```

              Sure, but they're still useful. They can even be useful in *avoiding* spoilers.

              Before I watch any movies I think might have a torture scene I make sure to check their Wikipedia article and skim the summary to see if they do. I'd probably be a lot less spoiled if the movie just told me "there's torture in it" instead.
              ```

                If you go to a movie's page on IMDB and go to More->Parents Guide then you can see any potentially triggering content the movie has grouped into categories. It's mostly spoiler-free or at least has much less spoilers compared to skimming through Wikipedia's plot summaries.
                ```

          Pretty privileged position to take.
          ```

          It's an inherently complicated issue; if you put content in your story that's both a spoiler and potentially harmful to some readers, there honestly just isn't a good way to ward off the harm without revealing things about the narrative.
          ```

      - u/Lightwavers:
        ```
        I think the "reeeee triggered" crowd has already done that, to be honest.
        ```

- u/Luminous_Lead:
  ```
  It's a good story. Reading along when there were large gaps between updates I admit I lost track of who certain characters were (kind of fitting, given identity is one of the main themes of the work), but I think that problem would be solved by a consistent read-through.  Good fanfiction all-around.
