## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  26 September is Stanislav Petrov Day. 

  Lesser known, and less-celebrated, is 27 October, Vasili Alexandrovich Arkhipov Day. 

  This has got me thinking: Could we create a full [calendar of feast days](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Calendar_of_saints) in honor of people who, in some sense of the word, "saved the world," before having to water down the meaning of "saved the world"?

    12 June - During the Kosovo War, Mike Jackson refuses to take Priština International Airport from the Russian forces currently occupying it, which might have sparked a conflict between NATO and Russia. 

    9 November - Zbigniew Brzezinski double-checks and hesitates long enough, in the face of an apparent Russian nuclear attack, to find out that it was a false alarm.

    I'd been meaning to compile a  similar list but I wanted to include momentous events in human history:

          No I got that, I just meant that this could be a tool to find such events, especially if one needs to populate a full calendar.

  I've been a bit annoyed at fantasy / sci fi species VERY frequently having human posture and walking manner. After having read some human evolution books one thing becomes quite clear, humans walk very strangely. 

  &#x200B;

  Pretty much no other animal walks like us or has a posture like ours ever. It's a pretty unique movement method suited for persistence hunting, but it's worst for pretty much everything else compared to other more common locomotion methods, it's slower, less controllable, more prone to falls and other kinds of accidents etc.

  &#x200B;

  Given that, few if any sentients should move or walk as modern humans do, unless they are related to us. If you want to make a bipedal sentient look at birds and dinosaurs that's the normal bipedal body type not ours.

  &#x200B;

  It feels incredibly lazy and cliche to see +95% of sentient species in fiction being portrayed as humans with masks / make up. On TV or movies where there's budget limitations and special effect costs it's at least understandable but in written word and comics there are no valid excuses. We can do better..

    I sorta disagree, but it's hard to explain.

    The nature of the development of high intelligence through evolution means any species which does it must come from a background where progressive tiny improvements in intelligence were always more beneficial than having a slightly more massive brain was detrimental. You can't have an environment where a high-intelligence niche opens up suddenly and something rapidly evolves to fill it because having a giant, well-networked brain is too complicated to develop quickly. Furthermore, brains are so expensive that evolution does not attempt to maximize their size unless each increment succeeds.

    In practical terms, this means you need some kind of recursively changing environment where becoming smarter means the next generation will also benefit from being smarter. This means you either need some highly unlikely series of adjacent different environments for a species to develop into, or one environment which changes with increasing intelligence.

    On Earth, this environment has always been social. In a social setting with other members of your species, being slightly smarter is nearly always an advantage, as you'll be able to make better plans than anyone else. But this is a runaway process. Once it starts, it becomes self-perpetuating, as the only factor spurring the rate of intelligence improvement is the intelligence of the species itself, and the only limiting factor is food. Which becomes less and less limiting as you get smarter. Which removes the primary evolutionary downside to large brains entirely.

    On an evolutionary scale, this can happen pretty fast. It took tens of millions of years for land-dwelling mammals to become streamlined whales, hundreds of millions for the earliest arthropods to settle into the general shapes we're familiar with today. Gross bodily shifts, streamlined and perfected for new environments, are really slow. But the earliest evidence we have of human-like behavior among apes was only a couple million years ago.

    Our bodies haven't had the time to rearrange themselves to be ideal at what we do yet. Perhaps the most salient example of this is not our awkward, dangerous locomotion, but the birth canal. Our brains literally cannot grow any larger now, and the limit is the width of the hole in the female pelvis. The positive feedback loop which developed human intelligence worked faster than basic things like optimizing reproduction and walking.

    The last bit here is that our ability to walk upright may have catalyzed this positive feedback loop. Communal persistence hunters benefit from higher intelligence, which was apparently enough to start the runaway process. You have to have compelling reasons to stick together and rudimentary planning capabilities to hunt like that, and those are also what you need to start playing social dominance games where intelligence has an outsized effect.

    Taken all together: it is reasonable to assume that the evolutionary process which produces high intelligence requires specific conditions. However, once those conditions happen, the actual development of intelligence can and will outpace the physical improvements which seem "obvious" to the naïve observer. We went from literal dumb animals, to tool use, to modern humans, all in around five million years, and if we don't wipe ourselves out it is reasonable to think we're going to begin colonizing the rest of the galaxy in the next evolutionary eyeblink. This "stupidly designed" body is nonetheless likely good enough to be the one human immortals remember with fondness.

    Which means we can reasonably speculate that all evolved alien species will also have some obvious design flaws in their evolved physical bodies. Maybe it won't be stupidly designed backs and pelvises which limit brain size, but it will be *something.* The evolution of intelligence outpaced the evolution of the bodies best able to wield it in every case on Earth, and it is reasonable to assume that will also happen elsewhere.
    ```

    - u/fassina2:
      ```
      I don't disagree with you on that. Yes other aliens likely have suboptimal physical traits. My point mostly was they should rarely if ever be the same as ours because ours is a very unique scenario that came from a very unique environment and circumstances.

  ```
  I want to talk about a topic I find endlessly fascinating: single quotes versus double quotes. To begin with, here's how I operate.

  If I am directly quoting a phrase that both relays the words and intentions of a given speaker, I'll use double quotes. For example, the universal declaration of human rights begins with "Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world."

  If I instead point out a specific word or phrase, or a snippet from a larger quote devoid of it's context, I'll use single quotes. For example, to point out that the beginning of the UDHR starts with the word 'whereas.'

  If I want to have a multiparagraph-quotation, I'll start each pharagraph with an opening double quote, but only include a single closing double quote at the end of the quotation.

  "This is the first paragraph.

  "This is the second.

  "This is the final one," she said.

  "'And of course, I follow the standard English convention of alternating between single and double quotes when I have nested quotations,' she said," he said.

  How do you all use quotation marks?
  ```

  - u/chiruochiba:
    ```
    Everything you've said regarding double quotation marks is the standard correct method, to my knowledge.

    For single quotation marks, I tend to use them when *not* directly quoting something. For instance, I use them when paraphrasing what a person or group has been known to say (example in the last sentence of  [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/gkaryj/d_friday_open_thread/fqrgefv/)). I also use them as a sort-of caveat for words that embody philosophical concepts with a very subjective, and sometimes contradictory, meaning (i.e. 'good' or 'evil').
    ```

  - u/Sophronius:
    ```
    Please, never use that approach to multiparagraph-quotation. I trip over it every time I see it, and I swear I'm not trying to be pedantic on purpose. It just takes me right out of the story.

    It doesn't help either that a lot of online writers simply forget to end some paragraphs with a quote, either. And then when they do it on purpose, they assume that they don't have to specify that the person from the first paragraph is still talking. Argh!

    The end result is something like this:

    >Steve smiled. "Hey, how are you?  
    >  
    >"I'm great," said Anna. "Actually, let me tell you about my day. So first of all, I went to the supermarket.  
    >  
    >"That's a lot of fun, going to the supermarket, right? Yeah, I think so too. But then, something crazy happened!"

    There is \*no\* reason for this. Okay, I get that you might want to avoid walls of text, but if you really don't want to combine the two paragraphs into one, just end it with a double quotation as normal and add an extra dialogue tag for the next one. Or better yet, insert a short reaction from the guy she's talking to in between the two paragraphs. Surely that would be a better way to break up the text.
    ```

      >Please, for the love of god, never use that approach to multiparagraph-quotation. I trip over it every time I see it, and I swear I'm not trying to be pedantic on purpose. It just takes me right out of the story.

      But... that is the actual standard rule for multi-paragraph quotes in English. You'll see it done that way in plenty of published novels. Amateur writers doing it wrong isn't a good reason for everyone to abandon the correct method.
      ```

      - u/Sophronius:
        ```
        I am of the firm belief that words should serve humans, not the other way around. If it trips at least some % of readers up, that's probably something worth knowing about. 

        Now, if you personally have a strong preference in the other direction, that's fine.

        But intentionally using a style that needlessly annoys readers because it is the "correct" method... that's not something I would recommend.
        ```

        - u/chiruochiba:
          ```
          I wouldn't say that I have a strong preference.

          It's simply like many other aspects of the English language - like using the correct spelling of homophones, or the correct placement of apostrophes in the possessive form of words that end in 's'; any person will be tripped up by it until they learn the standard.

          'It's annoying to people who find the standard confusing' is a really low bar to base your behavior on when the entirety of the English language is full of other rules like that.
          ```

          - u/Sophronius:
            ```
            Listen. It is simply a fact that most stories recommended on this site, even the \*good\* ones, do not have access to an extensive editorial process. If you write a My Little Pony fanfiction and you don't end a line of dialogue with an end quote, your average reader is going to assume that you simply \*forgot\*. 

            I don't care how good you think your MLP fanfiction is, it's simply not reasonable to expect your reader to go "Aha, unlike the last seventeen times I have seen this error, I can only assume that this particular author is doing it on purpose as part of an elaborate scheme to achieve nothing of use whatsoever."

            This is not a matter of me not knowing the basics of the English language, or me not understanding the 'correctness' of your rule. I am just informing the OP of a factor that they might not have previously considered. That's all.
            ```

              Wrong. I expect my readers, and especially the bronies, to be geniuses, and if they aren't, they don't deserve to read my work.

  Has anyone read any Murakami? And what do you think of it? I'm looking for reviews from a /r/rational perspective
  ```

  - u/sl236:
    ```
    Murakami writes beautiful fantasy, but it is difficult to say his works are inherently rational. The setting is often surreal and unstable; the characters are often unsure of what their goals even are, never mind how to achieve them. 

    In this, paradoxically, they are perhaps closer to the real-life experience of the aspiring but not often successful rationalist than many of the ideal spherical-HPMOR-in-a-vacuum style works commonly discussed here :)

  So I had a guy just fuckin' ghost me (leaving me on read) after we'd already made plans for a third date (AT MY HOUSE, *if you know what I mean*, and he'd said that he was interested in that sort of a date). I'm hoping it was just anxiety and he'll come back and apologise in a few days because he was *super short* and I was *so into that* and now I'm going to spend two weeks prowling dating apps for short guys and for some reason everyone on dating apps is more than six feet tall UGH.

  I'm mad that he was rude but I ended up spending the whole night watching reality TV, eating shitty food, and just chilling out and then I slept in this morning so I actually had a great night.

  EDIT: I live in a jurisdiction where covid is eliminated, so we are living that blessed pre-covid life except for our borders being closed.
  ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    Can I ask about how you were willing to arrange for a date during the current covid pandemic? Because I'm not sure where you live, but right now in USA, I consider it to be mildly crazy behavior to go out on a date with a stranger who you have no idea is a carrier for covid or not.

    So I'm just wondering how you stay as safe as possible while going out on dates currently, or are things that much better elsewhere that covid isn't a big concern?

    Also, that guy sucks for flaking out on you without even a text to apologize for dropping out. Good on you for having an excellent night in spite of him!
    ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      I live in a jurisdiction with no community spread for 8 months (i.e. covid is eliminated here), so we are effectively business as normal - our borders are closed. 

      I usually mention it when I talk about doing "normal" things but I was worried it was boasting.
      ```

      - u/xamueljones:
        ```
        Not at all, I appreciate you explaining.

        I understand being self-conscious of your privilege, but you're fine on that account.
        ```

        - u/MagicWeasel:
          ```
          Yeah it's so weird to see all the podcasts/blogs/media talking about the pandemic and masks and how bad it is and we are just sitting here whining that we can't leave our state to go on a holiday. It  doesn't feel real to us, only ever did in feb/mar/apr while we were in the process of eliminating it.

          I feel like I'm missing a big part of "world history", but it's also made me look at other parts of the world and want to scream at them to do a proper, full on, heavy elimination strategy because our state's economy had positive growth this year because our stores/etc were able to open in full in June and have been open ever since.

          And I know we're privileged with our isolation, and everything, but Melbourne went from 700 daily cases in July/August to having 0 cases for the past month, so it can be done.

            This is an impulse being shared by a significant fraction of the world's population right now.
