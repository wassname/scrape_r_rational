## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You automatically know a 'correct' answer to any question you are asked. Specifically, an answer that the ask-er would consider correct at the time of asking. 

  The question does not have to be verbal. When a teacher hands out written exam questions, you automatically know an answer that the teacher would consider correct at the time the teacher wrote those questions. 

  In the case where a question is copied, (like by a photocopier, or by a student being forced to write the same question over and over, or by an internet connection), the 'asker' of the question is still considered to be the person who originally posed the question. 

  Apart from doing really well on written tests, what could you do with this power?
  ```

  - u/scruiser:
    ```
    Can you get questions from collectives?  You could game this power as a politician by answering questions from a collective audience and then telling them exactly what they want to hear.
    ```

    - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
      ```
      This sort of works but sort of doesn't. It would work if the people asking the questions have a correct answer for those questions, but a lot of people will be asking questions they don't know the answers to, so your power would remain silent since there aren't any 'correct' answers.

      Note that the correct answer is not necessarily the same as the desired answer. If someone asks whether you will lower taxes, they will desire the answer of 'yes', but they won't necessarily think that 'yes' is the correct answer.

      So if they ask questions like "What will your fiscal policies be like during your term in office?", your power would be silent. On the other hand, if you can get them to ask questions like "What makes a good politician?" you could get a whole data dump on their political preferences.
      ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    Important distinction: does the person asking the question have to know in advance the answer to the question, or can they simply recognize it *as* the correct answer without specifically knowing that answer was correct ahead of time?

    If it's the latter, there are a huge number of questions that could be answered in math and science, where there are many possible theories but little ability to distinguish correctness between them, or finding the correct solution takes huge amounts of effort. String theory comes to mind, but you could prove P=NP or something like that as well.
    ```

    - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
      ```
      Hmm, you and /u/D0TheMath raise good points.

      I don't think the ability should allow the questioner time to verify whether the given solution is correct, otherwise it would be extremely overpowered. You could just have them repeatedly ask things like "Where can I find unfound treasures?" and then automatically know the locations of treasures since it is easy to verify it by going to said locations. Or even ask "what is the code for a friendly AGI?" then know it because it is also verifiable just by coding the AGI and seeing if it kills us all.

      Intuitively, I want the power to be some kind of limited mind reading, where people who ask you questions also inadvertently have the answers in their minds revealed to you.
      ```

      - u/sicutumbo:
        ```
        That's fair. Maybe the limit could be "verify that the answer is correct within the timeframe of the answer being said" or something similar, to maybe get a few things. You could be a good therapist with something like that, able to give clear answers to questions your client is confused on.

        There are the standard mind reading uses, investigation, anti-corruption, verification of intent when making deals, stuff like that. It wouldn't be particularly seamless, since you would need the people to directly ask the relevant questions, but it could still be useful. I think if you did a lot of searching through records, you could answer various criminal and political questions if someone happened to put a rhetorical question in their speech. "Why would I do such a thing?" and similar. Effectiveness would heavily depend on the person's rhetorical style.

        Oh, you mentioned that the power works through records and copies rather than direct speech. Does it work if the original person who asked the question is dead? You could probably get some historical information that is otherwise unobtainable by doing something like the above and looking through historical texts for people who happen to ask questions that are revealing when you can magically know the truth. May not be particularly lucrative or practical, but it would be interesting. No specific questions come to mind that this power could help with, but given how much recorded history there is, you're bound to hit something.
        ```

  - u/D0TheMath:
    ```
    This may be a stretch, but you may be able to prove that P=NP. Since when someone asks you a question, you automatically output whatever they would think is correct at the time of asking, for NP problems they'd be able to quickly verify anything you output, so the only answer they'd consider correct would be the correct answer, even if they don't know the correct answer themselves at the time of asking. 

    This has a bunch of fun effects ranging from super-fast protein folding to being able to crack any encryption algorithm. All you'd need is someone technically competent enough to verify your solution to ask the question (this reminds me of Watson in Sherlock Holmes).
    ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    Does this work for any written statement, or only ones that end in questionmarks?

    I'm thinking in terms of Fermat's last theorem. A notation scribbled onto the margin of a mathematical paper, giving a result and stating that he had a 'truly remarkable proof' which the margin was too small to contain. (A few centuries later, a several-hundred-page proof was found; but it would still be interesting - and possibly *very* informative - to know which proof Fermat had had in mind at the time).
    ```

  - u/RMcD94:
    ```
    Depending on what counts as "know" it seems like you would be useful to understand the zeitgeist of a group.

    Have everyone write down the exact same question to you say have every history professor in the world write down "How did Hitler rise to power?" and then have all of the questions in front of you and reveal them all at once.

    So read them the same question repeatedly as fast as you can using speedreading tools, since it's the same question I guess you just need to a millisecond to recognise the question has appeared and disappeared before you power kicks in and knows that it's written by someone else.

    Oh I just realised how you can use this

    Detective, police! 

    Force prisoners to write down questions like "Did I kill [X]?" you will know the correct answer even if they don't want you too. 

    Similarly you could tell if something is ghostwritten or something else by having the original author write an identical question as in the potentially ghostwritten thing

  Inspired by the [Wildbow idea of Gilded Lilies](https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/2020/09/17/4-8-spoilers-dossiers/)

  Every two weeks you receive by chance (a mail delivery you didn't order, a loose object lying on the ground, a bird dropping the item in your lap) a magic item. They typically have trade-offs in their usage.   Some are minor with small effects: a bit of luck (with unluckiness for using the luck "too selfishly"), a bit of knowledge (a stone that whispers vague warnings that become audible in your dreams if you sleep with it under your pillow), a small wish, a small curse, etc.  Every so often (about 4 times a year) you get a major one the sort of thing that could make the plot of a horror movie (for the items with more negative side-effects or primarily negative effects) or the plot of a family movie (for the relatively benevolent items: a kid wishes to be an adult, and is changed into an adult just long enough to learn valuable life lessons, or a mother and daughter switch bodies for a day, etc.) or the plot of a fantasy movie (you are transported into a magical land in your dreams, with challenges that mirror your real-life challenges).

  With practice you can occasionally guess at the genre and subvert it: the mummified baby that whispers of your eternal suffering can safely handled with gloves and tongs and locked in a steel box to be disposed of; the lava lamp that grants wishes can be drained of its power with harmless minor wishes; etc.  But some items don't cleanly fit into a genre, some don't follow narrative rules at all, and some may have a misleading genre.

  Some of the more useful items avoid being munchkined too hard: hidden usage restrictions, karmic systems of payback, narrative driven limitations on their application.  But for most items their limits can be worked around and leveraged.

  Avoiding or refusing the items typically results in innocent people hurt by them.  Innocent people are often slow to truly grasp that magic is at work and will latch onto other explanations, even to the extent of believing that the hallucinated things or had a psychotic break.

  As much as the items seem narrative driven, they don't quite cleanup after themselves into neat endings: the kid that wished to be an adult might suffer from a bit of dysphoria when changing back to a kid and the absence of the role he had taken as an adult might send things into chaos.

  Trying to reveal these items to the world see chance conspire against you, the item breaks, the video camera glitches, the video camera works but the resulting appearance of the magical effect looks like bad CGI, etc.

  There seems to be people that know about magic... but all of them avoid answering your questions and at most will buy some of the items off of you or dispose of the nastier items.

  So even with all those limit munchkinry ideas?  Items to prioritize figuring out and leveraging?  Obvious genre traps to avoid (keeping in mind you can't always predict the genre)?
  ```

  - u/Radioterrill:
    ```
    You can't easily predict whether these items will have a positive or negative effect on someone. What you can expect, though, is that they will add some more variance to the life of whoever possesses them. 

    Therefore, you should think of them as a way to distribute variance to other people by sending them an item. People facing long odds would benefit on average from their outcomes becoming more random, while entrenched harmful parties might be brought low more easily if they're affected by unpredictable outside-context effects. Sending the items as anonymous gifts seems like the easiest way to accomplish this.

    As a somewhat cynical bonus, it's probably a lot easier to catalogue the effects of the items and try to predict them if each one is affecting a different person, rather than having to disentangle the supernatural weirdness of having all of them affecting you at once.

  Small power, huge level of control.

  You have the ability to disintegrate anything in a  cube 10 cm (4 inches) in each dimension.

  The power works selectively with great precision. You can choose what to disintegrate, which shape to carve, with a precision of a tenth of a millimeter.

  You must see at least a part of the cube on which you apply this power, and can use it once every 30 seconds. 

  You also gain an approximate intuitive understanding of how matter is shaped inside the target cube, so you can for example vaporize the inside of a lock leaving the door intact.

  Your goal is to gain as much personal power (Intentionally vaguely defined. Money, fame, political influence...) as you can, while keeping your power a secret.

      Wonder how profitable it'd be to go into mining...

      edit: probably not very tbh
      ```

  - u/scruiser:
    ```
    How precisely do you have to decide on the shape?  If I think of a bear or a dinosaur or a bird, will this power fill in the details to carve that shape or do I need the exact dimensions of the desired sculpture?  What finish does the stone take: smooth or rough?  A tenth of a millimeter is some nice precision...

    This is not a particularly valuable application, but easy to conceal and keep secret: pick a semi-precious stone and rapidly make precision carving that can be sold at a decent mark-up.  You could also do carvings made to order for a bit more of a price.  Depending on the exact stone used and the sort of market you find... guesstimating from Etsy prices maybe $5-$10 for crude shapes in non-valuable stones, $50-$100 a carving for intricately detailed carvings in more valuable stones?  Radical Turnip suggested images in glass

    So if you get a huge block to work with and churn through it as fast as your power can work and find a seller that can absorb your full volume (which at your rate of production is actually somewhat tricky, you could fake being an entire sculpture production company)... that is about 120 sculptures in an hour.  At the low end, that is $600 dollars an hour (1.2 million dollars a year if you can manage to sell your full volume), at the high end $12,000 and hour (24.9 million dollars a year).  Not exactly world changing money, but easily enough to fund any intermediate stages of your plans.  Probably enough that you don't need to bother getting paid for assassinations or pulling off heists at least.
    ```

    - u/Worthstream:
      ```
      That's still a very nice profit!

      You have to imagine the shape, but let's say the power gives you a greater artistic sense, so you have an easier time visualizing the shape of a bear, but must still visualize as many details as you want in the finished piece.

      The finish can be smooth if you want, one tenth if a millimeter is small enough to feel smooth to the touch.

    Gambling.

    If you can use your power to gain an intuitive understanding of things within the cube, that is in a sense letting you see through solid walls. 

    It won't quite work for poker, because cards all have the same shape, but there are other forms of gambling that depend on hidden shapes. There's that one game (whose name eludes me) where the host places 3 die in a small cup, rolls them about for a bit and keeps the values hidden to all, then all players can bet on what values the die are showing.  Your power would let you know for certain what values are shown, because a dice typically has concave dots on each face, meaning the shape would be different depending on which side is up.
    ```

    - u/Worthstream:
      ```
      Maybe you're thinking of Perudo. There's also Tokyo, but there you roll only two dice and it's much more bluff and luck based.

      Not sure if there's anyone playing those two gambling real money, however.
      ```

      Is the ink on playing cards thinner than a tenth of a millimeter?

      - u/LazarusRises:

        Doesn't ink generally sink into the material it's used on?
        ```

  - u/D0TheMath:

    What does the cube disintegrate into? If the material is more expensive than water or air, then you can just sell that.

      Standard fantasy trope: "disintegrate" as in replaced by air.
      ```

      - u/D0TheMath:

        Ah. In SF it usually means to turn into a pile of dust or something.

    Do you want nobody to know that anyone has any powers, nobody to know that anyone has this specific power, or nobody to know that you have this power?

    If the first one, you can assassinate a public figure during a speech to a crowd by deleting exterior membranes of blood vessels in their brain. This will cause aneurisms, but if you practice on animals first you should be able to make it so the aneurisms burst several hours after the speech. You could get another one by erasing sections of the pancreatic ducts, causing digestive enzymes to leak into the abdominal cavity, though this would only work if you could see them from behind or if they were very thin. There's a reason surgeons do not mess with the pancreas. You can't do this too often though, and you probably can't use the same method twice, or else people will start to suspect that somebody has superpowers. If you messed hard enough with the wrong polities, they might also be able to figure out that you were the only common denominator in the crowds where these people died, though they wouldn't be able to prove that you did it with just that.

    Beyond assassinations, you can make impossible objects to sell to collectors of curios or projects which need them. Something like a perfectly hollowed out monocrystalline silicon sphere would be impossible for us to make, but trivial for you. Similarly, you could create perfect gearboxes of near-arbitrary complexity out of a solid lump of metal, allowing you to make some very valuable watches to sell to collectors. 

    You could purify veins of silver or gold with very little labor by disintegrating all the non-metallic material. If the deletion replaces the space with air at local temperatures and pressures, you could significantly extend deep-sea trips by refilling your tanks (though at the risk of causing the bends if you don't come up slowly), though you wouldn't be able to stay down indefinitely until local pressure increases the density of air by a factor of six. Interestingly, this means deep sea diving trips can be longer for you the deeper you are, with obvious applications for deep sea construction. This means you could also extend space travel indefinitely (at least the air part of it) by replacing canisters of highly compressed CO2 rich air with cannisters of breathable air.

    ```
    You could get some enormous amount of money and fame by doing fine art. You could do some really cool stuff, like a near-transparent bubble of rock around a tiny physics-defying panorama. Gotta pray to RNGesus that you get the attention it would need though.
    ```

  - u/Norseman2:
    ```
    Do you have to be able to directly see a part of the cube, or would indirect vision through a camera, mirror, or fiberglass periscope work as well?
    ```

    - u/Worthstream:
      ```
      Directly, but very long distances work as well. Something on the horizon is a valid target.
      ```
