## [BST] The Revan Challenge

### Post:

**Spoilers for Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and associated sequels, spin-offs, etc.**

*Congratulations! You've just won the Mandalorian Wars and ended the greatest threat to the stability of the galaxy since Exar Kun!*

*But wait, what's this? The Mandalorians weren't just blood-thirsty warmongers itching for a fight? Mandalore the Ultimate was under the control of a hidden Sith Empire? And the Emperor's on his way to stir things up? Your assassination attempt failed? You've been sent back to make the galaxy ready for the Emperor's arrival?*

*But wait, what's this? Upon returning to the galaxy you were able to break free from the Emperor's control? And now you want to make the galaxy better able to fight the vastly superior Sith Empire ASAP?*

*What ever shall you do?*

If you're not terribly familiar with the Star Wars universe or The Old Republic era in specific, this is roughly the scenario which faced the Jedi Revan after he broke with the Jedi Council to intervene in the Mandalorian Wars.

In canon he plays along with the role of converted and conquering Dark Lord of the Sith despite breaking free of the Emperor's control and treats the Galaxy with some tough love in order to whip it into shape to fight the Emperor when he gets there.

Things get squirrely when he's betrayed by his apprentice who doesn't quite get the "pretending" part of "pretending to be Dark Lords of the Sith" and he ends up getting memory wiped by the Jedi Council and pitted against his former apprentice in a bid to stop the imminent conquest, since the Council has no idea of the threat of the Emperor. If you want to play hard mode, maybe pick up things from that point instead.

**Assets:**

* The Revanchists: A breakaway faction of Jedi Knights who followed Revan into the Mandalorian Wars, serving as Generals and strike troops alongside Republic regulars
* The Star Forge: Massive orbital space station which is able to construct ships, droids, and other material by siphoning energy from a star which is then directed by a force user of sufficient strength, though it will tend to corrupt and darken the user
* The Republic: Although battered, the Republic army has a tremendous amount of gratitude and loyalty towards Revan and the Revanchists. Enough that when Revan declared his war in canon, the defectors were able to man the Star Forge produced ships and weaponry to fight the Republic loyalists on more than even ground.

**Obstacles:**

* Malak: Your apprentice who commands loyalty and respect among the troops second only to yourself and has eyes on conquering the galaxy, whether he has to overthrow you first or not
* The Jedi Council: Although the Revanchists and the Republic troops who fought with you are very loyal to you, the Council has huge influence over the Jedi who remained neutral in the Mandalorian Wars as well as the civilian Republic government. They've labelled you a traitor to the Order and demanded you submit yourself to them for judgment.
* The Emperor: For our purposes, the Emperor will be arriving in ~300 years. Enough time that say, a reformed Galactic government would be stabilized if you got it in place early enough, but not so long that you're likely to stomp out all resistance and dissent; or for significant technological breakthroughs to be adopted throughout the Core Worlds, but probably not throughout the Outer Rim.

If there are any other assets/obstacles that you're familiar with in canon, or which plausibly must be considered, feel free to utilize or deal with them as you see fit.

  Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

  In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

  Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

  “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

  The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

  Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

  Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

  L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

    Don't forget to track down and recruit Kreia, I'm fairly certain she would approve of most of this and she'd be extremely useful.

  Open up communications with the highest levels of the Jedi Order, explain where I'm coming from and that we're secretly on the same side.

  Incapacitate Malak. Probably the best thing to use would be that mind-wiping thing. He's Dark, so presumably not too good a precog; short-term spidey-sense is one thing, but the risk of a full-blown vision is pretty much impossible to work around when designing a trap. Still, the Force is on my side, right?

  Use the Star Forge to build robot miners and engineers, with attached security force and a few ships. Send them to an uninhabitable planet (Droids don't need to breathe and can endure extreme temperatures); have them make more until they have enough to colonize another planet. Exponential growth will make me the most powerful faction pretty quickly.

  The Star Forge should be operated by my minions, who will preferably agree to be mind-wiped afterward if it's cheap enough. No point letting my brain get fried by the Dark Side.

  How much do I know about the Emperor? Not much, right? Because the easiest way to deal with him would be to send some Terminators to kill his grandparents in the future.

  Hmm, 300 years is well over the lifespan of a SW human ... Holocrons! Phew, I'm immortal even though death will cost me my force powers. Actually, can I just make a bunch of holocrons and make copies of myself in charge of everything important? That would be a huge timesaver.

  The only way to deal with inevitable prophecies is to make sure they happen in a way that is congruent with your goals. Maybe make an invisible task force that monitors potential Emperors and tries to keep them from being genocidal maniacs. Also, we do have cryonics in this universe (carbonite freezing), so Revan should be able to stick around for the event if he wants.
