  Really appreciated that they skipped the rest of the lair, it was unnecessary minor stuff and allows the story to continue on to the actually important things. I was cynically expecting this chapter to be the rest of the lair and was pleasantly surprised.

  Carten really is surprisingly intelligent. One of Rain’s biggest boons(he sure has a lot) was meeting one of the rare unaffiliated tanks and becoming good friends with him. The lore bits about the Threat tree is really cool and shows that there’s more to this world than meets the eye. Tanks are super important and Rain was incredibly lucky to have a relatively powerful Tank to support him all the way to here.

  Dozer is unironically one of the best characters in Delve. No cringe-y dialogue that slows the pace of the story, and is a cute slime. I really do wonder what’s the deal with him though. It’s very obvious that his existence is eventually going to serve some important development, and he’s starting to get pretty smart too.

    I'm pretty sure Dozer's whole thing is that he's a blank slate exposed to prolonged Winter. Maybe we'll see an evolution or something.

    I agree the decision to skip the rest of the dungeon was good.

    I don't think that currently Carten is all that different from the dime-a-dozen 'dead-end' defenders. To date, he's been solely focused on upping survivability, just like the rest of them. His *future* plans to branch out into Taunting would set him apart, but he hasn't started on those yet for lack of levels.

      I got the impression that his defender build is uncommon.

  I wonder if Vanna will go for an uber bureaucrat build.  It seems pointless to awaken her to throw fireballs.

  Did they find a blue yet

    Only level 5

    yes

  I really enjoyed this chapter, I always enjoyed metha commentary on team composition, especially when you apply common game knowledge to a phantasy world.
  ```

- u/sohois:
  ```
  So of the 7 slots, two are healers, two are tanks, but they didn't really specify the other 3. Presumably one will be the debuff support that was mentioned, but I wonder if any will go to worker classes
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I'm confused how the party for the blue is only 7 but for the core it's 8. Shouldn't it be the reverse? 8 mundanes could easily murder a tied up dog but I don't think 8 mundanes could safely get to the core even with the Dungeon at 0-1%. Remember that long cold stretch, I'd think Rain would need to play escort there.
  ```

  - u/The_Flying_Stoat:
    ```
    Presumably the dog is at the end of the cold stretch so that would be an issue when killing the blue. Not sure how they'll get 8 people to the core.

    ```
    I wanna believe there are plenty of others who have figured it out that just don't advertise it to monopolize higher level power.

    Rain revolutionizing the world with knowledge that anyone who played D&D for 5 minutes would have doesn't feel good because it's not a real accomplishment on his part, it relies on the world being stupid.
    ```

- u/TheColourOfHeartache:
  ```
  This is my favourite chapter in Delve so far. I think all LitRPG authors should be made to read Rain's speech about party compositions.
