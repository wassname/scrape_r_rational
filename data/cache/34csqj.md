  Here's a link to the first chapter:

  This chapter was late. I'm currently writing the next one as a bonus chapter to make up for it. I'll probably link to it in this thread when it's up, which will be soon.

  Quite the interesting story, I shall be following it. I am sorry but I do not have time at the moment to give an in-depth review but I will say that I am enjoying Charlie and his narration of the world around him.

  Nice. I admit I'm not sure what this part is about:

  >A mix of frustration, anger, bewilderment, and several other emotions was flashing across Alyx’s face faster than Charlie could keep up. Charlie began to chew the inside of his lip.

  >Alyx fumed for a moment before taking a deep breath. She slowly asked “Are you being deliberately annoying?”

  That might be intentional, if we don't yet know why Alex would react so, or it might be I missed something :P
