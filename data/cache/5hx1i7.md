## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  A little while back I mentioned I was working on an "intro to rationality" post.

  I finally got some revisions done, and [here](https://mindlevelup.wordpress.com/rationality-101/) is the link to its current state.

  If you have any suggestions / edits (which would be very welcome!), [here] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1spH6cEI72k7XTrTeknTQ_DZMN2aDEGdsuZbRkP-OlRs/edit) is the Google Doc link that allows commenting.

    >Once you start reading up on these errors, it becomes easy to catch yourself making them.  

    It does???? When does that start?
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:

      I would probably change that line to "After repeatedly reading up on these errors and engaging in discussions about them, it becomes possible to catch yourself making them."

        Cool, thanks for the thoughts!  I can make the edit to avoid wrong implications.

    I think what the writer means to say is that it becomes easier to notice when one has made such mistakes and which specific mistakes were made in retrospect. Reading about cognitive errors isn't enough to make you better at catching yourself making them. For that you need practice.

    I'd try and add more content under each bullet point. Not too much, but a few could use a few more anecdotes.

    Hm, re: the periodic reminders to post on Mondays, would a reminder service like [Boomerang] (http://www.boomeranggmail.com/) be enough to help you out?

      It's more of an emotional thing, that someone actually cares enough to read the post than forgetting. I don't forget the stuff, but if no one expresses interest I won't put effort into it. If I get substantial responses to these posts it'll provide enough motivation to keep going. Seeing responses to ketura's Friday posts is enough to keep me posting here for now.

      I'll probably even formalize the post format a bit before I'm done to make it easier.

        I remember reading once about how people's brains turn off when they're handling notifications or questions that they've handled before.  The example was a tech support person standing right next to someone and telling them that, when this message box pops up, click B instead of A, but when the message box came up the person clicked on A anyways because that's what they've done in the past.  Their thoughts never came into the equation.

        I've experienced this myself with this alarm software on my computer I've set to remind myself to, among other things, get to bed at a decent hour.  Even though they're incredibly intrusive, I've long since memorized exactly what it takes to make them *go away*, and it's a rare day I even remember they said something.

        The downside, to these alarms, then, is that they're easy to get rid of.  I don't make the alarm telling me to go to bed go away by going to bed, I make it go away by clicking on the right button, and I'm back to doing what I do.  If you ask someone to pester you, not incessantly, but periodically, to get the post done, that would function as an alarm that you can only stop by doing what it's telling you to do.  Having it come from someone you don't want to disappoint is even better, since it cuts you off from trying to circumvent the system by ignoring the PMs.

        Good luck.

          Couldn't have said it better myself

          >Good luck.

          Thanks.

    This sounds pretty cool!  Looking forward to hearing about it as you progress

  I have a six year old half brother. He is showing an interest in how things work. Picking apart toys and remotes (often breaking them), asking about where lava comes from, etc. What's a good Christmas present to stimulate such interests?

  He is also unsure about whether Santa is real, but has come down on the side that it's better to believe and get toys for sure than to deny him and face some risk of not getting toys. This I find funny.

    I liked K'NEX when I grew up. They have tremendous flexibility to create fantastic mechanisms. I made a car with a working suspension and a retractable roof of my own design from K'NEX. I'd never have been able to do that with Legos without dedicated parts.

      Definitely second k'nex. Though I just always built towers with them

    I know many wouldn't want to give a child that age a computer game but of all the influences I've had to become an "aspiring rationalist", an old educational game was certainly the strongest. The game by itself didn't turn me into one, of course, back then Less Wrong wasn't a thing, the game didn't turn me neither into an atheist, nor a skeptic, nor any other label you might have a name for. But it woke within me love for science, wondrousness regarding the Universe, and how it runs.

    I'd give you a link and would recommend you to acquire it without skiping a beat, but as it happens it was first launched in 1996 (its first installment in 94), only available through CD-roms, and in Brazilian Portuguese; it doesn't even have a Wiki page. In a rough translation it was called Galactic Ranger 2: Prisoners of the Green Tribe and was about the galactic ranger, who cruised space alongside his robot (the comic relief). They fell in a planet inhabited by walking plant-like superstitious creatures, with primitive technology, and were made prisoners.

    In order to advance through the game the player had to solve scientific problems from the most diverse fields. Those involved concepts such as photosynthesis, greenhouse effect, combustion, air density, etc. The cool part is that those weren't done as if in a quiz popping up on the screen, those tasks were embedded naturally within the game. The robot provided tips when you got stuck but due to a "hardware failure" wasn't very useful.

    What I spent the most time checking, though, is a "galactic encyclopedia" which you could access from the main menu. In it you could learn about the big bang, galaxies, stars, supernovas, black holes, neutron stars, and so much more, not in a boring, text-like way, but by watching hilarious conversations between the ranger and his robot, accompanied by animations.

    I still remember when I was 10 years old, discussing with a classmate in school about the origins of humanity, he was pretty sure it was God, I told him we were made out of elements generated within stars, released upon their deaths. Coincidentally we were in a science class and he told the teacher what I had told him, she looked at me as if I were an alien. But anyway, I'd recommend you check FUN educative games if your brother is interested in tech.

      That game sounds awesome. I'll certainly look to see if I can find a game that sounds fun and educational.

        Kerbal Space Program would be a good one if he shows interest in space and rockets and so on. It gives you the freedom to make or break things as you will.

      Likewise, as a kid, I played the Castle of Dr Brain which was a good educational adventure game by Sierra. I think point and click adventure games can actually be really good for kids, there's little to no violence and the games are purely focused on the story and solving the problems that are in the way.

      Humongous entertainment (the company cofounded by Ron Gilbert the creator of Monkey Island) released a lot of good educational adventure games for kids that are a good introduction to the genre. They're available on Steam.

      BTW, I'm curious what the title of the game is in Portuguese.
