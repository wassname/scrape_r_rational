## What time of day (US Eastern standard Time) are new mother of learning chapters released?

### Post:

I'm new to MoL, but a big fan. Recently I marathoned through chapters 1-82 in about a week.... Only to be let down last Sunday when I found out the next chapter had been pushed back a week until today. 

Woke up bright and early this AM only to find change 83 had not been released yet though.

I know I'm being impatient. I don't know how you guys who've been reading along every month for the last few years have done it!

  You also have to let go about needing to read more. The thing with the author, is that he's consistently updated about 9k words every 3/4 weeks for years. This is crazy compared to many online fics/fanfics, which just die or are unknowable when they'll update (eg. Dungeon Keeper Ami).

  So ultimately, you need to find other fics to satisfy your /r/rational cravings, and suddenly recall MoL when it gets updated. And if you do forget exactly what happened, all the better! You only get maybe 5 rereads at most because of spaced repetition, which is unfortunate. So enjoy it as much as you can!

  A fic with a similar premise is [Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid), which is a Naruto fanfiction. Don't worry about knowing the characters for that one. It ends up doing some really cool stuff regarding looping, but definitely has some really fucked up (torture) parts, which kinda sucks, but was good enough for me to ~~get through~~ devour it.  
  It has some really cool looping and magic type stuff that I literally haven't seen anywhere else, which is why I like it so much.

  Note: it's pretty unrepresentative of other Naruto fanfiction.

  Another looping fic I recommend is [Purple Days](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/) for the ASoIaF (Game of Thrones) series. It's cool, not really because of the magic, but because the looping character is Prince Joffrey (who, if you don't know, is a horrible person). He gets better, and becomes someone I can root for, after the first arc.

  I can't really think of other particularly good looping series that I can think of, so you'll have to deal with other stories. I've liked most things recommended on this sub, so just look through, and give them a try, even if they don't sound great, they probably are. This sub has high standards.

  Also, another one of my favorite fics is A Hero's War, which is **the** magic uplifting story. It satisfies my need to have cool stuff be done with magic, experimenting to get to that point.

  You can check the times when the links to all the chapters were posted to get a rough idea. Hover over the "6 months ago" to get the exact time.

      Also the author pushes back chapters alot so with the next projected chapter it might be pushed back another week (rarely two weeks). So its mostly 1 chapter a month which can be torture for new and old readers
      ```

      - u/sicutumbo:
        ```
        Without looking at the stats on posting times, I think he only pushes back chapters about half the time. Frequent, but it would make the average only about 3 1/2 weeks between chapters.
        ```

        ```
        This one has already been pushed back once; the original expected date was the 1st.
        ```

  ```
  I always check Novel Trackr.
  https://noveltrackr.com/novels/view/mother-of-learning
  It always seems to be around ~7pm EST.

    ```
    This is a very cool tool, thanks for sharing. Does anyone know if there's a similarly-purposed *mobile* app? Doesn't seem to be after a quick search.
