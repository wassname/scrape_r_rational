## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  What are the requirements to be able to cross the Atlantic and Pacific oceans? Like could the ships of the Roman republic do it or some other ancient people? Was it a problem of navigation or the ships themselves?

    Around 1000 ad, Viking explorers sailed all the way to America, and found a settlement there. The settlement only lasted 2 years, because between the unforgiving wilderness and the worsening relations with the Natives, there was just no point in staying.  


    Similarly, Chinese explorers were very close to actually discover America before Columbus, and could easily sail to Australia, but there was nothing there they would need  


    Ancient and Medieval explorers did not seek virgin land just to settle: they wanted new land that would be relatively close to established trade routes, had some natural resources that can be exported, and robust population to conquer, enslave, or at least trade with locally.  


    Prior to 1500s, there were no technological or agricultural means to make remote wilderness an useful colony, so such colonies were rarely attempted. Roman, Medieval European and Chinese ships were more  than good enough to sail across the globe, there was just no point to it.  


    It was only after European empires grew powerful enough economically to send tens of thousands of people to Americas and Australia, and have hundreds of ships going to and fro with ore and grain, then it become economically viable.

    [Thor Heyerdahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor_Heyerdahl) did a certain amount of research into this matter, building boats using primitive techniques and local materials and then trying to sail them across the Atlantic or Pacific.

    *Kon-tiki* (1947) was a raft that he sailed halfway across the Pacific on, and *Ra II* was made from mainly papyrus reed, based on ancient Egyptian designs, and crossed the Atlantic to reach Barbados. (There was a *Ra* as well before *Ra II*, but it ran into difficulties and the crew had to be rescued).

      **[Thor Heyerdahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor Heyerdahl)**

      Thor Heyerdahl (Norwegian pronunciation: [tuːr ˈhæ̀ɪəɖɑːl]; 6 October 1914 – 18 April 2002) was a Norwegian adventurer and ethnographer with a background in zoology, botany and geography. Heyerdahl is notable for his Kon-Tiki expedition in 1947, in which he sailed 8,000 km (5,000 mi) across the Pacific Ocean in a hand-built raft from South America to the Tuamotu Islands. The expedition was designed to demonstrate that ancient people could have made long sea voyages, creating contacts between societies. This was linked to a diffusionist model of cultural development.
