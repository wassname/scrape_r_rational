  Sam and DASI walk the tightrope--how fast can you change things, even for the better, without a disastrous response?

  Here's a bit of non-spoilery puzzle:  DASI had to tell Black Swan about the board meeting discussion.  Why didn't Black Swan already know?  She has both ability and motive to monitor it herself.
