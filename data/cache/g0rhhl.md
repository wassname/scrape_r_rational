  is this really rational ????

  i read it up to a point and it seems like the usual fare

    I think it is - or at least close enough to not keep it outside the gate.
    ```

  - u/sheikheddy:
    ```
    The setting is a munchkin of the "summoned heroes" trope. The protagonist is pretty obviously in an altered state of mind so that excuses some of the more questionable decisions.
    ```

      My problem is that Guilded Hero  **isn't** that. It pretends to be a rational world, but in practice it's just a world of grimderp. 

      Everyone has stats, they know that stats are required to gain the all-important skills.  The main character spends 2 weeks before anyone even *asks* what his stats are.  As far as I can tell from reviews which follow after I dropped the story, it keeps this up the entire story.  Eg, why they don't even *try* to max out summoned heroes.  

      The story seems to confuse dark writing for deep writing.
      ```

        Ugh and then in this chapter a scribe attempts to teach the main character how to read the local language.... by having him copy pages of text. Over and over again. Onto parchment. Without any sort of translation or explanation. So now the MC is just copying gibberish *without knowing what it says*. 

        The scribe is described as being unwilling to teach the main character and having to be ordered into it against his will, but this is absolutely ridiculous - literally anyone (including the baron who ordered these lessons) should understand that this is *not an acceptable way to teach reading*. 

        And the main character is just taking it like an idiot, instead of going to the Baron and saying "hey dude, your scribe is wasting both of our goddamn time and a shitload of parchment".
        ```

        - u/Veedrac:
          ```
          He's teaching like that because that's a major way learning works in this world: brute repetition. That's been pretty well established.

          It's plausible, perhaps likely, that more earthly methods would work better, but it's completely reasonable for people to have latched onto the first-order effects.
          ```

        - u/BaggyOz:
          ```
          The MC being a Hero could factor into the method. The scribe doesn't want to teach him and heroes have a reputation of magically picking up skills once they do something enough.  Looking through that lens it's not entirely stupid even if the chapter is still pretty stupid.

          I'm not even going to touch on how the whole hiding behind a door thing got hand waved away. It feels like the author doesn't have a plan of how things are going to go.
          ```

        - u/AStartlingStatement:
          ```
          Its game mechanics. In Everquest you would get people to spam paragraph after paragraph of languages you didn't know until words started making sense.
          ```

      - u/ironistkraken:
        ```
        Its explained in the story why they dont spend a bunch of reasources on every hero.

        \>! The empire can just keep summoning heroes so there just a resource. The heroes get a broken ability to train faster but they arnt equal as a group.  Some take a lot less time to gain ability.  At first all heroes used to be given years of training before war.  But since stuff like massed arrows or catapults or magic pretty consistently kill heroes its not worth it to train all of them for years.  Only the really talented get more time to train while the inferior heroes get sent off to just be one more body in the army.  And then it explains they cant be mages because if they were they could end up killing the empire thats using them as soldiers. !<
        ```

        - u/xachariah:
          ```
          Again, I'm saying these are rationalizations and not rational.  

          It costs them literally nothing to say "Hey, what's your stats?  Cool, strength guy use a sword.  Dex guy go use a bow."  10 seconds and it would be *faster* in that initial week.

          The short time training is also a poor excuse, since the bulk of the army aren't heroes and literally everybody who's in the army and *not* a hero got more than one week training.  It costs the same amount to train a peasant for 4 weeks and train a hero for 1 week, or to do it vice-versa.  Except that the other way around gets you vastly better returns since it's training for a hero.
          ```

          - u/ironistkraken:
            ```
            Thats a good point.  I concede. I can only think of a couple or reasons someone would not just ask for the stats and none of them are good (or mentioned).  

            I think at this point it might be trying to be rational but failing. IDK if that necessarily disqualifies it form being on this subreddit.
            ```

          - u/123whyme:
            ```
            I mean, I think the whole point was that there was a battle and they didn't care enough about the hero's to NOT put them in the battle. So instead of training for ages they just shove them in and hope for the best.

            tbh it seems plausibly rational to me, we don't explicitly know how classes are chosen or what the empire needs, so you're making an assumption when you're saying that what they do isn't the best method for them.
            ```

      - u/Veedrac:
        ```
        Nobody asks what his stats are because it largely doesn't matter. You try everything you're allowed to try (aka. not magic), and you either pick something up or you don't. You don't want to specialize before people get their class specialization.

        idk what you mean by “they don't even try to max out summoned heroes”. They do; they just do it by throwing them into war and seeing who sticks. You might be thinking about keeping a more elite group in reserve and levelling them less dangerously, but given the logistical issues of handling kidnapped soldiers, the downsides of not having combat experience, and the fact the empire is in a panicked crunch, it makes sense that they wouldn't.
        ```

        - u/xachariah:
          ```
          I was under the impression that skills/classes have statistic requisites, so some hero who got summoned in with 100 dex would shoot a bow for 15 minutes and unlock their skill(s) and become a great archer or something, and someone like the main character with 5 dex would spend all day plinking arrows and get nothing.  

          Or are you suggesting that either of them has an *equally* likely chance of unlocking a bow skill from the same amount of time shooting?  And if they both happened to unlock the same skill, that they would be *equally* useful with that skill?

          Because if both of those aren't equal, then they ought to have customized training regimes based on stats.  It takes no more effort at all.
          ```

          - u/Veedrac:
            ```
            I was under the impression that stats were a first-order factor, but that other factors were similarly important.

            Most people have roughly average stats, which means that doing a bunch of everything gives them the best chance of unlocking whatever they're best suited to, which might not be what their stat suggested, while serving to round out everyone's baseline stats.

            It's true that people with poor stats in some areas might be practically locked out of certain classes early on, but people with valuably-high alternative stats will generally unlock their wanted class early anyway, and for the rest it makes sense to round out their missing attributes.
            ```

      - u/Brell4Evar:
        ```
        I've enjoyed it quite a bit. The pacing on updates and MC progress has been uneven - update schedule being very excusable due to current events.

        The thing about [heroes] are that they're apparently a dime a dozen, and if incapable of getting a martial class, they're thrown away. >!A pair of them were even sacrificed to fuel the spell that teleported John to his mercenary company.!< Heroic casters are problematic in the extreme for the king who summons them.

        I can understand how not liking the setting can get in the way of enjoying a work of fantasy fiction. A non-rational world, however, doesn't disqualify writing from being rational. It's the main character's motives and actions that matter here.

        This being said, John doesn't yet seem to have much agency. I think we'll see this change soon, and it will be that much sweeter when he gets his moment. >!The attempt to steal the knife from Karen was pretty frustrating because he finally seemed to be acting on his own goals, impulsive though it was.!<
        ```

        - u/xachariah:
          ```
          HPMOR doesn't have a rational world.  It's fine for a world not to be rational.

          But if the world isn't rational then the characters should be rational.  And as far as I can tell it's not the MC.  And it doesn't seem like it's any of the other characters.
          ```

          - u/Brell4Evar:
            ```
            What do you feel would make the MC more rational?
            ```

    - u/IgonnaBe3:
      ```
      I guess i dont find the munchkin scenario all that interesting
      ```

  - u/ironistkraken:
    ```
    I think its close.  The writer is trying to show at least at first that the MC just wants not be hunted and killed / having to be a solider which is a pretty big ambition for the world he is in.

    Its more of a realistic take on the isekai genre.

- u/efd731:
  ```
  So.......... is there a reason the MC doesn’t speak now??
  ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    because if he said *literally any words at all* he could resolve this stupid thing with the scribe
    ```

    - u/Brell4Evar:
      ```
      > Speaking and reading, it seemed, were two entirely different things, and I quickly learned Neriah had little interest in my knowledge of English. My efforts to show him such, only seemed to anger the man further- and his attempts to remedy that "problem" were down right brutal.

      He *did* try speaking to the [scribe], and the guy was as much of a tool as ever.
      ```

      - u/IICVX:
        ```
        I didn't mean to the Scribe, who's an uncooperative asshole. Saying "I'm literate, just not in your language" to the _Baron_, instead of just gaping like a particularly illiterate fish, would have put limits on the Scribe's bullshit.
        ```

        - u/Brell4Evar:
          ```
          I respectfully disagree. Said baron doesn't care about the particulars of John's literacy and delegated it to the scribe.

          The baron also made it clear he was willing to kill John for no reason whatsoever, and in fact nearly did so.

          The MC justifiably considers him to be a venomous honey badger.

          That isn't to say the MC's lack of agency isn't annoying; it's annoying as hell at times.
          ```

    - u/efd731:
      ```
      i was aiming to be rhetorical lol but yeah, i agree 100%
      like nothing is preventing him from writing out his ABC's and asking the scribe to compare it to his language.

      unless the next chapter reveals the whole "world-swap" removed all knowledge of english from the MC than this chapter is just....lazy filler

        See the quote elsewhere here. The MC did exactly this.

    He tried. Scribe got angry at him.

    "Speaking and reading, it seemed, were two entirely different things, and I quickly learned Neriah had little interest in my knowledge of English. My efforts to show him such, only seemed to anger the man further- and his attempts to remedy that "problem" were down right brutal. "

  Put your steelman theories of why the Scribe teaches the way he does here.
  ```

  - u/nohat:
    ```
    "Scribe" sounds like a class dedicated to (copying) writing. So to get someone to have that class maybe they force them to just copy something over and over, so he assumes he can force the Hero to do the same until he gets a skill or something. Basically he's trying to skip straight to the end because no one illiterate ever becomes a scribe normally.

    Still crazy, since writing without reading is useless to the baron. MC should really threaten to complain to Baron -- a bit MAD considering the Baron's mood.
    ```

    - u/Brell4Evar:
      ```
      The [scribe] may believe he holds more leverage over John. Alternately, he may just decide to take John down with him. If threats get leveled, he may proactively complain to the [baron] himself and get John beaten or worse.
      ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      Yeah no it's complete nonsense. The Baron ordered the Scribe to teach the MC how to read, not how to scribe. 

      I don't know why he hasn't complained to the Baron yet - if nothing else, they're wasting a shitload of parchment. Back in the day you wouldn't practice your letters on a sheet of paper, you'd practice them on a [wax tablet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wax_tablet).
      ```

      - u/Brell4Evar:
        ```
        Skill acquisition may happen faster with parchment, or may not happen at all on wax. In fact, there's evidence to this effect. From [4 - Training](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29286/the-gilded-hero/chapter/441146/4-training):

        >There was no practicing with wooden weapons, or with dummies, or anything of that sort.

        It looks like whoever set this system up was a fan of learning by doing.
        ```

  - u/Brell4Evar:
    ```
    He's pretty clearly doing what he knows will (eventually) get John a skill.

    In a world where armies are power, martial skills - and how to teach them - are better understood. (With the benefit of hindsight, Kepler was a true gem of a man.)

    The [scribe] is clearly an *utterly crappy teacher*. The problem is that the [baron] has nobody else remotely capable of the task.

    Compounding this is the problem that the [scribe] isn't apparently training John to be literate; he's training him to be a [scribe], a class that grants literacy as a side benefit. John's personal efforts to decipher the language are critically important. If the [baron] gets himself a [Hero] [scribe], he'll probably kill John in a fit of rage.

      > If the [baron] gets himself a [Hero] [scribe], he'll probably kill John in a fit of rage.

      Probably also the scribe's off-hand.
      ```

  - u/kevshea:
    ```
    Before the invention of the printing press, books were extremely valuable commodities. Literacy was rarer. In-universe, these two factors combined mean it's not worth it to make books that teach reading. It's more commonly done in person, sketching characters in sand with a stick or the like.

    The Scribe, as he's protested, ain't got time for that shit, but he's gotta get results anyway. As the main character has literally never seen these characters yet, and doesn't know the words associated with their sounds, he can't tell him "this is A, it makes an 'ah' sound." It'd probably make things worse.

    But there's no better way to get better at recognizing characters than staring at and reproducing them a ton. And, as our protagonist has a rote skill learning buff, and the Scribe doesn't want to waste his time... He's set him to work waiting for "Writing Lvl. 1" to ping.

    Also he wants to make more copies of whatever this text is and it'll be easier and less painful on his old arthritic hands to edit the protagonist's shitty chicken scratch than to copy it himself.

    That's my attempt.
    ```

  - u/natron88:
    ```
    He seemed to be learning well on his own after the Scribe left. The desire for independent study and the ability to start recognizing words were facilitated by the Scribe's unpleasantness and the forced repetition respectively.
    ```
