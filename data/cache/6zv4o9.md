## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  Anyone up for brainstorming spells? I'm working on a system whose spells (1) are usually minor and even niche in utility and (2) require rituals to perform (meaning that there's set-up involved in casting magic and you have to plan ahead). I've got ninety or so spells so far, some pretty good and some pretty bleh, and I'm hoping that the subreddit might get me thinking in directions I haven't considered yet. 

  Examples of what I've got so far: 

  * Drop individual thoughts in someone's head (nothing more complex than a couple of words, so this is best for emotions or very simple concepts), once every few seconds for as long as the ritual is performed.
  * Notice if someone is doing that (or something similar) to you, or has done so recently. 
  * Call animals (mouse-sized or larger) to your location, with extra work to fine-tune it what you're calling (usually down to a particular species, but one magician uses it as a lost pet finder). The animals aren't controlled by the spell, just called, so beware of calling e.g. bears. The ritual must be performed for as long as it takes the animal to arrive, and the animal will not forgo food or sleep, or enter into danger, to answer the call (so expect delays if it isn't reasonably close already). 
  * Temporarily revive a dead person in order to ask some questions (but be quick about setting up, because you're talking to a decaying brain, not an immortal spirit). 
  * Transmute blood into a multicolored substance that doesn't really have any practical purpose, but makes for a hella neat oil paint. 
  * Immediately learn where your keys are.

    * Appear in the dreams of everyone sleeping in a several mile radius.  However, their memories of the dream will usually be vague unless they wake up while it's ongoing.

    * Turn lead into gold coins stamped with the enchanted runes of a bank.  You can use this as currency, but the runes will instantly alert the bank, and you'll eventually have soldiers trying to arrest you for counterfeiting.  Creating gold without the runes is easy, but as a result, isn't used as a currency except in distant lands where the spell is unknown.

    * Take a spirit from limbo, and trap it in an animal body.  You can't specify which spirit, but most were alive in strange alternate universes, so if the resulting intelligent animal is cooperative, you can often learn about scientific or magical discoveries unknown in your own universe.  Most familiars are created with this spell.

    * Restore ruined buildings and furniture to the height of their grandeur.  Restoring entire large buildings is very time-consuming, so you'll sometimes see wizards living in single opulent towers emerging from the ancient ruins of a palace or temple.

    * Continuously perform a ritual that allows you to go about your daily life- eating, sleeping, working, even performing other magic- but which constantly requires some very strange behaviors and complicated taboos.  While performing this ritual, you won't age.
    ```

      Nice. The last one provides an interesting character concept as well.

      I like this one. I feel like it has potential as a self-insert uplift fic. You travel to a fantasy realm and have the goal of getting them to industrial age or further, but are hindered by being a rat or something.

    * Place in your mind the optimal route to a destination within a short distance (optimal as conditions are RIGHT NOW), probably on foot or horse
    * Place a magical "cryptographic" signature on a piece of paper or flat surface, identifying the person who cast it (or whatever alias they use)
    * Send trash to the local trash dump, probably requiring a source of heat as input
    * Determine when blood was last spilled in a given location
    * Create a signal that will be placed into your mind (or someone else's) at a specified time/date. Like a reminder notification, or delayed information transmission.
    * Clean dirt and other muck off your shoes (but only shoes)
    ```

    - u/callmesalticidae:
      ```
      Thank you! I like the reminder notification the best. It'd be very useful. Depending on the minimum time delay required, it could also serve as an instantaneous communication system.
      ```

    * Temper a piece of steel. Takes a few hours but if you know what you are doing for it can make the most of a piece of metal or much easier to ruin the temper on an item. While I like crafting/industrial magics that aid or replace a crafts person their use in a game can be limited. Dry wood, harden clay, fix cracks, connect/cut two pieces of similar fabric, and so on can be game relevant examples.

    * Control Fire. Can control a fire to make it burn hotter or colder using more or less fuel respectively. The fire can also be directed like it was in a moderate wind. The effect lasts until the fire burns out or the ritual is stopped. But by adding small amount of specially prepared powder can cause colour changes, images to appear in the fire, to burn with no smoke, to be extinguished, or other magical effects. Each effect takes its own unique powder. The larger the fire the longer the preparation required.

    * Preserve food. A set of symbols drawn on an object to preserve the organic materials within, the final rune seals the object and will be broken when it is opened. Most commonly used along side other methods of preservation as it extends the shelf life by half.
    Some magical ingredients cannot be used with it as it changes their nature while other alchemical recipes require such treated reagents.
    While it is the same ritual to preserve a body for funereal rites most people are not aware or do not talk about the overlap.

    * Drive out vermin. Spread the smoke from incense over an area by walking through it. Once all the incense has burned small animals and insects will be driving from the affected area and will typically flee some distance if able but are only prevented from returning until the incense has dispersed. It can be used anywhere but wind will quickly disperse the smoke rendering it ineffective or requiring large quantities of incense to be quickly burned.

    * Find north. An object will align itself with north as it floats. It must be able to freely move such a leaf floating on calm water or a feather falling in still air. There is a companion ritual that lets you set a large object as a companion by inscribing runes on it so you can choose to have it point there instead. The ritualist either needs a specially prepared "needle" or a copy of the central runes from the companion.

    * Cure a specific disease. Each disease requires a different ritual. An example might be to draw water from a blessed well each day at noon to wash yourself and then throw the water into the ocean at midnight. If any water is spilled or uses that bucket other will contact the disease as well. Best to burn the bucket once done.

    * Create a ritual area. Designate an area to confine a ritual to. Draw a circle, scatter ashes, sprinkle holy water, cast a spear into the middle of a battle field, travel a path while bleeding between dusk and dawn, or what ever. There is a lot of room to play around with this one and likely a number of variants for different groups and uses. Possible effects 1) other spells effects are stopped from entering 2) rituals conducted within it can expand to cover the whole area 3) Rituals cannot affect or leave the boundary 4) only those permitted can freely use magic. I took inspiration from Shawdowrun's wards and D&D's Guards and Ward spell.

    I had an image of a wizard running down a path in the woods trying to cover all of the ways to his home dripping blood before he is caught. Then being able use other rituals to hid that path from others, scry his enemies along it, call up the plants or animals to attack travelers on the path, and otherwise use it to defend himself.

    * Lose an object - If a person has an object on them they will lose it. Forget to pick it back up, put their keys in an odd place, or dropping something while fumbling in their pockets. This can be targeted at a particular item you are familiar with, can see, or just to make a person generally forgetful about a few items of opportunity. The target will be forgetful of or maybe not recognize the affected object until shortly after the ritual ends but another person can remind them about it normally.

    * Calm an animal

    * Protect you from the sun or keep you warm. Spells for general protection from the environment.

    * Crate a ping. Set a specific condition or name a person and when it is around you you know it has happened. A specific ritual or effect used against you, that asshole Bob is near by, the fire had gone out. You don't know any specifics, just that it has happened within the limitations of the ritual.

    * Break a spell. Stops a spell from current effecting you and gives some protection from that spell affecting you again in the near future.

    * Spell resistance. Makes a talisman that provides some protection to you from spells and breaks when it fails to protect you. The stronger and more magically resistant the materials used to make the talisman are the better it works. The maker can choose to shatter at any point and time that they wish to. Or maybe it protects you from everyone but the maker.

    Do you use sympathy and contagion in you system?

    * A ritual to see if an antidote will cure a poison, it does not tell you what the antidote is only if the ones you have on hand will work. Takes a minute or two to start but once going can check different cures quickly.

    * Was a particular weapon used to make a particular wound? The connection between wound and weapon lasts a couple of weeks for an inanimate weapon and a dead body but less for living tissues, if cleaned or disturbed, and can be broken by ritual cleansing.

    * Keep a person alive. Connects a person to a living organism such as a tree or their bodyguard so they share life. You will last longer and be tougher but are still most definitely mortal. This can be one sided in a recipient/donor setup so the recipient does not suffer over much from the donors injury or shared equally between them.

    * Write a victims name and a curse on one side of a tablet and you name and grievance on the other side and place it in the drink. This can be as general as a well or as specific as a wine jug. As long as the victim has drunk from it, the tablet remains in place, and the spirits that govern these things find you grievance true the victim will be cursed.

    * Rituals to cleanse yourself or break you connection to a specific item so things do not trace back to you.

      Oh wow. This is a lot. Thanks! 

      On preserving food: what if only the safety and nutritional value of the food is preserved? It may, therefore, putrefy or otherwise get icky, but still be perfectly nourishing and safe to eat. (I tend to make life awful for my characters, as you can tell)
      ```

      - u/TJ333:
        ```
        The idea of a rotten corpse still maintaining it nutritional value is kinda a disturbing one.
        The idea that only the under taker knows this and may one day have to make use of it is even more so.
        ```

  - u/semiurge:
    ```
    * Become pseudo-synaesthetic, with senses not being mixed once you experience them, but in the experiencing itself. For example, you might see scent trails in the air rather than simply perceiving smells as colours, or gain 360° vision by swapping your senses of sight and touch and "seeing" through your skin.

    * Determines the shape a plant will grow into over time. Doesn't make it grow any faster, but saves you the trouble of binding it into a shape, and grants finer control to boot.

    * A charm which prevents insects from stinging/biting you for a duration.

    * Makes your teeth supernaturally hard and sharp, and strengthens your jaw. Biting people is still an inconvenient way of attacking them though.

    * Seals a door/window/other sort of portal in a closed position with force equivalent to a mundane bolt.

    * Lets you perceive an illusion overlapping another person which displays what they looked like when they were younger.

    * Temporarily makes a material less brittle, preventing glass/ceramics from shattering easily, among other things.

    * Render a container airtight.

    * Decrease the heat conductivity of a piece of ice.

    * Gain a birds-eye view of your immediate surroundings at the same resolution as your regular vision.

    * Imbue a piece of paper with a simulacrum of life, allowing it to move about and follow a limited list of simple instructions. The paper is only articulated along folds made in it when the spell was cast.

    - A basic illusion, clearly distinguishable from reality because only the outlines of the object are visible (like a wireframe). Won't fool anyone, but useful for a mage who needs a visual aid or to draw runes in the air. Fades over the course of several minutes (depending on humidity) or pretty instantly if it comes in contact with water. Theoretically lasts forever in a vacuum (or literal zero humidity).
    - A null ritual. It does nothing, but it remains a ritual (albeit a brief one). Always succeeds.
    - Another null ritual. Also does nothing. Always fails.
    - A ritual that specifies two other rituals and succeeds if and only if exactly one of the two specified rituals succeeds (i.e. it fails if both rituals fail or if both succeed).
    - A conditional ritual. You would need to first perform the conditional ritual, specifying the conditions; then the (a) ritual; then the (b) ritual. If the conditions are true, the (a) ritual activates; if the conditions are not true, the (b) ritual activates. (One of the null rituals may be used as either (a) or (b) if desired). Conditions are limited to what could be discovered by scrying (i.e. can't depend on anything magically shielded or that has not yet happened). It also can't read thoughts very well.
    - Scrying. As long as the ritual continues, you can observe an image of the target in a bowl of water. Sound is not included (but you can attempt to read lips). The target image cannot move, relative to the ritual. (Not-so-wealthy merchants entering into sensitive and secret negotiations will often do so in a moving carriage to prevent being scried on. Wealthy merchants will hire anti-scry spells. Wealthy paranoid merchants have anti-scry wards placed on their carriages.)
    - Anti-scrying; no scrying spell can target inside the area of the ritual. Scrying spells targetted outside the area can still look in; this is therefore usually extended to an area a little bigger than a sealed room.
    - Charge transfer; electrons are magically attracted to or repelled from the target, causing it to develop an electric charge (and the surrounding area to develop the opposite charge). Famously used to defeat the Invincible Black Knight in a severe (nonmagical) thunderstorm.

    Maybe you should set up a discord for this like you did when brainstorming superpowers for that story you wrote? I remember that discord being extremely entertaining.
    ```

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    Do you need line of sight for the first one? How do you specify the target? Do you have to/can you even specify a target for the second one?

    Spell ideas:

    - Save the current state of the universe, or receive Red or Blue.
    - Destructively restore the last state anyone saved, sending them your choice of Red or Blue, or know that no saves exist in the past.
    ```

    - u/Loiathal:
      ```
      I don't mean to pooh-pooh these, but 

      > usually minor and even niche in utility
      ```

      - u/vakusdrake:
        ```
        Yeah plus time travel to the past is the sort of thing that if you include basically forces the entire rest of the setting to be about it.
        ```

      - u/Gurkenglas:
        ```
        If many people know about the ritual and it is simple, it is in practice almost useless, since you don't know who sent you back the color, and jumping back might only undo a few seconds.

        A big council of mages can probably put enough weight behind their intended use of the spells to gain enough divinatory information to pump enough money out of the stock market to keep running.

        If the world starts out casting more of the first spell than of the second, but eventually starts casting more of the second than the first, that will keep time trapped around the point where they are cast equally much, until the world is outcome pumped into casting the first spell more, but from the perspective of the "last" timeline this is just another Fermi paradox, perhaps with some bits in the past that are about as important as Prophecies.

        The setting might be *warped* to look different than it otherwise would, but the average citizen or protagonist might not think about it much, much like IRL most people don't care about AGI, even though our setting is about it.
        ```

    - u/callmesalticidae:
      ```
      In general, you do not need line of sight for any ritual, and specifying the target (if there is one) can require anything from a lock of the target's hair dipped in their blood to simply holding the idea of that person in your mind.
      ```
