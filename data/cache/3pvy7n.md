## Information based magic. Memetic and anti-memetic.

### Post:

Was thinking about the possibilities of a magic system based on information. 

Let's stay classic: medieval setting and only a restricted group of indivduals can do magic.

We need to 

**1.** Brainstorm magic spells.

**2.** Chose what we like.

**3.** Define a set of hard rules for this magic

**4.** See how people on the setting could abuse them.


So far I got:
High level spell "Antimemetic field": People forget about the user a split second after seeing them. It is a more powerful invisibility.


A travelling memory: You have the plot of this awesome book that when written will be amazing. You can't sleep at night thinking how awesome it would be. But as soon as you tell the plot to someone else you can no longer remember the details and the listener is the one now plagued by the plot.

Maybe the spells need to a ascrifice of information to work: Like you lose the memory of your mother, or youneed to bring a living human whose mind will be totaly wipped clean.

P.S. What are good SCP to take inspiration from?

P.P.S. Basicaly I'm thinking about a hard magic sytem around memetic SCPs.

  Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

  In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

  Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

  “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

  The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

  Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

  Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

  L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

        Hmm. You could make it so that the more widely known the unsolved riddle or secret is, the more power that can be gained from it. Maybe it steals processing power (or something) from the corners of people's brains, and devotes all that power to the one who knows the secret's answer. That would encourage people to pursue risky strategies.

  I think Charlie Stross's "Laundry" series might be useful to read. Demons are infovores, they feed on structured information and entropy gradients.

    Yeah I read the first 2 books. I liked tha angle but all those infovres seemed to much like technobubble. The fact that demons eat minds is very good but IIRC it is the only time the information angle was importnat and could not be swapped with a generic "I destroy everything" monster.

  People get more powerful the more famous they are. This is basically the opposite of what /u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer is saying. Instead of wizards hoarding secrets and speaking in riddles, they would be trying to spread knowledge. They would be all about trying to tell (and create) the most compelling stories they possibly could. This is the basic magic system for [Shadows of the Limelight](http://alexanderwales.com/shadows/).

  If you want to adapt something like that to spells:

  * Memetic bomb: A nascent spell gets attached to a meme of some kind. Maybe this is a piece of news, a new song, or a saying. From then on, the power of the spell that eventually gets cast will be dependent on the strength of the meme (and use up that power). Wizardly power would then be tied to which memes they had lashed their spells to, as well as how well a wizard was able to help a meme spread.
  * Memetic casting: The spells that are most powerful are those which are most known. *Fireball* is iconic, so it's powerful. *Glibness* is unknown, so it's weak. This provides a feedback effect for casting; as a spell gets more powerful, more people will know about it, which will make it more powerful, etc.

  That immediately puts me in mind of the [black hole information paradox] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_information_paradox). 

  This is the observation that:

  1) Particle interactions are predictable. (Electrons repel each other)

  2) Predictable interactions are  reversible. (Two electrons that have interacted will be further apart)

  3) All that get gets tossed out the window when a black hole wanders into the picture. (We have no idea how many electrons got sucked up. They're all contained inside the event horizon even if that volume of space wouldn't normally hold them.)

  If you treat "information" in an anthropomorphic way it seems to get where you wanted to go. If we take "you can't destroy information" to mean "you can't get rid of the knowledge in a letter" then Wizards would have some sort of a spell that gets the knowledge from the ashes. For even more fun maybe they can recreate the letter (or something more important?) from the knowledge and the ashes? 

  You wanted to abuse the system, you say? Then let's overthink information theory! What does encryption do to these wizards? The information exists, but isn't readily retrievable without more information. Or how about Godel's paradox? (Credit to a reader Para on my story for thinking about that one. I don't know if they hang out here or not, but "Hi" if you do.)

  > 3. Define a set of hard rules for this magic

  Wait, I wasn't supposed to go for the esoteric physics first?  Blast...

  > "Antimemetic field": People forget about the user a split second after seeing them.

  You're probably just thinking back to your last date with Aornis Hades there....

  Anyway, sounds like a fun idea. Now back to the nether hells normally occupied by authors of web fiction.
