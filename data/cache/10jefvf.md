## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I recently read *Anathem* and really enjoyed it. Is there anything else that's similar, specifically in the sense of including characters having the sorts of philosophical discussions they do in the book? Preferably something shorter.
  ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    Have you read *The Baroque Cycle* by the same author? Of all his works it's the most similar to Anathem, imo. It's not shorter but longer, though. 

    *Cryptonomicon* also by him is a bit shorter and less overtly philosophical, but is the most often recommended alongside Anathem and Baroque. 

    *Prince of Nothing* series is fantasy rather than SF, but there is a lot of philosophical discussions and musings by the various POV characters. The writer has a PhD in Philosophy, so yeah. Also, not short at all. 

    *Canticle for Leibowitz* is similar in many ways to Anathem, in fact I would be surprised if it didn't inspire the world of anathem at least a bit. One difference is that there is not that much overt discussion of philosophy like in Anathem. Still, very good and short!

    For more I recommend checking out /r/printSF. It's a very popular book there, people ask for similar stuff all the time.
    ```

    - u/N0_B1g_De4l:
      ```
      I've read *Snow Crash* and *The Diamond Age* previously, but beyond those no other Stephenson. I do think "more by the same guy" is good guidance for similar themes, but at the same time I do want something shorter.

      *Prince of Nothing* is a good suggestion, but I have read the full series (though apparently there's some indications Bakker's working on another one, so I'm looking forward to that). I know he's written some other stuff, but I tried *Neuropath* and found it less compelling that the Second Apocalypse books.

      *Canticle* is one of those things I've meant to give a shot for a while, so maybe I'll bump it up the list.
      ```

      - u/Denswend:
        ```
        IMO Blindsight is better than Neuropath, but YMMV. Both Watts and Bakker have a set of archetypes unique for them that sometimes overlap (for instance, a legitimate pyschopath as a secondary character) but I found Watts' Bindsight better than Neuropath in both execution and the futuristic setting (though PoN is a class of its own). Besides, one of the thing I love about Watts is his scientific (or scientistic, if you really will) approach to problems. You'll find notes and references at the end of his every novel from real life data to how those relate to his setting. Besides, Bakker is way too, uh, sexual for my puritanical tastes.
        ```

  - u/Dragongeek:
    ```
    [*To The Far Shore*](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/50836/to-the-far-shore) feels very similar and although it doesn't get as wikidive-deep as Stephenson, it feels very similar as a story and is also rather introspective and philosophical in a way.

    It's top tier stuff too, easily one of the best things I read online last year.
    ```

  - u/surt2:
    ```
    You might enjoy some stuff by Greg Egan. In particular, *Permutation City*, *Teranesia*, and his *Orthogonal* trilogy come to mind.
    ```

    - u/N0_B1g_De4l:
      ```
      I have read *Permutation City*. I've been meaning to read *Diaspora* at some point too. His other stuff sort of turns me off, because while I can admire the intellectual effort of realizing so completely an entirely counter-factual physics, reading through it doesn't quite interesting me. One of the things I really enjoyed about *Anathem* was the degree to which I could recognize aspects or reflections of real philosophy in the stuff it was working with. I worry that something like the Orthogonal books wouldn't really capture that.

    [A Prison of Glass](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-prison-of-glass-worm-cyoa.486424/reader/) is a Worm fanfic with an overpowered sociopathic self-insert, but the story is told from everyone else's perspective.

  An early recommendation for this week: [Unfathomable Power for the Low, Low Price of Someone Else’s Soul](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/57721/unfathomable-power-for-the-low-low-price-of-someone)


  I am disappointed (but not surprised) that this never took off on Royal Road, but it’s an urban fantasy book about a warlock who gets powers from selling souls of murderers. I would also argue that the protagonist Colm is rational, or at least rational-adjacent. He’s smart, looks for loopholes in contracts, and is aware of his capabilities, and seeks to rectify them. I’m not sure what else I could say to convince you to check this out, but you really should.
  ```

  - u/sephirothrr:
    ```
    I read what's up there, and I'd add a cautious recommendation - it's certainly one of the better entries in the "Dresden Files with the serial numbers filed off" genre, but I'd stop quite short of calling it rational. 

    All of the clever munchkining happens either offscreen or as backstory, but in a way that's mostly immaterial to the actual plot. 

    In fact, if anything, in the heat of the moment, the protagonist fails to use his full skillset due to (very understandable!, but still not rationally satisfying) trauma and inexperience.

    Regardless, it's still a solid work with a decently competent protagonist, which I feel is often what the "rational" label gets shorthanded as.

    >I am disappointed (but not surprised) that this never took off on Royal Road

    I mean, I guess most "taking off" takes place a month after fiction release or whenever it becomes eligible for one of the trending style lists, but speaking of it in past tense when it's not even that long or that old is kinda weird. 

    That said, it's pretty good--I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, but I can see why it might not be rising to the top of RR popularity charts:

    The main problem is that it's too short and not optimally written/structured for webfiction. Yes, the current 90k ish words is decent, but the first arc is only just now (seemingly) drawing to a conclusion, after a whole novel's worth of words. The pacing is more akin to what I'd expect in a book, and it leaves someone like me a bit frustrated, because I have reached the end, want to know what happens next, but even at the current (high) posting rate of the author, I will need to wait probably like a month until enough chapters build up so that I can finish the damn arc.
    ```

    Thanks for the rec, I've read up to chapter 17 of what's posted and it has been great so far.

  - u/thomas_m_k:

    Hm, literally the first sentence of the story has a grammar mistake (missing a "the"). This might be the reason it never took off.

  This subreddit's repeated recommendations of Mother of Learning finally got me past the early chapters where the MC is an obnoxious little asshole and it's good actually so if you, like me, have bounced off it for that reason, give it another try and a few chapters.
  ```

  - u/Freevoulous:
    ```
    >MC is an obnoxious little asshole

    agreed, though this applies to something like 98% of stories here, especially anything approaching LitRPG, Progression or Isekai stories. Especially frustrating when the worldbuilding and plot is good but the protagonist is the weak point.
    ```

    - u/buckykat:
      ```
      Well, sure, but pre-loop Zorian is less of a HJPEV-type obnoxious little asshole and more of a Holden Caulfield-type obnoxious little asshole. His petulance isn't fun.

      Point is, he does get better.
      ```

      - u/YankDownUnder:
        ```
        Pre-loop Zorian is a accurately depicted typical teenage boy who matures in a realistic manner over the ~10 cumulative years he spends inside the loop. It's a rare example of a Progression Fantasy story wherein the protagonist undergoes actual character progression.
        ```

      - u/Relevant_Occasion_33:

        Lol, I guess I was less irritated by Zorian because he was basically teenage me, except he actually had a few friends who liked him enough to pester him.

  I'm revisiting this subreddit and finding new ratfic's. I wanted to highlight a few that I had previously passed over and others may enjoy.

  - Virtuous sons: instead of cultivating power in an asian setting, they cultivate virtue in a greco roman setting. It's written like a hard science fiction, in that the world is not set out for you. You must be prepared to be confused as you discover the setting.
  - Mark of the fool: A good litrpg that is mostly driven by character decisions.

  I also wanted to mention a few scifi novels that, while they might not be fully rational, readers here will enjoy.

  - [Fleet of worlds](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/302537.Fleet_of_Worlds) by Niven and Lerner. It follows a paranoid schizophrenic spy who has to used his functional paranoia to foil the plots of superintelligent beings and alien minds. Unlike some Niven collaborations the Lerner and Benford ones are good reading. I like this because I like depictions of superintelligent beings and good books.
  - [The rapture of the Nerds](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13538762-the-rapture-of-the-nerds): Making fun of transhumanists. POV of a luddite in a transhumanist (mostly) utopia.
  - [Redshirts](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13055592-redshirts). A funny genre aware story from the perspective of one of the redshirts in star trek who slowly becomes aware they are in a story. I like this because I like funny books that break the fourth wall that are also good.
  - [Schooled in Magic by Nuttal](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20927280-schooled-in-magic) a girl is ported to a dark fantasy setting and proceeds to uplift it. Written by a MilSf writer. I like this because I like stories of engineers or scientists who are portaled to a backwards world, and must use their mind to adapt and improve the world.
  - [Protector by Larry Niven](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/100344.Protector). Human's have several life stages: child, adult, protector but we lost the symbiotic virus responsible for the last stage. The last stage is super intelligent but also super constrained by xenophobic instincts.

    of note is that this is blatantly a world-bashing harry potter fanfiction with all the names replaced, but with nowhere near the execution that even something like 50 shades of gray managed to pull off

    i would strongly recommend that no one waste their time reading it, and i'd go so far to say that i find very suspect the literary opinions of anyone who would suggest it
    ```

    - u/CellWithoutCulture:
      ```
      Yes, it's a book about a magical school, so yeah, there are some basic similarities. But beyond that, the story diverges considerably, going off in it's own direction (and continues to go its own way as the series progresses).

      Don't discount this series just because it's about a magical school.

      Like many MilSF authors Nuttall puts plot over prose, and people should go here looking for fun not literature. It may not be your cup or tea, but it is mine.

  Recently I read [Industrious](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/industrious-naruto-au-si-inspired-inventor.20293/), a Naruto SI where the protagonist gets Inspired Inventor. If you don't know, Inspired Inventor basically lets the protagonist gain a lot of knowledge in any field of his choosing (from any other fictional universe) once a month. He uses it to build a tech base in the Naruto world (he's basically a civilian with very little chakra and bad chakra skills). The story is alright, the protagonist wants to lie low while building his tech base but inevitably gets more and more well known. There's also a harem since this is a story on QQ. Anyways, what I was more enamored with was the premise. So here's my request:

  Any tech uplift stories taking place in a high magic fantasy setting. High magic fantasy as in something like Naruto or Magic the Gathering. Somewhere magic is, if not ubiquitous, at least extremely powerful. Preferably with the protagonist being underpowered, with most of their power coming from their tech. I realize that a high magic setting means tech is not as required anymore, but counterpoint: magic wizards fighting an army of mechs and nanobots.
  ```

  - u/buckykat:
    ```
    A new anime this season, The Magical Revolution of the Reincarnated Princess and the Genius Young Lady, is aiming towards tech uplift of a high magic fantasy setting. Magic is equated with, and only occurs in, noble families within the setting.

    Our hero is a princess born without magical ability of her own, but with vague memories of modern earth. She pioneers the field of thaumaturgy (or magicology depending on translation) which allows anyone to take advantage of magical effects regardless of birth by using technological magic items.

    Inspired Inventor, or really any crafting/knowledge based power that gets stronger or changes over time is something I always find enjoyable, but there are sadly very few of them that are not Taylor Alt-powers, canon Worm character close to Taylor(Annette or Danny) alt-powers, oc/self-insert close to Taylor(Every single Tinker of Fiction for some reason?? Like seriously, they *all* get adopted by Danny..), or Worm in general.

    So it's a shame this is a harem story. I absolutely loathe the trope. But thanks for the rec.

    Oh well, I guess I'll just start over Brockton's Celestial Forge for the third time.
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      I recently read Inspired Voyage, and it's a pretty good "Inspired Inventor in a different setting" fic - the setting being Star Trek: Voyager. I do like how the MC is able to leverage a lot of the native Trek tech to get things up and running, and the strict limitations of the Voyager setting keep it from being too much of a roflstomp.

      The Janeway hate is kinda off-putting though, and the story sorta just ends with a bunch of summaries of the future chapters since the authors don't have time to finish it.
      ```

      - u/chiruochiba:
        ```
        >The Janeway hate is kinda off-putting

        I agree with this. When I first read the story I thought it was a case of extreme character "bashing" by the author, but then I read a bunch of reviews and quotes from Voyager and realized canon Janeway is actually that crazy due to the writers of the TV series battling over different interpretations of her character from episode to episode.

        Her antagonism creates great narrative tension, so I was willing to forgive it in this fanfic. That said, I do think it's a case of all the other characters getting to be more rational than canon while she is still stuck as her irrational canon self.

  I've been digging around in Glowfic after rereading [mad investor chaos](https://www.projectlawful.com/posts/4582). I've found that I'm enjoying the format, it is kinda like a visual novel but far less intrusive (so I can treat it like a typical book and have it open on another monitor).  
  Here's some, but not all of the ones I enjoyed:

  -----

  (Velgarth, if you haven't heard of it, is from the Valdemar series. However, the specifics here are presumably based on the rationalfic [A Song for Two Voices](https://archiveofourown.org/series/936480). I recommend reading that too, though I find that I like staying in Leareth's perspective in the glowfic better than I do Vanyel's)  

  [we know we once were gods](https://glowfic.com/board_sections/551):  
  Settings: Golarion, Velgarth  
  Length: 141 + 36 + 212 pages. The second part is cut-off, but this story is basically-complete.  
  Desc: One of my favorites. Vanyel ends up in Golarion. A lot more hopeful than mad investor chaos. Probably read this if you're into taking over Cheliax and want to see various parts of Osirion.

  [break my shackles to set me free](https://glowfic.com/posts/4728):  
  Settings: Velgarth, Golarion  
  Length: 159 pages. On hiatus.  
  Desc: Cheliax has begun poking into Velgarth, and captures Leareth. He has to try to convince Carissa to not hand him over to Asmodeus' country. (I'd rec 'we know we once were gods' over this if you're having to choose between this and that) >!I felt the relationship between Leareth and Carissa was relatively weak?
