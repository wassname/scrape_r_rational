  I really like this story. Well written, intelligent characters, and just all around a very good story. Also, it took me an embarrassingly long amount of time to realize that the occasional "renegade option" chapters actually were a coherent story line separate from the main one.  As in, I was well past the Ophidian arc when I realized.

  The [Story Only Thread](http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.272850/) is far more convenient for online reading than the version spread over 11 threads and ~2100 pages. The page you linked does have .epub versions for offline access (I recommend reading online if possible, sometimes the author links stuff in-story). 

  I like the story a lot; Honestly it's almost better if you don't know Young Justice canon, because then the canon rehashes won't bother you as much. The author is now moving into between-season territory (YJ had a 5-year intermission between major storylines) so the dovetailing to the stations of canon should hopefully not be a problem for the foreseeable future.

  The author updates very regularly - in the middle of the night for those in North America, every night without pause or break. It's built up a lot of story over time.  Pretty much 95% of the updates either introduce important plot points or advance previous plot points - compared to Games We Play, the other major Spacebattles Daily Updating Creative Writing Thread, this is a huge improvement (that story, in contrast, has gone a couple realtime months, e.g. ~60 updates, without anything interesting happening)

  The SI actually is trying to explore and use superhero tech and magic logically to help/improve himself and others. That's something I like a lot. Also, there's a lot of genuinely good emotional parts, and a lot of good humour too. The hints of romantic attraction mostly have thus far just served to throw fuel into the shipping in the discussion threads, rather than going anywhere.

  The author has also proved fairly responsive to reader feedback.

      There's a lot of *potentially interesting* stuff... However, consider the story's recent events. [Games We Play](#s " Since Jaune's fight with Conquest, we have seen... like 30 chapters introducing sisters, recapping at sisters then fighting with the sisters for no stakes, then messing with Yang, then enrolling and stuff. The entire thing since the last Conquest fight has felt devoid of tension. Also the author likes to have Jaune explain everything to everyone on-camera and thus has spent way too long recapping. Easily 90% of the chapters since the Conquest stuff could be glossed over instead of covered on camera and the story would be the better for it.")

      [Games We Play](#s "It's *possible* that the author is setting up for some sort of later drama related to Jaune's various sisters and that thus the chapters introducing them, then fighting them for no stakes and no reason, then having them all leave again is actually vital setup... and likewise with healing the mooks and furniture from the bar, and likewise with every other task Jaune does that the author portrays on camera even though there is no tension, no opposition, no chance of failure, and no stakes")

      The author doesn't seem to have sorted out that just because the main character would logically tell someone something, doesn't mean you have to tell the person *on camera* and take up a thousand words to do so. You could simply put in "And then, after telling X about Y, I went do actually important and interesting new plot point or plot point advancement Z. and skip the thousand or two thousand words telling X about Y on camera. If, in a scene there is no stakes, no actual opposition, no chance of failure, no new information for the reader... then I would much rather the author elide the scene and go to the next one.

          He provided bad examples to prove his point. A lot of the stuff mentioned either was a set up for a later plot point or just general world building.

          After Jacques death the logical conclusion is his family coming home for his funeral. Introducing 7 new characters and mentioning " and then I told my sisters about my semblance and after school activities before training again" is just bad writing. Those chapters served to characterize his sisters and explain their semblances among other things. One of his sister's semblance gives him insight on his own and is revisited soon afterwards. We find out that another sister will be in Mistral which is likely going to be important seeing as Jaune will be returning there for several reasons.

          The fight among the arc siblings is there to show several of his new skills and how far Jaune has grown even after his fight with Conquest. 

          The bar fight provided Jaune the opportunity to meet Ruby which leads to a plot point set up earlier while also introducing Yang and dealing with her without angering Raven.

          To say that there isn't any tension since the Conquest arc is a lie. We learn of the Arc family dynamic which does some world building and exposition on hunter families in particular the relationship with Isabella and her daughters.  We confirm the existence of one other Rider and speculation on how many more there are and who their hosts could be. The aftermath of the bar fight introduces new information about the Grimm and also ties back into a plot point introduced way back when Jaune visited Mistral for the tournament.

          There reasons he provided aren't good examples of his point. A better one would be Jaune's rematch with the Grimm since it didn't really show anything we haven't seen before.

      The author at one point mentioned in a spoiler-hidden comment that for any post with New Gods, you should highlight the entire thing, because the New Gods communicate in their own weird mindspeech, which he included as text that is invisible unless highlighted.

    You can use [this](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/6187-xenforo-invis-text-multi-reveal) Greasemonkey script to warn you about invisible text on the spacebattles forums.

    >This script adds a button to reveal invisible text. The button is placed under a poster's avatar, and will only be displayed if there is transparent text in the post. Also, a dotted grey border is placed around any invisible text to denote its presence.

  How the hell do you read this story? I am constantly confused by the repeated chapters/  renegade chapters. Is he telling two stories at the same time? At other times it really seems like I just skipped some chapters. I was really into the story but just ragequit.
  ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    The renegade chapters are a slightly different story where Paul is more aggressive. The two stories do no interact, and you are perfectly able to completely skip them.  I've taken to doing so because I don't find the main character as compelling as I do in the main one, although occasionally he has some fun rants.

    I'm not sure what you mean by feeling like you miss chapters. Just about everything Paul does in his off time is mentioned beforehand and then you can basically assume he continues doing so. Cleaning the ocean, meditating, and reading about villains is set up, then not repeated because that would be boring.  If that's not what you mean, you could ask me.  I recently got caught up with the story.

      The things I most remember seeming missing is paul going to Titan. and why superboy dislikes monkeys (even before dr ivo's monqi's)
      ```

      - u/sicutumbo:
        ```
        The author generally skips Paul testing his power, as it would be annoying to either have a long repetitive scene or have a short scene that could have been better mentioned to already have happened.  In regards to the monkey thing, the author largely used dialogue from the show that the fic is based on, at least during the early parts. That line about monkeys comes up in the show without any explanation as well, and I'm really not sure if it's ever mentioned again.

      I downloaded the ebook version, and I know for sure it has at least one major missing chunk, I made a post about it but no one said anything. Eventually I just started reading the story only thread, and dealing with having to scroll to the correct part of the page whenever my phone randomly decided to refresh the page while the browser was minimized. Plus the ebook didn't have colored text.

      There is a special place of deep hatred in my heart for long story threads that don't have a next chapter button at the end of the posts. Even having to scroll to the top of the post is extremely immersion breaking, especially on a phone. But at least that way I wouldn't have to figure out which of the 25 2k+ word posts on the page I was in the middle of reading. I think the worst are stories where I have to scroll to the top of the post in order to check the chapter I'm on, then go back to the first page to get to the index, *then* click on the next chapter.
      ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    I know *exactly* what you mean, I had the same response.

    Start from [the table of contents](http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-eleven.311139/) and open things in new tabs as you go.  That way you can skip over the Renegade chapters.

    And yes, he's telling two stories at once.  WOG says that the Renegade and the Paragon will eventually meet and interact, but there's no sign of when that will happen.
