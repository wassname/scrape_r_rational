  Alright, I have a lot I could say about this story, but my spoiler tags don't seem to be working no matter what I do.

  So I'll just say that I consider this story's ending to be a nihilistic piece of trash.
  ```

  - u/CeruleanTresses:
    ```
    Nihilistic and also gross in some ways I wasn't prepared for.
    ```

  - u/TildeAleph:
    ```
    I think the author did say that the decisions the protagonists make leading up to the ending would not have been his/her own, but that it fit better with the story... or something.
    ```

    - u/EndlessStrategy:
      ```
      Well sure, the actions Caroline took were consistent with her character as it had been portrayed up to that point. But that doesn't stop the ending from being terrible.
      ```

- u/FeepingCreature:
  ```
  Cool story, but: [Spoiler](#s "Prime Intellect, I want you to slow down my simulation by a factor of two every second"). There. Death.
  ```

  - u/Chronophilia:
    ```
    Subjective or objective seconds?

    If subjective seconds, you'd experience the universe slowing down exponentially, and you'd probably hit the heat death of the universe in a matter of minutes... unless Prime Intellect finds a way around that, in which case you'd end up alive, but isolated from the rest of society.

    If you're slowed down by a factor of two every objective second, you'd experience only two more subjective seconds, and then die.
    ```

    - u/FeepingCreature:
      ```
      Yeah, I think if you assume that entropy is inescapable this is a win in both cases.
      ```

  - u/narfanator:
    ```
    I think PI is prevented from that. First, people aren't a simulation; they're in reality, but PI is controlling reality like a sock puppet. Second, people looking for their Infinite Pleasure Button have to experiment neuron by neuron, since PI won't read their minds. 

    That said, drop into a black hole?
    ```

- u/narfanator:
  ```
  TRIGGERS: Extreme voluntary violence. A character volunteers to be tortured, raped* and killed due to catastrophic ennui. 

  * This is not the right word to describe the story, but is the correct word to describe the trigger warning.
  ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    I think that if you subscribe to the notion of triggers outside of PTSD and epilepsy, then this story probably isnt for you.

  ```
  The *original* misbegotten attempted-FAI story.  Now with more ultraviolence and much less philosophical exploration!
  ```

- u/SaintPeter74:
  ```
  The same author has a fair number of other short stories, many of them set in a common universe.  They're quite good.  I used to read him when he posted on Kuro5hin (before it reached infinite suck).

  The author was also working on a sequel, but then Katrina hit and . . . well, he hasn't gotten back to it.
  ```

  I find this relevant, although it wasn't actually what I was looking for:
  https://www.erowid.org/columns/teafaerie/2012/05/

  It covers part of the foundation of the actual thought I've heard from the TeaFearie, which goes something like this, although I really can't do her prose justice with my paraphrase, and is the thought I thought of upon completion of the story:

  > What would make the perfect game? Well, for starters, you'd be in it, and other people would be there, too. Then, there'd be challenges. But they'd be challenges you set yourself, and very importantly, they'd scale with your level: they'd get harder as you got better.

  > Well - when things are at their best, doesn't that kinda sound like life?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    > Well - when things are at their best, doesn't that kinda sound like life?

    No: games involve extra lives.  A well-designed game has a space for blatantly reckless exploration of the possibilities.  Real life is *great* at being (often) nonlinear and having no set story you get forced through (freedom), but it's actually *complete shit* at letting you explore the possibility-space without suffering catastrophic penalties (such as death, destitution, or mental illness).  Worse: the tutorial levels (childhood) are deliberately constructed to shield you from the complexity of the real game (real life) instead of building you up to having the strength for it, so when you *do* get thrown into the real levels (again: real-life adulthood), it's a basically sink-or-swim challenge that breaks a lot of people and dramatically cuts off possibilities for almost everyone.

    The biggest barrier *stopping* real life from being a great place to live is precisely that we are forced to spend most of our efforts on survival rather than on self-actualization or doing good for/with others.
