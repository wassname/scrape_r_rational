  It starts semi-reasonable, but goes completely off the rails eventually. Perhaps the protagonist is rational to start with, but either he's being warped by the comedic nature of the world or the author isn't maintaining him as rational as the story goes on.
  ```

    ```
    Curiously (after reading through the 35 available chapters) I had the opposite impression; it starts fairly generic as oh-no-I've-transmigrated-with-a-system-as-the-cannon-fodder-so-I-have-to-suck-up-to-the-MC ('The Scum Villain’s Self-Saving System', 'The Price of Confessing To The Wrong Female Protagonist', 'There's a Pit in My Senior Martial Brother's Brain'), but later seems to start unfolding in larger, more unorthadox ways.

    As others note, the beneficial coincidences do feel quite contrived, to the degree of of (remembering a different story) 'huh, I have zero fighting ability yet always trip in exactly the right way to KO the expert fighting me' contrivance.  That said, that in itself doesn't exceed the degree of transmigration stories in which a desperate-for-survival transmigrator is misunderstood as self-sacrificing.

    The 'right, respond to suspicious threats with INCREDIBLE FORCE'  was extremely refreshing, as I don't believe I've seen it often, if at all--it's an appropriate which can only be taken narratively because there are so many threats, so many pieces in play.

    If the protagonist can accomplish far-reaching plans and the actions and motivations of the characters can hang together plausibly, I look forward to seeing how the world's events develop.  If instead it collapses from the author being crushed by the complexity, then less so.

    The strung-along-by-the-system state is a limiting factor for the protagonist, almost forced to expend resources as soon as he gets them--though if he can get a firmer foundation in the doing, then all the better.  He does however seem to suffer from the common system-blindness, in that he doesn't seem to question much "Wait, systems actually exist?  Who made them, what do they want, how much does this real one have to do with amateur-novelists' depictions of them and what's the connection?".

    ...hmm, what other thoughts...  pretty much just 'after reading the available 35 chapters all at once, I've found the chapters humorous and refreshing'.

    Hmm, I'm considering now that most (translated) stories on these lines have been 'premise...so that romance-fluff story!' in some way, where all the interesting context and humour is for the sake of being the backdrop to the inter-character emotions.  I feel that few stories have the interesting world and the changes to it as a result of the protagonist's actions as the main focus.  <contemplation of Lord of the Mysteries and Master of Gu>  


    Edit:  Attempting further introspection, even while I enjoy the two just above, they are also cases of protagonists being plunked down in a situation and going step by step according to the provided rules, if sometimes in ingenious ways.  Stories with systems don't affect this, just making the paths of progression more exclusive.  Perhaps what I thirst for is someone 'changing the game', deliberately going laterally in ways that take people completely by surprise and end up working better than the alternative, the protagonist outwitting the setting rather than clearing it on its terms.  Hmm.  Granted, I do derive pleasure from Peggy Sue foreknowledge stories where the story shows you the dominos, shows you how they're going to fall, and then shows you the protagonist shifting a few dominos directions and falling gloriously in a completely counter outcome.  There overall the power is still handed-on-a-plate, yet the microcosm smashing is pleasant...  hm.  Boring though when it's raw combat power rather than a-little-knowlege-which-can-be-exploited which is handed on a plate, though.

      Is there a ratfic specifically about this? Like, to an even greater degree than *Worth the Candle* is?

      Ideally, it'd have a setting where *creating new, visitable sibling universes with their own internal civilizations that think of their location as "reality"* is itself a formal, rule-based magic system of the setting, one which isn't "hidden behind the curtain of mysticism" when it's used, but rather described explicitly (hopefully in the way that e.g. the first chapter of Greg Egan's *Diaspora* describes explicitly the birth of a posthuman em.) And also ideally, the MC would eventually explore+exploit this magic system. (E.g. "what you'd assume would happen after the end of the movie *The Thirteenth Floor*, if the protagonist of that film were rational.")
      ```

      - u/MultipartiteMind:
        ```
        Without judging whether something is ratfic or not:  


        For characters actively creating new worlds like that (but only in the backstory), the Myst computer games is the one example that comes to mind.  The differences in philosophical stances is also amusing to me.  "No, no.  Always remember, we're not creating worlds, we're just *linking* to them."  "Oh, come on!  With a few words we can make massive changes to those worlds that astound the inhabitants, plus mine always collapse shortly after I write the book rather than before!  We obviously have creative control here!".  


        For one of my more fondly-remembered moments, 'Kumo desu ga, nanika?' ("So I'm a spider, so what?").  "Ahhh!  I spent so much time trying to survive within the system...  I never thought to ask *why there's a system in the first place!*  <horrifying secrets of the world and its history learned all at once>"  I don't remember which chapter it was in, but there's a moment of it in the anime PV at [youtube.com/watch?v=lwk3Q8QpRWg](https://youtube.com/watch?v=lwk3Q8QpRWg) .  


        More generally, in the fast-transmigration genre there are quite a lot of stories in which many 'worlds' exist, each unknowing about other worlds, and the 'host' to a system travels between them, spending a short time or a full lifetime in each one, each world having several chapters of the overall story.  The host uses the knowledge or power of the host and/or system to enact major changes to each story to accomplish the desired objective, depending on the type of system.  The different types of systems and objectives and how they react or refer to each other can be fun.  


        Continuing the last paragraph, in 'Sinister Ex-Girlfriend' the protagonist tries to destroy worlds (planes) by ripping apart the male lead female lead couple through tests of their true feelings while the antagonist side tries to save them; in a lot or most stories the host's role is to fix the future regrets of the person whose body they took; there's a certain nice story which at first glance looks like certain other stories ("Make the one who wronged the original body fall in love with you, then die for them so that they feel greatest regret for having wronged you!") which has a neat subversion ("Oh, hey, it turns out that the person who created the systems is harvesting energy from the negative feelings of the original bodies as they watch themselves do loving things with the ones they most hate and then kill themselves.  When I destroy the wronging-one's life directly to make them feel regret, I complete the terms of the mission *and* the original body gets to be back in control of their body and live happily with their family afterwards.")  Only, almost every (though not quite every) fast-transmigration story I've read so far seems to get quickly derailed by a same-partner-in-each-world romance storyline which takes most of the effort and interestingness out of the worlds themselves.

        >creating new, visitable sibling universes with their own internal civilizations that think of their location as "reality"

        There's two stories I know of that *sort of* does this, but it's not a focus of either one:

        [Factory Isolation](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/factory-isolation-si-multicross.30535/) \- It's a Self-Insert fanfiction where the protagonist is on a desolate alien world with a device based on the game [Factorio](https://factorio.com/). After figuring out his long-term survival plan, he decides to build a colony and rule over them as an emperor. His ability to travel to other worlds include fictional worlds, but I don't think he ever exploited that ability to the fullest.

        [The Nightlord Series](https://www.amazon.com/Sunset-Book-Nightlord-Garon-Whited-ebook/dp/B00NMMPRU6) \- A series is about a vampire, wizard, king that I'm following avidly. Eric, the protagonist, is a specialist in gate-magic and it's barely mentioned in the earlier books, but in the last two books, he begins to exploit the searching function of the spell and the time-independent aspect of the spell to find exactly (or almost) what he needs. There were two interesting usages that I remember.

        Need an incredibly rare metal? No problem, once I find a world with it, I can create multiple timelines of that world and re-retrieve the metal as many time as needed. Need to go back in time? No problem, I'll connect the 'end' of the gate to it's 'beginning' and travel back to when it was first built. Use only in case of apocalyptic god. I expect the next book to involve even more gate shenanigans

      In the todays chapters there is a small section that suggests system/something 'interferes' with him.

      Oh wow, someone else who cares about plot and worldbuilding as opposed to romance in the quick transmigrations genre!
      ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    Yeah I don't think I'd call this particularly "rational", but it *is* fairly fun.

    Like basically I think I'd describe this story as delivering on the promise that Simulacrum made.
    ```

  - u/ZedOud:
    ```
    The MC certainly skips a few beats, but I think the author has maintained the integrity of his setting’s rules in the misunderstandings he allows the MC to develop despite the MC’s genre savvyness, as they are owed to issues stemming from the MC’s lacking perspective as a transmigrator as opposed to the self-awareness of a reality-nativity (and this is largely addressed in the story, as compared to some authors half-assing it and leaving this up to the readers’ inferences and interpretations).
    ```

- u/ShEsHy:
  ```
  Thanks for this, started reading today and caught up. It's fun, and I think the story would be one of my favourites on RR if it weren't for the constant forced misunderstandings.
  ```

- u/PurposefulZephyr:
  ```
  ... I don't know if that can be considered rational, in steoretypical sense. It's a well made comedy of misunderstanding, filled with people who are genuinely thinking things through. And they could possibly have ended up with sensible and correct conclusions, if a certain cultivator wasn't Isekai'd without anyone noticing.

  It's great though, and keeps it's own logic believable and consistent, which matters most for me.
  ```

- u/ZedOud:
  ```
  This story has really great trope navigation. The reasoning of the MC and side character is often explained (unusual bordering on impossible for a Xianxia). The MC carefully uses his resources and does not allow for loose ends or escalations of conflicts.

  The MC has a lot of resources at his disposal and is liberal in using them to avoid any trope/templates that he might run into, even taking matters into his own hands when he can’t risk other not understanding a situation as gravely as he would in light of a trope/template.

  [At some point, he drags away his minions to educate them in the ways of anamolies (Main Characters).](/spoiler)
  ```

  - u/MultipartiteMind:
    ```
    A sudden horrible thought (about the anomalies education):  "Oh, as it happens, the spirit iron sheets are for communication--an array with the boulders lets you see anything written on any other spirit iron sheet."  


    Tiny risk probability, **huge** risk potential fallout.  


    ...and in general, the wisdom of *doing anything* with something you know is very important to a powerful organisation yet don't know how they use it...  hmm.
    ```

  ```
  I expect better grammar and sentence structure from an english author. Is he purposely emulating his writing like the bad chinese translation you usually get from reading wuxia?
  ```

  - u/pldl:
    ```
    The author says they are not a native English speaker as they do not live in an English-speaking country.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Apparently he isn't a native speaker. He posted it in the comments. He doesn't live in an english speaker country either. Also this is his first novel. 

    ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
    ```

  - u/ZedOud:
    ```
    I think that if you read too much of that stuff it will infect your writing process.
    ```
