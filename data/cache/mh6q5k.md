## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  What do you think would happen in a world like the one depicted in [The End of Creative Scarcity](https://m.fictionpress.com/s/3353977/1/The-End-of-Creative-Scarcity)? (Spoilers for the setting but not the plot ahead)

  It’s a good short story so I recommend you read it, but the premise is that one day, the sky turns red, everyone off-planet is teleported back to Earth, no one can leave Earth, every living thing stopped dying or being able to get hurt or hurt another person (random effects intervene like a pillow showing up or a bullet turning into bubbles), no one needs to eat, humans become the only form of life that can reproduce, and land is created as it is needed.

  A week later, every human receives a “bowl”, shaped like two normal sized woks stacked on top of each other to make a closed space. If you ask the bowl for something, it will attempt to create something that fulfills your request. It will make anything that can fit in the bowl, isn’t living, and isn’t any more technologically advanced than present day, including the information within. For example, if you ask how to create a super intelligence, it’ll probably give you an entertaining fictional guide to such. You can ask for food and it’ll create it, but on a molecular level it’s not food, which doesn’t have any health consequences because health doesn’t exist anymore. The bowls also won’t tell you anything about their creators or how to destroy the boxes.

  The bowls follow you around, and babies receive one from the sky after being born. They only follow verbal commands. They will always attempt to make something to fulfill a request, even if it’s impossible or contradictory, and usually try to stick to the spirit of the request. The boxes are excellent at creating art. You could ask for a live action HPMOR starring the author, or the book you would have written if you finally started it, or sequels to existing media. Basically anything that’s fiction, or non-fiction if it’s not a large conceptual leap (hard to pin this down, but basically you could get biographies from living and dead people, or Einstein’s opinion on string theory, but not a blueprint to a wormhole generator). This does allow for technological leaps by analyzing existing information from many new perspectives, and shortly after the bowls were given, tech to give internet to everyone on the planet regardless of location was created.

  The original story doesn’t say this explicitly, but I would count restricting the mobility of another person or gagging them to prevent access to their bowl counts as harm and is prevented.

  In addition to what would happen to humanity, what would you personally do?

    I think the first thing I would do is eat chocolate mousse cake.

    I'd probably spend a lot of time snuggling my wife on an atoll somewhere. I mean, I can sail, the bowl provides everything we need presumably including a perfect sunscreen and internet access, and the toddler can't drown, so why not?

    Long-term I expect I would spend at least a few decades just relaxing. See what kind of human my daughter grows up to become, play video games, read, learn how to cook perfect food even though I could get it out of the bowl. I'd like to be able to cook at least one dish to perfection in every ethnic culture in the world, and without having to worry about pancreatic health issues or weight gain, I could eat carbs again. (Do you know how much I miss rice? My family cuisine of origin is Arab by way of India. We have rice in *literally everything*, including the things we serve with bread.) And probably I could just turn off things being too spicy, and I'd never have to worry about mercury in fish...

    I really like videogames. I really like books and web serials. I've often said that I could live a hundred years and not be tired of reading, and judging by the thirty and change years I've been reading that's extremely likely to be true, but hey I'd like to give it a proper test.

    In short, "Unbounded time, access to unlimited creative works, and my partner is there to enjoy it with" sounds like *literally* heaven.

    Despite the limitations on what it can create, I would expect the Bowls to help technology advance by leaps and bounds.

    Of course, just immortality, invulnerability, and lack of scarcity are a big help on their own. People could spend lifetimes learning if they wished, they would never have to worry about any experiment hurting anyone or the environment, and funding and grants would be a thing of the past.

    But the Bowls are also *incredibly* useful for, well, basically any scientific or engineering prospect in existence:

    * Want a pure substance? Any pure substance, or any mix or compound? You can have it in bowl-sized chunks. Solid gold? Done. Heavy water? Done. Two gallons of the DNA from lab rat #5? Well, DNA alone isn't alive, so done.
    * Equipment? If it fits in the bowl, done. If it's made of parts that individually fit in the bowl, also done. And you might be able to ask for a redesigned version that does fit in the bowl, if it's near-current-tech.
    * For that matter, parts? Done. You want a atomically precise linear rod made of titanium? Or a perfectly pure YAG crystal with exact dopants? Or a known superconducting material which is hideously difficult to synthesize? Well, that'd be hideously expensive with current-tech, but not impossible. Done.
    * You want to follow in the footsteps of the great scientists of old and DIYers and garage scientists of new, and do all this at home instead of going to a proper lab or something? Done. You could ask for every component of a clean-room with easy-to-follow assembly instructions included, if you so wanted.
    * Ever make a mistake, or make *one* thing but want more, or need exact duplicates? With a little negotiation, you might be able to ask for "what I was holding 5 minutes ago". Imagine how much easier countless studies would be if you could get the **same** object, exact same object, for multiple trials.
    * If the Bowls are generous with their definition of 'current' technology, anything we invent after their introduction is also up for grabs.


    Certainly, the focus on media and entertainment and lack of motivation from scarcity would slow things down, but all things considered I would expect technological progress to skyrocket... everywhere except the space industry, at least.


    (On a unrelated note, current-tech is, by some estimates, pretty close to being able to run a brain-scan. Has anyone considered, say, "give me a connectome map of my dead relative" or "give me a exact inorganic duplicate of my dead relative's brain" or "give me a USB drive with a FMRI file of my dead relative's brain", etc, and repeat until you find a information format and density it's willing to give you and repeat until you have enough for reconstruction? It's willing to make simulations recorded by a video camera, that is probably enough to eventually reverse information-theoretic death all by itself.)


    Edit: sorry, i just remembered that this is a question of what you would *personally* do. As you might expect from the above response, I would probably join the ranks of "DIYers, but immortal and with access to lasers and plutonium."

    First thing I'd ask the bowl is an easy method to permanently eliminate boredom. Hopefully it would respond with some pill that would alter my brain structure to never be able to feel boredom again. 

    Or if that doesn't count as current tech, at least I could use it to accelerate neuroscience so we can produce the anti-boredom drug or treatment on our own. 


    Otherwise immortality would eventually end up being well . . . a bore.

    I think you'd get bubble societies. Neighbourhoods that put up a wall and *never leave*. A century or so down the line, a few of these bubble societies will have gone to *seriously* weird mental places.

  Hypothetical situation:

  One day you gain a superpower: You can create extra bodies for yourself, up to 5.

  Meaning; you can "fork" yourself making  new (not identical) bodies with the exact copy of your mind. You can also re-absorb the copies at will. THis causes the copies of your mind to merge seamlessly in one, and the memories to stack in the order of absorbing.

  Ageing, injuries and diseases of the original are inherited by the copies, but not vice versa. Only the original can make copies. For the sake of the argument, lets say that the copies have randomly generated but normal bodies of random (adult) age, random biological sex and a phenotype. The copies appear nude. No items can be copied, not even things like piercings, tattoos, filling or implants.

  How would you practically utilise this abilty? How would you optimise it? How would you deal with the practical challenges of being extra 5 nude people with no ID?

    Balance between work and school, favoring school as much as possible. The clones will have to do strictly online classes, while I'd be relegated to strictly in-person work and in-person classes. The best move is probably to start studying things which can be done entirely online, preferably with the possibility of self-employment. For example, get bachelors degrees (or the equivalent level of self-study) in:

    * Mathematics

    * Physics

    * Computer science (focusing on software engineering and game design)

    * Digital arts focusing on 3D modeling/animation and web design)

    * Music composition

    * Game design

    That should suffice for six of me to form an indy game studio and start publishing games on Steam relatively quickly. Once we have some decent earnings and fairly stable income, I could hire additional team members to keep up the momentum and put some of the clones back onto studying to enhance the knowledge level of the group, possibly now with an emphasis on data science, machine learning, neural networks, and philosophy. Being able to learn at six times the normal rate would give me an enormous advantage in development of AI for games (initially), then for stock market analysis, and eventually for industrial robots once I have enough money to get an assembly line.

    At this point, two things would be highly valuable to produce. One would be industrial robots which can take a building design schematic plus raw materials and establish steps to actually construct the schematic as specified. The other would be an algorithm to analyze the schematics for a finished product and design an assembly line to produce it, factoring in the need for maintenance and providing access to the construction robots to carry out said maintenance. This would allow me to produce a massive range of products at likely unbeatable prices, bringing in even more money, and allowing me to start hiring the staff needed to begin moving towards the development of AI for both domestic and extraplanetary purposes.

    Hmmm. The copies don't pass diseases back to the original, and can be re-absorbed (and then new copies can be made).

    This makes the copies *exceptionally* useful in dealing with dangerous situations. (This goes double if the copies can be re-absorbed without touching them). If, to take an example from fiction, it's necessary for one person to enter a highly radioactive environment in order to pull a few switches to save the lives of an entire star ship; then it's not necessary to compare the needs of the many to the needs of the view. I can simply send in a clone to do it, wait for the clone to signal that it is done, and then re-absorb the clone again (ideally without letting the clone out of the sealed-off area first).

    In a less fictional sense, the clones will be able to pull off incredibly risky rescue operations with little risk. A clone dying would be unfortunate, and something that my clones would make every effort to avoid; but *less* unfortunate than the death of a person who doesn't have a backup from fifteen minutes ago. And no-one cares whether or not the person rescuing them has ID. (The original might need to spend the time sitting in the back of a truck with a wide variety of equipment ready for the clones to grab before heading out).

    --------------

    In a more immediate sense, the clones can deal with coronavirus lockdowns much better then the original body can - a clone with the virus can simply be re-absorbed and re-generated to lose it.

      My original idea was that between the "disposeability" of the clones, and the fact that they can learn mundane skills at 6x rate, one of the uses would be violent vigilantes a'la Punisher.  


      Not many criminal organisations can withstand a concentrated assault of disposable teams of 5, which gain skills and experience at an alarming rate.
