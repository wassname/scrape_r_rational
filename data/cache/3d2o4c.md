  Not sure I'd consider this rational, but I followed it as it was being written and enjoyed it. People on this sub might also enjoy [Hit the Ground Running](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9408516/1/Hit-The-Ground-Running), by the same author.

  tl;dr: Ginny gives the Diary Horcrux to Hermione instead of trying to throw it away. Hermione does her best to penetrate the Diary's mysteries. 27k words, complete.

  I was thinking that this story was at least a *little* rational(ist). Hermione does a *lot* of research in the library in order to check what the diary tells her, and she consistently engages in intellectual discussion with it--including some stuff on the classification of spells as "dark". She also explicitly calls out the Hogwarts staff and the Ministry for incompetence.

    So, another fan mouthpiece, then.
