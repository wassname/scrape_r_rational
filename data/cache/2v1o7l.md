  (writing this as I'm reading the chapter)

  Naruto makes a reasonable mistake! Yes!

  I wasn't really concerned for the life of Naruto (Sasuke a bit, Hinata's slightly more) though, so if that's the kind of tension you want to build I think they've had it a bit too easy :P


  ... until the Kyuubi was released. Yep, that could go bad.

  I like this Kyuubi mode a lot more than the standard stupid enraged beast mode. He's morbidly adorable.

  >Eight hundred and sixteen?”

  >“…No,” Sasuke said. “Incorrect.”

  Hahaha loving it. Made me stop and re-do the math too...



  Nice chapter. The 'one important canon person dies per chapter' streak is still going! Yay.

  My scattered thoughts on this chapter:

  Being Hinata is suffering.

  Fun chapter. I always love it when people being possessed realize that they are being possessed, feel like they are still consciously in control, and then go do horrible things. It's a much more interesting way of handling the whole possession idea.

  So, it looks like if Naruto can just keep the fox's chakra from reaching his brain, he can access it's power without going crazy AND possibly still use the magic eyeball. Fox chakra everywhere but his head could have some very, very interesting implications. His world domination plan is looking better and better by the day. 

  Things the fox chakra does to your brain:
  Gives user urge to kill ninja. Sounds like it holds a grudge.
  Reduces thought clarity
  Naruto turned off his magic eyeball. Which is actually a serious power loss.
  Has an urge to eat people.
  Total lack of empathy.

    > Being Hinata is suffering.

    That's really been my takeaway from the fic in general.

  They are so very lucky the beast didn't create any shadow clones. That would have been an extinction event.

  Excellent chapter. Your Kyuubi mode was very original-flavored, and I love it. He's not stupid or mindless; he just has different values!

  And, of course, Orochimaru just died. Kinda surprised he didn't stick around for longer, but at this point there's no real guarantee for *anyone*, so I wasn't *too* surprised.

    Canon Orochimaru has multiple methods of immortality and reviving himself, so I bet rational Orochimaru is going to be even tougher to kill.

      On the other hand, characters do drop like flies in this story...

  I was again completely wrong with my predictions. They now own a village so is Naruto a kage now technically? :p

  I was totally thinking that they were going to deal with smart oro onstead of them other sannins, but this was pretty cool.

  Def one of the top fics I've read so far.

  Prediction: Kabuto dies next chapter but only after Karin appears and gets killed off too. Then we'll see a time skip of a few weeks or so to jump over the team's learning to manage the Sound village. Where they'll learn about Pein where he is either attacking Konoha (bet they'll be happy to have Konoha off their backs) or approaching them to make a partnership deal.

  Is it just me that finds it funny that it's SASUKE who is the Kage of Sound instead of Naruto?

  Before, someone said 
  > This story has some of the highest concentration of plot per sentence I've ever seen. Well done.

  I cannot agree enough! Every chapter is cramming in more and more plot than the one before it! I sincerely believe this story will die of plot toxicity. Let's see if we can get an overdose of plot. ;)
  ```

- u/scruiser:
  ```
  So a few predictions:

  * How does Shadow Clone interact with Kyuubi mode?  Maybe a shadow clone could hold onto his original values?  Bet this comes up later.

  * Anyone else think Kabuto is just playing for time until Orochimaru can respawn again?  No way he has really just surrendered like that.  This way he can keep Sasuke around to use the seal to help revive him.

  And once again, Naruto is oblivious to Hinata's feelings!  I'm sure he'll figure it out eventually...

  Kyuubi Naruto is hilarious.  Evil and horrific, but hilarious.
  ```

    > * How does Shadow Clone interact with Kyuubi mode?  Maybe a shadow clone could hold onto his original values?  Bet this comes up later.

    Shadow clones split the chakra of the caster, and the beast's chakra overwhelms Naruto's chakra, so I would bet shadow clones cast by the beast would have the same utility function it does.

    > * Anyone else think Kabuto is just playing for time until Orochimaru can respawn again?  No way he has really just surrendered like that.  This way he can keep Sasuke around to use the seal to help revive him.

    If Kabuto thinks Naruto can just kill Orochimaru normally, then there'd be no reason for Kabuto to think resurrecting Orochimaru would help and he would comply with Naruto just to survive.  On the other hand, if Kabuto's been eavesdropping on the latter part of the group's conversation, he'd almost certainly be plotting against them knowing that Naruto wouldn't call on the beast again.
    ```

      ```
      I think scruiser was asking about a shadow clone made before he allows the Kyuubi access to his body. Shadow clones maintain autonomy, so it's possible one body could allow the Kyuubi access while the others don't.

- u/Shadawn:
  ```
  Nice execution of jiinchuriku concept. Changed values while leaving other cognitive functions unimpaired explains why Suicide Bomber Jinchuuriki won't work - they can return and enact vengeance upon their "original"side.

  I'm looking forward into what could Naruto do with Sound resources.
