## Explain/munchkin the body-flicker/flash step technique

### Post:

If you've watched anime, you've seen this ability: Two mystic warriors face off, seemingly at an impasse, then *bam*: Suddenly one of them has appeared next to/behind the other. It's not teleportation, the characters assure the audience, merely "high speed movement". But how would this actually work? 

Tvtropes describes it thusly: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep

The ability differs from teleportation in the sense that you can’t move through walls or up into the air or reach areas you wouldn’t normally be able to, but other than that it functions much the same: The “super speed” certainly doesn’t seem to translate into increased momentum, and the characters don’t get super-thinking-speed out of it either. My current best model is that it functions as a kind of time-travel ability, reducing the amount of time that passes as you move from point A to point B without changing anything else. But I’d love to hear how you guys would interpret it as this explanation is far from perfect.

If you lived in a world where this ability existed, how would you model it in way that’s consistent with what it does, and how would you try to use it to your advantage? I’m thinking about the Naruto world specifically (for my upcoming awesomecool rationalist!Narutofic) but I imagine it’s much the same for other settings where this ability exists. Please let me know your thoughts!

  Oddly I think Code Geass had my favourite interpretation of the flash step.
  The character in question wasn't moving supernaturally fast, all the powers were mind based, he slowed the perception of everyone within a couple hundred foot radius down. To their eyes he seemed to be just disappearing and reappearing but from his perspective he had to run all the way over to wherever he wanted to go as normal and everyone else just kind of waited for him.

    Interesting. But what's stopping the character from just instantly killing everyone as he moves?

      ```
      The character in question's heart stopped (It's an anime, let's ignore how the rest of him didn't) so for however long he was using it, he was doing it at normal speeds but with no blood flowing, so his stamina was really terrible. Not to mention overuse in close succession could cause cardiac arrest.
      ```

      I think it was primarily a stamina thing. Enough time for a quick sprint and stab of one person but not enough to clear a room.

  There was this book, *Kung Fu High School* by Ryan Gattis, which by rights always seemed like it should be forgettable, but stuck with me for a long time. The flash step is the single "supernatural" thing in the book, and (like a lot of things in the book) it's played for horror. I can quote some of it here (mostly because it's out of print, and unless you buy one of the used copies on Amazon it's unlikely that anyone here will ever read it):

  > When he quit just before his sixteenth birthday, his record was 2,412-0-0. He was a ghost. Never been injured. Never even been thrown. And for his last full year on the mat in Hong Kong, never even been hit. Get your head around that. Not a single opponent scored a hit on him. All the scorecards are kept in the main tournament hall in HK. You can go look if you want. But that's not really necessary, because if you saw Jimmy's final fight to defend his world championship in the open category (any style was acceptable), you would've seen everything you'd ever need to see. That was the day he fought The Bulgarian.

  > Nobody I know knows The Bulgarian's real name and if they did they couldn't pronounce it, so everyone, even the TV announcers, just called him The Bulgarian. Supposedly he was the biggest-ever threat to Jimmy's domination in the sport. Cue and I didn't believe that for a second. We heard the same thing every year. It was all just hype. We knew Jimmy couldn't be defeated. It didn't matter that The Bulgarian had been stolen from his gypsy parents and taken off to Mongolia when he was a kid and raised in the mountains like some wild, latter-day Genghis Khan warrior.

  > The World Championships were being held in London that year and there was this huge procession in front of Buckingham Palace and then down in front of Big Ben, I remember watching that. The best part though was standing room only in the giant event hall. There must have been twenty thousand people in there. Serious. The atmosphere was ridiculous. People were even singing: "Hey throw that fellah / We said a-hey throw that fellah / Jimm-y throw that fellah / hey throw that fellah," to the tune of "Guantanamera." But Jimmy didn't throw that fellah. He looked disinterested for much of the match, and it was amazing to watch him avoid full-strength spinning kicks by centimeters, and hammer-throw punches by millimeters. The timed first and second rounds ended with no points scored and the third and final round was much the same until the last two seconds.

  > To this day, every person who saw that fight swears Jimmy somehow teleported himself behind the Bulgarian to score the hit that won it. They showed it on television for months on super-slow-motion replay but watching it was like watching a jumpy old movie that was missing frames somewhere. See, Jimmy was in front of The Bulgarian, not two inches from him, with his heels on the out-of-bounds line, as the big challenger opened his arms wide and was bringing them down on Jimmy. There was no way he could escape. There was really no room, nowhere to go. I remember grabbing Cue's leg in the shady bar we had snuck into to watch the match on pay-per-view at one in the afternoon. I knew he had had it. Cue knew it was over. Everyone watching knew it was over.

  > The announcers were even starting the sentence, "A remarkable run has finally en—," when Jimmy disappeared/reappeared behind The Bulgarian, extended his right leg, and executed a perfect kick to the back of his opponent's weight-bearing knee and sent him sprawling forward onto the out-of-bounds part of the mat. I'd love to tell you that I jumped and screamed and shouted and was so happy that Jimmy won, but I didn't. My mouth was just as open as Cue's and we were trying to figure out how he did it. It was shocking for real.

  > The cameras timed it afterward. Jimmy literally disappeared for a thousandth of a second before reappearing and winning the match. This didn't go over too well. Back in China, a leading priest denounced Jimmy as a dark spirit and people really got scared.

  I've always liked the image of a discontinuity; it's not teleportation, not exactly, it's like the world changed its form in a fraction of a second to arrange itself in a different way.

    Ah, as always, you have the best reply. How terribly unfair to the others! But as cool as that segment was, I don't actually see how your description is falsifiably different from teleportation. Whether it is Jimmy that teleports or the world, surely it amounts to the exact same thing?
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      I actually don't think this is the best reply. It's just got a lot of text, and people like text.

      Teleportation is a transversal; it's moving from one place to another without crossing the intervening space. The problem with the flash step as a concept (when people are being insistent that this isn't *actually* teleportation) is that it implies an enormous amount of speed and strength that the writer usually doesn't want the protagonist to have for other things, like punching people. After all, if you can flash step behind someone, then you can almost certainly just punch them in the face with that same speed. (This applies to a lot of answers in this thread, which leave me scratching my head and wondering about why it's not just a ridiculous offensive power.)

      Rearranging the universe is more like an optical illusion than teleportation. You know [that classic image](http://i.imgur.com/6ZkgfUO.gif) that's sometimes an old woman and sometimes a young girl? It's more similar to that shift in perspective than just changing someone's position in the world, even if the *result* of one person moving some distance is the same.
      ```

      - u/Sophronius:
        ```
        The problem you describe is precisely why I posed the question: How can I make this ability as it is described work in a rationalist story, without a rationalist character immediately breaking it in the most obvious way possible?

        What you describe functions, for all intents and purposes, exactly like teleportation. There's no requirement on having to move through the space in between, and the camera actually shows the person vanishing. In other words there's no testable difference between what you describe and teleportation, which means that for story purposes it would work exactly the same, unless I'm being dense and I am misunderstanding you.
        ```

- u/Kishoto:
  ```
  I'd probably do straight teleportation, but have the "cost" for the technique scale up exponentially as the distance increases. Using Naruto-specific terms, it would be like "all genin can cross this room, some more than others. Most chunin can cross this room and get through the wall to the other one. Few jonin can cross the 2nd room as well. And kage can just barely get to a 3rd room. And fuck jinchuuriki, those guys are crazy."

  And the technique needs to come with some setup, and follow through time. Doesn't have to be long, maybe half a second to a full second. I'm just thinking it would be obnoxious to have that exponential rule, only for some smart ass to get the idea to just chain together a bunch of little hops and become a God on the battle field.  So maybe you activate it, move, and when you land, there's a brief little period where you're disoriented, as your body takes a second to get used to being put back together. This period can get shorter and shorter (but never fully disappear) with training as you get used to it.

  Travel time wise, I say you could have it be near-instant, with the understanding that the user's body is converted into some sort of super light substance when moved. Maybe the momentum of the original body is transferred? Idk. 

  I think having the flash step technique as depicted in a lot of shonen anime is really difficult in a rationalist setting. It would mean all fights would be decided in the first few seconds, unless the combatants are stupidly, evenly matched, or there's some reason they can't use the technique. 

  But....for the sake of being helpful. Here's an idea. For the flash step technique, have it function such that the person is only able to move so fast because they use their energy (ki, chakra, whatever) to "shunt" their mass into another dimension. The better/more powerful you are, the more of your mass you shunt, the faster you move. Obviously, it's very risky to learn, consumes a good deal of energy and if you are disrupted mid-motion, things would be...unpleasant to say the least. And due to the mass being shunted, you can't simply whack someone at super speeds. I mean, you CAN, but make it such that the speed you could gain isn't worth the damage suffered by your hyper fast waif thin constitution mid-shunshin.

  Well, that's all I got. Can only hope anything from this wall of text is helpful. Good luck :D

  EDIT: Oh, and for my flash step idea, due to how it works, you can only get those super speeds if you start the motion **before** your mass is shunted, as you have little to no mass with which to influence your momentum when traveling. Experienced users, of course, know that they should keep enough mass on hand (and accept the speed loss) to be able to change direction enough that they have the time to reel their mass back in, assuming something in the situation changes. And of course, there's a price for going too fast. Little mass + less time to react? Uh oh....

  I remember reading a manga once that had an interesting interpretation of the flash step, and inspired by that, here is my shot:

  Flash Stepping involves great acceleration, so the principal part of the technique is cushioning those forces with <magic>. Then; the user imbues one or both legs with <magic>, and can release said energy with a mighty kick-off to accelerate almost instantly to sub-sonic velocities.

  It is recommended to use one leg for take-off and one for landing. 

  Advanced techniques include:

  * <magic-ing> an arm for the landing and using both legs for movement to allow changing direction.
  * Using <magic> to reduce air-resistance to allow super-sonic velocities.
  * Using <magic> to reinforce take-off surface to reduce property damage.
  * Applying misdirection <magic> to mask sounds, visual image, etc. to make the movement appear instantaneous for intimidation purposes.

  This rather neatly expands Flash-Step into an array of techniques distinct from teleportation.

  If Mind-Magic is available, it can be rendered even more impressive.

  It would generally be used to *dodge* or *disengage,* not attack.
  ```

- u/ulyssessword:
  ```
  I'd model it as a time stop that you can't think in: you'd have to queue the entire sequence ahead of time.  For example:

  - The person thinks "I will stop time, take three steps forward, then resume time."  They then stop time, move, and resume, taking all of the actions properly.
  - The person thinks "I will stop time, turn slightly left, go five steps, turn right, go another two steps, and then turn right again, and resume time."  They then stop time, take three steps, trip and fall, and flail their legs against the ground for the remaining actions.  They resume time lying face down on the ground.

  There would probably need to be some limitations, like "the time stops must be exactly 30 subjective seconds" to prevent popping out in mid attack, and "you still have sub-conscious balance" so that people don't fall over all the time.
  ```

  - u/Chronophilia:
    ```
    Screw subconscious balance, this is a power that requires Spartan-level training to use! Put as many psychological limitations on it as you want. A true master will learn to cope with them.
    ```

- u/ThatDamnSJW:
  ```
  So a possible munchkinable mechanism that isn't a complete game-breaker, like timetravel, is that using enough ki/magic/aura/blahblah in a particular way lets you warp your body's physics/interactions/aura/blahblah. When you stop, you have to slow down to dewarp.

  You and anything you're carrying through a flash step move faster. Nonliving solids become denser or stronger to you, so you can't phase through the walls nearby; gases become weaker, so that they don't drill holes in your body. Liquids act like solids or gases, depending on whether water-walking's possible. If you want people to be able to attack while flashstepping, living materials become stronger.

  To the average person, like a shonen hero or a bronze age wuxia warrior, this looks and feels like they're just being fast. You can make the warping effect scale to how much blahblah is being used by a person so that Protagonistman can show how much more powerful he is than Lord Deathface or something.

  Of course, you can't just warp your arm for a punch, because having different parts of your body follow different physics is a recipe for disaster. Maybe a high-level regenerator can, and they're going to be a boss-fight anyway, so it makes sense.

  If you're rationalist and not rational, or if you have some sort of Negimaverse style sequel set in the future, this becomes a fun sort of magitech. You can have *ki-powered FTL*, which also explains why you need humans on board your ships and why ship captains need to be badasses. Maybe your mechs are built so that the warp effects them too, but you can't use the effect on nonhumanoid objects, which lets you have *robot swordfights in space*.

  If you shunt negative energy to future self, it could work: A) Push negative energy forwards in time. B) Express sudden energy surplus as kinetic energy. C) Recieve negative energy packet, bringing velocity back to around 0 (minus energy lost to friction, drag, etc.).
  ```

- u/Kodix:
  ```
  The way I liked to think about it for Naruto is some sort of a pre-calculated burst of speed to reach a particular position. There would be no awareness while flash-stepping, and the g-forces, even cushioned by magic/chakra, would require great endurance - which sounds fine to me in terms of balance/difficulty of the technique.

  In practice, this would mean that you can only really flash-step in your line of sight and you need to stop for some duration to re-orient yourself before flash-stepping again. You need to calculate/precisely learn the amount of chakra necessary to move to your target, and you could probably only move in a straight line.

  Also, you would need to be *extremely* careful not to, say, flash-step through a ninja wire and get decapitated. 

  Let's say you can't throw a kunai while hand because you do not have the reaction speed to release it from your hand. Also, when hitting a solid object you're not sheathing in that g-force-dampening magic miracle chakra, the technique collapses and backfires somehow. The backfire can't be so dangerous that nobody uses it, but there has to be *some* way it can't just be used as a certain-kill suicide technique.
  ```

  - u/Sophronius:
    ```
    Much of that makes sense, except for one thing: In Naruto, the way flash-step is used almost always ends with the character standing entirely still. That is entirely at odds with a sudden burst of speed! Unless, of course, the technique has a built-in speed-stopper aspect to it, but that gets a complexity penalty.
    ```

    - u/Kodix:
      ```
      >Unless, of course, the technique has a built-in speed-stopper aspect to it, but that gets a complexity penalty.

      Yeah, that's how I imagined it. I don't think the added complexity is a real issue - this is a technique consciously created for a particular aim. If it was ridiculously simple and yet only used by very experienced ninja (jounin), that'd be strange.

      That said, I agree the other suggestions are more elegant. I particularly like the one where it feels to the user like a bubble of stopped time. Just make it cost exponentially more the longer it lasts to prevent everyone using it as obvious cognitive enhancement, and there you go.
      ```

- u/protagnostic:
  ```
  Handwavy not-actually-physics answer: The technique temporarily suppresses the strong nuclear force, reducing the user's proton mass to nearly zero, but momentum is conserved, so velocity increases dramatically to compensate. When the suppression ends, the user's mass returns to normal and velocity drops back down.

  This way you don't have to worry about megaton punches from super speed mode etc, although you have to do some handwaving about why the user's constituent atoms don't just immediately disintegrate without the strong nuclear force holding them together. Maybe you also suppress the electromagnetic force so that nuclei can just be held together by gravity. I think we can leave the weak force alone.

  Anyway, so now you're 99% less massive and moving at extremely high speed. Presumably maintaining the suppression gets exponentially more difficult the longer the period of time you need to maintain it for, which is why you can't travel very far with it (but only linearly more difficult the more mass you have, for some reason, because otherwise kids would flash-step around adults like it was, no pun intended, child's play). And the suppression field has to be centered on you, I guess, so you can't use it on other people unless you're carrying them. And you something something chakra to part the air in front of you so it that friction against it doesn't set you on fire.

  So that's how I'd model it. As for munchkinning it, that depends whether we have knowledge in-universe that this is the mechanism of action, or whether it's just a fairly opaque "high speed movement jutsu". 
  If we know that we're fiddling with the strength of coupling constants, first we shit our pants in fear, and then we very carefully experiment with doing it to inanimate objects to find the limits of the ability. Also to figure out where the mass is going. Mass is clearly conserved by normal interactions, but normal interactions don't change the coupling constants, so have we found a way around conservation of mass? Or is the suppressed mass going somewhere else, corresponding to a coupling-constant increase in another area?
  If we don't know the mechanism of action, but we do know the exponential-difficulty-increase thing, then I suppose I look for a way to continuously turn it on and off for the shortest possible time interval, to maximize average velocity.

          ```
          Ooh, yeah, I guess the allowed orbitals would increase significantly in radii as the electron-nucleus attraction decreased in strength, unless you correspondingly increased the strength of the Higgs interaction to make leptons more massive.

          You know, maybe it's easier to just say "It's magic!"

  There was a comic book called Steam Wars, where being a riff on Star Wars in a Steampunk world, their version of the force worked on some sort of uncertainty principle. A Quantum Dragoon could bend reality and teleport by decoupling cause and effect and maneuvering faster than causality will allow, among other things. It plays out as if reality has bad ping time or framerate, which is enough like a flash step that I suppose it's worth looking into. That or some sort of Speedforce analog exists in universe that allows for flash stepping, which works because Speedforce explains itself for nobody.
  ```

- u/Shadawn:
  ```
  Some time ago I actually thought a good model for super-speed that doesn't include super-strength. It included super-speeder not actually moving fast, but rapidly teleporting very short (~1mm or less) distances to get towards his destination. This way speedster never has more momentum that usual, thus not allowing heavy punches. It also doesn't allow to go through walls for obvious reasons. You can't throw fast projectiles with that. You can't even land a hits with that - "real momentum" for your punching hand wouldn't probably be aligned with punch direction. This also fixes sound barrier/friction heating. These teleportations would probably be subconscious - common user believing in "common sense" physics may not even notice anything besides speed boost.

  Optimizing this includes learning to hit (for example, getting punching motion before activating super-speed, and then cease to microport so that your fist flies towards his head). Actually, if (common-sense momentum) after the technique is the same as before, it'll take a lot of time to just learn to use it not from standing position.
  ```

- u/DCarrier:
  ```
  I figure it's like an Alcubierre drive. You move from point A to point B, but you don't actually gain the momentum or have the time dilation or anything. Also, since your perception isn't sped up, you have to plan the path beforehand, and it's entirely possible to accidentally run into someone's sword if you're not paying attention.

  The problem is that an Alcubierre drive, or anything else where you mess with spacetime, doesn't work well if you're touching anything. You have your space-time where time flows to one side as well as the future, and the ground just goes to the future, so you need space in between where time flows to one side, but not to such a great extent.
  ```
