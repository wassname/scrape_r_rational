  > “Early this morning,” said the Admiral.  “Parliament traveled to Paragon for security, and conducted a vote in secret.  With a narrow majority, they’ve authorized us to take broad military action against Commonplace and the mob.”

  I can't tell if this is actually what happened, or if the current violence just gave Paragon the opportunity/motivation for a soft coup. The story is plausible, but also "the government voted in secret to give us a bunch of power, honest" is inherently suspicious.

  I also *really* don't see this going how Paragon wants it to. For one, I suspect that this:
  > “Thanks to the recent broadcast on Verity,” shouted the admiral.  “Public opinion has shifted!  Only a hair, but it’s growing.  Commonplace’s false image has shattered, and our most loyal supporters have rallied as one!”

  is a pretty fucking optimistic take. If "public opinion has shifted a hair" is what they're saying when they're trying to rally the troops, how bad must the reality be? No, the rioting makes it clear that they're losing the people's favor. That's only going to get worse thanks to how brutally they're suppressing the riots. For example:
  > Thirty-two right thumbs sliced off tattooed hands, spurting blood.  The Commonplace thugs cried out in pain, doubling over, losing their grip on weapons, distracted.

  > ...

  > Blood spurted out of the enemies, and sixteen heads fell off their bodies.  They hadn’t even touched him.

  One incident, less than five minutes, 32 people maimed and 16 people killed. This sort of response doesn't engender much goodwill. I imagine they'll only make matters worse by performing numerous simultaneous military operations on domestic soil against an organization that has widespread public support.

  Paragon seems to have essentially abandon the fight for public opinion in the hopes that it won't matter if they destroy Commonplace. Even if they're right about that (and I'm not sure they are), it's still a big gamble to take when whether or not they can actually do enough military damage to Commonplace in a short enough span of time is very much up in the air. After all, Tunnel Vision has consistently been one step ahead of Paragon's best and brightest, and I don't see a reason why that would change now.

    Yeah, I have the feeling that Grace played all of them. Maybe something involving the host of Verity? We never found out what happened to her.

      I think it's more likely the play revolves around the intel Paragon has acquired and is planning their operations around. Either it's false, or else Commonplace is aware that Paragon has the intel and has taken the appropriate countermeasures.

  That's a nice fantasy you have there. Would be a shame if your superior were to immediately smash it against the ground and spit on the remains...
