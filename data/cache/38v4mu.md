## Super-simple ways to allow text selection at FF.net

### Post:

2 simple methods, take your pick:

Method 1) simply change the url from "www.fanfiction.net/..." to "m.fanfiction.net/...". You're done. The mobile version works fine on a desktop computer.
(You need to take out the "www" element.)

Method 2) [Go here](https://alanhogan.com/code/text-selection-bookmarklet), then drag the button marked "Allow Text Selection" to your bookmarsk bar. When you're looking at a story on fanfiction.net, click the bookmark - voila, you can select text. Advantage to this method is it preserves the Made-For-PC-Screen formatting.

EDIT: Method 3) Install the Chrome extension "[Selectable](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selectable-for-fanfiction/jcidlhgdoojamkbpmhbpgldmajnobefd)", or "[RightToClick](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/righttoclick/)" for Firefox. Thank you PeridexisErrant for this method.

(I know this isn't the normal discussion topic for this sub, but I've seen it discussed here several times, and this demographic's big on life hacks, so I decided to share.)

  I've been meaning to copy over everything I have on ff.net and get it into Scrivener so that I can make "canonical" copies for distribution/mirroring. I'll keep this in mind. I can understand the impetus for prohibiting copy+paste on stories, but it's one of the more asinine qualities of the site.

  If you really want to download the stories for your own personal reading pleasure, try [FicSave](http://www.ficsave.com/), [FanFictionDownloader](http://www.fanfictiondownloader.net/), or even [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/).

  [m.fanfiction.net](https://m.fanfiction.net/) is best when you want to be able to edit/modify your copy of the story directly.

    Fanfic-downloader now called fanficfare, installable with pip in python.

  I have NoScript installed so I just marked the domain as untrusted (I use the "insecure" unobtrusive trust-by-default mode and then blacklist domains that use unfriendly Javascript).  The website works fine with Javascript completely disabled, with only a few quirks such as the chapter dropdown not working.

    This is what I use, I temporarily enable scripts when I have to log in, but keep them disabled otherwise.

  If you're on chrome, or any other browser that lets you do this, right click and choose "inspect element". On the console that opens up ctrl-F for "-webkit-user-select". It will be set to "none". Change it to anything else, and it will let you select text.

    Alternatively, you can press Ctrl-U and just copy the base HTML.
    ```

      You'd lose the formatting and character escapes (\&amp; signs all over the place), but that's easy enough to fix by hand.
      ```

        I've never had that problem in any of the stories I've copied--see [this comment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/38v4mu/supersimple_ways_to_allow_text_selection_at_ffnet/cry6p8n)
        ```

          Oh, I misunderstood what you were going for. Yes, copying the raw HTML into another HTML document works fine - I misread it as copying raw HTML into a text document, which would be readable but annoying.
          ```

- u/ToaKraka:
  ```
  On Chrome, you can just hit Ctrl-U and copy the base HTML into Notepad++, then manually edit out the extra stuff at the top and bottom.

  Alternatively, you can write a simple program to download every chapter in a story sequentially and clean up the formatting at the same time.

  Once I've got the HTML files, I use (a rather old version of) [Sigil](https://github.com/user-none/Sigil) to compile them into a .epub file; [I've got literally hundreds of files on my computer, phone, and Nook.](http://i.imgur.com/EDLfFRG.png)

  With Chrome:  [Selectable extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selectable-for-fanfiction/jcidlhgdoojamkbpmhbpgldmajnobefd).  Similar extensions exist for Firefox.

    ```
    I'm here 7 years in the future too. XD

  ```
  Why didn't I think of using the mobile version of the site before!? Genius! Thank you so much!

  You beautiful soul now i can save them from being deleted and gone forever
