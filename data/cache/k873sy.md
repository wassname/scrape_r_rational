## The Fall of Doc Future ePub?

### Post:

I’ve seen this story mentioned here in the past, and I’ve started reading the first chapter on the author’s Tumbler, but I really prefer using my e-reader. Does anyone know where I can find an ePub file of the story?

### Comments:

  There is no epub because I have not yet entirely given up on the idea of turning revised versions of Fall and Skybreaker's Call into self-published commercial ebooks, but for the last few years continuing to write new serialized material (and eventually finishing Maker's Ark) has had a higher priority. I am using the motivation and energy I have available as best as I can manage, sorry 8-)

    You absolutely should, but I really feel you on the using the energy and motivation you have. Your work is easily of publishable quality, though.

  There isn't one. Your best bet is to use one of the website rippers to build an epub. Doc is active here and on twitter so feel free to tell him if you want to exchange dollar votes for a copy too.
