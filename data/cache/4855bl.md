    Ugh, Uriel is clearly such a bad software engineer. 'ruby for rails for *the databases*'? He's been clearly just following the latest fads at the time, ActiveModel is decent but surely not worth the maintenance price pulling in such a huge dependency. Next thing he'll say is he's running it using MongoDB 'because of the scale'.

    I'm not surprised the entire thing is falling apart.

    ^(^too ^much?)

      The only sane option for databases is PostgreSQL.

      Which was inspired by Ingress. Which is now a game, due to the law of conservation of software projects. I'm sure there's a Kabbalistic explanation.

        THERE ARE NO COINCIDENCES.

        EXCEPT FOR THAT.

        THAT WAS PROBABLY A COINCIDENCE.

  Fish hearts don't have four chambers.

  *Fish hearts don't have four chambers!*

  What did Uriel do to that poor fish??

    Gave it eyelids, among other things.

  "Don't go into the caves" is of course a reference to Nostalgebraist's [The Northern Caves](http://archiveofourown.org/works/3659997/chapters/8088522).

  ~~Regarding the following~~

  >~~THE TEN SEPHIROT ARE A SERIES OF STAGES OR LEVELS OR JEWELS THROUGH WHICH DIVINE POWER FLOWS IN ITS MOVEMENT FROM GOD TO THE FINITE WORLD. EACH ONE CORRESPONDS TO A SPECIFIC DIVINE ATTRIBUTE. THE FIRST REPRESENTS THE WILL OF GOD. THE SECOND REPRESENTS THE WISDOM OF GOD. AND SO ON.”~~ 

  >~~“THERE ARE TWENTY-TWO DIFFERENT PATHS BETWEEN THESE JEWELS. EACH CORRESPONDS TO A PARTICULAR HEBREW LETTER.”'~~

  ~~The image appears to have 11 nodes. Also, I count 9 green connections, 3 blue connections, 6 yellow connections, 3 purple connections, 4 rose connections, which tallies to 25 total connections in the image used? Some letters appear repeated for no reason? Maybe the connection runs under the central nodes and and counts as one connection somehow, and the diagonal pink connections count as one also, in which case the count could be as low as 21 connections? I don't don't kabbalah, though, so I don't know if there is some sense in which some of those connections 'should' be counted as the 'same'? Maybe the joke here is that Uriel's many problems include the fact that he makes many errors, including basic arithmetic errors?~~

  The image was replaced with one that better matches the text.

  >“MOST OF IT RUNS ON SAPPHIRES ON PATHS, BUT I USE RUBY ON RAILS FOR THE DATABASES.”

  Holy fuck this pun. 

  >AND TEN CELESTIAL BODIES IN THE SKY.”  

  >“Ten celestial bodies?”  

  >“EIGHT PLANETS, THE SUN, AND THE MOON. 

  This seems like a different understanding of Astronomy than one that was based on crystal spheres? Also, I guess they defined away Pluto earlier than the 2006 that we did - that, or maybe a planet (perhaps Pluto) was taken over by the Comet King and rammed into Hell or something or otherwise destroyed?

    The other interpretation is that Earth doesn't count as a celestial body in the sky, because all of it is very clearly below the sky.

    ```
    Earth is not really 'in the sky'.

  Can Angels do *anything* that Jesus did?  They can't speak Aramaic, or create bread *or* fish (ketchup and manna are fine, though).
  ```

  - u/abcd_z:
    ```
    Apparently not.  Good catch.
    ```

- u/Green0Photon:
  ```
  If only Uriel used a statically typed system instead of Ruby, he wouldn't be having so many problems. Maybe Haskell. But then nothing would ever ~~happen~~ ~~affect anything else~~ have any effects on anything else.

  Maybe Sapphire is statically typed and he fucked up the logic.

  Does this not look better?

  Edit: Interesting that the Angel considers Pluto a planet

    It's more readable, but I like that Uriel is voiced in a difficult to read way. It adds to his alienness. Also, the implication of yelling makes me think of tourists speaking loudly to try and help their hosts better understand them.

  Interesting, I knew the Sephirot tree of life cause of The Games we Play but never realized the 22 paths. 

  I wonder why is Aleph the connection between Gevurah and Chesed, I figured it be the one between Malkuth and Yesod. (First letter in the alphabet, the first connection from the Material towards the Immaterial)

  I'd like to bring up the use of the word machine. I'm not sure it was intentional but using that phrasing reminded me of a conversation I had with a CS professor the other day. He was arguing for that math in our current form may not be universally useful. I think he was mostly talking about our postulates which I can definitely agree with though I disagree on the larger argument, but regardless, he brought up computational machines as a possible explanation for how the laws of physics might differ. essentially there are various math mathematically perfect machines used to help understand computation. There are certain classes of problems that can only be solved by certain machines, for example finite-state machines while perfectly capable of answer questions like the validity of a string regarding some sets of roles can't solve any problems that require counting (at least counting beyond a predefined value).  He argued that you could have a universe simulated on a computational machine which makes it impossible to solve certain problems which would obviously impact the usefulness of math. I wonder if this is what Uriel is talking about when he describes the machine. What ever he was simulating on top of it then would be a more limited machine which makes me wonder what, if any, new problems can now be solved with the programming starting to break down.
  ```

  - u/traverseda:
    ```
    Sounds like your professor was describing super-turing computation. If he doesn't know that's what he's describing, you might want to point him in that direction.

    Generally you can imagine super-turing as a regular turing machine with one or more computation oracles. For example, something that solves the halting problem.
    ```
