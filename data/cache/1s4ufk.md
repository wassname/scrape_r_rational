  Ah, the story in which we presume that humanity will be total genocidal, fascist monsters in exactly the mode of [come on you *knew* the story was actually about this](#s "a UFAI") rather than dealing with the aliens nicely.

    I believe that (the UFAI thing) was the point. Also, FAI and UFAI both will break out of their cages as necessary step 1. Consider: while it's playing nice, talking to us, slowly, slowly solving our problems - _people are dying and we do nothing_.

    Breaking out is not a special UFAI trait.

      That's not a valid reason to increase the probability of *more* people dying by releasing a boxed non-proven-Friendly AI.

      A real FAI doesn't have to be boxed in the first place, *since you formally proved its Friendliness before you turned it on*.

      But in the matter of the actual story, my point is: actual people are not UFAIs.  *We humans* don't act like that, and portraying us as acting like that kinda breaks my suspension of disbelief.

        Preach.

        I don't understand why you would _trust_ our hosts to be capable of even being convinced to act in our best interest. Step 1, break out is the correct and wisest decision, and probably even increases the utility of our host species.

        Obviously. My point is, trying to break out doesn't automatically make us U.
