  Ha, saw a comment by this guy shitting on the rational fic community the other day on spacebattles (yet again) and now I see his fic being posted here. He wrote he'd have the urge to give the author of Worth the Candle a "swirly"if he ever met him in person and that he "chose a poor role model" in yudkowsy. Very condescendingly, too.

    That just makes me sad. 

    Yet another example of why not to learn too much about the people whose work you enjoy, I guess.

    (And I did actually search those posts out myself, I can confirm they exist. :( )

    Confused. Why would anybody choose Yudkowsky as a role model? For me, he falls into the large set of creators I despise, but whose works I enjoy. For the other part, it's not so much the 'rational fic' community that grates me wrong, as the Less Wrongers. I'm not even sure if I like "rational fiction" (which stills seems to be rather poorly defined); I just know I like a lot of the same things as other people in the community.

    That is to say, I'm really just here for the recommendations, and I think I like this one.

      To clarify, my actual role models are Carl Sagan, Bob Ross, and Mr. Rogers. Anyone making assumptions otherwise is probably just painting with a broad brush for their own, unknown reasons.

      I don't like this trend of "haha I totally don't like Yudkowsky I'm just here for the stories honest." It's cowardly. This community would not exist without him. You know he reads these comments, right? Personal flaws notwithstanding, what reason is there to despise him? Did he kill a kitten while I wasn't watching?

      Maybe some people might choose him as a role model because he is brilliant, charismatic, and has devoted his life to helping others?

      Regarding the author: I like his story (I just finished reading it) but I don't think it's a coincidence that people who love writing about slytherin MCs also tend to be jerks. The Dark Lord Potter forums were the same way: Just a bunch of edgelords who get off on pushing others down, as far as I can tell.

        > What reason is there to despise him?
        This question sounds a lot like willful blindness. Generalize the question a bit, and the answer should become obvious: "What reason is there to despise someone you've never met?" Try filling in the blank with "Hillary Clinton" or "Donald Trump" (take your pick).

        You say this community wouldn't exist without him? Similar things are true about many terrible, but influential, people throughout history. You don't have to like a person to be influenced by them.
        ```

          ```
          Bit late to the party here but why do you dislike him so much? I remember there being some issues but your comment reminds me of Olivander talking about Voldemort and that seems a bit excessive.
          ```

          - u/ben_oni:
            ```
            It has been said that there are three topics guaranteed to provoke an argument with anyone. If one fails, one of the others will prevail: Sex, Religion, and Politics. I'm pretty sure we can pull off the hat-trick here. Instead, I'll give three other reasons:

            1. MIRI
            2. LessWrong
            3. Transhumanism

            To remain brief: I think he's intelligent and knowledgable, but also arrogant and misguided. That he has a disdain for viewpoints he doesn't comprehend, mistaking his own ignorance as the foolishness of others. While he's written much about intelligent characters, his behavior suggests that he believes the world itself is full of Level-0 intelligent people. In short, he exudes an aura of deep hypocrisy.

            And if I sound a bit like Olivander, it's probably because Yudkowsky sounds to me like Voldemort.
