    It's not that Death Stars can't be used well, it's that it's difficult to avoid falling into the trap of overused tropes thanks to the success of Star Wars.  Iserlohn Fortress as an example off the top of my head.

  No spoil of the last movie ahead! 

  There is so many sins committed in this franchise, you don't even need to get to the not rational part.

  I mean, there is no consistency or coherence. I'll take merely three examples that for me are worth a million sinful details :

  1/ If you are Han Solo, you can apparently time going out of hyperspace to land between a planetary shield and the ground. Using your reflexes. At a speed greater than light. Seriously.

  2/ If you have a big starship threatening you, you can turn around and suicide hyperspace your starship into it. One wonder then why :

   2.1/ One doesn't use one of the expendable, mass produced and barely sentient droids to perform the suicide mission

   2.2/ One make convoluted plans to destroy a death star, losing scores of pilots in the process

   2.3/ One builds a BIG DEATH STAR in the first place when any big and expensive ship becomes a liability.

  3/ People doubt the Force exists, even if it played a major role in galactic history, that it is physically observable in blood (midisomething) and can be demonstrated with a simple telekinetic trick.

  That's why Star Wars (and especially the lasts movies) can't ever even reach the rational level of fiction. 

  1/ Not respecting basic / consistent rules of a universe

  2/ Not respecting precedents set by previous movies

  3/ Not having minimally intelligent protagonist we can empathize with

  Maybe I'm more harsh because star wars is popular and some better constructed and deserving science-fictions are not.

    I think this makes sense. Jedi are and have always been absurdly rare. Before Order 66, there were 10,000 in a galaxy with a population of 100 quadrillion. When there's so few, it's easier to just assume the well-documented cases are hoaxes. They could have been using hidden repulsors. And even assuming they do establish some people are telekinetic, that doesn't imply any more mystical importance than a repulsor has.
    ```

    - u/Zaurhack:
      ```
      OK why not. But why are jedi rare?

      In the first trilogy, well most were previously killed by a targeted offensive of the dark side. Fair enough.

      In the prequel, we learn that finding people with a strong aptitude must be done early, in order to stir them away from the dark side and train them. Fair enough.

      In the last trilogy, we have yet another spontaneous force user, who gets no training and still manage to beat trained jedi. Ahem. I mean if people with strong force aptitude can manage miracles without training, wouldn't jedi be more frequent?

      And here I'm only talking about internal consistency. Let's not get started on how an aptitude that is obviously genetically conditioned and gives you super powers should evolutionary be selected for and become the norm in a few 100ish generations. And please, please, let's not talk about the fact that they have access to CLONING TECHNOLOGY. please.

        the (now no longer canon) extended universe actually goes into a lot of this. everything below is drawn from extended universe sources.

        part of it is that the jedi rely on propaganda and that their fear of the darkside is a little overblown sometimes. there are a bunch of different force traditions scattered throughout the galaxy that are more neutral. the jedi are simply the most public and evangelical of force traditions.

        there isn't actually any sort of precedent for our mary sue protagonist being able to use force mind powers without training... so that one is just terrible writing. the lightsaber combat mastery could conceivably be justified because lightsaber martial arts are written into a sort of jedi akashic record, just floating out there for force users to telepathically stumble onto. I assume (charitably) this is what they were going for when rey switches to a more aggressive stance when she was training in the second movie. if only this scene had happened before the end of the first movie, it might have made a reasonable amount of sense. this phenomenon also accounts for darth vader. he was the most deadly lightsaber duelist in a thousand years primarily because of his strong force connection, not his dedication and practice (though that helps as well).

        regarding genetics and clones - secret programs of this sort to create super assassins from force users do exist, but are generally not scalable as the clones themselves are either mentally or physically unstable (clones of unusually powerful force users at least) or difficult to control (all your minions have their own super powers...) so they tend not to go anywhere. also, in the common races the genetically linked super powers only show up on their own around adulthood (individual is already at or past reproductive age) and even if you have the trait the powers show up very rarely and weakly in the untrained, thus survival of the fittest will in almost all cases fail to take this trait into account. there are some races that use the force for everyday things, and in these races they have basically 100% chance to be a force user. there is actually an empire that existed in prehistory that was like this, and a gradually increasing number of individuals being born without force sensitivity eventually led to a total collapse.

        EDIT: also I haven't seen the 3rd new movie, so I am not in a position to make any sort of comment on anything that happens there.

              Thrawn is a rational character, or at least as close as one gets in Star Wars. He learns from his mistakes, only punishes his subordinates for actual incompetence rather than simple bad luck, and almost always out-thinks his opponents to win. I will grant, though, that his ability to guess his opponents' next moves by studying their cultures' art is just magic by a different name - but at least it's *consistent* magic that, at least in principle, any other character in the story could learn with enough effort. It's quite notable that, before his final defeat, which is due to behind-the-scenes political maneuvering by Leia, *every single time* that Thrawn loses is due to coincidence and bad luck rather than anything under Thrawn's control.

            yeah, breaking from previous canon was the equivalent of deciding that they don't want this machine which creates gold, and instead they want to scrap it for parts and sell those. if they had just made some of the novels into movies then I suspect people would be a lot more excited when a new star wars comes out. there is probably a good 2-3 trilogies worth of material available before you even need to start looking at other eras like the old republic.

            if you do pick up some books, try "legacy of the force" and "fate of the jedi". both are nine book series which follow directly from the movies, both very good. if you want something shorter, you could check out crosscurrent and riptide: two books that follow jaden korr. he's the protagonist of the jedi academy game, a jedi who can make use of some dark side powers and not fall completely. it's a good example of how the extended universe can take something random, in this case the fact that the game lets you choose whatever powers you want because it is more fun that way, and make it into the basis for a good story.

        I was always under the impression that midichlorians are a symptom of Force sensitivity, not the cause. Force sensitivity is supposed to arise randomly among the general population, rather than follow bloodlines. So there aren't actually any "Force genes" that you can select for.

        The Skywalker lineage notwithstanding - that feels more like hack writers thinking "well if this guy is a badass space wizard, clearly his children should be too!". Because nothing makes me connect to a hero more than knowing he was literally born superior to everyone else in the story, right?

        Force abilities seem to be genetic. The Jedi have brought these people  into their order for millennia, and then enforced chastity on them.

        They've basically been bred out of the population.

        Granted, 10,000 people aren't going to be able to do that, but we only see the tail end of the order. They may have started with millions or billions for all we know.

        The point is, in the first trilogy, it was somehow believable. Jedi existed but they need training, they've long been exterminated, their memory is starting to fade, especially because the big totalitarian Empire has a vested interest in going revisionist on their asses. Fair. It's the current sequels that (like in many other things) dug themselves deeper into a mire of plot holes. Not that the original trilogy didn't have plot holes, but this one is really bringing things to the point of collapse, they can't step anywhere without contradicting something that was previously established.

        I always read *Star Wars* as following conventional Xianxia rules (even though those hadn't nearly been established when the first ones came out): there's *qi*—some sort of dark matter—out there in the world; it's a scarce resource; you [or your midichlorians, I guess] have to absorb it into your body (i.e. *cultivate*) to get more powerful.

        It seems like, in the *Star Wars* universe, there's so little *qi* out in the universe that just a few cultivators can soak up the entire universe's supply, leaving none for anyone else.

        (This also creates an actual *inverse ninja rule* in the *Star Wars* universe: if you create 50 clone soldiers made to all be cultivators, they have to split the already-tiny amount of environmental *qi* between them, resulting in each being 1/50th as force-attuned as your average cultivator.)

        Maybe *Star Wars* is set in some sort of post-apocalyptic setting where *qi* used to be abundant-enough for the progenitor of humans and other alien species to evolve the capability to manipulate it; but something happened and now it's mostly gone.

            The force is never described as limited, everyone has it. The history of the Star Wars galaxy is basically a history of force users killing each other on a massive scale, they've almost wiped themselves out of existence. The prequels pick up on the tail end of thousands of years of Jedi preventing those with the highest force sensitivity from breeding.

          ??? Xianxia is an old genre. The first modern xix novel was written in the 30s and the related traits that Star Wars used were extremely well known from martial arts movies - chi as the force, the ancient master. "Xian" just means Taoism. This is the whole point of Pai Mei in Kill Bill: the immortal master character is shot in a 60s/70s way because he's a character from the films of that era.

            Eh. Usage of terms shifts. The "fantasy, but low fantasy" martial-arts stories that might have been referred to as *xianxia* back then, would be considered *wuxia* by modern readers/writers of the two genres. By modern standards, these stories are not fantastical *enough* to be *xianxia*.

            It's a bit like how some stories can be redefined from being sci-fi to fantasy, or vice-versa, as we better understand physics. "Speculative fiction" like Verne's *A Journey to the Centre of the Earth* is now considered fantasy.

            In both cases, you could probably argue for there being a need for a "middle word" that we don't currently have. A word between *wuxia* and *xianxia* to describe "stories that assume Taoist mysticism is literally true, but which try to be realistic *given* those assumptions"; or a word between *speculative fiction* and *fantasy* to describe "stories that make one change to the set of axioms that the world is built upon, and then rigorously constrain themselves to evaluating what would happen in such a world, with the arc of the plot entirely constrained by the world."

              This is pure nonsense. Eg from Journey To The West:

              *Once an immortal who was the Marshal of the Heavenly Canopy commanding 100,000 naval soldiers of the Milky Way, he drank too much during a celebration of the gods and attempted to harass the moon goddess Chang'e, resulting in his banishment to the mortal world. He was supposed to be reborn as a human but ended up in the womb of a sow due to an error on the Reincarnation Wheel, which turned him into a half-man, half-pig monster.*

              And the point is that **that all the mystical traits in Star Wars were already well-known from Shaw Brothers movies.** In fact, most of them had been imported into Western pulp fiction decades before. And 1970s California was full of people teaching silly martial arts based on chi.

      To rant a bit more about my second point. 
      The entirety of the previous movie stands on the completely artificial deadline of the convoy of ships getting picked up one by one. At no point any of those condemned ship has the brilliant idea to make their sacrifice actually worth something for the others but turning around and attempting a face jump.
      It has to be the very last ship and the single most important character on board that does this.
      Not a single line to explain this EVEN IF IT WAS EASY!
      They could have said it is a very difficult jump and only the best pilot could reach its target.
      They could have said that it required a very large ship like the commanding one to do any damage.
      They could have said such a move is prohibited by Galactic Law of The Orange Bible and the commander took it on herself to go to hell for this.

          TFA is definitely the best of the sequel trilogy, but I always hated the existence of the First Order. That they are still a large military power means that all of the events of episode 6... basically didn't matter. They toppled a galaxy spanning empire, but 30 years later there's a reskin of the Empire in an apparently dominant position, still with the ability to make planet killing weapons, and the Rebellion still exists in basically the same state it was in the original trilogy. The reskinned Empire is even lead by a mysterious old sith, with a powerful yet conflicted and angry sith general. It wouldn't be that hard to show that the First Order isn't a near exact replica of the Empire, like showing that they are merely a strong power in the local region but they no longer are dominant on a galactic scale, but nope. The FO obliterates all non-Rebellion opposition with a single shot of their superweapon.

        I reimagined that part, where it’s the act of trying to have only one part of a thing go to lightspeed and not the whole, that disperses it in very high velocity shrapnel. And so Holdo actually would have to initiate jump while her ship is in sufficient contact, as in physically being rammed into, another large ship positioned in front of all the others. Which means a suicidal dash into the opposing fleet’s full firepower.

        It would have then made sense, not broken canon or even base consistency, allowed for proper heroics-sacrifice, and also explained why it wouldn’t be viable in any kind of practice but the rarest circumstances.

          This *does* fix the issue with SOP being to suicide if your capital is about to die, but doesn't stop the rebellion winning the battle of yavin with 30 X and Y wings flying until their noses touch, and have droids activate hyperdrive to cut a cross section straight through the death star.

I thought it was refreshing that it depicted heroic gambles that didn't pay off, bold maneuvers that felt noble/righteous in the moment but were ultimately harmful to the cause...There was for sure some silly shit in that movie, but I liked that for once it wasn't a given that doing the super risky dramatic thing would automatically work out.

      The problem is also when the heroic gamble is, like, one third of your entire runtime - an especially *boring* one, I'd add - and then it amounts to nothing. And one of the other thirds is a chase between two spaceships, in space, with no reference points, and the only determining factor how much fuel they have in their tanks.

        I wasn't referring to the good guys experiencing major setbacks in general, so much as the brutal deconstruction of tropes that are normally taken for granted in action movies like these. The hail-mary Macguffin quest backfires, the hotshot railing against his commanding officer's inaction is wrong, sacrificing nameless soldiers to take down a powerful foe actually weakens the good guys instead of just making the hotshot look cool...It was like for once the main characters had to survive in a world where the hand of God wasn't tipping the scales in their favor.
        ```

        - u/tobias3:
          ```
          In my opinion, what TLJ does isn't trope deconstruction. For example even "A new hope" has a few trope deconstructions. Farm boy goes on an adventure to rescue the princess, but turns out the princess doesn't need rescuing and is better at fighting her way out compared to the farm boy main hero.So the deconstructed trope is some kind of logical conclusion: Leia is the leader of a rebellion, of course she is a better shot than the boy that grew up on a farm!Or in (earlier seasons of) Games of Thrones: The trope is that the hero always survives. But the logical conclusion is that he gets killed because he is handicapped by e.g. honor and makes mistake after mistake (which he usually would get away with narrowly).

          TLJ doesn't do that. It just randomly turns the trope on its head. While the idea might be good, the execution is completely lacking. If you want to subvert the "Military Maverick" trope show that the general is competent (including communication with subordinates), that the general has a plan, and then let the ace pilot be a subordinate. If the ace pilot then doesn't follow orders the logical conclusion is that it will be some kind of disaster. "Military Maverick" will at the end be some kind of asshole/idiot or even self-centered villain, but that is the price you pay.

          That's another issue. The price. If you deconstruct your main villain and you don't have some kind of backup villain you have ... no villain (and the guy after you has to somehow add a new one?). James Bond gets hit by a random bullet from a random mook, it's a cool cinema moment, it is a logical conclusion of being fired at a lot, but there'll be a lot of problems finishing that movie and the next movie in the franchise will have some explaining to do (cloning?). So it is a positive surprise if someone subverts a trope, pays the storytelling price for that while still telling a coherent story.

          I think I understand what you are saying. 

          I think I was a bit too negative with this because whenever a trope got deconstructed, I asked myself "why isn't this going how it usually goes?" and because the universe seems unlawful I just think that's what JJA think is cool with no hidden meaning, just chaos, random noise. With the added effect that the fact that the heros suffer because of this makes this interpretation awful. I mean it is just *unfair*. If anything can happen because the force or because sci-fi tech, when bad things happen it must be the fault of the movie director.

          But yeah I totally get how one would like these parts of the movie. Thinking back, I guess I did empathize with the heros a bit, hence my violent reaction to the bad things that happens to them for no (good) reason. I guess it's still a performance of the director.

          I still am angry of the times I got pulled out of the movie by a plot hole. But yeah, not the worst movie of the year.

      >bold maneuvers that felt noble/righteous in the moment but were ultimately harmful to the cause

      You mean Poe's attack on Dreadnought or maybe Finn and Rose attempting to destroy the hyperspace tracker? Because the former turned out to be the single best tactical decision in the entire movie, while the latter was simply poorly executed (e.g. landing on a private beach instead of hiding the vessel in the forest nearby, bringing a shady dude on a very important mission, etc.).

      The problems experienced by the characters generally didn't lie in bold maneuvers or risky dramatic things, but in the fact that almost everyone was given an idiot ball in order to push the plot forward.
      ```

      - u/CeruleanTresses:
        ```
        What I remember about the attack on the big ship at the beginning was that Poe felt vindicated because they succeeded in taking it down, but the film went out of its way to acknowledge that the good guys lost a substantial chunk of their limited forces in the process and that continuing to pull high-risk high-reward maneuvers like that presented a real risk of dooming them by attrition. I liked that; it grounded the story. As for the hyperspace tracker, I don't remember the exact details; I recall it being set up as one of those things where the good guys are going to have to eat some kind of loss or concession to prevent an even worse outcome, but the main characters are morally outraged by the idea of accepting that loss and instead gamble on an approach that's riskier but has the slim possibility of delivering a complete win. When I see that kind of setup in an action movie, I know with the certainty of natural law that it's going to be touch-and-go for a while, but ultimately the heroes will thread the needle on that one-in-a-million chance and prove they were right not to take the initial L. Except this time it not only didn't work, it also screwed up a different plan and resulted in a lot of unnecessary deaths. 

        It's not as important, in my mind, whether they failed purely because they made tactical mistakes or whether it was truly impossible for them to have succeeded. The point is that they took a big risk that, in just about any other action movie, would have paid off no matter how much the universe had to twist itself in knots to make that happen--and for once, it *didn't.* There were shades of r/rational in that the choices that felt noble or brave or righteous weren't always the consequentially best choices. 

        (It reminded me a bit of those thought experiments where you imagine a population threatened by a plague and have to decide between a treatment that will definitely save only X% of them, or a treatment with a Y% chance of saving everyone and a 100-Y% chance that everyone dies. In most movie universes you can pretty much assume that Y = 100% no matter how low the characters say it is.)
        ```

        - u/Jakkubus:
          ```
          I can see your point with Poe, however I still disagree. Results-wise his decision was proven right, when the Resistance was forced to fight on Crait. After all Dreadnaught could just glass their outpost like it glassed the previous one. Moreover, while the losses in people could be considered a blow to the Resistance, later events made it basically irrelevant by killing off almost all of remaining ones. So even if they didn't die against Dreadnaught, they would still die soon after. As for the losses in ships, they weren't really that significant, since the bombers they've used were basically flying coffins. Sending then against anything other than unarmed, helpless targets was basically a death warrant on the pilots.

          As for Finn and Rose the problem was not the risky decision, but the fact that due to utter incompetence and a streak of irrational decisions they basically forced their hand. Have they acted thoughtfully, the setbacks would've likely never happen. In the end the reason why it didn't work wasn't that they took a gamble, but that they brought the failure on themselves through acting like idiots.

          So I would say that it's not the righteous choices themselves that were bad, but rather their execution. Also the movie was basically an antithesis of /r/rational, since the plot moves forward by making most of the cast act irrationally.

            The Dreadnaught being destroyed was validated *even earlier* than the battle on Crait.

            Imagine if Poe had held off on the bombing run, and the Rebel fleet had just escaped into hyperspace. The First Order fleet would have caught up with them immediately, *with the Dreadnaught ready to go,* and blasted the entire Rebel fleet to pieces there and then.

            If Poe hadn't ordered the bombing run, the movie would have been over in 10 minutes. The only reason the entire rest of the film could happen, is because of Poe's "mistake".
            ```

          - u/CeruleanTresses:
            ```
            I see where you're coming from, but I still don't think that the specific reasons that the Macguffinquest failed are relevant to what I liked about that part of the film. Even as Finn and Rose made one dumb choice after another, I was expecting everything to somehow work out for the best. I was primed by dozens of other movies to assume that the success of Macguffinquest was a foregone conclusion, no matter what specific things happened on the way. And then that...didn't happen. Their fuckups were actual fuckups that actually mattered. The gamble was an actual gamble that was never guaranteed to pay off. 

            I certainly wouldn't claim that TLJ was a rational or rationalist movie on the whole. Only that there were echoes of r/rational in the film treating risks as *actual risks* instead of just lip service to raise tension, and in how it rejected the idea that it's always right to do the Gryffindor thing at any risk or cost. (See: Poe ordering the retreat near the end instead of committing to a badass but doomed offensive, and this being portrayed as a wise move rather than a weak or cowardly one.)

            I'll refrain from arguing the Dreadnought thing further because it's been too long since I saw the movie and I don't remember all the details of the fallout of that decision.
            ```

            - u/Jakkubus:
              ```
              That's a fair opinion, but the movie isn't really consistent in that matter, as basically all other gambles are rewarded with little to no cost. Poe's decision to blow up Deadnaught was validated later on, Rey's attempt to enter Supremacy on her own and let herself get captured didn't cause any setbacks either, while Rose ramming into Finn's speeder not only didn't kill them both outright, but also somehow didn't cause gorilla walkers to just shot them down. 

              One swallow does not make a spring. The movie doesn't treat risks as *actual risks* unless characters go out of their way to maximize said risks with their misguided actions. And even then they often get a free pass.

              - u/WhyContainIt:

                Don't forget that the bombers that they lost wouldn't have had an opportunity to do anything useful later, so they got destroyed at the best possible time. The "bad trade" of their whole bomber fleet for the single dreadnought turned out to be getting something for nothing.

                It's still shown as a bad decision, that leads to an unfavorable situation that requires... I dunno, like, "effort" (and luck), to get out of.

                Even if there aren't long term negative consequences, there's a sense of "Whew, Rey messed up, and barely got out alive. She should probably be more careful in the future".

                This is *not* a feeling that Episode IX conveys, despite Rey making quite a few really dumb decisions which magically pay off.

(Among other things it predicted stealth and AWACS, and actually made fights with space axes work logically. And Worsel Of Velantia would eat Yoda as a snack before breakfast.

  Yeah, it's obvious that they jumped into this new trilogy with no overarching plot or themes, each film was an overreaction to the criticisms of the previous film. The prequel movies are some of the worst fantasy films of all time, but they at least had some original ideas and weren't shy about putting them out there.

  I think it all comes down to greed.  Disney jettisoned the Star Wars expanded universe because they didn't want to adapt anything and have to pay royalties like with Marvel, but the EU represented decades of market research on how to expand the setting , what works and what doesn't , and what fans love and hate about the setting.

      You can probably pin that on a failure of leadership. They gave the films to two different directors and apparently cut them loose to do whatever they wanted. This whole mess could have been avoided with just basic oversight; an executive producer with the power to rein them in, and another screenwriter to organize their ideas and nail down a beginning, middle and end to work towards.

      "Having a visionary writer/director on staff" is just not something that [live-action] film producers are trained to *seek out*, I think. (Unlike television producers, who at least *know of* the job-role of "creative director", if only as "that asshole from franchise corporate who's breathing down our necks about portraying the toys correctly as characters.")

      The "way movies get done" 99% of the time in the big Hollywood studios, is that a producer will *buy* a screenplay from a Writer's Guild screenwriter on the open market; and then they'll set up a new production staff (director et al) to make that screenplay into a movie. The screenplay might get rewritten several times by the director, editor, etc. of the movie, but the seed of it always came from a screenwriter who was more-than-likely entirely unaffiliated with the production staff of any previous movie in the series thus-far.

      And even movies that are adapted from novels go through this process: usually, some Writer's Guild screenwriter buys the rights to the novel, and then writes a screen adaptation, and then sells *that* to a studio.

      Even if this is not the way Disney makes their live-action movies (and I'm suspicious that it might still be), it's industry culture, in a way that makes long-term planning *not* industry culture.

        This just isn't true of tent-pole franchises any more. Generally there's a concept, money gets behind, and writers are hired to base a script around it.

        \> The screenplay might get rewritten several times by the director, editor, etc. of the movie

        No. Editors never even see the screenplay. Most screenplays get re-written by more *writers.*

        \> And even movies that are adapted from novels go through this process:  usually, some Writer's Guild screenwriter buys the rights to the novel,  and then writes a screen adaptation, and then sells *that* to a studio

        No.

        Generally a studio or a producer buys rights and hires a writer - eg Warner bought Harry Potter from JKR. If a producer has rights he'll often pitch a studio with a treatment and try to get development money to pay for a script. In fact, most remotely suitable novels aren't available to script writers because a studio has already optioned the rights. Another example is Amazon - not a scriptwriter - buying the rights to Iain Banks' Culture series. Or Gone With The Wind got made when Selznick International bought the rights, partnered with another production company, and hired multiple writers.

        So like, I totally get all that, but it's still baffling to me for one small reason:

        *Disney owns Marvel*.

        They already *have* a billion dollar franchise that has a license to print money *sustainably* over *a decade* and it's mostly thanks to starting momentum and careful planning, under the head of Kevin Feige.

        Star Wars had more starting momentum than they could ever want. All they needed was to find someone who could act like Feige, possibly someone already from Lucasfilm or LucasArts or something, someone as familiar with the franchise as they could be without being George Lucas. They then have that person draft a series of phases, let them act as the last word on such trivial matters as "what is the movie about", and then let em rip.

        (Actually, now that I think about it, if they could get George to do it initially, it would probably work great. He had already been doing something similar for years and years signing off on books, games, TV show plots and so on; keep him away from the script and away from the director's chair and he probably would have done fine.) 

        Instead they adopted the Marvel pattern of different directors without any oversight, and it fell apart.
        ```

        - u/derefr:
          ```
          Right, but that was my point, here: the culture in Hollywood is such that studios like Marvel (who plan for ongoing creative direction) or Pixar (who at least ensure continuity of direction in sequels, even if they weren't planned as part of an N-ology to begin with) are *accidents*. One studio might have institutional knowledge of the value of creative direction, but that doesn't mean that an acquirer like Disney will *inherit* or *absorb* that institutional knowledge from them. Usually the other way around, in fact.

          The games industry is very similar, and I bring it up because there's a helpful central example of this effect in the games industry that a lot of people are aware of: EA. EA buy studios with creative vision, who clearly have often succeeded *because* of their creative vision, and then learns nothing from them, and gradually destroys any element of creative vision in the absorbed studio.

    There's no rule that says you can't make good movies if you're greedy. There's certainly no rule saying that greed forbids you from having a consistent plot.

    Are the actually worse than the 3rd movie? The one where irritating teddy bears defeat an elite high tech military force? And the first is one of the most derivative films of all time. It staples together the servant characters from Hidden Fortress with a Lensman ripoff and ends with a clone of the finale of Dambusters. It's a kid's film that actually starts using a plot device that any adult would laugh it - one much more dubious than anything used in any of the other films people complain about. (The bad guys don't shoot at a lifepod because there are no life signs... In a universe full of freaking ROBOTS!)

          > Fans are stupid and inconsistent. They sulk over Jah- Jah and forgive Ewoks . They complain about relatively small plot holes and ignore the one the franchise is based on - the Empire not shooting up the droid's lifepod because of a lack on life signs, in a universe full of robots.

          Fans might not be representative of the audience at large, but to me saying that fans are "stupid and inconsistent" only shows that you didn't pick up on the logic behind those things. Stories have a certain amount of credit when it comes to suspension of disbelief. You gain credit with some things, and spend it with others. If your objective isn't to be 100% rational it's fine to make something that's a bit weird or silly if it works, makes the movie more fun, or is balanced by something else. Most of the Ewoks' antics concern one specific battle that's interspersed with other two - a space battle and a lightsaber duel, both among the best of the franchise. Jar Jar is simply pointless, in a movie whose entire tone is more childish than any other that preceded it, and which is the entry point, not the end, for a trilogy, which means it's got to do more groundwork to get people to buy into its setting and conflict, as they're all brand new. 

          Fans might be selective in which things they complain about, but they're not reacting at random. I think you can make a movie that both fans and the general public enjoy, on average. Sure, you'll always have the occasional party pooper, but nothing can be enjoyable by literally everyone. Marvel movies however have a much better track record in this regard.

          I don't think that's true anymore due to the changes in technology. The fans are the ones talking about the series and spreading word about it, and when the fans embrace or reject something they have the ability to make themselves heard now and have a real effect.

          I wouldn't say that fans sulked over Jar Jar either. I think people realized that the Phantom Menace was a terrible film, but the average person might not be able to break it down and say exactly why the pacing was a mess, or the why characters were one dimensional, or why so many great actors were turning in wooden performances, so fans latched on to something obvious like Jar Jar. Return of the Jedi has some of the same problems as the Phantom Menace, but it's a much better film overall, so people were less willing to nitpick it.

            Maybe. But what fans think they will like and what they will actually like are two different things. And they're hardly the only people who will comment on a successful film. Once again, Teen Titans Go is a big success, and the Retarded Nerd Club hates it.

            *I wouldn't say that fans sulked over Jar Jar either.*

             I remember the reaction to the film. And for that matter Simon Pegg based an entire episode of Spaced around the adult fans' hatred of Jar Jar...

            And if you say that fans reacted to Jar Jar because they can't articulate their real problems with a movie, then what exactly is the point in listening to them??? 

            Which is RoS tried to do anyway - it's just a bad idea. The more someone obsesses over one of these silly franchises, the less likely they are to be creative. If you take the average of the opinion of millions of obsessed, unimaginative people, the results are going to be awful.

              I mean, they are an indication that there *is* a problem. If you're a doctor and a patient cries that they're in pain, do you ignore them because they can't tell you exactly the anatomical name of the body spot where they feel it?

                My point was that you shouldn't listen to the fans when deciding what to put in a new movie. This has nothing to do with what you're saying. Yes, if they say they hated a movie, then you can assume they did. But that doesn't mean listening to the details of what they say will help you fix the next one. Especially as many of them seem to be just plain creepy incels.

          The Jar Jar Line is  much more recent than the [Ewok Line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwAEhhd80SQ&t=23s), so this phenomenon is easily explained.

    I think the Prequels tried to be like the Wire and less like a Western and so the failure was huge (especially with Lucas helming sans his editing team).

  TFA undid the meaning of all the triumphs before it, but had enough mystery boxes that fans could cook up theories to satisfy themselves.

  TLJ undid TFA by taking each mystery box and opening it to reveal nothing. It also took each character and restarted their character development. The only question really left after that travesty was "How the fuck are they going to progress from here?"

  TROS answers that. 

  Poorly. They progress poorly.

  JJ’s a former scientologolologist, so it follows the Space Opera ideal: bad guys are deontologically bad and choose to be evil unless they renounce it, good guys lose until they win with near-magical effortlessness, and Discovering Yourself is more important than thought.

    >the Space Opera ideal

    ...Doesn't work that way at all. The ur Space Operas were Lensman and Skylark Of Space, and the wars there were VERY hard fought indeed. Ditto for recent literary space operas like Revelation Space and Vernor Vinge's work. And even more so for the major Japanese entrant, Gurren Lagann - something like 99.99% of the population of the Galaxy is destroyed. And the Xeelee series is (imo) unreadable, but I think the conflict is pretty damn bloody again.

    You'd probably enjoy Blake's 7 - it's the complete opposite of the traits you outline. (And probably the most influential TV space opera - B5, Buffy and Angel owed a lot to it, and Andromeda and Farscape were almost reboots..)

    In fact, I can't think of ANY space opera fitting your description. Even Scientology has the thing about all the Good Guys being brought to Earth in DC10's and sacrificed in nuclear volcanoes, come to think of it.

      That's a strange statement to me for three reasons. First, in TTGL no such thing happens in the show's timeframe. Maybe you refer to the past actions of the anti-Spirals? Second, TTGL is mecha more than space opera, as the conflict is driven only by a handful of individuals in a cockpit, like the crew of a single ship (even though their mecha gets really big). Third, to mention Japanese space opera and not consider the most straightforward take of the genre, namely, Legend of the Galactic Heroes, just feels weird.

      Seconding Blake's 7. 10-15% of the episodes are really bad and the costumes and effects are very 70s but the acting, characters and dialogue are amazingly good.
      ```

      - u/thelastteacup:
        ```
        And the show really sticks to its logic. The heroes never get an easy win and there are false resolutions to moral dilemmas. It's also got very nice plot arcing - basically the structure Joss Whedon copied for Buffy and Angel. There are continuing themes but you can watch virtually any episode out of order and skip those 10% of bad ones. (Although Harvest Of Kairos is so good-bad that you should watch it at least once: "You madam, are no lady!")

    I kind of feel like this is breaking the "I will not rant about the unworthiness of the enemy after they have defeated me" item on the Evil Overlord List.

    Star Wars changed cinema. It's one of the defining cultural staples of the Western world and inspired whole reams of derivatives. "It has a rare setting and an above-average story, I guess" *isn't enough* to explain that.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      The thing is, Star Wars *doesn't* have a rare setting. Lucas originally wanted to write *Flash Gordon,* but he couldn't get the license, so he made his own mashup knock-off, combining elements of *Flash Gordon*, *Buck Rogers*, *Dune*, and *John Carter of Mars*. A lot of the success of *Star Wars* was repackaging and synthesizing for a new era a lot of the old serials that Lucas had grown up with, and it's *highly* derivative in a way that proves that being derivative doesn't matter so long as you execute well. Most of what was novel about *Star Wars* was in the ground-breaking special effects and the way that it revived a genre that was close to dead.

    It's born of longing. Some of us spent 20 years or more imagining what happens after Return of the Jedi, and to see someone come in with all the money and support but none of the sense, and create something worse than 10-year-old us came up with...its a mix of bitterness, and befudlement, and ultimately, the sense that (even) we could have done better. 

    First step of doing better is identifying what went wrong, but the second step of improving on it is out of reach to us, except in the occasional "let's make a new script" YouTube video. So here we are firing up those skills that let us pick apart the failure state, and hoping the act of doing so burns out the frustration that's settled in our bones.

    Tho that doesn't speak for everyone. Some people do indeed take it too far.

        The Thrawn trilogy and Hand of Thrawn duology, and the X-Wing novels, being head-and-shoulders above the rest (in my opinion).

        The rest of the Legends books I've read are readable and enjoyable (excepting a few real stinkers like *Planet of Twilight* and *The Crystal Star*), but not remarkably so.
