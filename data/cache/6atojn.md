  I got a few theories:

  1) Those trees are ents or something and the roots swallowed up the kids. This doesn't seem too likely because not a single one of them managed to yell for help.

  2) All the kids spotted some sort of danger that they needed to hide from, so they're all staying hidden until the coast is clear.

  3) Diabolus ex Machina

    I think it could be predators/snatchers that move incredibly fast underground or from above. Or there are concealed pits in the ground that work like a trap door by resetting after a kid falls in.
