  Huh. It looks like we're about to get a time skip?

    Doubtful. If there was going to be an imminent  timeskip why bother with this chapter at all? Nothing major happens, one small skirmish to update the zombies and handwaving that the rockets worked.

      I read it back when it was new and after it stopped updating the first time I never looked back into it.

        Ah.  There’s a lot you missed.
