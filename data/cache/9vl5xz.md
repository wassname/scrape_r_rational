## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  I got bad news this week: the coauthor of vampire flower language is officially burnt out of the story, the characters, and quite possibly even the setting. This made me understandably... sad. 

  When she announced it to me, I had a knee-jerk "can't possibly finish the story without her, she's the glue that holds the story together", but now it's really sinking in that the ~90,000 words I wrote will not be seen by anyone other than myself if I don't get over that attitude and maybe deign to present something suboptimal, if it'll mean that it actually will see the light of day.

  The other option is for me to focus my energy (for now) on writing a werewolf story in the same universe which I am satisfied I can write without her, it's not a romance, I'm not entirely sure what it is yet, but it's going to be a little bit about blue and orange morality as the main source of conflict, I think (but.... probably not too cerebral, maybe pitched at a young adult sort of "philosophical"). I might write up the babysitter's club startup stuff I futzed around with first, since that's no stakes.

  What I'm most sad about, oddly, is that I had this weird fantasy that we'd self-publish the book on Amazon when it was done, and maybe get a patreon with a modest ~$15/month level subscriber base, and go out for a modest dinner once a year on the proceeds, and have some sort of ineffable feeling of wider recognition and accomplishment from that. I was already feeling really great about myself because of the positive comments the story was getting on AO3. 

  Not that I need any of that stuff to feel accomplished - my coauthor has called me "the most productive person she knows", and she's probably right. But yeah. I had all these strange little hopes and dreams tied up in this, and those have all "come crashing down". So I'm mourning it.

  Thanks for listening to this; I needed to get it out there. 

  Thanks especially to /u/callmesalticidae who said some really lovely things to me right after it happened.

    Hang in there, /u/MagicWeasel.  :)

    Sorry. It always sucks when that happens. :(

    You should probably try something smaller-scale next time, honestly.

      Ouch :(

        Yeah, sorry, I shouldn't have said anything. It's kind of harsh.

  Taskmaster series 7 just ended, and I think it was my favorite since the first one (though it's never been bad, just sometimes failed to properly gel). If you're into seeing people do random tasks, check it out. The show has more genuine problem solving per minute than any other I can think of.

  Edit: Also, the [Taskmaster book](https://www.amazon.com/Taskmaster-Extraordinary-Tasks-Ordinary-People/dp/1785943588) is apparently quite good; it's on my Christmas list.

  I received an interview invite from MIT this week. It arrived on the last of 3 possible days, and after being [rejected by Harvard](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9nl1og/z/e7nll9u) I was pretty nervous about my chances.

  Interviewees have a ~50% chance of being admitted in contrast to the ~11% admission rate of the entire applicant pool. Fingers crossed.

  MIT's final decision comes shortly before Christmas.

  I recently wrote down a lot of my old story ideas to see how they've changed over time, and it's really interesting. The premises have evolved over time to become simpler, and more stereotypically novel-like, while the actual outlines themselves tended to become more complex. I think this is a result on my conception of the ideas and characters becoming clearer over time, which explains why most of my attempts to spoof this process (by doing something like taking a punchy novel premise and working back from there) don't work - the only thing that allows me to be more certain about my ideas is to think about them.

  I'm going to try to stop this from letting me sit on them for too long, though. I don't have any right to be proud of them if I haven't given them two legs to stand on.

  I recently found... an odd sub. One that is very critical of rationalists (especially the Yudkowian kind). It's name? [r/sneerclub](https://www.reddit.com/r/SneerClub/)

  I wouldn't be surprised if there's a unspoken rule of not talking about this group, but I am curious- what's your take on them?

    A lot of it seems to be counter-reaction to the alt-right and neo-reactionary brand of rationalism that's quite common in /r/slatestarcodex, and is (or can be seen as) an outgrowth of particular elements of "rationalism" as established by LessWrong. Browsing the front page of that subreddit, you'll see that most of them are pointing out racism, sexism, nationalism, fascism, etc., all of which are somewhat common within *certain parts* of the rational-sphere.

    So, typical culture war outrage factory stuff, despite their insistence that they're not. Not worth paying too much attention to, IMO.

    They may or may not have valid points, but since I find sneers of my in-group unpleasant and they deliberately go for that as hard as they can, I can't be bothered to find out.
    ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    They're good at pointing out the  parts of /r/slatestarcodex that lack self-awareness and social adjustment.

    Otherwise, they have the common problems of communities that are built around people telling each other how much they hate something. They seem really insecure overall, in the "I sure hope these people we hate realize how much we hate them!" sense.

    I'm not sure what else to say; they're like dozens of others subreddits that are dedicated to finding things to hate about the outgroup. After a while it's just sad and boring.
