  ```
  Amusingly, in D&D 3rd edition, the general cost of scribing spells was supposed to be 100 gp per page for materials for spells copied into spellbooks in general, thus making the cost of parchment at 2 sp / sheet a tiny minority of the cost.  However, a wizard who could cast Secret Page (third level spell) could cut the costs - the spell Secret Page is used to disguise text or writing as something else, and explicitly lets the caster put spells on the 'fake' pages it creates. So you could take some worthless writings that are cheap to write down, and 'hide' those cheap writing beneath 'fake' spells, and then just memorize your spells per day off of those 'fake' pages displayed by the Secret Page spell. Makes making backup spellbooks much more affordable if you have some downtime during a campaign.
