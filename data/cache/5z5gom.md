## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  Saw [this](https://www.facebook.com/quartznews/videos/1493070964059934/) interesting video recently. They had a male and female actor play the part of Hillary and Trump respectively, mimicking their mannerisms and wording from a presidential debate. The (largely liberal) audience had the reaction that female!Trump was much more trustworthy than male!Hillary.

  I'm still not sure what conclusion to draw from it.

    That Hillary might be a good politician, but she's certainly not charismatic? Especially when parodied.

    Or, if you wanna stress the gender angle, - which I'm far from confident is relevant -, that male mannerisms in a woman make her look confident, whereas female mannerisms in a man make him look weak.

    From my comment about it on Facebook:

    So I find this fascinating, not just on its own merits, but particularly because of something I did a couple years ago: I took clips of Game of Thrones out of context and showed them to a few friends who never read the books or watched the show. Without access to the bigger narrative, I wanted to see if I could make characters come off differently than the way they were experienced by viewers of the whole story. Obviously it made a difference, but it seemed like a fun exercise in exploring characters and narrative, and some of the reactions were still surprising.

    Which is why watching these clips of the gender-swapped politicians who came off very differently than my memory of the debates made me think "Huh. How much of this effect is coming from the divorced context of the characters being played? Is it possible that changing the faces and voices of the characters is enough to disassociate the negative feelings people have of them based on their histories?"

    Because as I watched this, I had to constantly remind myself that the female speaker's talking points were factually inaccurate, because yes, charisma matters... but also because I felt like I was watching something disassociated from reality. The debates weren't that long ago, but they were still immersed in the context of their time, where Trump was, from liberal perspectives, blatantly lying day after day, week after week, not to mention all the other... character flaws, let's say, that he exhibited.

    So overall, I love that this was done, but I want it taken further. I want to see this reproduced as a full film that mirrors the election. Not just the debates, but rallies, speeches, press releases. Let us get used to these two characters, Jonathan Gordon and Brenda King. Let us really feel what we felt about them again, from the left and the right, but gender flipped, THEN see how we judge them.

    Because I think the context is important to just about everything in life, including our reactions of King's attitude and Gordon's affect, as seen in these debate videos. Just like context was important in judging whether Cersei was a benevolent and wise queen or Arya was a bloodthirsty psychopath in my own "experiment."

  Are there any "primers" for being more rational? That is, more easily consumed than academy textbooks. Something (maybe not a perfect example) like the snippet from Luminosity about *"What do I want? What do I have? How do I use what I have to get what I want?"* to break down problems, avoid pitfalls and generally have the tools to handle everyday things rationally?

      I mean yeah all the stuff in the sequences is covered in greater depth elsewhere, but I doubt there's anything else that really approaches the scope and range of topics covered in the sequences.

  How much do you guys think it's 1. useful and 2. fun to know about economics?

  Mostly asking because while the topic generally interests me, and is likely important in an abstract way (this is a thing that needs to be understood if we ever are to get a working government, but we're so far away from that it's probably not the bottleneck right now, and also nothing I can ever do will make a difference here), but I'm finding it really hard to interpret what I'm reading.

  Main problem being with how politicized this area seems to be, there's a lot of people seeming very confident, and of course they don't agree with each other on almost anything. Below, I rant a bit about [Inequality for All](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2215151/), which I've watched recently, but rather than focus on particular factual assertions, I'm more interested in the meta topic: how do you ingest information about economics, find trusted sources, and most of all evaluate claims? I've read some of [themoneyillusion](http://www.themoneyillusion.com/) (though most of his posts assume a thought framework that I don't have, and it's hard to extract value); and some of /u/EliezerYudkowsky's rants. They both seem very confident (EY especially, but then EY seems confident in very many things :P) in a non-mainstream model (granted, it's been becoming more mainstream, so that's something). And while their arguments generally make sense to me, so do the opposing sides', and so it's hard to share that confidence.

  Getting back to the example of Inequality for All, the author seems confident that he's making a case for a particular policy, and I just can't follow his argument from the factual assertions he's making, to why his suggested policy helps with those problems.

  For example one claim from the movie that I can remember, is this rich trader guy saying he has gained <some large amount of money> from his investment into <hedge funds etc>. And then he says something like "I believe no social good was produced from these investments", which the movie just takes as a fact and doesn't elaborate on. That quote perplexes me - someone gave this man money, and presumably they gave him the money for some perceived benefit. Perhaps the social good was very small, like just providing some extra liquidity to a market so that someone else that's not speculating can buy at a lower price / sell at higher price; but it's really hard to imagine financial investment to have negative externalities on its own.

  The movie extends that argument by noticing that rich people don't spend their money; they save/invest it. As opposed to the middle class, which is consumption-oriented. Which consumption, in turn, is what the movie presents as the real driving force behind the economy in what it calls a [Virtuous Cycle](http://inequalityforall.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/PAGE_25.jpg) - whereupon as wages increase, workers spend more, driving more demand, which leads to more production, and higher wages. To me, that just looks like a bubble?

    I have nothing in particular to add, but this reminds me of the lovely burn, "Ask any two economists a question and you will get two different answers.  Unless one of them is Lord Keynes, in which case you will get three."

    My main criticism/rant against Capitalism, and all the satellite plolitics, is that afterall it is a paperclip maximizer. 

    After all things in capitalism get produced with the sole scope of making a (ingent) profit.

    Furthermore corporations are more or less china-room AGIs, not able bootstrap themselves to godhood ,yet, but smarter than any individual.

    It is also my opinion that they are being also used from the profiteers to distance themselves from where the profit is coming from, to shield their personal morality and empathy from their-not-anymore-theirs actions.

    I would unironically suggest to read Capital by Karl Marx, he isn't perfect but he tries to describe economic phenomena in the most scientific way he can, basing himself on historical evidence; which we know isn't perfect but we cannot exactly simulate universes in which to try different economic models.    
    Afterall,  it became political later on,  while it was being written it was a critique and an offer for an alternative.

      This argument proves too much. Every policy is a paperclip maximiser, for some value of paperclip.
      ```

      - u/Veedrac:
        ```
        I don't see it. I can quite clearly see capitalism as a paperclip maximiser because it shares the integral trait: significantly above-human intelligence and resource applied to maximising output of some quantity only tangentially related to welfare. Not many systems share this.

      Yes. I generally agree with this argument, or at least with how I understand the argument (summarized below). My problem is that I also find convincing arguments from the opposing side. Thus rather than a constructive 'this is the right thing to do because of this chain of logic' argument, what I feel I need is a deconstructive analysis of the competing, internally-consistent arguments, with the assumptions behind the arguments made explicit and analysed for conflict.


      The way I understand the precommitment/print-more-money argument for inflation targetting is mostly by seeing inflation targetting as a coordination problem. Everyone prefers moderately low, stable inflation [citation needed; bitcoin guys really like deflation, I guess]. But the individual incentives do not support stable inflation; without organised control small chaotic movements can blow into inflationary or deflationary reinforcing cycles. However, the cycle only works when individual actors expect all other actors to follow their individual incentives; i.e. the self-reinforcement in part relies on the expectation of a self-reinforcing cycle. Adding a powerful agent that does not act in its self interest but instead precommits to keeping inflation stable defeats most of the self-reinforcing process, because if individual agents expect this coordinator to intervene if things were getting out of control, they are not incentivised to take advantage of things getting out of control.


      I'm not equipped to evaluate whether the assumptions behind inflation/deflation cycles, and the market response to trustworthy commitment to inflation targetting, are reliable. It *seems* correct, but I would not be very surprised if an economist with an opposing view came in and pointed out complexities or externalities that are ignored by the argument.

      I guess what I'm looking for is dialogue, where I don't have to evaluate the factual accuracy of assertions made by either side (which I can't evaluate), and can just look at the logical coherence of arguments made because factual inaccuracies are caught by the opposing debater.
      ```

      - u/EliezerYudkowsky:

        It sounds like you're taking an inflation-centric view.  I'd suggest taking a trade-and-production-centric view: the question is how much stuff and service is produced; and to a lesser extent, who gets the stuff.  Notions like 'inflation' and 'deflation' only matter to us except insofar as they affect how much stuff gets produced, or to a lesser extent, who gets the stuff.  The point of NGDPLT is not to stabilize inflation or whatever, it's to produce as much stuff as the economy can produce, with a minimum of distortion on who gets the stuff.  It does happen that unstable inflation or deflation or hyperinflation reflect circumstances leading to less stuff being produced, which is the only reason we care.

        I don't see how the Fed is acting not in its self-interest under NGDPLT or how other actors would take advantage of that.

    I know (and trust) a few people in the public service who have PhDs in economics, so I tend to talk to them over dinner.  Which I guess doesn't help very much ;p

    > To me, [a consumption cycle] just looks like a bubble?

    To some degree it is, in the same way that borrowing money to make investments or even having a floating currency - kinda like a bubble in that if everyone panics it's bad, but good in that panic is unlikely and it allows for greater liquidity and prosperity.

    > it's really hard to imagine financial investment to have negative externalities on its own

    The usual examples are volatility, high-frequency or insider trading, and bubbles.  This is basically "too much liquidity" and "too much leverage", the results of which can definitely cause social harm (see: 2008).

    It's normal growth, it produces tangible goods for resonable price. It would be a bubble if it was fuelled by making stuff that nobody wants to buy.

    I recently finished Charles Whelan's 'Naked Economics' and if there's one lesson I took away it was that aligning incentives matters a lot to the policy maker. It's quite easy to create the opposite of the effect the policy maker wants if he fails to think through all the incentives in play in the population.  A wealth of plot ideas for a rational antagonist to implement in my stories, so yes it's fun .

  Where could I read about "Future Me / Past Me Dialogue" technique that Red Verres is using in *Pokemon: The Origin of Species*?

  /u/DaystarEld
  ```

  - u/Anderkent:
    ```
    I'm not familiar with the exact example (not being a reader, and google not being very helpful), so this might be inaccurate; but the core concept behind considering future/past selves as independent agents with different value functions it is [hyperbolic discounting](http://lesswrong.com/lw/6c/akrasia_hyperbolic_discounting_and_picoeconomics/) - the fact that there are things that you value more/less depending how far away you're considering them from, time-wise.

    So, for example, me from 5 hours ago as well as me 8 hours in the future would much rather the me right now was about to go to sleep, rather than read reddit. However, for the me right now the annoyance of waking up without enough sleep in the future is minor, while reddit is compelling. If I were to have a dialogue with the future me, maybe he could convince now-me that it's in our shared interest to go to sleep.

    (fortunately the now-me is in control of when he wants to talk to future me, and so our reddit adventure continues)
    ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    /u/Anderkent is pretty on the money. There's no specific blog post or topic discussion of it as far as I'm aware, but it's kind of a blend of hyperbolic discounting, [Near/Far thinking](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Near/far_thinking), and a general character trait of personifying different perspectives in your head.
