## [WIP][D][BS] National Novel Writing Month: Week 1

### Post:

This is a general purpose thread for anything you'd like to talk about for National Novel Writing Month, which starts November 1st.

* Want to check in your some progress?
* Want to talk about what you're writing?
* Out of ideas and want some help?

Feel free to make posts to the subreddit if you crank out a chapter you want to share, have a meaty question you want some help with, or something like that; this is more a place for things that aren't quite substantial enough to warrant their own posts.

  As a just as cool alternative, there's [NaNoGenMo](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2015), which is the same thing except easier! Or harder! Because instead of writing the 50,000 words yourself, you write a computer program to do it for you! I'm really torn about which one I'm going to try, and I'm sorry for the sleep deprived exclamation points.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    ...

    10 PRINT "Hello world!"

    20 GOTO 10

    You're right, that *was* easier.
    ```

    - u/quickpocket:
      ```
      >The "novel" is defined however you want. It could be 50,000 repetitions of the word "meow". It could literally grab a random novel from Project Gutenberg. It doesn't matter, as long as it's 50k+ words.

      Congrats! You finished your novel already! Go submit it then :D

        Unfortunately there are two problems with /u/eaglejarl's novel:

        1. It's written in Basic, which is an outdated genre nobody buys these days
        2. It's a lot longer than 50Kw - in fact none of our editors finished reading it.
        ```

        - u/eaglejarl:
          ```
          Oh, no worries. A quick editing pass should help:

          "Hello world " map [1..100000]

          How's that?
          ```

          - u/PeridexisErrant:

            Lovely, I reckon we could get a trilogy out of it easily.

    I've seen that before - it's very cool, but as with Ludlum Dare and similar game jams, I think your results tend to be orders of magnitude better if you have some background (in the case of NaNoGenMo, NLP stuff).

    It's probably just because I'm already a computer programmer, but that sounds easier to do than to take the time out of my busy schedule to write a novel. I mean I could use my code as a course project for one of my classes.
    ```

    - u/Transfuturist:
      ```
      I've started writing a lexer and parser (good feedback loops for short iteration), even though my calendar looks ridiculous. If only I were actually taking a programming class.

  I'm doing a continuation of *The Dark Wizard of Donkerk* this year. Because of some editing work on last year's NaNo, I'm basically in catch-up mode if I want to hit my goal of 100K words; Day 1 was spent getting back up to 50K, so I'm basically starting a day behind. I'm a little leery of the fact that I've got three and a half magic systems going, but they're all vital to the plot, so I guess I'm just forging on ahead. On the plus side, I think I have all of my principal characters pretty firmly set in my head.

  [Here's a link if you want to check it out.](http://alexanderwales.com/darkWizardNaNo2015.html) If you want just the stuff from this year, CTRL+F for "Miriam had taken her oaths late, at the age of eighteen."

  Finished Day One at 2,275 words. An excerpt:


  “I think I’m going insane,” Manch offered to the table at large. The assortment of tabletoken players rolled their eyes and continued the current round of betting.  

  “Get yourself a wife, boy,” said an old weever. “Then you’ll know.” He laughed sharply, then coughed and said, “Four greens on the fourty. Fill ‘er up, Terzo.”  

  Terzo shuffled the tokens around to their new places and flicked the turn-counter to his left. “Your bet, Rudo,” he intoned, his hollow-sounding voice matching perfectly with his mask-like face.  

  The longbrow trowling yanked on the eponymous feature of his race and screwed up his face. “Smoke it, Genki, I feel like I’m playin’ with a Scavenger here. My luck’s run out and kept on runnin’ the other direction. Go easy on us, will ya?”  

  The weever cackled, jumping a black token across the six fingers of his bottom left hand. “Experience trumps luck every time, Rudo, my boy.”  

  “I’m old enough to be your father, you spiny loon,” said Rudo, tossing a handful of muddy brown tokens onto the table.  

  “I’m older at heart, Rudo, I’m older at heart. So, Manch, what brings you moping to seek the company of us tabletoken rascals?”  

  “Insanity loves company, or something like that,” said Manch, tilting his head and peering blankly at the mess of colored tokens arranged across the table. “What’s the count, Terzo?”  

  “Seven-and-one,” Terzo replied, voice passing through the air like a raindrop through smoke.  

  “You’re crazy if you think you’re insane, boy,” said the weever on Genki’s other side. “What’s got ya down?”  

  “The turning point of my life is approaching and my brain is falling apart into a mental game of tabletokens where each of my thoughts bids against the others to gain control of my focus. Are yellows still wild?”  

  Genki glanced back at the stack of tokens in front of him. “Aye. So when’s this turning point, anyway.”  

  “Five days from now, at the Midcycle Exams. How many turns until the Shift round starts?”  

  “After Terel here makes up his mind about how he wants to lose,” said Genki, his bottom right hand splurching out to point at the other weever.  

  “Are you going to apply for Squireship, then?” asked Rudo, wrinkled face scanning his tokens for a pattern he hoped he’d just missed.  

  “Mm,” said Manch noncommitally. “Take five white, Terel, then declare and double.”  

  “What?” said the young weever. “Why would I double, especially after I declare? Why would I even declare in the first place, that’s letting Genki take the side-pot right off.”  

  “Don’t listen to him, he’s obviously insane,” Genki said, eyes flicking to the table’s tokens before becoming interested in the black token he was still flipping between his fingers.  

  Rudo’s voluminous eyebrows twitched as he found whatever it was he hadn’t known he was looking for. “Hey, Terel, the boy may have something.”  

  “If you don’t, Genki’s going to trade all his yellows for whites first turn of the Shift round,” Manch said, eyeing the pile of whites in front of Terzo.  

  “What?” said Terel, lost. “But he doesn’t have any-”  

  “Smokes!” yelled Rudo. “He’ll have a finger on everyone else’s by the time his turn comes around!”  

  “How?!” asked Terel in exhasperation, still not seeing it.  

  “The count’s seven-and-one now, right?” said Rudo, shaking his head in amazement. “If you do nothing but bet flat and pass on doubling, Genki just has to double at the start of his turn and he’ll get the pick of any color he’s got nil of! I was wondering why you kept passing up the chance at nabbing a few yellows yourself, you wily bastard,” he said, this directed at Genki.  

  Terel sat back, deflated. “Damn.”  

  “Will you shut up and bet,” said the fifth denizen of the tabletoken game, a towering aspin fay with a bushy white beard.  

  “That’s all you ever have to say, even at a time like this?”  

  “This time is no different than any other.”  

  “I almost lost everything!” Terel cried. “We all did!”  

  “Take five white, declare, then double, Terel,” Manch said boredly, repeating his earlier advice. “If you play as bad of a Shift round as you do the primary rounds, you’ll still come out on top, though not by much. Have a goodnight, you guys.”  

  “Yeah, you’d better leave,” grumbled Genki, arms crossed, four hands tapping an angry beat against his exoskeleton. “I’ll have you know that in the past, they used to string up a spectator by his bottom-wrists for interfering in a game of tabletokens.”

    You use insane and crazy a bit too often for my tastes. I recommend replacing a few with delusional, loony, or cracked in the head. Especially since it seems like you're going to be using these words again later.

  Day 1:  2000 words, the results of which are posted to /r/rational.  *Cracks knuckles*

  For NaNoWriMo I'm going to be writing an erom, *50 Shades of Grey Except Not Awful*. (It's a working title.)

  Unfortunately, last month I did a NaNoWriMo challenge for 80,000 words, of which I've only written 68,000, so I need to finish *The Change Storms: Induction* before officially starting on NaNoWriMo. Wish me luck.

  Accidentally commented with my alt account yesterday. Awkward.

  Excerpt from Day Two:

  His breath caught in his throat as he finally saw what had taken everyone else’s away.

  The three suton were of moderate size for their race, each clothed in flowing, silk robes over what looked like a small mountain of wrapped cloth. Their hairless heads - including an eerie lack of eyelashes and eyebrows - were perched atop those small mountains, peering calmly around, a distinct lack of interest written across their fleshy features. The long poles they always carried were grasped loosely in wide, soft hands, resting horizontally across the backs of their steeds.

  And they were all painted in wide swathes with a nauseating amount of deep, crimson blood.

  A few strong smells mixed in the air, most of them a result of the strong spices the suton carried with them. There was riversalt, some strong peppery odor, and a hint of the bitter culo seed.

  And the overpowering, metallic scent of a nauseating amount of deep, crimson blood.

  It hit Manch instantly as he stepped to the front of the crowd, clogging the air around him, reaching down his nasal passages and stuffing a grimy cloth all the way down and into his throat. “Wait, don-” he tried to cough out.

  Rimmer poked his head out right next to Manch as the rest of his sentence choked on the stench of stale life.

  “Guh,” said Rimmer.

  *What in the twelve hells?* It wasn’t that he’d never seen blood before, because he certainly had - though never quite this much of it, to be sure. He, and the entire city, was intimately familiar with the smell of death, with death itself. It was as much a part of life as anything else, especially life itself. It just wasn’t usually this… *They really are dead in the eyes*, Manch thought, looking between the three remaining sutons - he’d put two and two together as soon as he’d seen the blood, and now knew why there were two riderless fulpir. *And dead in the heart*, he finished, completing the quote. The suton weren’t doing anything to indicate their awareness as to the fact that they were currently drenched from scalp to saddle in the blood of their recently deceased brethren. *Recently devoured, by the looks of it. What could have killed them that violently? A pit-tree?*

  Manch fought to swallow the grimy rag of bloodsoaked air blocking his throat, and took a shaky breath. It had taken him by surprise, that was all. *I can’t react like this if I want to make it out there.* He eyed the newly-dyed silk robes. *At least, not if I don’t want to end up with my blood recoloring someone else’s wardrobe.*

  As he stared with morbid curiosity at the thick drops of blood falling languidly from the bottom hem of their robes, the suton at the head of the group caught his eye. Or rather, its eyes caught him. They were grey, or maybe just white and filmy without reflecting much light, and they were as empty as a corpse set upon by a swarm of bloodworms. The suton was looking at him, he was sure - it was even looking where his eyes were, technically. It just wasn’t actually meeting his eye. It didn’t look like it *could* meet his eye. Where were its pupils? Could its eye even focus on something as specific as Manch’s own?

  It broke eye contact - or whatever it was that had been - and Manch felt an involuntary shudder pass through him. He ground his teeth with sudden conviction. *If they pass the evaluation and I don’t, there’s going to be one more fulpir without a rider.*

  Pushed hard today in order to reach 10,000 words. That buffer is looking mighty comfy.

  Currently sitting on 21,960 out a targeted goal of...well, however big it gets. I'm finding my best method of writing is to have the key areas thought out (Beginning, middle, end, any major plot points) and beyond that just write any scenes I'd find interesting that fit in each section. Like, the 21,960 scenes all are either the intro or fit in before the climax. 

  It's a little modular, but gives me room in the editing to go "Ok, I think that this particular scene of interaction would probably work best here. So lets do a little tweaking of it's tone and the specifics so it does. Hm. If I put this framing device over here, it will make this point in the climax work better."

  Nothing worth posting around here. I just noticed that a lot of people in my generation that I know seem to suffer from this...lostness? Like they're not really sure where they're going or what they want to do?

  So I wanted to capture that in a teen coming of age story.

  The only real rational parts of the story is that I do deal with how the brain processes information, patterns of behavior, some stuff about drugs, sexuality, relationships...

  But it's more an INTJ character being an INTJ character rather than well crafted research on my part to make sure everything they say is accurate. I feel that way it's easy to look at it and go "Ok. I can easily see how the character went A - B - C+D = E, etc." and not have them be an author mouth piece.
