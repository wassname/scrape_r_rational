  i half expect the Tyrant to show up with benny hill theme playing in the background,

  &#x200B;

   Iserre  would make one fine chase scene.
  ```

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    Yeah, at least maneuvering around Harrow had a strategic reasoning to it (even if nobody remembers the initial one).
    ```

- u/Ardvarkeating101:
  ```
  So Cat now has her portal gun back and is using it appropriately.  All doubts have been assuaged.
  ```

- u/BaggyOz:
  ```
  How is the Army of Callow in Iserre? The Vales were collapsed and would take the army months to open up if Callow was so inclined to spend so much manpower on it when their economic situation is weak. The Staircase is far to the North and the Army would have to have fought through half of Procer to get to Iserre. 

  My only thought is that Maesgo got back to Callow and proceeded to blow the Vales up to open a path to Black.
  Rescuing Black would make sense since he's the only family he's got left outside of the Woe.
  ```

  - u/RiOrius:
    ```
    I could see pissed off Masego blasting his way to rescue Uncle Amadeus, but bringing an army doesn't seem like his style.
    ```

    - u/Cariyaga:
      ```
      He doesn't really need to bring the army. He could blast his way through and they could follow separately.
      ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        He could have created an opportunity to press the assault when he blindly marched forward, obliterating everything and everyone within his horizons. Juniper could have taken this as an opportunity to press the advantage into Procer, stealing food, weapons, and gold along the way to fund Callow's unstable economy.
        ```

  - u/Ardvarkeating101:
    ```
    They have oath bound fae at their command through Arcadia
    ```

    - u/cyberdsaiyan:
      ```
      Not sure if those oaths survived the eating of winter.
      ```

      - u/Ardvarkeating101:
        ```
        They were given by the fae, they should exist as long as they do
        ```

        - u/cyberdsaiyan:
          ```
          Aren't the oaths sworn to the Queen of Winter? Does that entity exist anymore?
          ```

          - u/Ardvarkeating101:
            ```
            They were sworn by the hunt to the queen of winter, who is now Komena
            ```

            - u/cyberdsaiyan:
              ```
              Not so sure about that, since Winter was absorbed/combined/somethinged with the Night, and so it's a farfetched assumption to make that the old title survived.

              But -

              >“We swear to your service, Queen of the Hunt,” the fae said. “Queen of Air and Darkness, Sovereign of Moonless Nights. We swear ‘til the day of last ruin, ‘til all debts are paid. We would ride beneath your banner, in this world and every other.”

              > The Queen of Callow rose to her feet, as bright and terrible as any of them, and softly laughed.

              > “What clever foxes you are,” she said. “Your oaths I accept, in the spirit they were given.”

              they swore to the "Sovereign of Moonless Nights" and since Catherine put a shitton of safeguards into that title... it might be relevant later... nothing is clear yet though.

              Edit: I just realized, Larat's debt of 7 crowns or something that he made, it hasn't been repaid yet. So you're probably right.
              ```

        - u/Locoleos:
          ```
          Yes but they were sworn to Catherine specifically in her capacity as the "sovereign of moonless night", which is a thing that's been mucked about with before. It's been spotlighted as a potential plot point, and I don't think that Akua taking over her body for a moment there was really adequate climax for that buildup.

          &#x200B;

          Plus, the last time she took a nap during a battle they stuck their thumbs firmly up their asses and refused to help at all.

          What I'm saying is that even if she ordered the hunt to obey Thief's commands or whatever, that might not still hold since their oaths are probably sworn to Sve Noc now.

  ```
  Cat really needs to write that holy book so she can properly enshrine snark as a main duty of the High Priestess of Night. 

  And that other thing about Rumena. But mostly that snark is a religious duty.

  ```
  Do we know any of the Hierarch's aspects yet? It's probably the reason he was able to lead his army through the Waning Woods and march much faster than normal. Considering what he believes in, I'd expect that one of his aspects will be to turn everyone under him into his "equals", i.e. Named, kinda like how Rider from Fate Zero can turn his followers into low level Servants with his Noble Phantasm.
  ```

    > Do we know any of the Hierarch's aspects yet?

    Mend and receive have been revealed, if memory serves.
    ```

  - u/OmniscientQ:
    ```
    It strikes me as far more likely that Anaxares walked into the Waning Woods in the desperate hope that "his" army weren't suicidal enough to follow. Of course, the Tyrant gave zero fucks about all that, and so the armies of the League of Free Cities followed their Heirarch into the valley of the shadow of death, and emerged unscathed. Rather than losing them, Anaxares merely cemented their absolute faith in his leadership.

    Blah blah blah foreign despots, something something Will of the People.

    EDIT: Although, he could still have such an aspect and just doesn't know it. It's not like he's been a willing participant in any of his Name shenanigans so far.
