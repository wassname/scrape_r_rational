  I have been keeping up with every single new chapter of this fic.  I am also a GM who made the mistake of recommending this story to his friends.  I'm either going to switch to a homebrew system or just institute a "If Jake does it, you can't" house rule.

  Cause I have to.

    *laugh*  Thank you!  That's a high compliment indeed.  So, what, you don't want your players using Wall of Iron in creative ways?  ;)

  New chapter is up.  Talking is a free action, and moving eighty miles in six seconds is no problem.
