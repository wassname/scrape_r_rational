## [Q] Rationalist fiction tends to have a main character whose ultimate goal is to end death/suffering, colonize the galaxy, and usher in a new era of peace and prosperity for humanity... Do any stories get to this point?

### Post:

This might be hard to answer without spoilers, just giving the name of a series could spoil the end but I'm really frustrated. I keep reading new stories linked here and most are works in progress, which is fine, but I'm dying to see a character actually realize their goals. I want a transhumanist utopia!

The closest I've gotten is reading the iain m banks culture novels or reading [Manna](http://marshallbrain.com/manna1.htm) by Marshall Brain

Are there other works where these concepts are explored in detail? I'm so tired of dystopian science fiction that makes technology out to be the bad guy who must be defeated at all costs :(

  If it's okay to start out with that as the setting, then:

   _Aristoi_ by Walter John Williams goes on the list.  Possibly Greg Egan novels although only _Permutation City_ and _Quarantine_ seem to me to be really good and they aren't set in happyland.  _The Golden Age_ by John C. Wright, but the sequels suck.  Many different novels by Peter F. Hamilton.

  Stories where the protagonists win sufficiently hard?  I'm having a hard time thinking of a single one.  Some of Alicorn's writing maybe.

    How hard do you think is winning 'sufficiently hard'?

    (I'm curious whether my current notes for the story I'm writing come anywhere close to that mark.)

  The problem is that you're asking about rationalist fiction. Have the main character be super intelligent *and* live in a utopian civilization? What would be interesting about that? There's no point in telling you what happens after the Death Star/Dark Tower blows up except to let you know that the heroes lived happily ever after.

  [Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom](http://craphound.com/down/download.php) is quite the opposite - The protagonist is terribly bad at life, and fucks up as much as any human possibly can in the world, but ends up for the most part completely fine.

  Also I haven't read it, but doesn't Accelerando fit your description pretty well?

  Banks gets closest to a true utopia. I'm not going to say utopias are boring, because they don't have to be, but there doesn't tend to be a whole lot of conflict, and conflict drives stories. And for whatever reasons, books that are essentially explorations of an idea or setting without much in the way of story don't tend to sell (though there are a few examples of this working, the only popular ones are extensions of existing franchises).

  If you just want the transhumanist happy ending that comes after the conflict is resolved ... I don't know of any. I tried writing that ending once, and it just felt too happy, but that might have been because of the type of story it was.

    Frankly, this sounds to me like fallacy and cowardice on the part of the writers.  [Plenty of stories](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoAntagonist) manage a [conflict](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Conflict) with some kind of Big Bad to fight.  In fact, since real people have a tendency to get into conflicts of some sort over things, you should expect that a utopia *will* have conflicts: they just won't be *existentially risky*, Save the World-y conflicts.  Besides which, that kind of conflict is exactly the kind people don't actually *want* to *participate in* on a regular basis.

    So basically, all forms of Man vs Man, Man vs Self, and Man vs Nature conflicts that *don't threaten the total extinction of your setting* should be available in a utopian setting -- authors just *think* that people would sit around going "ooohhhhhmmmm" like fucking movie-Zen monks all the time because they *haven't thought about it*.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:

      We disagree on the definition of utopia, I think. To me, utopia heavily implies conflict minimization, not just for the existentially risky stuff, but for all the day-to-day stuff as well. And when there is conflict, the utopia should be minimizing the drama involved.

      But I feel like when you say utopia, you're thinking of normal human society with only a few large things fixed, not what I would class as a utopia.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        When I use the word, I'm thinking, "fun-optimized habitat for people" rather than "conflict-minimized habitat."  Generally, I would hold that fun-optimizing the habitat means that a lot of "daily stuff", the little daily subgoals we have to get through in order to have fun, *do* get minimized, not only in the sense of conflict but in the sense of just making them easier because they're bloody unimportant.
        ```

      - u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer:
        ```
        Okay. Why can't your conflict be the person in charge of minimizing drama in a utopia? Or, as in Banks, the ones who protect the utopia from the barbarians at the gates and natural disasters? Seems really arbitrary to say it is almost without conflict *definitionally*.

        Why does it have to be protagonist against the government, or against someone else in their own utopian society? Those are the only two conflict elements that a utopia stops from being as effective.

          I'm not saying that you can't write utopian fiction, I just take issue with /u/eaturbrainz seeming utterly flabbergasted at the idea that utopias don't tend to have a lot of conflict - like this is some act of cowardice or lack of imagination instead of just being the way that utopias are structured.

          The Culture novels are all set at the hard edges of the utopian society, the places where the Culture interacts with other, less perfect societies. I'm trying to think through all of the novels, and I can't recall one that takes place purely within the Culture itself - they almost all deal with how the Culture interacts with other civilizations. And that's because within the Culture itself, there is relatively little in the way of (interesting) conflict, possibly with the exception of the Minds that do all the actual decision making.

          Again, I'm not saying that you can't write successful and entertaining fiction set within a utopia, because you definitely can, I'm trying to explain why this is so uncommon - and it's not because writers are lazy or unimaginative.

            Well, if he and I can come up with simple and well-known examples...that sort of *does* suggest a lack of imagination inherent in your statement. Whenever utopias are written of, they are interesting in some way.

            >The Culture novels are all set at the hard edges of the utopian society

            Not quite true, but even Jane Austin novels are set at the "hard edges" of their part of society, even if that is upper class people who technically don't fear for their next meal. No one writes stories about people without problems, just living normal lives, but those with serious personal or external issues that need to be resolved.

            *Seinfeld* personifies this, with almost every problem the characters experience being internally generated while they live in the lap of (worldwide median) luxury in New York city. But they are also the most dysfunctional characters you can imagine, and they constantly rub up against a perfectly functioning society's minor issues and turn them into major ones.

            ---

            As for conflict inside a utopia, there were several times that outsiders (like in *Use of Weapons*) were squicked out by the Culture. An entire habitat full of Culture citizens was endangered in *Consider Phlebas*, and their civilization is actively at war in that story.

            People have conflicts about time use and the way they personally fit into the Culture. Body modifications exclude friends from interacting the same ways, and desires for adventure and excitement aren't drugged or genetically engineered out of anyone, so they still have them.

            > I'm trying to explain why this is so uncommon - and it's not because writers are lazy or unimaginative.

            That is exactly what you have not shown, and what at least I am suggesting.

            The fact that Dystopias in fiction are so common strongly suggests this. Dystopias are so easy because everything is rapidly approaching maximum shittiness. The level of imagination required to pull out an exciting story is minimal.

            It is, in short, prone to lazy, unimaginative writing, and is more popular *amongst writers* than the utopian fiction genre.

    It always bugs me to hear this, because it's so clearly a Bad Ending to me. Do people *really* read Banks and think *that* is a perfect society? 

    They life in motherfucking *castes*. The protagonists - our viewpoint characters! - are all from the lowest caste. The one that has essentially no legal protection or social standing, can't own industrial or military infrastructure and live at the whim of their masters, and mostly end up committing suicide in the depths of old age even though **they can cure aging** - because it's socially unacceptable to live. And half of the protagonists are actively fighting the Culture, for various reasons!

    Is it because they're the "liberal" faction and the fanbase is primarily liberal, or because they're the most commonly-recurring faction so they get positive associations from Banks' writing, or what? 

    ^^I ^^notice ^^that ^^I'm ^^confused.
