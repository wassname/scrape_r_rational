  Complaints about update frequency notwithstanding, this was a good chapter. Experimenting with battlefield tactics in a controlled setting was a neat idea. 

  The added length seemed a bit unfocused, though. The author will need to re-calibrate to make sure pacing is as tight as previous books.

    I kind of wonder if she won't end up overconfident from her test; trench tactics look a lot different once the other side brings artillery and specialists of its own.

      The army of the dead is a pretty difficult tactical problem to solve.

      Line warfare against people is usually about logistics and morale, as I understand it. So, like, making it hard for your enemy to feed their soldiers, tiring out their soldiers via marching. & fortifications, and then convincing the soldiers to break formation and run away.

      None of that applies to the dead. The dead have greater endurance AND numerical superiority. Barring narrative mojo, every zombie eventually has to be stabbed by a living soldier.

      The fact that the dead have parity or superiority in artillery, air support, and special forces makes this a real uphill battle for the living.

        Eh. Never retreating isn't really a point in the undead's favor.

        During early WWII, the Soviets biggest disadvantage was Stalin's insistence that troops defend their positions to the last man. It means any defeat automatically turned into a massacre, even when the Soviets could have fallen back to stronger positions.

        See also this fight, where the Binds sent their small army straight into a meat-grinder, even though they could have gone further with guerilla tactics and forcing the Army of Callow to pursue them.

  Cat's wit is as sharp as ever. So is her ability to put the right amount of nuance into her discipline.
