  The big news here, to me, is that they introduced "The Crack".  Underground adventures seem likely soon.

    Woah there! Don't get ahead of yourself. We need a few more months of preparing, and discussion, and maybe some side character viewpoints, and some interpersonal politics, and then maybe just a little more discussion, before we actually go into the crack. Give it time...

      You joke, but I can tell you with confidence that it will be >7 weeks(chapters) before they actually venture into the crack. 

      How does that make you feel?

        Honestly, I think I'm done with this story at this point. I liked it; I even liked the 'stuck in the cave' arc. But it's starting to feel like the author is just milking it now. I don't really care about all these different character perspectives and minutia. More critically, the main character hasn't stopped doing stupid things without proper preparation. It was forgivable for the first 3/4 of the book given that he was out of his element and had no time to figure out a plan. But now? He has all the time he needs and he still fails to prepare properly, instead just rushing in and figuring it out as he goes. He should be dead. It's not a compelling read for me anymore. 

        So yeah, when you say that, I'm not actually surprised. Like, I'm joking, but I'm kind of not really. Maybe I'll check back on this work in a year when I can read it as a block. We'll see.

          What stupid and unprepared things has he done recently?

            Mmm, I guess two things come to mind that rubbed me wrong. The first is the MC's heavy-handed insistence on operating the company as a direct democracy, despite widespread resistance and ignorance. He demonstrates no political savvy or leadership ability whatsoever, yet pushes forward with a seeming certainty that his ideas are best, and no one else's opinion on the topic matters. It gives a very neckbeard vibe, and it seems likely to cause real problems with faith in leadership of what amounts to a paramilitary unit. 

            The 2nd thing is that they tackled the very first lair they came across with an insufficient level of power. The MC made a huge deal over many, many chapters about being slow and taking things with a large degree of caution... and then dives into a lair with what clearly wasn't enough firepower to make it safe. I don't know if this is just a mediocre writing decision to try and make the stakes seem high, but it makes the MC seem like an incompetent planner.

              I think these are valid criticisms, especially the weird democracy implementation. The MC feels less sympathetic than he did at the beginning, more clueless despite knowing a lot more about the world, and the focus on the extended cast doesn't really do the story any favors, as it's not a strength of the author. The math obsession has also almost never paid off, despite math stuff being like 20% of the story.

                Yeah. It's like the MC is getting more stupid as he becomes integrated into this new world, rather than less. I get that part of it is supposed to be driven by his soul damage and whatnot, but at this point it's been ages with just increasing levels of naiveté and self-absorption. It's getting old, and the story is only becoming less focused on actual forward progress as time goes on.

              The democracy one makes sense to me. Rain's experienced all the drawbacks of being under someone else's thumb, both in the sense of being overpowered by someone's high level magic and being under the rule of an unstable tyrant. The former one explicitly traumatised him - hence wearing amour everywhere. So Rain's insistence on not becoming like them makes perfect sense, if it's a bad idea it's a bad idea that very much fits his charachter.

              For the lair, I just went back and checked and it looked like Rain did bring in as much firepower as he could have. He would have brought more but for some reason Ameliah said no. (Talhart and Stevvo saying no makes sense though). And as Rain says "Bringing a Fire user into a Cold lair sounded like common sense, until you considered that their two options were a little girl and an impulsive teenager who couldn’t hit the broad side of a barn."

              There is a question of why they pressed on after the first fight didn't got perfectly, but then the first fight did go quite well. Everyone finished with near 100% health - with the only damage they took being from Rain's mage burn. We see a party screen after the first fight when everyone's back to 100% hp. And honestly I think you're wrong about an insufficient level of power, the boss fight we saw against the turtle didn't even scratch them.

                Sure, I agree the *motivation* makes sense. The total lack of competency in the implementation is what bothers me. It turns me off the story, but obviously you're free to like it if you wish.

                You make a good point with the fight in the lair. It's true that no one was too badly hurt, but it was definitely played up as a big risk with a lot of uncertainty and fear. Maybe this was just a choice by the author to make the stakes higher, but it kind of undermined the entire point of what Rain was doing. Ramping up the tension just to make the stakes seem higher isn't great writing, even if it's not actual in-universe failure on the character's part.

                  Has Rain ever been portrayed as socially skilled? People fell in line behind him because he's powerful and was doing something, but actually skilled? I recall him shutting up and letting smoother members of the party talk whenever the stakes were high.

                  To me this feels like a natural evolution of what we've seen so far. He's not a charismatic politician, but he doesn't want to be what he is good at which is giving picking reliable subordinates and giving them sensible orders.

                  When I re-read it, it felt spooky but not really high stakes. It was full of creepy villagers, but as soon as the battle started rain took them all down with a single blast because they're level 3. The blizzard was more of a threat than the spirit caller, and once they got to the turtle they just dismantled it safely by using boring but practical tactics.

                    No, it's been clear that Rain is not that socially skilled. That's not the problem. The problem is his arrogant insistence that he's still right, even in areas where it's clear he's not very skilled. That's why I say I'm getting neckbeard vibes. It's not a compelling character trait, and it's honestly not even that believable for someone who's been put through near-death situations for months. Rain appears incapable of actually learning humility. The author says he learned from his failures, but the character himself doesn't actually show that. Honestly, i think it's more just poor writing than anything. 

                    > When I re-read it, it felt spooky but not really high stakes.

                    Maybe I'm misremembering, but there were several cliffhanger cuts that made it seem like things were about to go wrong. There was an chapter end where rain forced to use his heat aura, even though it had just been established that the lair punished such use with extreme cold and snow fall. The last line of the chapter was Rain making a forced action to use an ability that had been established as a bad idea in this lair. Then the next chapter was other characters outside the lair being very worried that things were taking too long. Maybe this is just an attempt by the author to make things seem high-stakes, but if that's not mirrored by *actual* in-story risk, then it's just mediocre writing.

                    It simply doesn't work to have both a main character who is supposed to be very cautious in planning things out ahead of time, while also having high dramatic tension due to the predictable results of that characters actions.

  Another slow one. At least the ending was happy. I feel like ascention is going to absorbe some of these new people, but i wonder if that's going to stretch their resources. Probably some extra moral delemas on the way too.

- u/CorneliusPhi:
  ```
  I feel like what Delve needs is a time skip.  Like "we found a dungeon that produced level \~11 Blues.  9 months later everyone in Ascension had a 10-12 cap.  Time to go deeper."
