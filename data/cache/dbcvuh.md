## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  It's been a while, because I kept trying to make a big monday post. This might end up that way, but I figured it's more important to give out recommendations than it is to give out a lot of them. Standard disclaimer: none of these are necessarily rational, but most of them are intelligent or otherwise suited to this community.

  **WORM:**

  * [*Daystar*](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/daystar-worm-exalted-crossover-au.773104/) is a Worm/Exalted crossover. Just saying that is a blast from the past, but it's a relatively recent story. It starts pretty interesting, but I feel like the last arc has lost a lot of momentum. I'm still not sure where it's trying to go. It also has a budding Taylor/Sophia relationship, and that ship can burn in hell where it belongs. Nevertheless, it's got okay grammar, and it's over the 30k word hump, so it beats like 75% of *Worm* fanfiction. What I like more is...

  * [*Pyrrhic Victory*](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/pyrrhic-victory-rwby-worm.775690/), a RWBY crossover where Pyrrha Nikos is inserted into the body of Emma Barnes after >!Pyrrha dies in season 3!<, a year or so before *Worm* canon. This story really delivers on the feeling of impostor syndrome that such a situation would create, but it's still not out of its second arc. Still, at 49k words, I feel like it has a little while to go before it dies. I'm really loving its direction.

  * [*Trailblazer*](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/trailblazer-worm-gundam-au.680881/) is a great Gundam alt-power/fusion. I feel like I read it and dropped it before, but I must be imagining things, because when I went through it recently it felt like one of the best *Worm* stories I've ever read. It really nails the dissonance between Taylor's perspective and how the rest of the world views her - her costume has a *dramatic cape*, but she has no idea that she comes across as authoritative and put-together. It's nearly at 350k words and updates regularly. If I had a complaint, it's that the AU elements from Gundam could have been introduced more smoothly.

  * [*Tank*](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/tank-worm-altpowertaylor-au-complete.700525/) (complete) is a piece of *Worm* crack fiction where Taylor has the power to turn into an endless army of Soviet tanks. Roon is probably the only person in the fandom that could have written it, because the story parodies two things simultaneously, in brutally hilarious fashion. The first is the explicit parody of USSR-brand communism. The second is the meta-commentary about stories which try to portray *Worm*'s neo-nazi faction as sympathetic - she's trying to tell the brain-dead idiots on Spacebattles that those stories are exactly as absurd as Tankie!Taylor is. It's amazing and I love it.

  * [*Mauling Snarks*](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/mauling-snarks-worm.41471/) is actual trash. I've read one hundred and fifty chapters of it, mostly because I ran out of actually good Worm fanfiction, and I can say without a doubt that it's the blandest wormfic I've ever read. Everyone has the same voice, there is no villain beyond redemption, and *nothing ever happens*. Even when you think it's going to dip into fanon and offend you, the consequences are so minimal it's hard to muster the energy. *Why* have I read 150 chapters then? Because there are elements of it that are fascinating. There's this dissonance between how the author has written/views the main character and how the character actually looks when you zoom out on their behavior. After reading most of the story, I can really buy that this character is Jack Slash's niece: the weird emotionless tone of the narrative fits with a sociopath who only gets entertainment from fucking with people, and Taylor's bizarre willingness to cross boundaries as if they never even existed fits how I would imagine a Slaughterhouse 9 member.  I don't recommend you read this story, but if you feel like those things above would give you enough value, it will do in a pinch. Updates regularly, and has a huge backlog of chapters.

  * [*Still Defiant*](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/still-defiant-worm-defiant-peggy-sue.789799/) is a brand new story, at three chapters long. Normally I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend something that early, but this story has the distinction of making the most succinct and accurate assessment of a peggy-sue scenario I've ever seen. This story is the closest to classically rational on this whole list. Quote:

  >There’s a remote possibility that this is a simulation of some sort, but that sort of worry is something completely unaddressable. I’ll act as if this is real, and if it isn’t then I’ll either never learn otherwise, or discover the truth and adjust accordingly.

  >In much the same way, my memories of ‘the future’ could merely have been a sort of one-time precognitive vision. But, I’ll never be able to know the difference. Better to take them at face value - doubting myself in such a way could only be a hindrance.

  **NARUTO:**

  * About once every two months, I return to Naruto fanfiction to scope out what people in the fandom seem to think is the best of the best. [*Sanitize*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12431866/1/Sanitize) is one of the stories that justifies coming back. I found it in the [Gold Standard Recommendation List](https://www.reddit.com/r/NarutoFanfiction/comments/bn5cec/the_gold_standard_of_naruto_fanfiction_20page/) - I can vouch for about half of the stories in there. This one is among the better ones. SI with a basic recollection of modern medical technology gets inserted into the Warring Clans era and runs her own clinic, quickly turning it into neutral territory. I really love how down-to-earth this story is, compared to the frenetic action of ninja. Slow updates.

  * [*Retrograde Motion*](https://archiveofourown.org/works/12566900/chapters/28622888) is a Sakura peggy-sue story, also from the Gold Standard list. If I'm being honest it's kind of trash, but it isn't terribly written, and when you acknowledge all of the AU elements for what they are it can be entertaining. A good time-waster, and a novel experience if you haven't read Naruto fanfiction in a while. Sloooow updates.

  * [*What You Knead*](https://archiveofourown.org/works/17401478/chapters/40958717) was published early this January, so I'm a little late to the party. As a short story, it's pretty easy to miss, but even at its current length it more than meets my minimum standards for a good fic. Kakashi decides to become a baker as a hobby, and it helps him work through a lot of his trauma better than his usual coping mechanisms. It's actually remarkably similar to *Loaf* from the *Worm* fandom - another recommendation for that, if you haven't read it. Definitely a feel-good story. In progress/On hiatus, but it's slice of life, so it could sit as it is forever and still be worth reading.

  **MISC:**

  * [*Walk Two Lifetimes*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10572048/1/Walk-Two-Lifetimes) is a Bleach SI fic, set from the perspective of someone with "vague knowledge of two arcs of Bleach" who is reincarnated into Hisana Kuchiki. I put "vague knowledge" in airquotes because the author *really* overestimated what knowledge that would be. Nevertheless, it's emotionally compelling in a way only the best SI stories could be. It ends on a cliffhanger, and it's not due for another update for six or so months, but if you're okay with a little bit of sadness it's a must-read.

  * [*Theatrum Alchemicum*](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/theatrum-alchemicum-technical-waifu-simulator-tournament.8063/) is a NSFW quest on Questionable Questing that misled me into thinking it was actually NSFW. There's a lot of risque fanservice moments, but currently no actual sex scenes as of when I caught up. Instead, there is a lot of interesting worldbuilding going into creating the context for the "waifu tournament" that the main character takes part in. I'm really happy with how this quest is going, and how the quest-maker is rewarding the players for making risky plays instead of punishing them. Like a Royal Road story, only competent. Updates frequently.

  * [*United We Stand*](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/united-we-stand-halo-mass-effect-crossover.736864/) is your typical Mass Effect crossover where humanity is swapped out with the the UNSC and UEG from Halo. It, in true Spacebattles fashion, spends way to long on individual battles and goes into way to much detail about the military capabilities of all of the participants. But where it stops being typical is in how it treats each of the different parties. Instead of reading like an /r/HFY manifesto, *United We Stand* allows the Citadel Council the be both realistic and altruistic in how it acts: not as an adversary, but as an ally against a much greater threat. And even the Covenant are given their fair shake - for a genocidal alien race, anyway. They may not be sympathetic, but you *can* understand how and why they operate, even if the reason is fucking stupid. This novelty alone is a good enough reason to push through all of the battles, for me. I can't wait for the next updates. Recently revived, but has been written entirely within the span of this year.

  As always, don't count on these being great to read for you. But they all get my seal of approval for being tolerable enough to catch up on. I'm up-to-date on the latest chapter for most of these, and the ones I'm not up-to-date on I'm waiting to binge through. I can guarantee that the grammar in each is well above par for fanfiction, and I can also guarantee that none of them have done things that would have made me drop them.

  Soft rankings, subject to change:

  1. Trailblazer
  2. Walk Two Lifetimes
  3. Tank
  4. What You Knead
  5. Sanitize
  6. Pyrrhic Victory
  7. Still Defiant (assuming it keeps updating for a while)
  8. United We Stand
  9. Theatrum Alchemicum
  10. Daystar
  11. Retrograde Motion
  12. Mauling Snarks
  ```

  - u/Flashbunny:
    ```
    This was a really great list. I can vouch for Sanitize being great, Still Defiant and Daystar being pretty great, and Mauling Snarks being disappointing. I will definitely check out your other recommendations!

    > And even the Covenant are given their fair shake - for a genocidal alien race, anyway.

    As a point of ultra-pedantry, they're a caste system of multiple genocidal alien races.

    > Trailblazer

    Uhh. I do want to like this, but the AI portrayal is a bit much. Does it get better later on, or is she forever a deus ex machina sidekick?
    ```

    - u/Robert_Barlow:
      ```
      She's a sidekick, so far. But she takes a smaller role in the plot after the early chapters. I figured a lot of her completeness can be attributed to Veda being a complete blueprint from the Gundam universe, and the general tendency of tinker creations to work with minimal resources. I can't say she'll be unimportant forever, but she doesn't trivialize every encounter or something like that.

      EDIT: Also, Worm isn't that realistic about AI in the first place, so it's not necessarily out of line for the setting.
      ```

      - u/Anderkent:
        ```
        Worm is not that realistic about AI, but the development is off-screen. Maybe if I was familar with Gundam it'd be more tolerable, but 10 chapters in every scene with the AI is incredibly grating.
        ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    Seconding *Retrograde.* Good rec.
    ```

  - u/Anew_Returner:
    ```
    Just curious, but as someone who also has consumed a... less than healthy dose of Worm fanfics, which one is your favorite out of all the ones you have read? Not asking for a top 5 (although if you can I'd be all up for it) but which one did you enjoy the most, found most memorable, keep thinking back to, etc?
    ```

    - u/Robert_Barlow:
      ```
      The Gold Standard of Worm fanfiction looks something like this.

      Longfics:

      * *A Cloudy Path* probably gets the Original Flavor award for being pretty similar up until maybe the last five arcs.
      * *Split* is devastating and wonderfully written. Best version of a Trump power.
      * *Mixed Feelings* is cute but has a lot of padding.
      * *Trailblazer* really captures the good parts of mech anime and everything else doesn't suck.
      * *A Subtle Knife* is the best crossover set in a different universe.
      * *El-Ahrairah* gets the specifics of Worm's shardlore wrong, but it does the best I've seen in any fanfiction.

      Smaller fics:

      * *Deputy* is the best unpowered Taylor, but it would be beaten by *Denial* if that hadn't died.
      * *Camera Shy* is the best cluster!Taylor. Out of maybe three or four fics, sure, but it's still good.
      * *Aspects*, for nailing Wildbow's style instead of just Worm's style.
      * A ton more alt!powers and stuff under 100k words, many of which I don't have time to sort through.

      And finally, specific authors:

      * Anything by UnwelcomeStorm for character interaction driven stories, but especially *Constellations*.
      * maroon_sweater for crackfics, and I'll stand by that until roon finishes something that *isnt* a crackfic. Maybe Loaf counts.
      * Harbin is a good writer with a lot of dead stories.
      * ManMagnficent for good characterization (usually)
      * RavensDagger, but only read until the jokes start getting old.
      * Any authors that are popular in other fandoms and have branched out into Worm, like Ryuugi.
      * And pretty much anything else by an author on this list.

  The topic today is retro fantasy.

  [Nine Princes in Amber](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/92121.Nine_Princes_in_Amber) by Roger Zelazny. Zelazny was known more for sci-fi than fantasy, but this fantasy series moves quickly and paints in broad strokes. The premise would be a bit of a spoiler for the first book, but its ontological implications might be of interest to those on the sub.

  [One for the Morning Glory](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/152328.One_for_the_Morning_Glory) by John Barnes. Could be considered a predecessor to Practical Guide in that it's about characters aware they're taking part in stories. Has some amazing lines. You should take this book very seriously and not at all seriously, just as it takes itself. The opening execution sequence alone is worth the price of admission.

  [His Dark Materials](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18116.His_Dark_Materials) by Philip Pullman. *What if souls were empirically real?* This question has a huge number of epistemic, ontological, theological, ethical, and practical concerns, and Pullman pokes into an impressive number of them. 

  [A Wizard of Earthsea](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13642.A_Wizard_of_Earthsea) by Ursula K. Le Guin. This book is incredibly spare in conception and prose. Rewarding reading.

  [Tigana](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/104089.Tigana) by Guy Gavriel Kay. What if the name of a land were stolen from its people? Kay is one of the better writers in fantasy, and this is one of his better books.

    Nine Princes in Amber &al:  a lot of fun.  First five books are better than the second five.  Don't read if you care about minor continuity errors.  Stay away from the Betancourt prequels.

    His Dark Materials: Excellent first two books.  Third book...  has problems.  The downer part of the ending is contrived (though I'll forgive that if the sequel trilogy it sets up is any good); the victory over the (arguable) primary antagonist is a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment, and, well, there's some implied creepy stuff going on given the ages of the protagonists.

    A Wizard of Earthsea: I really need to re-read this.  If you liked the bits of HPMOR about seals that shouldn't be opened, there's a lot of people opening those seals and having to deal with them.

    Tigana: All I can say about this book is that, after reading his debut trilogy, I was emphatic about not reading any other GGK novels.  I was assigned this book as part of a college course, and it completely reversed my opinion of the author (though not of *The Fionavar Tapestry*), and I went on to read most of what he's written since then.  It's *that* good.

    I haven't read One for the Morning Glory.
    ```

    - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
      ```
      > well, there's some implied creepy stuff going on given the ages of the protagonists.

      I mean, that stuff is creepy if it involves adults and teens. Given the ages of *both* the protagonists... they're a bit on the young side, but I'd say it happens. I wouldn't call it creepy, it's not like there's anything voyeuristic about it, nothing is stated outright either, it's just vaguely suggested.
      ```

      - u/Nimelennar:
        ```
        I did say that it was just implied.

        And the creepy bit isn't so much that it happened, but >!that it was both prophesied and necessary to avert the end of the world.  The fact that it was wholly consensual mitigates that *a bit*, but there's still the lingering impression that the universe manipulated them into it.!<
        ```

        - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
          ```
          Fair, but >!from a materialist deterministic viewpoint, free will simply doesn't exist and pretty much everything is preordained from the start anyway. What you're pointing out is the fundamental problem of free will - an issue that exists within all narratives that include prophecies and future-past feedback loops. If such things really were possible, well, we'd have to deal with a lot of situations in which we both would have the impression of having made a free choice yet the outcome was effectively determined from the start. Or from a different point of view - is it any more moral, or any less existentially terrifying, that Harry Potter might have been forced to kill Voldemort by prophecy, than Lyra and Will just making love, without being prompted or pushed,  simply following what at the time was a genuine impulse they felt, even though it was also prophesied to happen?!<.
          ```

          - u/Nimelennar:
            ```
            As I don't really want to get into a discussion about >!prophecy and determinism!< right now, I'm just going to say that even if it could be rendered not-creepy in a Watsonian sense, it remains kind of creepy in a Doylist sense.  That is, the fact that Pullman >!made a romantic liaison between thirteen-year-olds necessary to save the world (regardless of how far that off-screen intimacy progressed)!< is what is creeping me out, even if it could be explained in a way that made it completely not-creepy in-universe.
            ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    Seconding *Nine Princes* (Corwyn cycle only). 

    It has some of the best character development in fantasy I've read. The titular nine princes do a lot of growing up over the course of the series, despite their ages. All the clever power plays that are the heart of the early books seem incredibly immature in retrospect.

    It also has the best take on ye olde amnesia plot I've seen anywhere. Too often, a shallow blank-slate protagonist slowly discovers a past self that's essentially a complete stranger. But here the protagonist clearly *is* their past self, a complete character with all the depth of personality and experience - only missing the memories. That makes the mystery so much more tantalising.
    ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    Man, His Dark Materials is a blast from the past for me. I read those just after realizing I was and always had been an atheist, and they helped me work through some of the implications of that by showing me other ways the world could have been constructed. Definitely good books, though also definitely on the YA side of things.
    ```

- u/MagicWeasel:
  ```
  I've finished Luminosity now and Radiance, the sequel. Someone warned me the sequel was terrible and was a marked drop in quality but I honestly noticed no difference - Radiance has a new viewpoint character who I didn't like as much but I still liked fine, and the plot was a lot more complicated (I lost track of a few characters and was scrunching my face up going "who is Jane, again?"), but it was still an incredible story. I'm working my way through the short story collections now. 

  If anyone was scared off by the thought of (mild spoiler about the nature of the endings (e.g. happy vs sad, satisfying vs unsatisfying)) >!Luminosity having a sad ending!< and Radiance being no good , rest assured that Radiance reads great and >!has a satisfying ending, and even has a collection of assorted shorts/flashes that do prologue and epilogue stuff in very cool ways!< 

  Whole-hearted recommendation, though I was hoping more romance from a Twilight fan-fic. The series didn't really deal with romance in what I'd consider a rational way: the romance was a lot of the time supernaturally "forced", so relationship issues didn't feature into the story. That said, it was good to see a rational work that didn't completely ignore romance. But my quest continues.

    I think the problem may be that people just don't like the change of character. I know I missed Bella and was disappointed by what she was like at the beginning of Radiance, but well, that's just the outcome of having grown used to her as a POV character.
    ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      Yeah, I missed Bella at first but I quickly grew to enjoy the new character, though I didn't like how the stuff with Chelsea changed her (though that was kind of *the entire point* so whatever). That said I think the new character was overall much more interesting with Bella as her power was really cool.

  I saw this recommended here some time ago and wanted to echo the rec.

  [Release That Witch ](https://m.wuxiaworld.co/Release-that-Witch/) is an uplift isekai. A mechanical engineer wakes up one day in the body of a loser prince in a Medieval setting, only to discover that the witches being hunted by the church actually have magic powers. He attracts them to his banner and uses them to industrialize the region, eventually wielding modern processes and tech against knights, the church, and other supernatural forces in the world.

  I felt it did a great job not just uplifting, but in explaining the mechanics behind various technologies and how they might be used in a low-tech setting. It *does* trend to the power fantasy side of things, but all in all tends to at least ensure that the MC has to pay for each resounding victory with a slog of R&D failures first.

  And I dunno man. There's just something viscerally *satisfying* about watching snooty knights and nobles get roflstomped with heavy artillery.

  This is a Chinese translation and suffers from middling grammar, odd phrasing, bad formatting, and strange punctuation, as well as occasional chapter order mess ups. If you can overlook all that, tho, it's a satisfying piece of work.

  Oh, also no harem, minimal romantic bullshit.
  ```

  - u/Anew_Returner:
    ```
    Are there any other isekai or medieval fantasy stories with that kind of premise? I'm reading RTW and watching the Dr.Stone anime, but I'm not sure how or where to look for more stuff like this. Dungeon fics scratch a similar itch, but most of them are about upgrading the dungeon itself and not getting an entire nation/civilization up to speed with modern times.

      [Tales of the Reincarnated Lord](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/tales-of-the-reincarnated-lord/), but the author was forced to drop it after 590 chapters.

      Joel Rosenberg's Guardians of the Flame series has some of this element. The later books of the series get more into it. A handful of college students get transported to their D&D world. One of the PCs (not the protagonist) was studying civil engineering and gets rail and gunpowder going.

      [A Hero's War](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/2826/a-heros-war) contains a magic assisted industrial revolution and doesn't shy away from exploring how both the magic and the technology work. (Slow updates)

      There are novels like Lord of the Mysteries that do like Worth the Candle and feature a protagonist isekai into a world several hundred years past the arrival of a previous industrializing isekai.

  I'm not sure I'm still allowed to post here since it's over midnight here, but I find surprising I don't see [Ajin](https://myanimelist.net/manga/49865/Ajin) (The Manga) being recommended here more often. It is probably the most rational manga I've seen in a while. Most certainly the most rational very popular one.

  There's some straw vulcanism, arguably, but most of the actions of the main character make very much sense. And the immortality is absolutely munchkined to hell. The main character is rational, or at least very close to rational, the powers are consistent at all times, the villain is charismatic and pretty much every character is realistic even when they are not rational themselves.

    Loosely speaking, the [vigilantes spinoff](https://www.viz.com/shonenjump/chapters/my-hero-academia-vigilantes) is more rational than the base series. Its power level is lower than the regular version, and concurrently it's somewhat more "thinky", with the important battles (and even some of the less important, played-for-laughs ones) have a greater focus on well considered use of more limited powers. Lest I give you the wrong idea, it's not munchkiny, though.

      Vigilantes jumped the shark for me when >!It turned out the protagonist had actually been suppressing the true nature of his power due to childhood trauma and his quirk is actually on the level of a pro hero's in terms of power and versitality!< Given that we had the EXACT SAME narrative bullshit in the main series, anyone hoping that vigilantes moves away from it would be a bit disappointed.

        I completely disagree. [spoiler](#s "Early on, in the main series, it's mentioned that sometimes, peole find out that their quirks don't work in the same way they first expect. For example, a quirk that lets you spray water from your hands might actually be a quirk that lets you condense water from the air and launch it. Meanwhile, there are plenty of examples of people finding new uses for their quirks. Though with one caveat-- the people who find these new uses tend to be, overwhelmingly, heroes and villains. This is completely unsuprising-- who else is more likely to find out that their quirk had additional versatility than the people constantly using them? The Vigilante MC fits this exactly. He thought his power was to slide on surfaces so long as he had three contact points, and for most of his life that was all he could do. But it turns out, his real power is the ability to project a force from his extremities. It just so happens that, without training, he needs at least three contacts for it to do anything. Every feat he's pulled off is an extension of that power. If he gets a further powerup, it will be that he can project a force from his entire body, but for psychological reasons it's easiest to do it from his extremities. It follows a logical progression from a simple power, but since he doesn't know that power from the beginning (because who would investigate some nobody's power) we get aspects of it revealed to us over time.")

          To each their own. >!People discovering "new dimensions" to their quirk or "unlocking" new abilities for it reeks of the deus ex machina shounen BS that i thought BnHA was trying to avoid. It's worth noting that in the main series, that whole bit about being able to do so only really started being a thing after the protagonist got their own deus ex machina upgrade. The only one I really liked was Twice's, because his was rooted in actual deep psychological trauma that was clear from his character introduction, not "oh yeah i spanked u as a child until u stopped floating around, guess u forgot lol"!<

    BNHA x Oregairu crossover [https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/my-hero-school-adventure-is-all-wrong-as-expected-bnha-x-oregairu.697066/](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/my-hero-school-adventure-is-all-wrong-as-expected-bnha-x-oregairu.697066/)

    Hikkigaya isn't a rational character, but he nevertheless has many traits similar to one, making him enjoyable to read. His ability is to copy up to 108 quirks and use any one of them at a time at 108th the strength of the original quirk. There is munchkinry.

  Not exactly "rational", but what is the book that has the most realistic portrayal of the effects magic (or some other weird thing) would have on society? Bonus points if the author actually has a background in economy/sociology. Extra bonus points if it either modern times (harder to explain technology), or at least tries to explain why society hasn't evolved technologically for thousands of years.

    Check out Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn series. It starts out in your basic medieval society, but following books timeskip ahead to the industrial revolution. There are books planned for the modern era as well.

      I've read them already, but it's a decent example of it, although I don't think Sanderson goes that deep into the actual implications, just on the surface on the surface to have enough to create a story around

        The only other story that comes to mind at the moment is [Metaworld Chronicles](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/14167/metaworld-chronicles). 

        >Gwen Song awoke in a new world where all that she was familiar with had disappeared and she must begin from zero. A 21st-century tale of an Earth ruled instead by magic, where humanity lives in enclaves shielded from magical beasts and otherworldly beings. Follow Gwen as she struggles to once again rebuild her life in the new world, a tale of companionship, adventure, and Spellcraft! Grow with Gwen as she grows from high school to university, and finally onto the real world, discovering the secrets of a real-life world made unreal by magic and Mages. 

        >Inspired by the spell system of classic Dungeon and Dragons, but set in the Modern World.   

        It does deal with economy ad society (in her previous life the MC was an economist/business owner), but it's not exactly "deep." Plus the way the author writes is a bit odd, slightly jarring but not terrible.

        It also deals with politics (to an extent), a society that had to build up a country around mages (the "Tower system") and the MC travels to different countries with their own distinct culture, government, mythology, etc.

          Should be noted that great worldbuilding aside, this is very much a popcorn fic. Think along the lines of "technically competent xanxia with a great setting" and you won't be too far off.

            The worldbuilding is my favourite part. Seeing how the Chinese communist government shoot themselves in the foot because >!they refuse to use faith-based magic when fighting the undead!<, or how the Incas survived by >!creating a state religion that essentially creates a mini-god!< and everything else is a breath of fresh air compared to another generic medieval European society.

              Those concepts are very much in the more recent portions of the fic.

              I cant say what happens in the early or middle chapters though. I've been following this fic for over a year now and the overarching plot is lost to me now. I should reread it.

                I've found the last few arcs pretty interesting.

                Mild spoilers >!It's a tournament arc. Normally I hate these things, but the tournament takes the MC across the world and introduces a whole lot of interesting places.!<

                There isn't really an overarching plot. It's basically slice-of-life in a D&D Xianxia world.

                Like sure people are kinda worried that Gwen's gonna call the void down to Earth for supper or something but whatevs.

  So I had read hpmor, am caught up to Mol, and wanted more rational fics so I jumped in even though I hate superman and read the metropolitan man.   
  Holy Mother of fuck I hadn't got this big of a void in years. That was literary crack. It was rational well paced and just good. And I need more rational fiction. Much more and finished preferably. Any recs?

  - u/noridmar:

    Worth the candle, from the same author as Metropolitan Man. Be warned though that the Void (Beast) will probably eat you alive.
