## [Biweekly Challenge] Gods

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6def1q/biweekly_challenge_low_budget/) the prompt was "Low Budget", and our winner was /u/arenavanera, with [their story, "A boring test in a room"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6def1q/biweekly_challenge_low_budget/di27otv/). Go read it now, and /u/arenavanera, congratulations on your second win!

##### This Time

This time the challenge is **Gods**. You are free to take this in whatever direction you please, whether the god(s) in question are literal or metaphorical, whether they're actively present in the story or merely discussed by the characters. If you're writing a story that involves a real world religion, try not to be a dick about it. In issuing this challenge I'm largely thinking about Scott Alexander's work (examples [A](http://unsongbook.com/), [B](http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/15/answer-to-job/), [C](http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/08/17/the-goddess-of-everything-else-2/)). Remember that prompts are meant to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, June 21st.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

    Nice! For a while I was convinced the story would end with [spoiler](#s "him choosing a god that simply offered him peace from other gods.")

    I like it!  I was expecting a story where he picks a munchkin power and somehow escapes the cost, but was pleasantly surprised.  (Not because I don't love munchkin stories, just because it's fun to have some variety.)

    Wow. That was fantastic! I loved everything about this story.

    If I were in his position I'd try to find anyone else who made that deal and see if there were any hidden downsides. Also, I'm surprised he didn't think to ask. From pretty much the beginning I was wondering if he could find a god that would just do absolutely nothing.
