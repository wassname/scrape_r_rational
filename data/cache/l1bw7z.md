## [RT] Unpopular Opinion: Worm is the antithesis of rational

### Post:

**Spoilers up to Arc 13**

*Before I start with my issues with Worm, I'd just like to say that I still find Worm a very engaging read. I think the writing is great, and my only issue with it is that it doesn't fit the rational genre. 

I'm currently on Arc 14, so I'll only reference stuff prior to that*

My requirements for rational fiction include a rational protagonist, a consistent world (with people acting in their own interests), competent antagonists, and evidence building up to major plot events (if I can look back at earlier chapters, I can see the event happening)

In my opinion, Worm doesn't really have any of this. At this point, Taylor hasn't acted rationally at all. She has no plans, no real contingencies, and she just reacts to events. She's competent and clever, but she doesn't think rationally. She doesn't even think about her moral qualms rationally. Also, her plan to free Dinah is pretty much just "impress Coil", and she doesn't have a plan in case that fails.

The world is inconsistent, and there is nothing really rational about powers. They just \*exist\*. This isn't bad, it's just not rational. 

The people in the world seemingly have no self-preservation, and they mouth off to a supervillain with *SuperEvilBugPowersTM* who is trying to help them. This completely broke my suspension of disbelief because it just isn't realistic, and I can't picture anyone actually doing it

The antagonists are incompetent, and they all lose to a brand new villain. Mannequin, a superpowered robot, fails to do any sort of planning, and loses to spider silk. He has no tricks accumulated from his many years of villainy. In the second fight, he loses to a puppy. 

The major plot events are completely unforeseeable. Endbringer came completely out of left field. There was no way for the reader to predict that Endbringer would come, and he went from not-existing to existing in the span of one chapter, so I think that also breaks a core principle of rational fiction. 

I'd like to say again that this isn't a critique on the story, it's just why I don't think it belongs in /r/rational

**Edit: I admit I was wrong, and that my assumptions were based on a small slice of the book.**

  This opinion isn't even unpopular ...

  But I found this line so baffling that I have to respond to it:

  > The major plot events are completely unforeseeable. Endbringer came completely out of left field. There was no way for the reader to predict that Endbringer would come, and he went from not-existing to existing in the span of one chapter, so I think that also breaks a core principle of rational fiction.

  Rational fic doesn't mean literally every plot event is predictable. That wouldn't even make sense - every core concept has to be introduced at *some point*. There's no point before the introduction of the Endbringers where you would need to know about them to understand what's going on.

  In particular, the reveal of the Endbringers is the *introduction* of a conflict, not a resolution to anything.

  Wildbow have stated that worm isn't rational so you seem to be barking at a dead horse. That said

  "Having not yet read half of the story I can confidently assert that there is no information in the remaining book that could possibly make the setting internally consistent"

  If you really want it spoiled read [here](https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Entity). Worm does a good job at creating a internally consistent world in which superpowered people in capes hit others like them, though at your point you lack the information to see the underlying reasons.

      Probs for changing oppinion based on feedback. 

      I think that some of your critique is valid. Taylor doesn't have a clear goal and when she does make plans of questionable quality she doesn't spend enough time considering backup plans. People are generally less competent that could be required and >!'soft mind control'!< is narratively unsatisfying answer.

        But she doesn't pretend to be a rationalist or antything. Pretty sure she knows she is good at thinking on her feet in battle.

        Besides, planning is for thinkers. And she had a great one, so she wouldn't have felt pressure to make great plans just to be laughed at.

  Some of your statements here are assumptions that may not be true about the story at large. You're not even halfway through (the halfway point is somewhere around arc 19, by the way); what makes you think that you know everything about the setting and the overarching plot?

  > Endbringer came completely out of left field. There was no way for the reader to predict that Endbringer would come, and he went from not-existing to existing in the span of one chapter

  No, you just missed the [earlier mention](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2011/08/27/agitation-3-6/): 

  > “And there’s the monsters.  The really dangerous motherfuckers, who are barely human any more, if at all.  The Slaughterhouse Nine, Nilbog-”

  >“The Endbringers,” I interjected.

  later:

  > Protecting the status quo, keeping the game afloat.  Bitter enemies call a truce, everyone bands together, favors get called in and everyone does their damndest to put the asshole down.”

  > “Like we do with the Endbringers,” I said.  I sheathed my knife.

  > “Holy fuck,” Lisa said, slapping the sides of the steering wheel with her hands.  I think if the van had been moving, she would have hit the brakes for emphasis.  Traffic was starting to move, though, so she started up the car and put it into gear, “Twice, you bring up the Endbringers in as many minutes.  You’re being morbid.  What’s going on?”

  They're established as a threat so terrifying that even just mentioning them stresses people the fuck out, which I don't blame you too hard for forgetting since it was early on.

  Absolutely dog water take. Keep reading. Worm has probably the most rational explanation for powers I've read.

  > The people in the world seemingly have no self-preservation, and they mouth off to a supervillain with SuperEvilBugPowersTM

  Balance of power. There's a reason only the baddest and most evil villains actually kill or hurt people, and people know this. Villains in general cannot get away with killing. Besides, you think people mouthing off to their saviors is IRRATIONAL? Just look at 30% of the USA. People consistently act against and lash out at people or groups that actually serve their interests.

  > Mannequin, a superpowered robot, fails to do any sort of planning, and loses to spider silk

  Tricks? Tinker powers are very specialized. The only thing mannequin could actually do was create self-sustaining protected biomes. He also had a deathwish. When dying isn't something you try to avoid, you stop trying to actively survive. I'm not really sure what kind of tricks you expect him to have. 

  > evidence building up to major plot events (if I can look back at earlier chapters, I can see the event happening)

  Adjacent trope, not a requirement.

  > The major plot events are completely unforeseeable. Endbringer came completely out of left field.

  Once again, not only is it wrong, it's also not a requirement for rational fiction. Endbringers are mentioned at LEAST twice before that.

    I know that I haven't read enough. I was wrong.

    I'm not sure I agree with this, but I can definitely see where you're coming from

    > Tricks? Tinker powers are very specialized. The only thing mannequin could actually do was create self-sustaining protected biomes. He also had a deathwish.

    I still think that Mannequin was far too underpowered. In order for him to survive in Slaughterhouse 9, he had to have been competent and yet he loses to an amateur villain. IMO, This isn't very internally consistent.

    > Once again, not only is it wrong, it's also not a requirement for rational fiction. Endbringers are mentioned at LEAST twice before that.

    Like I've said in other replies, the casual mentions only talk about how the Endbringer exists, and it provides nothing that suggests that Endbringer will come and destroy Brockton Bay.

      On second thought, I agree with you here. Seeing how harsh the entry tests are, he really should have been scarier. 

      > Like I've said in other replies, the casual mentions only talk about how the Endbringer exists, and it provides nothing that suggests that Endbringer will come and destroy Brockton Bay.

      I just don't see how this is relevant. Maybe tattletale could have predicted something, but for me the out-of-the-blue effect was great. It enhanced the story, and really made them feel like a natural disaster.

        Massive spoilers for both Worm and Ward below

        >!I think I have to disagree with you on this. Given what we learned in Worm about how the S9 was formed and how the Shards are interacting with each other, I don't think it's inconsistent. Mannequin may not have had to go through the same tests as went down in Brockton Bay. The Brockton Bay Trials were a way for Jack to entertain himself, whereas he may have been piqued by the contrast between Mannequin and Sphere already.!<

        >!Furthermore, as Taylor has the Queen Administrator shard she is going to subconsciously get fed information about the weaknesses of enemy capes. Her shard is designed for information and coordination and will happily pass that information to its host. You see similar things in most of her fights, actually; her ability to detect weakness is probably not just natural ability.!<

        >!Also, we know that Tinkers are very, very susceptible to planning issues. They can be ridiculously overpowered if they prepare for the right situations, but if they encounter something they haven't already prepared for then it is almost impossible for them to improvise a novel solution. Especially if someone is feeding their enemy hints about their weak points.!<

        I would've preferred to have some prior warning, but I can see your side too. I guess this is just a difference in opinion more then an issue with the rationality

      Just remembered: [read this here essay](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9esous/the_asteroid_strike_unconceivable_threats_in/), hell, read the fanfic it's based on (The Waves Arisen). Unforeshadowed problems are *precisely* rational: sometimes you just don't see something coming, no matter how prepared, and reacting to them properly is a great way to demonstrate characters' thought processes and abilities.

- u/RedSheepCole:
  ```
  Since somebody else brought this up, an adjacent complaint: the Entities' goal/plan is asinine.  It's roughly equivalent to the Pentagon deciding to test the F-35 by breaking up all its systems and distributing them randomly among a bunch of chimps who didn't understand them to see what they did with them.  One ape gets the guns, another the sensors, a third the engines, a fourth the computer, and they all bumble around the jungle using these new tricks to dominate each other and secure the territories with the best hunting and fruit trees.

  What would that tell you about the performance of the entire plane by a human pilot who understands its purpose and can use all of its abilities together to achieve vastly different ends?  The same thing human capes can teach Scion and Eden: bupkus.

  (I still enjoyed Worm)
  ```

  - u/TrebarTilonai:
    ```
    It's not quite as bad as that. The Entities are extremely uncreative, and while they have picked up a lot of technology from previous species I don't see them working out all the possible interactions on their own. They're also not distributing them at random, and the pieces can talk with each other while everything is happening. So it's closer to a distributed data system than complete disassembly.
    ```

- u/DXStarr:
  ```
  Taylor tries to figure out solutions to her problems, in life and in battle, rather than waiting for a Voice of Wisdom to tell her the Author's Approved Answer.

  Taylor tries (clumsily!) to make her life and her world better, rather than accepting that Just Because I Have Superpowers Doesn't Mean I Should Actually Try To Fix Things.

  Taylor lives in a world where masked superheroes mostly feel like a force of actual chaos and social breakdown, rather than Somehow The World Isn't Changed.

  Those three are what makes _Worm_ rational-appealing for a lot of people.

  As you say, there are a lot of anti-rational elements. Taylor is _not_ sensible about her life choices outside battle tactics. The justification for the repeated failures of cooperation is mostly hidden from the reader until very late. Taylor keeps hitting world-scale people and issues like the Endbringers, for reasons that have a lot more to do with a fun story than justified logic.

  But a story where the POV actually _tries to figure out answers while we're reading_ is so rare that _Worm_ ends up feeling rational-appealing to a lot of us anyway.

  So if your definition is "how sensible is this hero?", _Worm_ isn't rational.

  If your definition is "how likely is this series of events?", _Worm_ isn't rational.

  But maybe your definition is "how much does the story approve of trying to figure out answers? Of using your situation to make your life and world better?" In that case, _Worm_ is definitely a rational-adjacent delight.

  > Also, her plan to free Dinah is pretty much just "impress Coil"

  So this post has some things I disagree with, but I will go to my grave with a dead certainty that everything wrong and bad in the Parahumans series comes back to Dinah. She was a cancer to the plot.

  ```
  1. If that's your criterion then I can't fault you. I have less stringent expectations from protagonists of rational fiction. If they and their biases are consistent and dynamic the way a smart person in their position plausibly could be, it passes my test. No real life human is perfectly rational after all.

  2. By that argument none of the fantasy fiction on here is rational fiction. Even the most internally consistent magic system still either "just exist" or were intelligently designed by some super-being.

  3. People throw stuff at armed convoys belonging to invading foreign forces IRL.

  4. The antagonists lose to a new villain with backing from an old villain. I won't go further due to spoilers. Mannequin is certifiably insane.

  5. The Enbringers were foreshadowed multiple times. Like before the bank robbery for instance. They were a part of the setting from the beginning and no less out of left field than a hurricane.
