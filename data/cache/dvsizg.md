  Oh boy. Didn't expect all this Discourse.

  I'm a fairly big believer in death of the author, but still think it's worth being informed of an author's biases when reading something and know that other people here probably *aren't* believers in death of the author. If I were to recommend The Fountainhead to someone, I'd mention the author is a hardcore libertarian, or if I recommended something by a tankie I'd mention that too. But I'd still recommend and read the work.

  Having a wrongthink bot, especially by someone who isn't a moderator of the subreddit, makes me a bit uncomfortable. Things like With This Ring being on it also feel over the top, where the objectionable topic was something like a single throwaway sentence 1million+ words into a great piece of fiction that is now being blacklisted due to Forum Drama. And I think Lightwaver is arguing in exceedingly bad faith in all of their comments about the topic of the bot.

  As someone who has "objectionable politics" but who always tries to keep them out of this sub per the rule about no discussion of politics, this feels like a slap to the face. It's like I'm a sucker for trying to uphold the principles of the subreddit in good faith while someone else goes around openly defecting.

  On the one hand, it might be good information to know. On the other hand, it's the perfect example of the "commit one sin and you're damned forever" mindset that people *rightfully* disdain. I don't think giving authors a badge of shame for being idiots is necessary, on-topic, or compliant with subreddit policy. 

  A linking bot in a story subreddit should link stories, not controversies. If you want to critique the author's politics, you can do it by hand.

      Aren’t the links a link to a discussion of those issues, though?

    If the design was to make people avoid the work, the bot just wouldn’t link works that have been designated as having problematic authors. I see it as more of a forewarning, because it can be unpleasant to enjoy a work and then find out the author is a homophobe or whatever and have the experience retroactively soured.

      Or you could just judge a work of art at face value, and separate the art from the artist, it’s not that hard

        Separating the art from the artist is optional.

      - u/CeruleanTresses:

        The opinions of all the authors on the linked list made their way, in one form or another, into their work. That's going to affect many readers' enjoyment of the works one way or another, and is useful to know before getting invested in the stories. I can't separate an author's, e.g., transphobia from their work if the transphobia is *in* the work.
        ```

        - u/Ozymandias195:
          ```
          Except that that contradicts that the poster above me said, if you read the story and disagree with the politics, then you don’t have to enjoy or upvote the story. If you read a story, enjoy it fully, then find out you don’t like the authors politics, then you have successfully found an author who has separated politics from their story and you should be able to enjoy it. I still like R Kelly’s music, despite him being a despicable person. His character hasn’t somehow detracted from the art he already created.
          ```

            I'm not really concerned about whether my take on this "contradicts" someone else's take. Though if you want my opinion on cases where the author's politics don't manifest in the work, I prefer not to read their work either because I don't want to support them with clicks/views/etc.

  I think I'd rather have a short list of warnings, or hell, even one general warning, about the content of the work rather than anything about the author themselves. I was under the impression that this sub is mature enough to separate art from the artist, and even if it's somehow not, having a person who used an "attack helicopter" meme on the same list as a quote-unquote "white supremacist neo-Nazi" is a tad ridiculous.

      Same! But from my (admittedly limited) experience with AO3, this can be fairly time-consuming.
      ```

- u/Iconochasm:
  ```
  I think the change to [Controversial Author Politics] is a step in the right direction, but I'd still rather we just *not*.  I doubt anyone here is going to defend Nazis, but the instance I saw in the wild was about attitudes towards transgenders in a Chinese work.  If you can't tilt your head and see that calling that inherently objectionable (or even controversial) is itself objectionable from a Chinese cultural standard, then I don't think you meet the standards of this community to be making those calls.  Similarly, it took me half a shower to think of "objectionable politics" in virtually every seminal work in this genre.  If it's just going to be lightwavers personal beliefs, then I second /u/erwgv3g34 that this is a defection from community norms.  I suppose /u/lightwavers could just flag everything that anyone asks to be flagged for any reason, but that will obviously be gamed immediately.  Frankly, this community is not big enough to handle a damn political schism, so can we please just *not*?

  > Any system that tags "actual nazis" and people who hold any right-wing opinion with the same brush is going to be uncomfortable

  That's a weird way of putting it. There's one person who's tagged with that flag for political leanings, and I'd be comfortable calling him a Nazi just based on the fact that he tweets a substance indistinguishable from Nazi propaganda. 

  The other two people are tagged for problematic treatment of trans issues in their works, which again is reasonable (though it's also a super common attitude in China, so most Chinese web novels that cover trans issues will get tagged like that)

  I haven't seen any indication that /u/lightwavers is tagging people with that flag for just "any right-wing opinion".

    I had a discussion with lightwavers regarding Lord of Mysteries when they initially tagged it. You can see the discussion in the link (be sure to look at posting times). It's worth pointing out that they added the Objectionable Author Politics tag based solely on one reader mentioning that some of the characters exhibited an attitude that might imply transphobia,  without any quotes or evidence. Lightwavers hadn't read it or obtained any evidence other than that hearsay (and initially pretended there were quotes provided). This is an incredibly low standard for putting a bot accusing someone of transphobia everytime their story is mentioned. I actually reread the chapters in question after someone else went to the effort of finding them, and found them pretty mundane, with only a couple of instances that could be uncharitably interpreted as implying a character was against trans people (specifically referring to magical sequences that secretly turn you into a man or a woman as a "trap." Maybe that refers to the derogatory english slang for a man that looks like a pretty woman,  but it really takes a stretch considering the author is chinese, the work is translated, and the word is referring to the magical potions, not the person).

    Moreover you shouldn't mistake the opinions of a character for the opinion of the author.

    I will say that I also don't like the idea of policing author politics, even if they actually are evil. We shouldn't avoid a work just because we don't agree with the author, that way leads to small minded conformatism. 

    Lightwavers responded to this by saying that they are just providing a tag so if the reader doesn't want to support authors with "objectionable politics" they can read the linked post themselves. Certainly readers can choose which works to read however they want, but I find encouraging this very fraught.

    Regardless there is still a big difference between mentioning this in a comment, and having a bot post said "objectionable author politics" tag on any mention of the work. 

    I'm not excited about it, but perhaps if lightwavers just puts a (?) link on all their posts (not just the ones that they think are objectionable), where prospective readers can check out author politics should that be important to them. Or they can just maintain a objectionable author list that people can check if they desire.

    Whatever happened to "death of the author", and why is "doesn't agree with the western idea for trans identity" being presented as an objective negative?
    ```

  ```
  Is that tag really worse than manually responding to a recommendation saying "This dude IRL is a Nazi"? Because I'm really fine with people responding to recommendations of a Nazi's works by saying "This dude IRL is a Nazi".
  ```

  - u/nytelios:
    ```
    It's about perception. Having a bot that automatically links works with an ad hominem disclaimer is different and influences first impressions differently than a personally expressed opinion. Breadth of coverage (a real person can't respond to every mention of a work) or associations of automated bots to objectivity (giving some the idea that it's the sub's official stance).

      Dunno, I'm way more likely to question a robot's judgement of a fic than a person's.

  ```
  Look idunno about you guys, but I don't feel especially inclined to read a book by someone that hates me and wants me to die. Certainly I think there should be some more specific standards for what qualifies you for the list, but I don't have any issue with it existing on principle.
  ```

- u/CeruleanTresses:
  ```
  Personally, I always want to know if the work I'm being linked to was written by a white supremacist before I waste any of my finite lifespan on it. And the tags on this list that aren't about the white supremacist author are about works with transphobic content, which, yeah, I'd also like to know about before I get invested in a story. I find that kind of thing meanspirited and unpleasant, and it ruins my enjoyment of the work. So these tags are genuinely helpful to me and I wouldn't want to see them removed. 

  Proposed compromise: The tags already link to context, so maybe they could just be changed to say "Author Politics," or "Controversial Author Politics." That would leave it to the reader to decide whether they care about author politics enough to click the link, and then, if they do, whether they think the described politics are objectionable.

    Done.
