## [HELP] Looking for two rational stories.

### Post:

I found and lost two stories. Maybe someone here can help me find them?

- First one: it's on Ao3, Overwatch fanfic. Winston is the main character, and the plot centers around Angela Ziegler aka Mercy doing shady things with using Nanotech to take super-accurate brain scans of her team mates in order to be able to revive them.

- Second one: It's an original sci-fi novella, about an arkship which receives a message from Earth that everyone is dead and everything has been destroyed, and that they will transmit the brain scans of _everyone_ to the arkship. The awakened pilot and captain must then scramble to figure out some way to receive the signal, and because the Captain cannot shut up and multiply, they end up crashing the ship and humanity as a whole is lost.

  The second is Transmission by Nate Soares: http://mindingourway.com/transmission/

  That second one is familiar and I think it was definitely posted here but by Google Fu is weak this morning. But I did find https://www.dropbox.com/s/n2huyv4pale3of2/Starwhisp.pdf?dl=0 and https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/41kfyt/contact_1955_rt/
  which I missed when they were first posted so at least I've got something new to read!

    Good for you! /u/LunarTulip  and /u/AstralCodex found the two I was looking for if you're interested.
