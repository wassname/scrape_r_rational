## Any recommendations similar to "crystal society"?

New to the genre but gawd damn it's an epic frontier to write in

  You have read the [two sequels](https://www.amazon.com/Crystal-Mentality-Trilogy-Book-ebook/dp/B01N7TK5EF), right? (Though I just learned the third book isn't that good, apparently?)

    I highly suggest the second book and the first half of the third book!

  I'm not into the pony angle at all, but this story had lot in common with Crystal Society (especially the second and third books). The thing I liked about it was the same thing I liked about the Crystal books, how the story is largely through the AI's point of view.

    I love this mandatory disclaimer everytime someone links something from that cursed site.

      Really, it's the pony fandom's fault for producing such good content that even total outsiders are forced to enjoy it.

  I’m not done reading them yet, but [The Divine Dungeon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bookseries/B01MUI3TG0) series is essentially about a runaway AI process (in a Xianxia world.) So far (I’ve read the first three books in the five-book series), it has accidentally created a zombie plague, semi-purposefully destroyed entire cities (killing off their entire populations) in the process of powering itself, and *entirely* purposefully created and released mosquitoes into a blissfully pre-mosquito world.

  If you know *Dungeon Keeper*, the AI is essentially a sentient Dungeon Heart, acting as its own dungeon keeper (which is just how Dungeon Hearts work in this setting.) The AI also *used* to be a human, but, because it doesn’t retain much of its original human preference function, it’s more intuitive to just think of it as a straight-up AI.
