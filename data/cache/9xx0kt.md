## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  well, the christmass movies are on TV again. so heres an evil idea for a power to munchkin. 

  you get nearly unlimited power, but only to perform a christmass miracle. the limits: it must be a G-rated family friendly miracle, the miracle must benefit someone other than yourself, and the end result must result in a positive outcome for those involved (no revenge). and naturally, the effects center around christmass eve and christmass day. using this power outside of that time requires it to focus on how it lead up to that time. 

  you can perform multiple miracles at the same time, if your clever. but for the plot twist- somewhere, a grinch gains power equal to the power you just used. you dont know who or where the grinch is, but their selfishness will ruin someones holiday. the grinch has no limits on power use, but cannot use them to find you. the grinch is not exactly rational.
  ```

    ```
    So if I manifest ten billion dollars for SENS, the grinch gets ten billion dollars to be a selfish, Christmas-runing asshole with?

    Done. Someone's Christmas is going to be utterly wrecked, but everyone gets to be immortal in a few Christmases. Easy game.
    ```

    - u/Teulisch:
      ```
      ten billion dollars... of illegal drug empire! the grinch just got a new business plan. and all of breaking bad on DVD. little timmy is his newest enforcer! oh, we will need another timmy... but little timmy is expendable.
      ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        I don't think there is an amount of evil you can do with ten billion which is greater than the good caused by discovering biological immortality. The drug empire can be eliminated by legalizing drugs and undercutting the gang or having it go legit, after all.
        ```

        - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
          ```
          What if he uses the 10 billion dollars to somehow trigger a nuclear war though? He's a grinch, he hates Christmas, and so it is entirely in character for him to attempt to replace our wonderful winter with a nuclear winter. 10 billion dollars could go a long way into manipulating and bribing various military groups towards that end.
          ```

          - u/vakusdrake:
            ```
            This grinch was described as not evil just selfish, so presumably they would use their power in whichever way personally benefited them the most which isn't going to involve a nuclear war (or the risk he'd have to put himself in to start one).
            ```

            - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
              ```
              But the grinch was also described as not exactly rational, which could mean that while he values his own wellbeing, he may value his selfish desire to ruin everyone's Christmas more than his own wellbeing.
              ```

              - u/vakusdrake:
                ```
                Trying to start a nuclear war at cost to himself is still pretty incompatible with a grinch that's in any possible sense not "evil".
                ```

  - u/Nulono:
    ```
    Is a miracle that involves teaching the Grinch about the true meaning of Christmas and making his heart grow three sizes as a result on the table?
    ```

  - u/vakusdrake:
    ```
    Well it seems like the grinch uses his power after I use mine so it seems pretty trivial to ensure he doesn't get to do anything. Just create say some supernatural godlike being with your values that grows in power and intelligence exponentially every instant it exists for. That way when the grinch gets their own god it won't be able to do anything bad because my god can just overwhelm it in power at every turn.     
    Of course there's many other selections that might capitalize on your head start like this, but this seems like the most extreme and powerful example.

    Alternatively beyond just relying on the fact you get a headstart on the grinch, you could also rely on the fact that it never indicated the grinch was as clever, knowledgeable or skilled in munchkinry as you. So there's a near infinite number of powers whose exploits are non obvious which would let you beat the grinch. I could list powers like that all day but the best choice will depend on which exploits you're familiar with. Here's a few assorted selections you could use that are from CYOA's I've done before:

    * _Limited Divination_: [As demonstrated by this short story](http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/02/and-i-show-you-how-deep-the-rabbit-hole-goes/) (or rather the fact the makers of the that CYOA didn't realize the problems) you could pick divination extending say a month in the future and use that to chain information back from arbitrarily far in the future. Making you insanely more powerful than the grinch if they don't figure out to do this.

    * _Always Winning Games of Chance_: Based on how most people don't think to use this to make up their own games whose win conditions are anything you want, the grinch probably won't think to use this to gain godlike power, especially if you place a time limit on how long you get this power.

    * _Malevolent Wish Granting Item_: If you're tremendously skilled in the use of crafting airtight wishes then you could ensure you (and by extension the grinch) get an item that will try to (within some limits) interpret your wishes so as to be as beneficial as possible for the other party. This selection is particularly amusing because given how bad nearly everyone is at coming up with airtight wishes, in all likelihood you can just sit back and wait for the grinch to use up their wish and you'll end up vastly better off.

  You can send butterflies back in time to a location and time of your choosing. How do you optimize this so that you can send your past-self messages? Learn to differentiate butterfly species so you can assign some meaning to each, made more specific by sex, color, and other things I haven't thought of? What happens to the butterflies? Do they disappear once you deviate from the timeline they came from? Or do they stay, potentially being used again?
  ```

  - u/Nulono:
    ```
    Is there some reason I can't just write my message on the butterfly's wings?
    ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    If you can send messages back in time at all, you can send them arbitrarily far back. Immortal, distant future you passes you a sequence of butterflies which have been genetically engineered so their bodies are high-capacity thumb drives containing the steps they took to uplift the universe and become as gods. You just have to make sure to close the time loop at some point.
    ```

    - u/vakusdrake:
      ```
      I generally agree with you strategy, but you're thinking too small here: Don't even bother sending information back, just send back butterflies which are either filled with self replicating nanites or have their cells construct them automatically. Boom singularity within a few days at most.

      Loop mechanics might require that it would happen even if it didn't.

  Draw a circle, creates hemisphere of antigravity within. Topologically speaking, so you can draw arbitrary shapes. Height determined by two nearest neighbors.

  EDIT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmgkSdhK4K8&feature=youtu.be&t=232

  Kinda like this, but just don't draw the "z" point if the midpoint between the two points lies outside the shape.

  If on a slope, the height above the ground for any given point is at a right angle to the shortest line that connects two points.

  The pen required draws 5cm, if any 5cm point is touching three places, the whole thing fails, ie, no overlapping, no pinching off. If the maximum distance between any two points >3m, the whole thing fails.

  "Fails" means no change on gravity, it's just normal ink on the ground. It gets pretty easy to rub off when it gets wet

  If there is one hole, the zone instead gets 2x gravity, but inside the hole is normal gravity. Another hole inside that hole will cause normal gravity in the one outside and the hole becomes the new exterior boundary.

  If there are two holes, 2x antigravity. Odd numbers, gravity goes down, positive it goes up.


  Holes | Multiple of Gravity
  ---|---
  0 | -1
  1 | 2
  2 | -2
  3 | 3
  4 | -3

  etc

  1) You find a marker with this power. You don't know the rules. How might you discover them?

  2) These become really easy to find, and there are plenty of guides for how to use them. Say you can summon them by drawing some pretty simple shape that takes 3 minutes to complete if you get fast at it, ie, they're extremely difficult to create by accident, but also extremely difficult to prevent someone who wants one from getting it. What happens?

  3) Same as 2) but this happens in 2000 BCE. How does society evolve?
  ```

  - u/Teulisch:
    ```
    this requires ink... 2000 BCE would not have access to that ink, as well as a surface to draw on. expensive, controlled by an elite class, and is basically magic. 

    if its one pen and you dont know the rules, the odds of it being used correctly are low. how many people draw proper circles? 

    if its common and known, then it becomes technology. can i spin a plate inside a circle to align more or less circles? what does a hole at a right angle or reverse surface do? what if i put gravixt x2 here, and -2 there? is that a drive system in zero G? can we turn it on and off? because if we can, then we have not only propulsion, but free energy. 

    for free energy: put the +/- gravity disk on the end of an arm, and have its spin turn a wheel to generate power. numbers come down to limits of material science for how much force can safely be used. 

    so, free energy and arbritraily fast spaceships (again, limited by material science for how much gravity of force they can withstand). actual 1G in livable circular sections of spaceships. so big circle for people, smaller circle (hole) for the gravity drive. you ship is vaugly donut shaped at its core, surrounded by radiation shielding and life support.
    ```

  - u/vakusdrake:
    ```
    Well if you're the only one with a marker then it seems like you'd use the power to get stuff into space really easily and produce infinite energy (have part a turbine in the anti-gravity field). 

    If the whole world had this magic then space travel and space infrastructure would immediately become no more expensive than building things on earth, kinetic weapon attacks would probably become a massive danger with lots of terrorist attacks probably decimating cities and leading to a global winter and a perpetually dust filled sky. So in all likelihood the population would quickly begin moving into space habitats which can't be as easily targeted by extreme kinetic attacks (and are smaller and more decentralized than cities making you less of a target) as well as self sufficient underground bunkers. However in all likelihood billion would die. On the plus side this new space faring humanity would have tremendous advantages in every area from the fact they had virtually free and unlimited energy.

    Were this magic to become available in 2,000 BCE then it would both probably kick off an industrial revolution (since the _relatively_ simple mechanical applications of this powers limitless energy is nearly endless, for instance allowing the easy transport of water against gravity, or building flying machines). However as the tech got more complex so too would the kinetic weapons, as people figured out how to make simple machines which would rise further into space before flipping around and smashing back down into their targets. Since you can't really stop some lunatics from putting insane amount of dust in the air from impacts, whether this would probably lead to human extinction is unclear: Since whether using the new tech people could save themselves in time is unclear (for one they'd have to figure out some way of growing crops despite the perpetually clouded sky, though machines could easily be used to generate heat).
