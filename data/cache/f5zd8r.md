    ```
    Lydia and Marcus were rescued from the same ship that Grace and Allyria were.

    They were lent out to the Red Hand and never made it back.

    To add on to the other comment, it’s been a long time since we’ve seen them (I wanna say 15+ chapters, but I’m too lazy to check).  

    >!After their Red Hand squadron got their butts kicked by a Compact squadron, they were rescued by one of Red’s AIs.!<

  Ohh that lead-up chapter with the Naiad  migration was just bone-chilling. 


  If the Principality and the Compact agree to an armistice, a hell of a lot of resources will be freed up to deal with Red. 


  The tone seems to be shifting away from Space Horror, but I hope we have more of those moments will be present in the future, as Red's activities will shift into more fleet action (I assume with the new potential allies) than that personal touch of spite that I enjoyed hearing from her. The sheer enjoyment she takes in to moments of torture, the fulfillment of her long crusade, bit by bit.
