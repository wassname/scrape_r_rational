  Was not expecting that. It's refreshing, for the truth to come out. A strong scene that hashed out both of the character's ideologies fairly well, moved their relationship forward, and gave some doubt about whether or not Lois will actually help Luthor.

    No kidding.  I'm so trained by popular media's trope of dramatic-yet-ridiculous revealing of characters' true feelings/beliefs only after some extreme event has come to pass that an actual *conversation* involving *trust* between two people in order to come to a better understanding of each other actually caught me off guard.

    I half-think it was a reference to [this](http://dresdencodak.tumblr.com/post/10979241054/rebooting-the-justice-league).

    > **Origin:** The Kryptonian civilization once spanned hundreds of worlds, their technology and knowledge unrivaled in their corner of the galaxy. Kryptonians had long since advanced to a point where technology and biology were indistinguishable, making them virtually immortal and omnipotent in the eyes of less developed races. Over time they grew overconfident, and wished to introduce their technology to undeveloped worlds, in direct violation of the most important rule of the galactic community: the Omega Law. 

    > In an attempt to assimilate the natives of the planet Mars, Krypton finally gained the attention of Colu, enforcer of the Omega Law, and was marked for extermination. A Kryptonian Scientist named Jor-El, specializing in passively and remotely observing nearby Earth, witnessed this and rapidly set a plan forward to save his infant son, Kal-El, from their fate.  By sending him in a conventional rocket toward the backwater planet Earth, he guaranteed Kal-El’s safety from Colu.  The rocket took over a thousand years to reach the planet, and upon reaching the surface, restructured Kal-El’s body so he would appear as a human.

    > Raised by simple farmers, Kal-El (now called Clark Kent) eventually learned of his heritage when examining a recorded message from his rocket. His father informed him of his fate, and that he must never dominate the planet with his immense power, as it would warp the fate of all life on Earth. Not content to passively observe humanity, though, Clark decides to inspire others through his actions as Superman.

    > Superman has declared that he fights for those who cannot defend themselves, owing no allegiance to a particular government (though still obeying their laws). He has particularly targeted corporate corruption and the military-industrial complex as enemies of human progress, his most prominent opponent being billionaire industrialist Lex Luther and his company, LexCorp.

  Huh. [Spoiler](#s "So Superman anticipated someone tracking down his secret identity and placed a decoy spaceship. I wonder why he didn't anticipate the possible threat to Martha's life and safety?")

  [Spoiler](#s "I also find his 'I'm not a slave' assertion to be a little facile. There is a wide, wide distinction between completely ignoring others and obsessive, frantic dedication to their good, and pretty much every political and social ideology humanity has ever devised, is somewhere in that spectrum. He could presumably do better for humanity than he is doing, without compromising his sanity. He could definitely be more pro-active in solving prospective and grand-scale problems. That said, I do acknowledge that his behaviour as Clark Kent is entirely canonical, especially in the Golden Age comics and the 60's TV show.")

    The bit about the stolen ship might well be misinformation, we only have his word and he's good at deception (and as for as we know, not good at building advanced pieces of technology like the stolen ship). If he only came recently to his better senses, he indeed did not take proper measures before to ensure the ship's safety nor his mother's, and lying then might serve further, undisclosed purposes. That said, I cant think of any really good purpose right now.

    +1 for superman being a "level 1.5 (at least)" player rather than the plain brained hero he appeared to be at first.

    PS: I dont see much reason for spoiler tags here as we're obviously discussing the latest chapter.

      Superman is actually hiding a lot of the truth from Lois. He knows that someone out there knows his secret identity, and that there's a shadowy figure or figures pulling the strings. And he's also got to realize that Lois's life is in danger, just like his mother's was. He doesn't seem to tell Lois any of that, though it seems like she should have a right to know. He also doesn't tell her that he's got a prisoner in the Arctic. That whole conversation was sort of funny, because both Lois and Superman were dropping layers of their deceptions while pretending that they're dropping all of them.

      It could be misinformation in order to see how she'd react to the lie? Or misinformation to see how/whether she's leaking information to someone? Tell Lois that the ship is in the Arctic, see what happens?

      I appreciate the spoiler tags, as I often hit this page before I get the update in the ff.net app on my phone. It's certainly not a huge deal, as I know better than to go looking at comments before I read.
      ```

  - u/VorpalAuroch:

    I assumed that the part about the arctic was a lie. Yeah, he's coming clean about some things, but habitual deception on the scale he practiced doesn't break easily.

    [Spoiler](#s "Lois seems to believe that he should spend every waking moment fixing humanity, while he resides somewhere in the divide between apathy and obsessive action you describe. I don't think him comparing that to slavery is entirely a miss.")

    [Spoiler](#s "I don't know how much he could cut down his Kent time without slowly going insane, and he doesn't seem to either. And any mistake he makes in that regard can be catastrophic. He should rightly be terrified of going too far.") 

    [Spoiler](#s "He very probably could be more *efficient* about helping than dealing with each individual problem by hand, but he just plain doesn't *know better*. Lex could help him with that, but.. we all know how that particular relationship is destined to go.")

    As a side note I'm not sure it's necessary to use spoiler tags to discuss a chapter in that chapter's comment section, but eh.

      > He just plain doesn't know better.

      How about he bloody listened? The early chapters note the existence of many different people and organisations with ideas to do much greater good in the same amount of time as what he is getting. Psychologists exist, so if he fears going insane he can get help rather than trying to self-medicate by having a job on the side as a reporter.

      The man has super-hearing, and has an institute of brilliant scientific and philosophical minds created specifically to intelligently deal with the predicament of his existence. This isn't some understandable farmboy level ignorance, this is arrogant, deliberate, and insistent.

        Keep in mind, this is "world's best psychologists" based on 1930's standards.  I am not an expert, but I believe by current standards, their expertise would be considered utter quackery.

  ```
  It seems odd to me that Lois hasn't made the conclusion that "Clark Kent" is Superman's way of staying connected to the human world. That is who he is first, then Superman. If he dedicates himself wholly to the latter, he's concerned he'll lose touch with his human side; ironically, fulfilling the exact fears Lois and Lex have about a Superman living amongst mortals. 

  I agree that Supes is wasting time working at the Daily Planet instead of stopping disasters; however, it's abundantly clear that he has the same mental stress limits as other humans. If he is terrified of what he'll become if he totally gives into the Superman persona, that should be STRONG evidence in support of his actions, instead of a weapon to be used against him by Lex and Lois. 

  As smart as they both are, they are making the critical mistake of assuming they can figure everything out without actually *talking to him about it*. Granted, he hasn't been open about his true heritage with anyone til now, which is why I've let it slide thus far.

  Lex was on the right track with the concern about a human connection/empathy; however, tricking and lying to him (on both Lex and Lois' part) is a weak battle-plan compared to just talking to the man and working out with him what he needs to do to stay Superman and sane.

    The problem is that talking to him is a high risk / unknown reward strategy.  If you talk to him about something important and he doesn't like what you say he could lash out.  If he doesn't like what you say and it's the last straw, then he snaps and you've created what you were trying to avert.

    On the other hand, talking to him might help ground him...but what if it isn't enough, and he goes bad anyway?  Then he knows who you are and might well target you first.
    ```

    - u/Nepene:
      ```
      Superman has made it very clear repeatedly that he has extremely strong morals, and is very adverse to lashing out. It took a guy repeatedly aggravating him, confessing his crimes, sending people to rape children and lots of other things to get him to kill. It took killing his mother.

      Lois likely could say a lot of things without him lashing out given his personality. He clearly isn't going to lash out at relatively minor things like "Maybe you should give criminals jobs, not just beat them up."
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        Would you bet your life on it, when him losing control is the very thing that you're afraid of?  I agree that it isn't likely.  I simply understand why Lois and Lex might not be eager to do that.
        ```

        - u/Nepene:
          ```
          This sort of logic is very holey.

          Would I bet my life on it? Yes. Why? Because their whole thing is that they are already betting their lives and are willing to do so. They are trying to poison him, attack him, kill him, be aggressive to him. They are clearly willing to risk their lives.

          Based on their models of human emotions and his behavior talking to him is likely to have a much higher reward/ risk ratio than trying to kill him, or murdering his mother. Any course of action could lead to risk/ benefit, but they should base their actions on what is likely to happen. They shouldn't purposely only pursue what they know is a high risk/ medium reward strategy when there is an alternative low risk/ high reward strategy that carries little additional risk.

          They should also be considering other scenarios. What if other super beings come? What if the Superman thing is an elaborate test by some godlike entity? What if the USA is invaded? Those scenarios should carry some weight, Superman could reduce the risk of a mass extinction.

            ```
            Up until this Chapter, I was definitely willing to respect Lex/Lois' tactics- Supes was an unknown on the most important of factors, mentality. Sure he acted nice in the interviews and played a good Smallville, but those could be ploys. 
            Now that they've had an honest conversation about who he is, Lois has the responsibility of re-evaluating the risks as she sees them. 

            Her old info:  unknown mindset, clearly lying about who he is, extinction-level powerhouse.  High-risk to talk to directly. 

            Her new info: known mindset (lonely Smallville kid with superpowers but potentially limited rationality skills), lying to protect his own sanity, still extinction-level powerhouse. Low-risk to talk to directly. 

            I know which one of those I'd bet my life on, if I knew I was one of the few people who could make a difference.
            ```

            - u/Nepene:
              ```
              I agree, it's very clear what sort of personality he has and how she should react to him if she wants to minimize the extinction risk which is- say her feelings, speak freely directly to him. He very explicitly told her how to make him happy.

            Your opinion is noted. 


            The sensible thing to do, actually, would be to pursue both options in parallel. Although different people should be on each side of the program -- you don't want Superman to notice that his friend and consigliere is also looking for ways to kill him.
            ```

            - u/Nepene:
              ```
              I think pursuing them in sequence might be safer. If the low risk, low danger options of talking are successful they vastly reduce the risk.

              After all, even in his death throes Superman could still be deadly. 

              http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome#Signs_and_symptoms

              If the kryptonite radiation hits him you could have one day of an insane god with super diarrhea, a massive headache, superpowered spasms, superpowered vomiting, given knowledge of pre-existing radiation symptoms. Any other (safe) option would be preferable.

              Plus if he believes his friend is conspiring with the person trying to kill him his danger increases. Ideally, you'd want to use subtle methods to encourage those around him to talk to him and be friendly, and do nothing that looked like an order, or which could conceivably be seen as a lie if the person had to talk about their contact.
              ```

- u/Zephyr1011:
  ```
  Superman's comment about moving the spaceship seems odd. If he isn't lying, he presumably put a decoy spaceship in, but I can't see for what motive. Why would a decoy spaceship be better than none at all? Especially since it contains kryptonite. Perhaps he just couldn't move the kryptonite? Or it could be a fake? But if it were a fake then Lex has no ability to harm him next chapter, which would be an extremely disappointing finale.

  Him lying doesn't seem to make much sense either. He clearly acknowledges the need to move it, so why wouldn't he have? It is surely within his ability, even with the kryptonite inside it. And for what purpose did he lie?

  This line will hopefully make sense next chapter, because I am currently at a loss
  ```

  - u/omgimpwned:
    ```
    My thought was that for some reason he didn't want to admit to Lois that the spaceship had been stolen by someone, so instead he just told her that he'd moved it a long time ago. And of course he now acknowledges the need to move it, because of hindsight; it was just stolen!
