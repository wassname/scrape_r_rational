## What would prevent you from taking a drug to make yourself smarter?

### Post:

In the rational community, most of us value intelligence, to the point where some of us have explored using currently available drugs to increase it, if possible. I suspect most of us, if given the chance to take a pill that made us smarter without any side effects, would jump at the opportunity. 

What I'd like to discuss is slightly different. Suppose a pill was developed that could significantly increase human mental capabilities. Intelligence, concentration, memory, reaction time all shoot dramatically upward in a person that ingests it; one of the world's leading physicists tried it for a month shortly after it came out and published a working theory of quantum gravity shortly thereafter, and an ordinary Joe with a hobby of mathematics solved one of the Millennium problems within a year of starting the drug. It's affordable, easy to get, and the only problem is- [X].

Now, my question is: how severe would [X] have to be for you before you decide it would be better not to take it? Addiction? Ance, breaking out all over your body? Death by withdrawal if you miss a dose? What?

  The biggest thing that would stop be is worry about potentially unknown side effects. A handful of test subjects over a short period of time is no assurance of safety.

  I don't know if their is something that would stop me. With the level of boost you are talking about, even if it killed me I might still take it. I've never considered myself particularly intelligent, but if it could let an average Joe like me jump humanity forward a substantial amount then I would take it. death is bad but since it seems like I will not be alive by the time we figure out immortality, then it is better I try to make us get to that point faster.



     The above is my gut reaction answer, but really taking time to think about it... I don't know. I don't know how bad the penalty would have to be, or if I even would have the will power to apply myself and accomplish anything important after taking the drug.


  The things that wound give me pause on whether or not to take it...

  * A huge diminish in life span (kills you in a year or so)
  * Permanent mental disability (dementia or being unable to care for the well being of others)
  * Loss of control of body (being unable to move and only able to think)

  I think I would be afraid to take it if it changed who I was. Maybe it subtly shifts users towards socio/psychopathy? Like someone else mentioned, if it causes addiction or death, that can be fixed by an intelligent doctor. Behavioral shifts would be harder to detect, I think. I don't want to lose who I am.
  ```

  - u/elevul:
    ```
    But then who you are is already in a continuous shift...
    ```

  - u/tilkau:
    ```
    It seems problematic, to me, to assume that the mental boost itself wouldn't qualify here.  That subtle shift you suggest seems like a direct consequence, not a side effect, as the boosting effects really would make un-boosted humans more like ants -- programmed automatons. It would definitely make it harder to relate to those who aren't boosted -- social interaction would -not- be on an even basis, and it would become even more imbalanced as the gains compound.

    Social interaction becoming purely a too-easy game that the boosted are nonetheless required to play, seems to me a likely outcome, and of course when you're stuck with something too easy you start experimenting to make it more interesting.
    ```

    - u/biomatter:
      ```
      You make an interesting point. I guess what I would mean is that there is some 'ideal' version of me that is smarter, and then various shades of 'not-me' that gain/lose various positive/negative characteristics that I would rather not slide towards. I'm not sure if this makes any more sense. This is kind of like a genie's wish - even if I could state what I wanted, what I really want is for my 'wish' to be interpreted intelligently on a higher level to best satisfy myself in a way I might not have explicitly been able to state.
      ```

      > the boosting effects really would make un-boosted humans more like ants -- programmed automatons.

      I'm quite clever, and I've only ever heard teenage edgelords refer to other people like this.  Statistically, everyone is a programmed automaton governed by their needs to eat, drink, and sleep -- including you, Mr. Boosted.
      ```

      - u/tilkau:
        ```
        .. What? Of course everyone actually are automatons, so what? I regret I have only one downvote to give.

        Consider the level of boosting we are talking about. It's specifically significant; it's not just slightly smarter (which can be illusory in a sense that intelligence is made up of multiple skills, you can be bad at some of those and still 'look smart'). 

        This is exactly the same argument that is used in discussion about AI existential risk. When the difference gets large enough, it creates an objective justification for classism. 
        (or in other words, when you are relatively equal in the 'size of the lever' you wield, you don't have any solid reason to consider others as beneath you... but when you have much more power to achieve things, you actually do have a **very** real reason to consider them beneath you. Instead of just being a deluded teenager who thinks their particular talents are more important than they actually are, you and they both could easily see that in an objective sense you actually do outclass them -- perform **systematically** and **cumulatively** better than they do. It's not at all complicated to see why that could turn into a game -- we already have plenty of examples of it : parents vs their kids)

        This argument won't occur to all of the boosted. But it would be quite strange if it didn't occur to some of them, and hence, quite strange if it didn't appear to promote sociopathy/psychopathy to some measurable degree.
        ```

        - u/None:

          I'm not sure how it qualifies as an "objective justification for classism".
          ```

          - u/tilkau:
            ```
            It creates a separate class, one that is *specifically* defined as systematically intellectually *superior* (by society, not just by an individual). Assuming that the initial trend illustrated in OP holds up, there will be an abundance of evidence that the boosted "just win" / are "just better" / "advance humanity more". While it remains the case that the population isn't composed entirely of boosted, that's the justification right there.

            It would be worst in the beginning, and mildest in the end (increasing proportion of people who can thwart attempts at exploitation with the same facility as the people making those attempts)

            I do grant that if X is (universally considered) bad enough, this might not happen.
            ```

  - u/Phhhhuh:
    ```
    This is a very good point. Anything that changes the way you think changes who you are, to some degree.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Honestly, the only thing that would stop me from taking that drug would be a problem I wouldn't be able to get rid of either by stopping,  or by using my new found intelligence. After all, what would stop a doctor from taking the drug and curing the addiction with his boosted intellect? Or figuring out how to counteract the affects of withdrawal? Only if X couldn't be solved by increased intelligence, and couldn't be gotten rid of by halting your use of the drug, would I not take that pill.

    Another option is if the side effect was permanent but minor. For instance, it could make you fart 1.1x more often.
    ```

    - u/SometimesATroll:
      ```
      That wouldn't be nearly enough to make me stop taking it.  Not even enough to consider not taking it.
      ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      If the only side effect would be to fart constantly, to the point that one would assume that I'm breathing out of my ass I'd probably still take it.

  Nothing.  I take nootropics every day,  I have for years.  I've noticed a quantitative uptick in attention,  memory (short &  long term),  &  problem solving. If I could scale it up to "inhumane" levels... 

  What would X have to be? 

  Death,  long term agony,  Brain damage...

  - u/LeonCross:
    ```
    For some reason, your conditions have me correlating them with overclocking.

    If the drug does 2x increase, the brain wears itself out (basically, age) twice as fast. 10x = 10x faster, etc.

    Only tangibly on topic, but that's what came to mind reading your response.

      Yeah,  great point! Over clocking & over excitement of the neurons are both issues to be wary of.  

      Would be an interesting ramification in a story as well.

    What nootropics?

      ```
      Piracetam,  anaracetam,  noopept, ALCAR,  rhodiola,  Bacopa,  Ashwagandha,  theanine,  ginseng,  PS,  GPC,  Coleus forskohlii,  Artichoke,  Arginine,  and a couple more.  You?
      ```

      - u/rakov:
        ```
        All of them currently, or historically? Which would you recommend for getting started? I heard nootropics are mostly placebo, can you comment on this? How big effect actually is?
        ```

        - u/InvisibleRegrets:
          ```
          Mostly all of them currently.  The racetams I'm not on currently,  but I'm just in an off-cycle.

          Nootropics for beginners : there's a couple ways to approach this.  Nootropics are generally broken down into pharmaceutical and nutraceutical.  I would suggest choosing which angle you are most comfortable with -  do your research (I suggest examine.com as the best source of impartial information on supplements period),  check out /r/nootropics and get some ideas.  Start slow and try each ingredient by itself before adding it to your stack.  

          The other option is to buy one of the pre-made stacks that companies sell.  There are downsides ; you don't learn nearly as much about nootropics because you never research,  measure,  change,  and create your own stacks, every body is different and will respond optimally to slightly different doses,  if you make your own stacks you can personalize it to your biology -  you can't do this with pre-mades-,  there's also the possibility of quality changes,  fake ingredients,  or scummy businesses in the "natural health market" (there are many issues here).  Despite that,  I do use one pre-made stack right now for a couple reasons: I know the owners of the company,  and am relatively confident that it's all high quality ingredients,  it saves me time and money making my own stack (involves 10+ good nootropics,  which are a pain to source,  measure,  and cap  myself),  and it's also an affiliate company,  so I can make a bit of $ from referrals.  I still add additional nootropics to the pre-made,  as it's not a perfect product yet.  

          Lots of it can be placebo (and what's wrong with that if it works?),  but there are a ton of studies that show quantitative increases in many cognitive functions from a slew of different nootropics,  again check out www.examine.com and look up any of the things I posted before -  look at the human effect matrix,  it's awesome.  I of course have a ton of anecdotal stories from people who have taken nootropics,  but I prefer the research side as weight.  

          Actual effect? Increased cognitive functions across the board (depends what you're taking!) attention,  memory,  reaction time,  learning,  comprehension,  alertness,  anxiety decrease,  stress decrease,  depression decrease.  Plus,  you can get physical effects from them as well -  increased endurance,  decreased heat &  cold sensitivity,  increased oxygen absorption,  etc.  Anywhere from a 1-15% increase if I were to generalize (the pre-made I'm on has shown a 7.52% increase in memory,  attention,  and learning speed,  for example).  Enough that you can notice a difference in your life (absolutely!) but not enough that you're suddenly a polyglot photographic memory  genius -  unfortunately.

        Your post just renewed my interest in nootropics. I've limited myself to caffeine, creatine and theine (from green tea).

        Have you charted your performance and compared it between using and not using nootropics? Have you ever felt anxiety if you run out of one of them?

  Nothing. I've been eyeballing a "[prosthetic neuronal memory chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthetic_Neuronal_Memory_Silicon_Chips)" as my third implant for precisely that reason. 

  I suspect any increase in intelligence is sort of self-justifying in that you can then look back on who/what you were before and would feel no desire to return to it, due to how your perspective has expanded.

    Isn't the problem with that the fact that the changed you may not have the same views as the current you, and thus may find things you would find abhorrent now to be fine? Suppose a side effect was that you now found most forms of murder to be ethically ok;  or at least, you didn't care about them happening. You wouldn't want to return to your previous state, but that would still be a change for the worse.

  Toxic side effects. Early dementia.

  But as described, you'd and up pretty much having to take it to keep employed at any high paying job. So I hope the guys who do take it don't also turn into psychopaths.

- u/GaBeRockKing:
  ```
  If I could reasonably expect that utility\*time would decrease, then I'd avoid them. If I could reasonably expect utility\*time to only marginally increase, I'd probably still avoid them, because humans have a tendency to be too optimistic anyways. I'm also pretty uncomfortable with mind altering substances in general, so I'd need to take that into account, as using the drug would inherently lower my utility.

  It would probably be a moot point pretty quickly anyways, though. At that level of intelligence boost, I know other people would be more than willing to take them, and I believe the people who have access to that drug (assuming I can get access) would probably have similar ethics to mine anyways, so I could just be a free rider to whatever progress they make.
  ```

- u/Khaos1125:
  ```
  If it's widely available, then it seems like you'd have to take it to stay competitive.

  Things that would prevent me from taking it...

  - Particularly bad withdrawl symptoms, combined with the drug not staying 'fresh' very long, and uncertainty regarding future availability

  - High risk of long term mental problems (EG: Dementia, depression, etc), combined with the drug itself being not very popular. (If a large number of people are taking it, then the market for solutions to problems it generates will be large, and the problems are likely to be solved)

  - Aggressively shortened lifespan.  I'd probably be willing to lose 20-25 years in exchange for a miracle drug of that nature, but much more then that and I'd begin second guessing this.
  ```

- u/Meneth32:
  ```
  I wouldn't take it at all. Fun Theory indicates that there's a limit to how much fun you can have at a given level of intelligence. Since there's no going back from raising your level, I'd want to exhaust my current level before anything else.

  Also, given the existence of the drug, I would expect the singularity to arrive soon, so I can be uploaded and use digital mind revision, rather than clumsy chemicals.

- u/Rhamni:

  If it significantly changed my values. If users had severe/minor but lasting changes in their personality that made them *different* as a person afterwards, that would give me pause. If it's as great as in your examples, it would have to be pretty significant changes, but if users tended to, say, lose interest in friends and family/dramatically change political/religious/ethical views, it would be a tough choice. Even if I didn't use it, though, I'd keep it at hand in case there was a sudden change in circumstances.

- u/glowingfibre:

  It would be hilarious if it came with a compete loss of motivation to do anything with it, maybe you have to hold the people over a fire  pit or something dramatic to even get them to do something useful.

  Hum, let's see if I can come up with something no one has said yet... blindness/deafness? Or perhaps a dramatic loss of motor control?
