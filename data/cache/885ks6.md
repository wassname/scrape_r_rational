  Scope insensitivity can numb even the best of us. Feedback and comments would be appreciated, as ever.

  At this point- I haven’t read enough to have a coherent opinion but I have enjoyed it, the MC’s clear mind and the explanation for said clear mind.

  I’m glad to have discovered this and will read more chapter(s) this weekend+ look forward to more. Excellent job introducing the characters, hooking us and willing to be ruthless.
