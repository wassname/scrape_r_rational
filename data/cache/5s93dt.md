    It is an old fanfic of mine that was partly inspired by HPMoR (mostly its abbreviation). Of course, here the HP stands for Hewlett Packard and MR stands for an incorrect misname of Ronald McDonald (a similar mistake to calling Link by the name Zelda).

    I explored similar rationalist themes in this short fanfic such as the merging of science and magic and its inevitable consequence: magic AIs. Ronald, as everyone knows, has chaotic reality warping powers: he is thus a fitting arch-nemesis to Hewlett Packard and his magic science.

      Where?

        When HP builds a magic printer, he is combining printers (muggle technology) with magic: he's building technology out of magic. Similarly, the final plot twist [spoiler](#s "alludes to the possibility that an AI might rebel against its creator, like in A Space Oddysey.")

  So why exactly was this submitted to /r/rational again?
