  Even factoring in the risk of being murdered, I still think it would be really really fun to work for Accord.

  Typos: 

  "Capitalism pigs" should be "capitalist pigs"

  "Ghandi" should be "Gandhi".

    Not just me having problems then... how odd, hopefully removed by authorial intent rather than censorious dickery.

  I continue to adore this fic.  Keep up the good work!  Taylor's conversation with Gauthier was heartwarming and generally great, and I loved the description of Gauthier regarding "hollowness".  I'm not sure if it's that you've gotten better as a writer or if I've just read more of your words by now, but I'm starting to get a sense of your style and I'm really digging it.  The sentence starting with "The wind was frigid..." maybe isn't the best example of a distinctly you-ish line, but it is excellent nonetheless. 

  Some typo notes (etc):

  > I woke up to an empty house, which was the usual. Dad left for work an hour before I did for school, and an hour and a half since I'd started using portals (which was arguably incautious, but it was really hard not to portal everywhere). 

  This part confuses me.  Danny left before she woke up, but after she started using portals?

  > The outdoor jacket and hat **was** a darker, charcoal gray

  Were.

  > I made a portal to the door of the station and went inside, then immediately made a beeline for my favourite bench in the lobby and sat down. It was interesting, how I'd managed to find a **favourite** bench, but I'd spent so much time at the station that I was already used to the place. I'd spent the night on **this couch**, once, about a week before.

  "Favourite" is a british spelling.  Also, what couch?

  > Those were protests, where the people forced the elites to do the right thing.

  Unnecessary comma.

    This is probably the most flattering thing I've ever read. Regarding your points, some are errors whereas others are stylistic. I'll see if anyone else is confused about the same points before I start rearranging those.

    First point, it's meant to be parsed like this

    >I woke up to an empty house, which was the usual. [Before my trigger event] Dad left for work an hour before I did for school, [but presently left for work] an hour and a half [before I left for school, as a direct result of my using portals to cut down on my travel time].

    Second one is an error on my part; it should be were.

    Third one is a mix of two drafts. It was originally a favourite couch, but became a favourite bench. Ironically, I distinctly remember being aware that this might happen, and triple-checking to make sure they matched. Apparently it got mixed up anyway.

    "Favourite" is a Canadian spelling as well as a British one, and I've tried to stick to Canadian spelling since there's basically no way I'll manage to keep to American spelling without slipping up.

    Final one is a mistake, but not the one you described.

    >[The anti-Vietnam demonstrations and the unions' fight for the eight hour workday] were protests [and therefore by implication the prohibitionists weren't "true" protestors], [because a "true" protest is] where the people [force] the elites to do the right thing.

    Gauthier is essentially going full No-True Scotsman here, with a double helping of The Worst Argument in the World. The whole statement is an artifact from a different version of their conversation that got a lot closer to hugging and crying and would've derailed the plot for the next three arcs. Without the rest of the conversation to provide context, she's setting up a comparison and never really delivering, so it's unclear and it looks like I mean to say, "those were protests where the people," which I would never do because the correct phrasing is "those were protests in which the people".

  Just picked up this story.  I really like it. 

  I saw there were rewrites or other chapter on SV and am guessing you are re-writing to slow down the escalation some: this is good.  I only read the last few chapters to catch up, and then checked and found some big discontinuities: what I read on FFnet seemed a lot better at slowly turning up the heat. The work on SV is good, but the little I read: has Accord texting during a conversation, offering Gyros during a meeting, and Coil sharing how his power works. . .  three more and it's time for breakfast.

  You've probably decided how you are going to make gravity work, but you asked an interesting question so here is my 2cp. As far as I know the gravity shadowing might not happen because gravity seems(?) to be a curvature of space space/time and not propagated by particles (anybody correct me if I'm wrong on this I don't go much past general and special relativity). IMHO a portal might propagate gravity across it as the two different potential energies and the curvature averaged out?  If the gravity shadow came from *Bio of a space Tyrant* kudos on your classic SciFi
