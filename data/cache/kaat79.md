## Why the Hate?

### Post:

I don't want to encourage any brigading so I won't say where I saw this, but I came across a thread where someone asked for an explanation of what rationalist fiction was. A couple of people provided this explanation, but the vast majority of the thread was just people complaining about how rational fiction is a blight on the medium and that in general the rational community is just the worst. It caught me off guard. I knew this community was relatively niche, but in general based on the recs thread we tend to like good fiction. Mother of Learning is beloved by this community and its also the most popular story on Royalroad after all.

With that said I'd like to hear if there is any good reason for this vitriol. Is it just because people are upset about HPMOR's existence, or is there something I'm missing?

      I think there are aspects of rational (not rationalist) fiction that _would_ be a benefit to nearly all fiction. I don't think that a story ever really benefits from characters carrying the idiot ball or acting in ways that contradict their personalities and self interest (note that this _does not mean_ that characters should never make bad decisions, those bad decisions should just make sense with the rest of the character traits etc). Of course, some people would argue that those more general aspects of "rational" fiction aren't all that different from "good writing" and don't warrant a specific tag, and I don't necessarily disagree.
      ```

      - u/Sonderjye:

        I think that many genres would benefit from being more rational but some, i.e. many comedies wouldn't necessarily benefit, and given how much effort it takes to make a world truely self-consistent I can imagine many works in which the reward to effort ratio is not cost beneficial.

        Game of Throne perhaps being an example of the latter. You might argue that it would benefit from a better exploration of the magic and it's strategic uses however the books are already slow in coming out and I would rather have them as they are than adding another say 20% creation time to each book.

    I think most fiction should be just a little bit more like this. Obviously some comedies get a pass and other niche genres that I can't think of off the top of my head. But in general stories are better when the characters act slightly more realistic and work towards their own goals.
    ```

    - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
      ```
      I think it's less that most fiction should be more like this and that more fiction *of certain specific genres* should. Namely, the ones that depend heavily on world building and are very plot driven. Then of course it all falls down to how the work itself is presented. I do not resent the lack of consistency or logic in, say, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, because the entire thing is blatantly aiming to be stylish, over the top campy nonsense. But when something poses itself as serious and tries to get me involved in a complex narrative, that narrative better make sense (this is also, much less controversially, referred to as "good writing").
      ```

      - u/FordEngineerman:
        ```
        Jojo's is exactly the type of niche genre that I agree doesn't need to be rational. But even average tv shows or normal fantasy books would benefit from having the characters behave in ways that are more beneficial to themselves and their own goals.

        For example, I recently watched a show where an FBI agent uncovered a plot to assassinate the President. The agent told no one because she was afraid she wouldn't have enough evidence. So instead she tried to kill the assassin herself and got in trouble for firing a gun near the President. Makes no sense. Even if she had no evidence, the secret service takes threats seriously. She even knew the exact room number the assassin was using to snipe the president and when it would happen and being an FBI agent she knew exactly who to report to and would know that they would take it seriously and check out the room.

        But luckily she was a better shot with her pistol shooting at a hotel room across a field than the sniper was with his sniper rifle firing at someone standing in the open with no cover so everything worked out....

          Oh, sure, that actually covers a large bunch of shows and books. There's also an argument to be made for how certain such stupid tropes are so common and consistent that they actively become diseducative. I recently watched a couple episodes of "How To Get Away With Murder", and if people get their notion of what the legal profession is like from stuff like that, well... let's just say they'll likely start looking at summary lynchings in a much better light.

          In a lot of cases, irrationality is just a writer's lazy shortcut to creating engaging narratives without actually making the effort of working within a bare minimum of constraints. In that sense, I think it's worth criticising, because it actually does harm.

          Bringing up a hot topic, but... this is something that really irked me in The Last Jedi. The movie is supposed to be about rebels fighting against a fascist Empire. Yet lots of people were entirely willing to defend the notion of a superior demanding unthinking obedience, even in the face of apparent certain death, from one of her own commanding officers, and blame the latter for not being satisfied with that, and even turning to mutiny when he thought the life of his crew was in danger. Now to me, that seems absurd. Even the real military doesn't work like that - orders can and should be explained unless there's a good reason not to. And these are supposedly resistance fighters, likely with a less rigid hierarchy. But most importantly, I would say that if you in good faith think your commander is leading you to death with manifest incompetence, you absolutely DO have a moral duty to protect the lives of your fellow crewmates. Even if that means breaking the code of whatever military you're enlisted into! And that somehow people who supposedly cheered for free thinking and resistance to power were perfectly okay with the notion of an absolute military hierarchy in which nothing but unthinking obedience is owed - a notion that in real military theory has been probably abandoned since, like, WW1 or so - is a special kind of absurd. But it speaks a lot to how the movie imagine of any military organisation is mostly that, so yeah, everyone just reads it in that light.

            Ya, it's super lazy. In my example the agent could have called it in, but the bad guys were monitoring communications and move their location or abandon the plan for another attempt later. They already showed in the show that the bad guys had an inside agent and had hacked the white house security systems. Or if Agent was shown to know about those things, she could have tried to confront the bad guys in the room she knew about without talking to other sources. Maybe bring some FBI friends she talks to in person. The bad guys could have had security though and ambushed them causing some deaths on the FBI side that get blamed on the main character and we are back to her foiling the assassination attempt but getting in trouble like the writers wanted.

          Lol, designated survivor is probably the worst show if you want well thought out character motivations. Literally the whole FBI agent plot has things like this. Like when the big bad terrorists knock her out and leave her in a van filled with explosives next to a government building in order to kill/frame her but leave the keys in the ignition and enough time on the clock that she can drive the van into a river. Why?

          Plus the whole having access to all of the FBI's resources but never giving her any backup. The whole series drives me up a wall tbh.

  I've never heard anything about this sneerclub or nazi issue before (in fact, this subreddit seems solidly left to me), but I do follow some literature groups. From the conversations I've had and threads I've read on here, I'm fairly sure that many rational readers (myself included) are massive STEM nerds who judge literature by unusual standards. 

  This subreddit is basically a 'safe space' for disregarding normal conversational and literary conventions. People tend to be more honest and rambling, and no-one really mocks others for that. I would bet that many people in these circles are either somewhat autistic or socially inept, if for no other reason than that sort of behaviour is more accepted here.

  Also, everyone here seems to be having great fun using pretentious words and phrases, and earnestly sharing what they know without fear of being thought arrogant. I really enjoy that about this community, since there aren't many places you can do that, but it looks really weird from the outside. 

  Essentially, I've always felt r/rational is like a group of weird science kids who started their own book club where they can be themselves (maybe because I was in such a book club when I was younger). This on its own is enough to draw hate, I think.

      Lesswrong (which I'd consider a predecessor to /r/rational) had a few disproportionately loud neoreactionaries (who are adjacent to neo-nazis, are the intellectual predecessors of the modern alt right, and which incubated people like Steve Bannon and by extension influenced Trump). Some of these neoreactionaries were participating as community members and others of whom were brigading and engaging in mass downvote spamming of anyone with leftist views. Many in the community tolerated them and embraced it in the name of "free speech".  Yudkowsky himself firmly repudiated them and generally advocated downvoting and banning them, so it's a bit unfair to say that rational fiction (which was born largely from Yudkowsky) is tainted by assocation. Prior to that, intellectual predecessor OvercomingBias has also had a notable neoreactionary presence, probably in part to some of founder Robin Hanson's opinions. It's not super visible on this subreddit but if you know the history of things, it does make sense that people would associate that with us, even if most of us repudiate that.

      >I can't help but think anyone who thinks that is so far left that anyone right of center looks like a Nazi.

      I don't think Nazis are as far right from the center as you're thinking. You're imagining Nazis as this impossibly ridiculous far away point, rather than something which the populace fully embraced in recent history and which the populace is 100% capable of doing again with just a few steps to the right of the current scenario.

          SSC is Slate Star Codex, a subreddit/former website that at least a year ago had to stop this weekly newsdump discussion thing called "culture wars" because the the whole thing was slowly getting overwhelmed by neo-nazis, simply because most people don't like being near folks who believe that they shouldn't be allowed to vote/live/have rights due to where/what they were born as.

          Scott Alexander was very confused at why having open nazis wasn't a good idea and blamed the people leaving for making the place unwelcome instead, so the people who left stayed away and found elsewhere to be, and then Scott approved this place called The Motte, which is supposedly nothing but the "culture wars" thing, but it's basically a hub for "race realism".

          The Rationalist community was born during the 2 years in which Eliezer Yudkowsky, author of [_Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality_](http://www.hpmor.com/), blogged daily, first on Robin Hanson's blog, [Overcoming Bias](https://www.overcomingbias.com/), then later on his own blog called LessWrong. These blog posts are known as _[The](http://web.archive.org/web/20161111231754/https://wiki.lesswrong.com/index.php?title=Sequences&oldid=5863) [Sequences](http://web.archive.org/web/20170327154113/http://lesswrong.com/lw/72m/an_epub_of_eliezers_blog_posts/)_, and form the foundation of modern rationality discourse. For more on Eliezer's backstory, please see [my earlier comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/CultureWarRoundup/comments/iwu6wt/offtopic_and_loweffort_cw_thread_for_the_week_of/?limit=500#g6mns8z) on /r/CultureWarRoundup.

          A few years after Eliezer stopped blogging, LessWrong declined to the point of irrelevance and the community moved on to various other websites, an event known as the Rationalist diaspora. Scott Alexander (author of [_Unsong_](http://unsongbook.com/)), who had made a name for himself on LessWrong under the pseudonym Yvain, started a blog called [Slate Star Codex](https://web.archive.org/web/20200622131343/https://slatestarcodex.com/), which became _the_ major website of the diaspora. So popular was this website that it spawned it's own subreddit, /r/slatestarcodex.

          Like in a lot of other forums, political discussion started taking over the sub; the solution was to corral all political talk to a single recurring thread called the Culture War Thread, which quickly became the single most popular thread on the subreddit, accruing thousands of comments each week. Eventually, [under pressure from critics](https://web.archive.org/web/20190222094427/https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/22/rip-culture-war-thread/) (most notably /r/SneerClub), Scott decided to evict the thread from the sub. Those who wanted to continue the thread created a new subreddit, /r/TheMotte, where the thread continues to this day. You can think of it as the rationalist politics subreddit, much like this is the rationalist fiction subreddit.

          And you didn't ask about this one, but since it will probably come up, /r/CultureWarRoundup is a competing alternative to /r/TheMotte created by users who were dissatisfied with the latter's moderation policies.

      I think the problem there tends to be that a lot of people on that side of the political spectrum are really enmeshed in what I'd call "emotion politics" - politics all based around people's feelings as the one metric by which all should be judged. I tend to think that's not really a solid way of doing politics - after all, the racist likely *feels* deeply scared and worried about those violent thugs who want nothing but to rape his daughters, and yet somehow I doubt we should pay that feeling too much heed - and that since all politics involves compromise and agreement between multiple parties, it can only be built on things on which entire groups can agree on, namely, shared, measurable elements of reality. I think a lot of people around here would probably inclined to think the same way (given the nature of the community itself), and so that probably creates a significant ideological rift.

          Here's an example of a discussion I saw some days ago. This was mainly among researchers from social/political sciences. Apparently, the common trend right now is to believe that if you're researching a sociopolitical issue, to take an activist role in those topics is encouraged as something that *enhances* your research. The logic, rooted in critical theory, is that since every narrative and framing is expression of a power relationship anyway, you might as well embrace one openly. The opposing view, that you should strive to distance yourself from the topic and assess it in an objective manner in order to produce useful research, exists, but is in minority, and often draws accusations of right-wing bias. Because, after all, inaction is the same as standing with the oppressor.

          Now note that I'm not saying that when people study these issues, "both sides" have a point. If you study genocide or discrimination, one side definitely ought to have every decent person behind them. Nor am I saying that it is possible to achieve perfect objectivity: it is always only a goal to aspire to. Nor am I saying that your research's results will always be perfectly apolitical: if one side blatantly lies or believes falsities, the truth will be political. And finally, I perfectly understand that if your subject of study isn't elementary particles but people, people who you often interview, befriend, live among, then it's not going to be exactly easy to keep a distance. There will be times in which you might feel a tension between your professional duty and your duty as a human being, as they might be at odds. You might feel like you just *can't* stand on the sidelines and document as other people are involved in the fight.

          The problem is saying that activism actually makes your work *better*. It really, really can't. Being personally involved will raise your emotional stakes in what you find out. If what you find out happens to support your cause, you'll be all too happy to publish it. But if it doesn't, you'll have all sorts of peer pressure and emotional investment in NOT releasing it, or twisting it; a lot more than you would otherwise (not that you usually wouldn't: but that will still be there, and be compounded). And this in the end hurts the cause too. If all the research - the job whose task should be to provide facts to the public so they may make their own mind on an issue - feels like it's somehow affected by partisan politics either way, then it loses more and more credibility. People stop wondering about what the facts even are and feel absolved in simply going with their gut; after all, it's what even those researchers do! 

          And obviously that instinct is always present, to a point. The problem is how we're completely losing any desire of fighting it off. Historically, the political left has generally stood *more* for reason and objectivity. Pointing out how many social, historical, cultural or religious constructs are *not* absolutes or laws of nature is rational. Asking for equality among humans where there is no evidence that justifies discrimination is rational. If the left abandons that stance in frustration too, what we actually end up having is a political spectrum in which no one agrees on anything but one thing: truth does not exist, reason is of no consequence, personal feeling is all that matters. But in that way it also becomes impossible to achieve any kind of compromise, because no one can just convince someone else to *feel* differently without that change having some roots in a shared reality.
          ```

          - u/FunkyFunker:
            ```
            So you're saying that bias in researchers promotes anti-intellectualism and distorts published science. That there is a movement in 'left academia' towards embracing this bias, which furthers tribal thinking and makes compromise difficult, as there is no neutral academic basis that can be used to observe political ideas.

            You're then saying that this lack of neutrality/objectivity makes it difficult for left to compromise with right, and distinguish nuance in right. That this means it's hard for left to tell if a r/rational comment is Nazi or just right. 

            Is my interpretation of your comments correct? I have some issues with your ideas, but I just want to check that I have it all down first.
            ```

            - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
              ```
              I am saying this is an example of a general philosophical trend towards making subjectivity and feelings not just drivers for action, but the lynchpin of political discourse (didn’t say anything about “left academia”: that people who seek discovery and change with an open mind tend to be left wing is hardly surprising). 

              Basically, I believe “objectivity may be impossible to achieve, but all the more needs to be something we strive for”. This philosophy tends to be more “objectivity is impossible to achieve, therefore it is worthless and just a mask used to hide reactionary ideas”. Also, the philosophy then trickles down into popular discourse and becomes dumbed down, losing whatever nuance it had.

              > That this means it's hard for left to tell if a r/rational comment is Nazi or just right.

              No. I mean that this leads to considering any comment advocating for rationality or objectivity as *intrinsically* reactionary, because those are just the names existing systems of power give to the status quo.
              ```

              - u/FunkyFunker:
                ```
                I used 'left academia' for people 'researching a sociopolitical issue' who believe 'that activism actually makes your work better.'

                Although I mostly agree with your philosophy, I feel like your argument as a whole isn't quite logical. It feels to me like you're personifying movements and forgetting the person. Rather than talking about what tendencies and bias 'a left-leaning person' might have, you're describing people as being a faceless limb of 'the left' (though your phrasing varies). There are many steps in your hypothetical train of thought, but in reality I'm not sure a random left would pass step one. People just aren't so defined by umbrella labels.

                I'm certain that what you're saying is true for some people, to some extent. It seems very unlikely, however, that this idea is so broadly applicable that it could be relevant as a significant force all the way down to the level of international web forums.
                ```

                - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
                  ```
                  I mean, an ideology is more sort of a... distilled average of individual people? Obviously it's really hard to pin down "purely left" or "purely right" people - though some who build their whole identity around that might fit the bill - it's more that people adopt ideas and often certain social contexts will reinforce them (so if I'm, roughly speaking, 90% left and 10% right, I'll still be loathe to voice that 10% while in a context of other majority-left people coded to be left like a political party or a movement, which then creates a feedback loop with others. This effect becomes stronger if those people are inclined to shaming or other forms of social pressure, which *absolutely are* very common in political discourse these days).

                  My point isn't that everyone does this, though the discussion I mentioned involved academics who do *not* like this approach complaining about peer pressure from the majority. There is such a thing as "mainstream" ideas in a certain environment, I don't see what's problematic with that, without a need to label individual people at all, which I don't think I did. My problem isn't with the people, it's with the specific shape the ideology is taking, the "meme" so to speak (in the sense Dawkins originally coined the term for).

                  You asked for an example, I made an example. There's more. My point is, there is a general trend towards this sort of extremely relativistic interpretation. If epistemology exists on a scale, from "Truth exists and I know it because it's all written in this Holy Book or whatever" to "Truth does not exist, everything is subjective to the point of solipsism", then the dominant epistemology associated with left wing ideologies would be slowly shifting towards the latter extreme in the last years, too close for my comfort, at least. And I'm still pretty relativist, of course! I just don't think it's useful any more when you get to the point of completely abandoning any hope of even *pursuing* objectivity. Even with all its trappings and fake goals. It just feels like a lot of people have stopped trying altogether and have called the objective itself worthless, with actual philosophers and theorists (from whom these ideas originate) basically providing smart-sounding rationalisations for why this sour grape mindset is actually a good thing.

            I don't think you're understanding the point that those folks are making?  Moreover, none of that actually has much to do with the politics of the folks involved and is instead mostly about what some subsection of academics believe.  The average leftist isn't going to say that they believe in a particular ideology because of how politics make them feel, they're going to say that they believe in a particular ideology because of specific material issues.  I mean, ultimately all politics are, at some level, a moralistic determination so it's not really possible to have literally no emotion but it is exceptionally rare for any leftist to say that they are leftist for no objective or material reason.

              In the context of that discussion, the folks involved are mostly not even in the western world, so their own politics are generally a bit separate from ours in terms of categories. The academics here are just an example of what instead tends to be the mindset across people active on the left side of politics specifically in Europe and the US - and in particular in the English-speaking world.

              >  The average leftist isn't going to say that they believe in a particular ideology because of how politics make them feel, they're going to say that they believe in a particular ideology because of specific material issues.

              That's not really what I meant either, it's more about whether you think solutions to those material issues (such as economic inequality, racism, sexism, homophobia etc.) should be then measured against more or less objective metrics, or designed based on some kind of attempt at empirical evaluations vs. just going with what your gut tells will work.

                Who is arguing for this though?  You're strawmanning here.  For the most part, no leftist is saying that gut judgements should be used to evaluate performance of policies.  There's a reason why lots of leftists aren't really a fan of affirmative action anymore - it has mostly failed to address issues of inequality in attainment of secondary education except for mostly in the divide between men and women.  Which part of Sanders' or Corbyn's platform was based on emotional gut feelings?  They were, one and all, based on objective reasoning even if some people on the right might end up disagreeing with the policies in question.  I'm really just not understanding where you're getting this idea that leftism is specifically more moralistic or emotional.

                  Sanders has actually had his fair share of critics exactly because he's more old-school in these respects. But it might be here the problem is that perhaps I'm saying "left wing" more in general and incorporating more groups that perhaps you'd class as "liberals". 

                  I rooted for both Sanders and Corbyn. The latter got IMO unfairly shafted by the whole supposed antisemitism scandal, though I also think he's not that great at communication - certainly worse than Sanders. But I actually wouldn't consider them part of this trend that much, they're both really, well, old. This is more of a younger generation thing.

        I don't think I would agree here; Don't think there is really a distinction between either end when it comes to a lack of rationality for the members who lack it, while I have seen rational and educated members of both sides, even both extremes. And the rift I blame on a rising culture of non-tolerance, with the excuse of labeling opposing opinions as "harmful". Which I agree is shifted left atm, which I also think is the lesser of two evils even though Communists are just as bad as Nazi's since both ideologies lead to gulags (and the obvious example of this leaning is that nazi's get banned while communists don't).

          Oh, I'm not saying wingnuts on either side are more rational. My point is that the left isn't just full of people who act emotional, it's also full of sophisticated theories that *rationalise* acting emotionally and make it sound like a very good thing and, in fact, the only right way of doing politics. That way, by the usual mechanisms of polarisation, the concept of acting rationally instead becomes purvey of the right - who gets to scream "FACTS DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS!" in between ranting how climate change is a hoax, COVID is just a flu that's being exploited by Bill Gates to inject us all with microchips, Trump didn't lose but was a victim of a strange, elaborate and ineffable conspiracy and democrats have satanic pedophiliac orgies in the basement of a pizza parlor.

          I mean, there is absolutely no question that the right is in practice the most detached from actual reality and rationality. And lo and behold, on lots of topics the left absolutely *does* appeal to it, because well, it makes sense. But the general discourse is very emotion-focused on a lot of things, even when you could actually make excellent rational cases for the same things. Left wing Twitter, when it's not busy dunking on whatever's the reason of the day to get *absolutely indignant*, reads much like a self-help book. I agree with all the core values, but frankly the packaging these days makes me facepalm a lot.

          Obviously, in the sense of feelings as driver to action. However, if for example you want to design a legal system, you can’t decide to punish people just based on how their victims feel about their crimes. Because it becomes a social endeavour, you need to build credibility with all parties involved, and that can only be done on the basis of our shared reality. If all you tell me is “I feel this way!” I don’t even know if you’re telling the truth, and can’t possibly check. Also even if you are, your feelings might be rooted in a faulty understanding of the world.

  For transparency I used to be a regular visitor of r/ rational a few years ago, before I became a far more occasional visitor the last couple years.

  A lot of the points made by others are likely true, although I can't speak to the alt-right infiltration personally. 

  One thing that kind of put me off the community is that there is a common culture of believing that rationality is the utmost standard to which all fiction should be held to, and some seemed to believe that the world as a whole should try and be understood through a mechanistic framework of pure logic. This used to appeal to me but as I changed I realized that this perspective was kinda irrational ironically. 

  The value of a story can come in a lot of different ways, and a lot of rational fiction can be bad from a storytelling perspective and a lot of irrational fiction can be great as they can create circumstances which have great emotional resonance. I think in part this dislike of this community comes from the exclusionary culture. 

  As a general paradigm this overall cult of rationality leads to this weird notion that other paradigms are inherently inferior. For science and an understanding of probability the rational paradigm is very useful, an openness to critique and the actual essays on cognition that Yudowsky writes are interesting to think. But swathes of the community I found had a preoccupation with rationality to the exclusion of the kind of common sense conclusion that you have to understand people as emotional, and that sometimes speaking with facts and logic without a consideration for the personal aspect of it comes across as callous, and occasionally ridiculous. Like critiquing someone in a story or in real life for making an emotional mistake as irrational and they should never make such mistakes shows a lack of emotional self reflection imo because we are all susceptible to such mistakes, and if you think you aren't, you are likely making more of them. A lot of people, unfortunately the loud vocal ones which might go to other communities, didn't think of rationality as a way of trying to overcome human's naturally irrational heuristics through careful consideration,  but like spacebattles logic, the application of being smarter than everyone else to in order to become more correct, speedrun god-hood in stories and be better than others.  

  This problem is kinda exacerbated as a lot of the community seemed to use the mark of being a 'rationalist' as an in group, affirming these 'smart' qualities with the community and gaining a sense of identity in it. It makes sense how others outside the community would identify this sort of personal callousness and derision for anything which isn't 'rational' (often meaning 'optimally smart') and associate it with the community. 

  I don't think this is a fair characterization of the points which Yudowsky himself often makes on less wrong, or everyone in this community,  but I do think that it is understandable how such an impression comes about.

    I agree with this statement the most. At their worst, rational books are about overpowered know-it-alls and Gary/Mary Stu's who can never fail and succeed at everything by virtue of being the smartest person ever. Sadly, that's what most outsiders seem to think when they hear about the rational crowd.

    At it's best, rational is a system of tools and characteristics to write and analyze the logical consistency of a world and character's actions given the details of a specific scenario. Usually though, that kind of story has a lot of other things going for it as well, and readers outside the rational crowd rarely credit our tools and techniques. So we're judged by our worst.

    I don't think that's really what the spirit of rational writing should be (this was heavily discussed some time ago when the definition of rational fiction was debated and updated). I know I have no problem having my characters make plenty of mistakes if it fits their personality and the situation. I think what really happens a lot of the time is that people find it hard to believe someone would make THAT specific mistake which also happens to be tremendously plot convenient. It's in the end all to do with suspension of disbelief. To make a recent example - in Queen's Gambit, Beth Harmon losing a match because she got hung over the night before due to her poor self control and being easy to sway and so played less than optimally is not unbelievable. Beth Harmon losing a match because she forgets that rooks move in straight lines would be, no matter how many emotions are involved - that seems something that should be so deeply baked into her brain, it's second nature.

  - u/Dragfie:

    Completely agree with this. I'd add also that a lot of these aren't preventable; the rational community enjoys "well thought out stories" and dislikes ones which are not. This is the whole point of the subreddit and should be encouraged, but it will piss off anyone who doesn't like one of the stories that are deemed as "well thought out" because to some people, this will imply that they are not "smart" enough to enjoy it (whether this is the case or not is irrelevant).

    So out in the real world I've only met three people who were aware of the /rational community, and all of them were aware of it in the context of yudkowsky's 'math pets' and that gal who killed herself after alleging abuse by a guy who was part of the bay area /rational community.  Beyond that, one of those people is an up and coming engineer/project director at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and he could barely stop laughing long enough to mock Yudkowsky's ai theory institute.

    I'm not sure whether my small sample size means more than lots of people on reddit, but that's my experience of people hating on the rationalist community.

    As far as the actual writing goes, I think that when a story gets really pretentious and purports to do something like demonstrate methods of rationality then it has to pass a higher bar, or it is judged more harshly.  Scenes like the one where quirrel reaches harry to lose, or Yudkowsky's rape play in three worlds collide, become serious black marks in those stories not because other things we read don't have those elements, but because the person writing them says they're supposed to be edifying.

    Tldr: there are at least a couple reasons to dunk on /r/rational

      I mean, to me everything involving Quirrell in HPMOR sounds like it has to be taken always with a pinch of salt. It's not that the lesson Quirrell teaches - knowing when to fold 'em, so to speak - isn't valuable. It's that he teaches it in an exceedingly violent way, and there's always evil undertones to all he says and does. And the "evil" element here isn't nullified by the fact that Harry benefits from it. 

      Personal experience: I've gone through a hazing process once. Nothing quite that humiliating, but still would count as bullying by common metrics. I think personally I actually have benefited from it in that specific circumstance, as in, it did force me to come out of my shell and it did help me integrate better with the ones who were undergoing it with me and so on. However some other people also broke under it, and quit altogether. Basically the point isn't "hazing is bad because it hurts everyone", nor "hazing never works". Hazing *does* work with a certain percentage of people, that's why initiation rituals have been a thing for millennia. The point is what happens to those with whom it doesn't. For the most violent, extreme forms of hazing, this can mean even physical harm, not to mention the psychological one. That's what makes Quirrell's methods questionable - not the lesson, nor the fact that they can't possibly work. He does what he does because if it succeeds he's happy, and if it fails he doesn't give a fuck if Harry is hurt by it.
      ```

      - u/Slinkinator:
        ```
        The points you've made aren't the problematic ones.  I like a lot of the ideas and methods bandied about between harry and quirrel, and remembering to lose or to appear to lose is a genuinely useful technique I've used in my own life.

        But the scene itself is constructed out of painfully juvenile delusions, much like a lot of hpmor. I would relate it to an anime like Baki or a show like The Boys, where the driving force of the narrative is masculine inferiority complexes.  To me, when I tried to explain that scene out of context, it quickly became apparent that the power of that scene came from exploring different facets of what it meant to feel weak as a child, and not in a healthy or constructive way.  It was a weird power fantasy.

        And again, it's not that there aren't other things I digest with similar constructions, but when you're as pretentious as Yudkowsky gets with HPMOR, then building your story out of weird juvenile power fantasies becomes a more glaring flaw than I view it in Supernatural or Batman.

        edit: also, what you're talking about with gazing isnt what harry goes through.  He's not a pledge in a frat or a new recruit with a squad, it's focused on just him.  It doesn't help him integrate better with anyone, within the story it's part of quirrells plan to build him up and build him apart. The way quirrells keeps on calling him dangerous and telling everyone hjpev is the next dark lord. So there may be some value in hazing, but that is the exact opposite of what the story was doing in that scene.

          > But the scene itself is constructed out of painfully juvenile delusions, much like a lot of hpmor.

          I'm not sure how that appears in that specific scene? I mean, I get the general criticism - HPMOR owes a lot to Ender's Game, after all, which has a lot of the same traits - but not in that one, unless you mean the power fantasy is the ability to just stand there and take all that abuse without breaking down.

          Then again, Harry Potter itself is a power fantasy. HPMOR still has that DNA.

          > what you're talking about with hazing isnt what harry goes through

          I know, but of course I haven't gone through anything quite like that, so I just used a comparison. Hazing is usually humiliation for the sake of creating bonds - those who go through it are connected by the solidarity of fellow victims sharing a common experience. What happens to Harry is more humiliation for the sake of breaking his pride, forcing him to swallow his instinct to react. The scene itself could be constructed differently or written better here and there, but as a concept I think is one of the strongest of the story, exactly because of how it pits Quirrell and Harry's philosophies one against each other, and because of the cognitive dissonance between the lesson and the way it's taught. Another one would be Quirrell's speech, in which he genuinely makes good points about unity and willingness to fight while also scarily sounding like a fascist. The only synthesis I can find for that is that the good kind of unity is the one that emerges spontaneously out of personal responsibility and willing cooperation: those who lack that ability are either condemned to be broken up and defeated, or be united against their will by a tyrant. But it's certainly an interesting moment and it does force one to engage with the reason why some "dark side" ideas are actually so fascinating and ever returning. It's not enough to say "these ideas are evil and shouldn't be spoken of!" to exorcise them: in fact, sometimes that simply means you let them creep on you until it's too late while you willingly pretend they aren't there or are just irrational ramblings of a few fanatics.

            I wrote up more than I probably should've and then tried to post with reddit down =[

            So in brief, the primary juvenile power fantasy in play here is 'im so dangerous that I can't fight back without killing them' which helps small children being victimized, turning their weakness and fear into power and resolve, but it is an egregious example of a theme that runs throughout HPMOR.  I have no issue with the lesson about losing, and if I encountered this scene in a YA novel about, say, a farm boy who's sent to the royal academy before he kills the evil court magician to save the king's life, I wouldnt blink.  But HPMOR and it's author embrace some really pretentious, lecturing BS about teaching people the true power of rationality, and this theme of juvenile power fantasies hits below the mark they set themselves, or maybe communicates too much about who is writing this and who it's for.

            I actually like most of quirrells input, if you removed his desire to murder people he thinks are dumb I don't think he'd count a villain, even voldemort would be preferable to most real world hierarchies if he were a shade less irredeemably evil.  I have no issue with the examination of uncomfortable moral landscapes.

            I also don't see what ideological clash you're referring to in this scene, harry and quirrells are on the same page that harry has a problem and quirrells has a solution.

            This is, surprisingly, less than I wrote the first time. Also, you might be interested in the novel Inda by Sherwood Smith.  It's a really good 'children learn to fight' novel that I think is probably palatable to the /rational/ crowd, and it has a lot of the sort of hazing scenes you were describing.

              True, though Harry being a wizard, and Hogwarts a school where young children get given a deadly weapon and taught to use it... realistically, the body count in those books is much lower than it ought to be. Bullied children COULD totally kill because all it takes is the right spell hitting by surprise. And Harry does have some creativity. I feel like the issue there is that part of the conceit of the story is *also* to explore the "what if we actually take magic to its logical consequences" idea and that inevitably makes it ridiculously deadly.

              > I also don't see what ideological clash you're referring to in this scene, harry and quirrells are on the same page that harry has a problem and quirrells has a solution.

              I may remember that wrong, but I thought at the end Quirrell said something to the effect of how Harry could take his revenge later, while Harry of course had no intention to do so? I probably mixed it up with something else.

      There is a general problem with STEM types not knowing humanities stuff and “reinventing the wheel” when discussing things that are best addressed with knowledge/background of the actual field of study, especially humanities topics.  

      As for good examples of this.... Scott Alexander of Slatestarcodex identifies as left-of-center... but seems unfamiliar with and/or incapable of actually properly steel-manning basic leftist thought and literature (to be fair, the left-right divide in the US skews so heavily right that Scott identifying as center left isn’t dishonest).  This in turn skewed the Overton Window of the SSC discussion in a weird way, which combined with the ideals of discourse of SSC (charity, taking weird ideas seriously) led to the Nazi/alt-right infestation before several steps were eventually taken that caused the alt-righter to spin off into themotte.

      As for other examples of stuff they make fun of... lot of lesswrong-adjacent Silicon Valley tech bros.  Common reasons to make fun of them include: anti-academia viewpoints (startup founders are the real innovators and the background research done in academia is meaningless), idiotic libertarian views (failing at basic economics and empathy), and in general stupid ideas which they view as genius (thinking that being an entrepreneur makes them an all around expert in humanities and unrelated fields of science).

        I think this is what they would claim to be the reason. I think it's giving them far too much credit. The stereotype of a basement dwelling nerd without any real world experience inventing wish fulfillment to salve a easily bruised ego is what you come up with when you want to make fun of this place not where the grievance came from. Especially since the primary antagonist of this story is a psychiatrist with a philosophy major. The actual reason is much stupider. 

        Back in the heyday when big Yud wrote HPMOR fanfiction was in a very different place. There are reams of text demonizing the guy for accepting donations (it was going to cause all fanfiction to get shut down and deleted from the internet by the copyright holders) before Patreon made that a thing normal people are allowed to do and most of the rumors about him running a doomsday cult start thereabouts. 

        Also I don't know if you've noticed HPMOR is very snide calling people who liked the original out for the various moral hypocrisies of the at the time considered totally wholesome novel by progressive icon JK Rowling. The idea that  only smart people are moral -> Yudkowsky running a  nazi eugenics program is probably down to that more than anything that happened later.

          I think you are missing the point of sneerclub.  Sneerclub doesn’t have high minded ideals, they see stuff that they think is stupid, then they make fun of it.  People periodically make serious posts and are reminded by the mods that sneerclub is primarily about what is funny and not for serious discussion.  The serious discussion goes on, because there isn’t really a place for counter-rationalist thought elsewhere, but it isn’t the goal of sneerclub.

          As to the stereotype... I see lots of posts on sneerclub linking Twitter threads by Silicon valley entrepreneur types with completely stupid takes on things outside their expertise, so this view doesn’t rely on stereotypes alone.  And yes occasionally EY has a bad or weird take that gets linked.  His posts on GPT-3 seem to misunderstand how it actually works so much so to make one question his knowledge of AI as a field or to speculate that he was being intentionally alarmist.

          As for the view on HPMOR, I recall several sneerclub threads with highly upvoted posts pointing out that HPMOR ends with Harry slaughtering a bunch of Fascists, so the people that care are aware that EY didn’t intend to promote Neo-Nazis initially and that it’s a more organic unintended outcome.

          Some of the hate for HPMOR does focus on the way it seems to sneer at the whimsical world building of Harry Potter, but I think that form of hate is primarily found in spacebattles and HPfanfiction and not in sneerclub.

            Fair enough. I actually mistook your comment for another one I read that was about the more general hatedom. Still I think "organic evolution" of nazism in this case is just confirming their own expectations and rooted in a history of nerd slapfights that look incredibly sad in retrospect.

            Edit: I do think you missed the point pretty badly when you bring up silicon valley entrepreneurs. That being that association to these guys IS the stereotype.

                I've been. Lovely chaps. Still pointing to this as evidence for the idea that ratfic is a gateway drug to fascism is so amazingly petty.

                The only time I ever got curious enough to check who it was that was ranting about rationalists on tumbler I found a) a tankie who believed that murder was a construct of  bourgeoisie morality and that liberals were obsessed with sexual freedom so they couldn't realize the obvious fact that women raped by nazis deserved to be lynched b) someone who maybe ironically advocated for voluntary human extinction c) a \*shudder\* rational wiki editor oh and also d) there was the one right winger who railed against it being a cuckold conspiracy or something (oddly enough not mentioning anything about jews).  And these guys weren't my top picks or anything. They were just the first clicks that I found cussing at rationalists.

                Of course it doesn't really mean anything aside from the fact that trolling is easy. As long as you can point out other people doing stupid shit anonymously and not have to explain any of your own dumbass behavior it's impossible to lose a mud slinging competition.

        > This in turn skewed the Overton Window of the SSC discussion in a weird way

        Personally I'm sort of intrigued by the idea that the Author of any work is probably the "centrist" in the room (of their own comment section / discord). Almost by definition. I like the idea, even with the obvious warts (e.g. of unbalanced readership causing the perception of unbalance).
        ```

        - u/Versac:
          ```
          There are slightly different dynamics depending on whether you're talking about a singular Author or a larger genre of work with multiple sources, but I'm of the opinion that it's far more useful to look at the audience population the work reaches, and from there who chooses to pursue it and at what level of depth.

          Taking SSC as a particular example: you have a broad readership whose "center" is roughly around where Scott is. (Scott's position is reasonably close to the median user of reddit/blog platforms, so difficult to determine causality here.) But his most popular work is long-form critiques of certain culture war SJ issues - valuable to the center-left in an academic sense, but viscerally appealing to folks quite a bit further to the right. The skew propagates into deeper levels of engagement, so you get an interesting asymmetric decoupling between "likelihood of agreeing with Scott" and "likelihood of sticking around Scott's blog".

          Or to piggyback on jtolmar's comment and phrase it a different way: audience size tracks total revenue, and it turns out that AAA games make more money *per developer* than indies. The audience is weighted towards and reflective of an Author's most high-profile work, which is under no obligation to be most reflective of the Author's position.

          I don't think this one really holds water. I hang out with game developers: they're consistently pretty committed to socially progressive ideas, and a lot of them are increasingly eying labor activism. Gamers, on the other hand... there certainly are pockets of lefties, but there's also a huge reactionary undercurrent that was made obvious with gamergate.

          Maybe games are unusual in this regard, but I also suspect the most popular authors on this subreddit are a bit to the left of the community as a whole.

            No such thing happened. Self-identified gamers at that time had a high rate of being past bullying victims (by now the label has been mainstreamed enough that it's less true, but the rates are probably still elevated), and reacted to Gamergate as another instance of the popular mainstream bullying them. (This may not have been true at the very beginning, I'm unsure, but it was correct within a week.) Gamergate was a defensive reaction to a gaming *press* which was (and still is) dismissive of its audience and what they care about.

            To the extent there is any 'reactionary' undercurrent in gamer culture, it was not revealed by GG, but *created* by it. Snooty leftists insisted that they couldn't have any reason for disliking the status quo except being bigots. It is unsurprising that people who were bullied and tarred as bigots for daring to express contrary opinions had a meaningful number of people decide that if this is all it takes to be declared a bigot, maybe bigots aren't nearly as bad as their reputation. And if they're welcoming and the only people willing to say "Fuck, you didn't deserve that", it is unsurprising if some of them stay in those circles and drift closer to them in beliefs over time.

              This is 100% nonsense. Gamergate literally began as a harassment campaign targeting women involved in gaming that evolved out of another harassment campaign targeting one specific woman involved in gaming, and it remained (and to the extent it still exists, continues to remain) nothing but a harassment campaign orchestrated by channers.

              Literally everything in your post is just the usual justifications for the vicious hate campaign masquerading as concerns about ethics in gaming journalism that were unleashed on every woman in sight. Fuck that shit, and let nobody here be misled, it is rank nonsense to the point where even Wikipedia doesn't give it any thrift.

Zoe Quinn was not a victim, but a sociopathic abuser.

                It got out of hand, to be sure, but it was fueled by real problems and started by real offenses. And it got out of hand on both sides at approximately the same speed and level of vitriol.

  To me, the name explains it all; **Rational** Fiction. - Which is emotionally correlated (whether it is true or not) with; "Smart people" fiction or; "Dumb people would not enjoy" fiction, which, if you don't happen to enjoy said fiction, and you are insecure about your intelligence; the very suggestion that Rational Fiction is good is a personal insult.

  Combined with the fact that anyone at the end of a bell-curve is a minority, and that the favored target of "SneerClubs" mentioned in previous comments like to target things which exhibit an emotional reaction from them (such as what is mentioned above) and this community receiving hate seems kinda obvious to me.

  That isn't even mentioning this community **is** kinda subtly snobbish (I mean, even my comment above wouldn't really be thought of as "Humble"). E.g. Just look at the comments on any story post of a not-really-rational fic. Half of it is strait up hate, the other half constructive criticism which to an insecure person is no different than hate. I mean, just look at the comments on Delve chapter posts; half of it is just snobby "why would you like this" subtly disguised as criticism.

  A lot of people have offered a lot of good commentary! I'd add one thing:

  /r/rational is overwhelmingly centered around fanfic and web serials (mostly LitRPGs). There's very little in the way of mainstream (in the sense of "published by a major publishing house") fiction discussed on this sub.

  The difference in polish levels and quality is massive, and most of the sub comes off as thinking that the mediocre-but-entertaining stuff that's our usual fare (which I enjoy, don't get me wrong!) possesses a degree of excellence past what it really does. I don't mean that the /r/rational folks should go read through the NYT Most Important Books of Whatever Year, that shit is absolutely awful, but any given year's Hugo Best Novel nominees are overwhelmingly likely to be better than any of the stuff we rave about.

  So we've got a community that grew out of a mediocre (and extremely condescending, in the "I don't need to know the canon to know it sucks" way that is so widely despised) fanfic, and leaving aside all of the other, shitty/asinine communities we may or may not be associated with, we overwhelmingly discuss works of fiction that not only belong in genres which are treated with enormous disdain, these works of fiction aren't all that well executed, particularly in terms of editing/polish.

  Rational fiction is X, other kinds of fiction is the general class of ideas.

  1. we have a bit of a nazi problem (common problem for online communities nowadays, but we can't seem to properly repudiate them)
  2. there is a faction of backlash against yudkowsky and the communities that have cropped up around him, in part because of 1), in part for other reasons, some good, many bad.
  3. something else?? There are certainly a lot of things I like about rational fiction that I could see other people hating about it.

  I could make more or more detailed guesses, but that heavily depends on the context and the type of community you encountered this backlash in, and what their prior point of contact with "rational" fiction was, all of which you have refrained from giving us.

  There is some discussion on this topic in this sneerclub thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SneerClub/comments/jck19i/when\_i\_see\_posts\_like\_this\_i\_cant\_help\_but\_feel/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SneerClub/comments/jck19i/when_i_see_posts_like_this_i_cant_help_but_feel/)

        I've been reading SSC for a long time. Never once commented. Very rarely even venture into the comments, so I can't really argue about what may or may not exist there.

        But the comments sections of LOTS of websites are completely toxic. To a far far far greater extent than I'm willing to believe goes on in the SSC comments (if for no other reason than that SA _will_ ban people occasionally, which many websites don't do), and yet those sites don't get called out for "having a nazi problem" (probably because most people know better than to pay attention to the comments). And I think it's completely disingenuous to say that his actual writings or article are in ANY way pro-nazi or giving succor to nazis. 

        If the problem in the comments is as you describe, then a much more standard "hey if you go there, be wary of the comments section" would be a more fair warning than claiming that SSC as a whole "has a nazi problem". 

        Claiming that SSC iteslf, which to me, means SA and his writings, has a nazi problem is so wrong I question if you have actually read anything he has written. Like...anything.

    I think it's also important to realize the connection the name has to the alt-right. Especially the "rational thinkers" on youtube who are all alt-righters and often a gateway for young men to those ideas. The idea of rationalist fiction as a gateway to radicalize young men is something someone puts forward in the SneerClub link (re: Yudowsky's writing specifically). I think in part because of this.

    On the one hand I can see it. Authors don't often respect the ideas put forward by feminist critique, this is especially obvious when the author appears to barely have a surface level understanding of the literature. And a more blatant omission when the modern understanding of culture is completely lacking from the work. Which is an obvious failure of attempting to be rational (at both a surface level, and a deeper level, that it's probably hard to deconstruct tropes without proper cultural context). Which leads into the "I am very smart" trope, and blatantly missing ideas of soft power and bias in society.

    On the other, the critique feels like a failing of "don't ascribe to malice, that which can be ascribed to stupidity". A lot of authors in this space are not professionals (the fact it's a lot of fanfiction proving the point), and in fact a lot of amateur media has these problems, and often a lot more implicit. I'd point to the overall shittiness that is most romantic fan fiction, and the professional works of the genre like Twilight and 50 Shades (a comparison I make in part because progression fantasies / litRPGs are the trashy literature genre aimed at masculinty (of which rational is often a sub-genre); in much the same way people view romance literature as that for femininity). Both genre's most popular authors are not great on these issues, and both have popular novels which are. Which returns to my point about most people just not being educated on the topic.

    It's hard to talk about because it is part of the "culture war". So to me critiques like this ring hollow, especially when they attack how characters' internal thoughts are presented. I feel like the better parts of the genre are closer to hbomberguy's critique of the youtube rational thinkers: maintaining the persona, while changing the content. Which is to say hbomberguy comes off as a sort of cringe gamer pseudo-intellectual (this is his character) but uses it to counter people who often take that personality to talk about alt-right issues (in a way, a positive role model for that character). And I think part of what feels frustrating about these critiques is they draw a line between how authors in this genre present characters and the ideas it is often used to present. Which can be frustrating when, as a reader of the genre, I often identify with the way the characters are being presented (and I recognize the inherent bias that comes with that identification; the lack of emotionality relating back to toxic masculinity's suppression of displaying emotion; but some works use this to their advantage to display the bias). To say nothing of the inter-sectional problems such critiques often fail to be cognizant of (neuro-atypicalness; nerds/populars; etc.).

    I don't know the answer, but I avoid the topic in general because it appears to be a culture war problem, where neither side seems to have taken a women's studies nor an anthropology class (nor the honest self-directed educational equivalent). It's basically just people shouting at each other. Hence why my personal view is to ignore the vague aspersions of hate, enjoy what I enjoy, and engage with people one on one if the topic comes up.

            The same thing happens every few years with a different movie. The 70s had Taxi Driver. The 80s had Gordon Gecko. The 90s had Goodfellas. The early 2000s had American History X and The Wolf of Wall Street. (Lotta Scorsese here) Recently there was Joker. All these movies regularly get accused of supporting viewpoints that even a cursory viewing of the film would make obvious they don't.

            Despite what so many people on the internet believe, audiences are usually savvy enough to understand satire. The people who support nazi shit with Tyler Durden or Travis Bickle quotes are generally doing so based on out-of-context quotes, sound bites, or YouTube videos. 

            The problem is that no matter how small the percentage of people who misinterpret the movie are, they will post their shit everywhere, and people will respond by accusing the creators of misleading the audience or "glorifying" the villain. 

            Of course there are people who put these villains on pedestals, but that's true of *all* halfway-decent villains. After all, they did the same thing with the Heath Ledger's Joker and Hannibal Lecter who are much more obviously evil villains.

            The truth is that if evil were never likeable or relateable, almost no one would be evil. In reality, people don't generally do evil for no reason. They do evil because they think it's right or cool or it will give them purpose or take away their pain. 

            My problem with that kind of criticism is that it discourages writers from writing 3-dimensional villains for fear of too many people agreeing with them. It's Poe's Law taken to the logical extreme.

              Happens to movies like the Matrix too, the prevalence of the "red-pill" meme among alt-right topics for example.

              I think you are right that people don't see the work, nor analyze it critically. And that this has lead to a decline in the ability of people being able think critically (a sort of self fulfilling prophecy).

              I'll reiterate my point earlier that it mostly seems like people uneducated in the topic on both sides that are shouting at each other.

      I don’t think /r/rational was especially bad, but the Slatestarcodex culture war thread got really bad.  As in people posting the 14 words paraphrased or even rarely not-so-paraphrased and getting upvoted and serious discussion.  They stopped having culture wars thread so the people that liked them started themotte which is even worse.

      As to why this happened... several factors

      * discussion norms focused on principle of charity and steel-mannning even heinous ideas let alt-righter and crypto fascists get a foot hold.  See argentstonecutters linked Twitter thread why this is a bad idea.

      * Scott Alexander presents himself as left-of-center but fails at understanding and/or steel manning leftist ideas, while simultaneously doing a really strong steel-manning of far right ideas like Neoreactionary ideals and libertarian ideals even if he nominally disagrees with them.  For another example his infamous “You are still crying wolf” post about Trump which explained how Trump was basically a standard Republican, not as a take down of Republicans but as a defense of Trump (even though Scott acknowledged Trump was a bad president).  Because of course to Scott the real problem was that negative media about Trump made his patients feel worried as opposed to the actual bad stuff Trump was doing. Overall Scott’s pattern of hot takes like this skewed the Overton Window of SSC to the right in a way that made alt-righters feel like Scott was secretly on their side.

      As for spacebattles... things which are popular often develop a backlash fueled hatedom on spacebattles.  For instance they had a Let’s Read of Worm in which discussion of it mixed up details and mistook fanon for WoG and vice-versa and used this to justify hating on Worm more.  HPMOR was immensely popular so it also got a lot of backlash hatred that failed at reading comprehension (or didn’t even try the source material they hated).

        My problem with this is, it's not like the alternatives work especially better. The approach "we don't talk about this; and if you say anything that sounds remotely like this we'll shun you on principle without even deigning you of an explanation as to WHY we think your ideas are wrong" also produces pretty bad effects. It's how right wing ideas got to pose as "counterculture" and as "this is the stuff the liberal élite doesn't want you to know" and so on. Frankly I have a general feeling that looking for this or that cause of the rise of the alt-right in the way we conduct discourse is a bit of a moot point. The real causes are probably rooted in much deeper issues - economic and social transformations, as well as the memory of WW2 just getting further and further away - and everything else is simply accidental.

          It’s a lot of work writing a detailed response. Occasionally, in between low effort mockery, someone on sneerclub will do a more serious post so I’ll just piggy back off that.

          Or for another example... the entire character of Dylan Alvarez in Unsong.

              Here is what Scott directly admits to thinking about leftists, which the top post in sneerclub brings attention to

              > I had always assumed most leftist groups sucked because they were primarily made of stoner college kids and homeless people, two demographics not known for their vast resources, military discipline, or top-notch management skills. 

              And his book reading has led him to the equally uncharitable alternative conclusion 

              > But S&W believe they suck because they choose to suck, for principled reasons.

              Scott then goes on to acknowledge that the book fails to justify basic leftist thought since it is actually aimed at leftists, but then fails to steel man the book by considering it in the context of leftists thought.

              Scott concludes with a handwavey dismissal

              > I know the arguments in this space. I know people wonder “what if the benefits of utopia only go to the rich?”. Or “what if letting people have their own private visions of utopia means elites can shape the future?”. Or “when some people don’t have health care, doesn’t spending money on utopian visions seem irresponsible?”. Or a thousand other different things.

              In which he fails to actually steel man these arguments for the purpose of reviewing the book.

              From someone that is willing to steelman extremes like Neo-reactionary thought, this lack of steelmanning is a serious over sight.

              And I don’t think Dylan Alvarez is a leftist, I think Dylan is Scott’s best take on a middle class white person becoming a radical leftist because he can’t actually empathize with that line of reasoning.
              ```

              - u/VorpalAuroch:

                >  And I don’t think Dylan Alvarez is a leftist, I think Dylan is Scott’s best take on a middle class white person becoming a radical leftist because he can’t actually empathize with that line of reasoning.

                You have assumed the consequent. You presume that Alvarez is a representation of leftism because you believe Scott cannot interpret leftism charitably enough to understand it. If you don't have that assumption, you would have no reason to associate Alvarez and leftism at all.

                Alvarez is quite literally a rebel without a cause, or better [Rebel Without A Cause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebel_Without_a_Cause) since he is deliberately, specifically acting as the heroic rebel protagonist of a movie. He is leftist only insofar as American pop culture identifies the rebellious underdog as stereotypically anti-rightist. If there is any lesson to be drawn from him, it's that the prospect of radical change without a clear goal ought to terrify everyone, which is a centrist point of view, not an anti-leftist one.

          Before I spend the time searching through old threads... Would several links to upvoted examples of paraphrased 14 words be enough to convince you?  I could find that easily enough.  I could probably find one or two examples were the 14 words are stated out right.  I could find lots of examples of the 14 words and other White Supremacist talking points heavily paraphrased and buried in thousands of words... for instance you typically you find phrases like “Western Culture” used as code for “white”.

          On the old culture war threads they often hid their power level (using enough code phrases and euphemisms that you needed to already know the lingo to realize what they were actually saying), but in themotte it is more blatant.

          I am asking first so I don’t waste time on something that won’t convince you.

          Edit: I found two examples right off the bat with a quick search of sneerclub’s mockery:

          The second example got deleted at some point, but it’s quoted in the sneerclub thread, so I’m linking the sneerclub thread on the comment instead:

            How about a good one?  Your first example that you're implying is a white supremacist is someone who is rejecting the validity of racial categories altogether, but criticizing someone else for being inconsistent in rejecting racial tribalism.

            The second example is a Sneerclub link to a comment that was deleted by the moderators.  I don't see the claimed line quoted in the Sneerclub thread.

            The third one is a hypothetical from someone who explicitly rejects that position, which prompts discussion and counter-argument.  

            Honestly, if those are the best examples from the last 4 years, in a community that averages 4k comments per week, that would seem like strong evidence that the "Nazi problem" is somewhere between "wildly overblown" and "imaginary".  As the saying goes, if you can hear the dog whistle, you're the dog.  Would you take seriously a criticism of this community as being filled with "crypto-Stalinists" because "Trust me, you just have to decode their lingo with as little intellectual charity and as much hostility as possible"?

              And now I think I can't convince you regardless of evidence.  There is a documented pattern of alt-righters using euphemistic language.  If you are going to dismiss even blatant usage of racists euphemisms and lingo in the name of charity almost nothing will convince you.

              Just in case you are willing to change your mind

              Here another comment with some moderate racism in the initial comment and some really racists responses.  Instead of concluding that IQ is a crappy, culturally biased measure of intelligence, commenters came up with some hard mask-off racists responses:

              [https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/f53qhm/culture\_war\_roundup\_for\_the\_week\_of\_february\_17/fi1oa0h/](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/f53qhm/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_february_17/fi1oa0h/)

              Among the highlights in the comments...

               someone that doesn't understand IQ or the effects of colonialism (36 upvotes):

              >The countries with average IQs below 80 on that map are exclusively  in Africa and not part of the Arab League, minus Mauritania and Sudan.  None of them have accomplished anything in modern history, save for the  infrastructure built by colonial powers. They're mostly concentrated at  the bottom of the current HDI rankings.  
              >  
              >Having an IQ of 80 makes it hard to function in Western society  because there are elevated minimums for economic/marriage viability. It  doesn't mean that a society of 80 IQs can't feed themselves. How do you  think *any* country's populace survived in an unbroken chain from  single-celled organisms? Fitness and IQ in nature are not correlated.  What's the IQ of a penguin? 

              and another highly upvoted comment:

              > So 70 IQ children of elite whites tend to have syndromes and are  ostracized, while 70 IQ lower class black children can have the same  level of abstract thinking but still socialize as mostly normals.   

              And someone points out the actual answer and only gets 9 upvotes, with a disagreeing response getting more.

              >Occam's  razor suggests to me in practice IQ is a flawed thing that more  measures your cultural familiarity with standardized tests than anything  useful  
              >

                Then there should be some really off the wall quotes from the 2000 comments posted since Monday!  The fact that there aren't is, at this point, strong Bayesian evidence that they don't exist in sufficient rates to justify your claims about the community.

                Considering that I've been a frequent poster there since the Obama administration, yeah, I'd like to see some actual evidence of all the Nazis I managed to miss.  Instead of these pathetic anti-examples from someone so clearly allergic to different ideas.  Ok, McCarthy, I'm sure you're the expert on the devious codes the kids use these days.

                >someone that doesn't understand IQ or the effects of colonialism

                No, that's your failure, along with the followup.  This really isn't appropriate to argue in detail in this subreddit, so I'll just note that you managed to misunderstand the claims being made, or speculated in both quoted comments.  The selective editing speaks of bad faith, too.

                The third one, whatever it's correctness, is not actually a good post by the sub's standards; the first half is just reiterating one of the very claims being argued, and the second half is a mod-baiting insult that doesn't even try to make an argument.

                I understand that that kind of low-effort swiping is fine at Sneerclub, or most of the rest of the internet, but themotte is at least trying to be better.  For example, consider the *very next reply*, which highlights a problematic implication for that "actual answer".

                >lethal force against BLM protestors

                That's an outrageous characterization of that position, unless you think the modal BLM protester is a violent pedophile in the middle of physically attacking a minor.

                >And have some good old Race "Science"

                Yes, the newest reply there definitely has someone saying that racism isn't bad.  It only took us 8 curated examples to find one in a thread with 3500 comments.

                I doubt this convinced you of anything, but please, the next time you see something linked on sneerclub that seem *obviously* wrong and outrageous and terrible, come argue against it.

            What's really noteworthy in your first link is that the guy who called out the nazi got banned for it. And that's a pattern on SSC, unfortunately. You can say the most heinous things, as long as you say them politely, but you can't call them out, because that's a personal attack.

            This goes all the way up to the top. This is how Scott Alexander himself moderates as well. I don't think it's ill will. I think it's naive optimism about how humans work. But the results are rather disastrous.

            I once got banned from the old Slatestarcodex for calling someone a failure of a human being. The person I responded to, who was saying we should shoot ships of immigrants trying to cross the Mediterranean and then let the survivors drown, faced no consequences.

            I'm still a fan of Scott. But yeah, he's a terrible moderator, and the people he appointed are terrible moderators too.

              There are ways to call them out that would fall within the rules, unlike this particular example. The idea that you can't call them out under those rules is plainly false. As an example, that very thread has several people who called the "nazi" out and didn't get banned for it.

        Scott Alexander started out as fairly left-wing, but in recent years has been becoming more and more libertarian. I think this is a case of the fan base influencing the author. As you and others have pointed out, his social media channels got infested by nazis. But they also got invested by libertarians, and while the nazis have been mostly pushed out, the libertarians are still there, and they rule the place.

        It's a real shame. His writing is still excellent in most cases, but whenever he talks about politics these days, libertarian bullshit pops up more and more often.

How exactly that government is formed or functions is left as an exercise for the reader. I've never much cared for it.

                But yeah, Scott definitely (admittedly!) has a pro-individual anti-institutional bias. When he puts in the effort I rarely have cause to fault his analysis, but he gets sloppy when he's not trying and it seems to be pushing him in a specific direction over time.

            Scott absolutely did not start out as a libertarian. He wrote several pieces against libertarianism.

            He has drifted towards libertarianism in recent years. But not the leftist kind, for the simple reason that leftist libertarianism doesn't exist.

            *edit* Finally got around to reading that link of yours. It's bad. It's very, very bad. Completely fails to understand the debate around free speech, and what limits people are actually proposing. But setting that aside, I fail to see why, even were it persuasive, it would make more more libertarian. 'Free speech is important, therefore I should be against social security, minimum wages and wealth redistribution'. Seems a bit of a non-sequitur.

              Andrew Yang ran for President in 2020 on a leftist libertarian platform.

                Yang ran as a Democrat. He supported medicare for all, lots of action against climate change, wants to expand paid-leave, wants to reduce income inequality, wans to reduce tuition costs, and of course most famously supported an UBI.

                He's a social-democrat, and a fairly left-leaning one at that.

                If you think Yang is a libertarian I can see why you'd mistake Scott for one though. Virtually everyone would be a libertarian by that metric.

              You miss the point of the article, then. *Giving the government power* is a bad idea, because the government is usually stupid and intermittently evil (or less intermittently, depending on your standards; drone strikes and CIA coups are facts of life so there's a good case).

              Also, there is nothing anti-libertarian about wealth redistribution; it's anti-ancap, but libertarianism and anarchocapitalism are not synonyms. Most means of wealth redistribution have side effects which libertarianism objects to, but the core principle is compatible, hence UBI.

                This is it isn't it? This is the central error of libertarianism.

                Libertarianism is the bastard child of American exceptionalism. It starts with the correct observation that the US government is often incompetent and often evil. It then assumes this must be true everywhere else on earth, since after all America is the greatest nation on earth, so it's impossible for any other place to be better. And of course it can't be changed either, because America is perfect.

                I come from a very different place. A place bisected by large rivers, with large swaths of land below sea level. Nearly a thousand years ago my ancestors already realized that yes, I can build a dyke along the river, but that won't be any good unless my neighbor does the same. They realized that we're all in this together and we need each other to survive.

                Government can be good or evil, competent or incompetent. But it's always essential.

        SSC culture war thread comment section examples would turn into politics debates because the alt-right/white supremacists viewpoints are masked by just asking question, or playing devils advocate, or citing an out-of-context statistic that’s lack in context leads to implication racists conclusions.

        The motte is more straightforward but still require some familiarity with the lingo and euphemisms to get at what is being communicated.  I can find a lot more direct examples on themotte but finding one that is unambiguous and direct enough for someone that insists on maximum charitability is still proving a chore...

        Isn't it obvious why this is? Half of the time when the word "nazi" is used it's not used against actual Nazis but against "the kind of people we don't like". The kind of people who post at r/rational are far more likely to have been bullied at school than average; we all know how this game is played. Any rhetorical weapon, even if it's literally anti-bullying rules, is immediately weaponized by the powerful and against the powerless. 

        Speaking less hypothetically, a while back I posted that I didn't think Strong Female Protagonist is rational, and I got a comment back saying that it must be because "my politics" causes me to find it strange to see lesbian characters do good things. I found this to be incredibly baffling, and it was a little disturbing to see that sort of thing get upvoted. I don't think it's paranoid to think that casually slinging the word "Nazi" around is an attempt to move the overton window to a rather unpleasant place.

        Don't get me wrong: I hated the far-right presence on Less Wrong back in the day, and I much prefer the friendly atmosphere we have here now. But I don't want this subreddit to become rationalwiki either.

It may be almost nonexistent in r/rational specifically, (probably because of the politics rule) but I see no reason to disbelieve people's claims about the affiliated communities that have this problem.

  It's a political/tribal reaction.  Rationalism and by extension rational literature is [grey tribe](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/).  To put it in short grey tribe is a cluster of personality traits of tech nerds: they're rationalist, highly online, atheist, not into sports, highly affluent, and so on... and these nerds like a particular brand of fiction.

  Grey tribe is a subset of the general blue tribe (liberal umbrella group), but has been splitting away from it for some time for various reasons (too many to cover now).  This accelerated after 2016.  A prime example would be reddit going from from loving everything Elon Musk did to hating anything he does nowadays.  Nobody can hate you quite like someone who shares *almost all* of your views.  For a parallel, think of how big and important the early 2000s atheism movement was, and now it's basically an unpopular shell that gets derided from both sides.

  Back to rational and rationalist fiction, it's a hallmark of grey tribe so it gets attacked.  Rational**ist** fiction is even explicitly evangelical of it's mode of thinking, which makes it more of a target.  It was popular and accepted within blue tribe a decade ago because it had science and coherent stories, but times change.  However, I should note that, it's not like humans are robots that get updates on marching orders. It takes time for the mobs to disseminate that something is uncool or 'problematic' in this case.

  But it's a slow grind and likely won't reverse.  Rationalists will keep disappearing, either joining blue tribe orthodoxy, sublimating over to red tribe, or learning to keep quiet about rationality.

    What you've described and what your link described are quite different. In the link he is talking about political views, but here you are talking more about personality traits. Your final conclusion that Rationalist fiction is doomed is also strange and I don't see any particularly strong evidence for it. Regardless I appreciate your perspective.
    ```

    - u/xachariah:
      ```
      In the link, I believe he's describing cultural things, where it's a mix of politics and culture.  One example is that whether or not you own a Ford F-150 pickup truck isn't a political statement, but if you meet somebody and see them in a big F-150, you can make a pretty decent guess as to their general politics.  Food is not a political statement, but whether you eat organic vegan gluten free cousine, drink Soylent for most meals, or have a BBQ every weekend is information that informs politics.  That's because politics are downstream of culture and the same goes with literature.

      Rationalist fiction being doomed is part of a greater trend of rationalists and the rationality movement being on the decline.  You're right that I didn't give strong evidence for it here, but it's a general trend I've seen.

  - u/CarsonCity314:

    I think you've got the more likely case.  The blue tribe is essentially policing a heresy, and the grey tribe's defenses against a blue tribe attack aren't nearly as well-developed as its defenses against a red tribe attack.  (Also notably missing defenses against red tribe infiltration).

    There's the remote possibility that the grey tribe establishes an identity it can be proud of, and becomes able to resist attention from the other major cultural players.  Until then, attrition and security in obscurity.

  Having never encountered such a reaction, I am only making guesses. But from what I've seen, rational fiction tends to have a particular style of intelligence-based power fantasy to it which appeals to a different audience than your standard physical-based power fantasies. When done poorly, it is fairly grating to just about everyone; when done well, it is still grating to some. 

  Saying that rational fiction is a blight on the medium is like saying that any niche genre is a blight on the medium. Some would say fantasy itself is a blight upon literature; though less so nowadays. 

  The fact is, the smaller the niche, the less chance that it will produce consistent quality works. Most of us are amateurs, even if intelligent amateurs with a particular goal in mind, and 90% of everything is still going to be subpar. 

  It's just that when something is done loudly it attracts more attention, and like it or not this particular niche made quite a splash. More positive attention, more negative attention.

  The Rationalist Movement doesn't have the best reputation online (unsurprisingly, most people get a little upset when they see a forum willing to debate Nazi Rhetoric), and that trickles down into how many people see rationalist fiction.

  Its not just that a lot of people don't like HPMOR - its also that a lot of people also really, really don't like Yudowsky. The rationalist fiction movement is not something fully separate from the wider modern rationalist philosophy movement (and the politics that inevitably involved), especially because many people first discover the movement through fan-fiction. A surprising amount of SneerClub seems to be people who went pretty deep into the fiction/philosophy side of the movement before getting dissuaded by the politics, and that is reasonable; the entire character of Professor Quirrel in HPMOR does look different after you see some of the stuff that gets posted in TheMotte. The wider Rationalist 'movement' has seemingly decided to honor Free Speech over Moderation, and that's OK; but that does mean that the people who get to 'represent' rationalists online (especially in comment sections) aren't always going to be the 'the best', if you know what I mean, and that is going to affect how the average layperson sees rationalist fiction.

  Plus the definition of rationalist fiction does feel, to many people, like a classic case of 'Not Invented Here' syndrome (another thing that is often a general critique of the rationalist movement that trickles down into critiques of rationalist fiction). Many people feel like the rationalist fiction community is just a bunch of STEM nerds who took concepts that already existed in literature (e.g the fair-play-whodunnit, among other things), gave it a new name and pretended like they invented it. I honestly believe the genre would not attract nearly as much vitriol if it was just called 'Fair Play' fiction or something along that lines - anything that gave some merit to the wider literary traditions that preceded it.

  And to be absolutely fair, both of these common critiques do have merit, and are something we should think about as a community.
