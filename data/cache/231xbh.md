  This isn't severely rational per se, but the characters are at least clever and *well-written*, no one is making stupid decisions, the world is intricate and interesting and creative, the magic system is simple but deep, and the plots are not paticularly twisty but still interesting.

  The characters are the strong point here. Every member of its substantial cast is unique and powerful in their own ways, but I won't spoil anything. Just enjoy (an laugh, because it can get pretty dang funny at times).

  Edit: I forgot to mention that the webcomic makes excellent use of its medium. Some parts make really creative use of we page structures and color schemes, and it updates frequently.

    And recoil in horror, because it can get pretty fucking dark at times.
