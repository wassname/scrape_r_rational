  I liked this book very much. It's one of the very few I literally didn't want to take a break from (you see this hyperbole everywhere in reviews, but this doesn't happen to me with most books).  It has a lot of clever solutions, pragmatism and snarky humor. 

  Of the complaints I've read that I think are justified to some degree:

  * Too many Diabolus Ex Machina with pulled punches (many bad things happen out of the blue, but the damage is limited, so the hero can recover);
  * The hero is too unfazed and lighthearted given the situation. I personally liked it much better than *Gravity* with the heroine unstable to the extreeme;
  * The writing is stylized for a modern blog, and tries too hard to be funny. I liked the style, but I see from where the dislike may be coming from.

  I read this on the author's website while it was being written. It was amazing, both because he did ALL the research and because Mark Watney is a funny guy.

  The published version is presumably at least as good.

  I recommend reading his other stories ([on his site for free](http://www.galactanet.com/writing.html)) as well.

  Also, this is a [repost](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2p9ejr/the_martian_by_andy_weir_hsf/) (not that I'm complaining, The Martian deserves popularity for its quality.)

  Finally, the author did an AMA on reddit in case anyone's interested: [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/sciencefiction/comments/1wwjol/i_am_andy_weir_author_of_the_egg_and_the/)

  I have not read the book, just [this article about it](http://nautil.us/issue/20/creativity/the-hit-book-that-came-from-mars-rd).

  > An astronaut gets left behind on Mars in a near-future NASA mission, and has to survive until help comes. This he does through physics and chemistry, algebra and pipe fitting, botany and celestial navigation, all described in meticulous detail, some of it even simulated with software that Weir wrote himself.

  A [movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3659388/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) version should come this year.

    They SO have my wallet.  If it's at all true to the book, I'll see it multiple times and drag other people to it.  We should signal strongly that science-based movies and rational-based movies are something that Hollywood can make money on.
