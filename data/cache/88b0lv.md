## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  I've been rereading a lot of fantasy books, with supernatural societies using their abilities left and right in secret, and it got me thinking: how much mass can you create out of nothing before NASA notices their rocket equations are going wrong? I mean, it would take a lot before gravity changes noticeably, but every bit more gravity is a bit more speed needed to hit escape velocity, and that extra speed requirement *exponentially* increases the amount of rocket fuel that is needed to push a rocket into space, if I understand rocket science correctly (I probably don't). Anyone more familiar with rocket science able to put some numbers on this?

    NASA does gravimetric surveys. They'd notice that long before they had any noticable hit to dV.

      Huh. I didn't know about that. How much extra mass would it take before they notice the gravimetric surveys are giving odd results?

      (And why do they do gravimetric surveys anyway?)

  A few weeks ago, I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7zoo8l/d_friday_offtopic_thread/duqvy3i/) in a friday thread. tl;dr it's a pitch about a setting where immortals decide to return because they find the singularity interesting. /u/trekie140 posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7zoo8l/d_friday_offtopic_thread/durcriq/) comment about how such a setting could be used to explore some interesting philosophical topics, and /u/eaturbrainz challenged me to write using that prompt.

  It didn't turn out so well, for a variety of reasons.

  Can I get some constructive criticism on the writing, and any advice people have for writing “thinky” stuff? It turns out, philosophy was further out of my wheelhouse than I’d guessed. Feel free to be as brutal as necessary.

    You accidentally wrote comedy while trying to write something philosophically serious.  The basic trope to play off for drama is [Romanticism versus Enlightenment](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Analysis/RomanticismVersusEnlightenment) here, but you've kinda degraded both sides into parody versions of themselves: the war god who's fooled by the "supplications" of bored employees and semi-sapient AIs, and, well, bored employees forking copies of themselves to deal with boring work in a world that, according to your reader's pre-baked expectations, shouldn't have much scarcity or boring work at all.

    More so, in relation to the original post: if we're talking about a world in which the reappearance of gods and magic was *jarring*, who's jarred?  Samantha's not: she's *bored*.  The war god is, apparently, too mentally primitive to be all that significant in the post-singularity corporate world, so where's the actual conflict?  Where's the sandpaper scratching on the souls of your posthuman whatevers and AIs as they confront the profundities and ancient powers of mythology?

    First of all, chapter 1 is perfect. Opening of Hamilton perfect. You could not have explained this premise in a better way and that last line had me hyped to see what you did next with this idea. Where you faltered is that you didn’t seem to decide whether this would be a world-shaking mystery like Arrival or a anthology of short stories like old sci-fi satires.

    Chapter 2 sounds like a scene from a story about first contact, but it skips over the buildup to the encounter and doesn’t establish a goal the protagonist is after. The thing I was most interested in hearing about was the immortal, but you instead focus on explaining how transhumans work. The story of how Samatha was chosen to do this is a great way to present that, but there’s nothing to establish why she’s meeting Bob and what she wants from it. Consider opening with pulling the straw and then her going over the plan because she’s anxious.

    Chapter 3, on the other hand, is about how the immortals are being integrated into human society. It’s definitely interesting, arguably more so than Chapter 2, but it’s basically a vignette from a person’s life in a strange world that we want to learn about. This is a completely different kind of story from what Chapter 2 seemed to be going for and it leaves us hanging by not exploring the consequences of the event or revealing more about the immortals.

    Both ideas are great ones for stories, I had originally thought the former was the best way to go but now I think the latter might be a better choice. If you didn’t have a specific theme you want to teach the audience, like Arrival did about communication, then it’s fine to just present some cool ideas in short stories about this world and the people in it for us to think about.

    I think you should also hammer out precisely what the immortals *do* in this world and why. One possibility is that humanity lives in a simulation that the immortals got bored of interacting with, but have now returned to see what’s new and recapture the fun they once had. It could be like a new expansion pack for an old video game, or commentary on nostalgia if you want to do that. That’s just a random idea I haven’t thought through the implications of, though, so you can do whatever you’d like.

      thanks for the feedback!

      I don't think I'll be continuing this story per-se, but I'll integrate it into further iterations of me trying to write about the direct aftermath of world-shattering changes suddenly affecting humanity.

      >If you have difficulty writing a natural-sounding conversation about philosophy, you might try engaging one of your friends in a conversation about philosophy and use it as material. That's worked for me.

      This in particular isn't something I've thought of before. I can definitely see how proxying conversation topics with friends could be useful.

  So, I had the flu this week, and I emailed my boss on Tuesday to let him know that I'd just been to the doctor and the doctor had told me to stay home the rest of the week.

  He responded with the usual get well soon, and then said, "a gentle reminder" to get a medical certificate.

  This shits me, because this guy is completely anal about sick leave for some weird reason (we have 12 days sick time a year FWIW). I've been working there for 7 years now and I am *intimately* familiar with the sick leave policy because I've read the documents that outline it: so intimately familiar, that I know that due to a particular confluence of events, I *don't* actually need a sick note for last week.

  I do *have* one though, because if you're going to the doctor anyway there's never a downside to getting a note written. 

  I'm like, should I sass him back when I get back to the office and be all, "Actually according to 12.4.6 of the EBA, blah blah blah" - or should I just put my damn head down and give him the sick note even though he doesn't need it? 

  He's asked for sick notes from coworkers that are in *unambiguously* non-sick-note-requiring territory before, and they haven't provided them AFAIK, but my sick note situation is more ambiguous. 

  geez this is like the longest post ever and it's just me whining!!!!

  since it's already long, sick note policy is that you need a sick note if you take three consecutive sick days. i had wednesday booked as a day off, so I only took Monday/Tuesday and Thursday as sick days, so I didn't get three consecutive *sick days*, even though I was absent from work for four consecutive days. (And you can't turn pre-booked "days off" into sick days because you were sick on them except in very specific circumstances, but I could potentially use this situation to turn my day off into a sick day, which would be niice as they come out of seperate "accounts").
  ```

  - u/blazinghand:
    ```
    It's a shitty move from the boss. I guess the question here is, what benefit do you get from not sending in the sick note, and what costs are associated with that, and is the benefit worth the cost?

    Generally speaking, in situations like this where there is nothing directly to gain from proving to your boss that you're technically right, I keep my head down. This is not because I think my boss would take it badly, but because there's no real benefit to it, I get over the annoyance quickly, and it could have a negative impact on me.

      Realistically, the message I want to send is,

      "I've been working here for 7 years. I am well aware of the sick note requirements thankyouverymuch."

      I think the ask a manager blog would tell me to phrase it like this:

      "I'm confused why you're telling me that. Of course I know the corporate policy is to get a sick note after three consecutive days of leave. Did I do something to make you feel as though I don't understand the sick leave policies?"

      The issue is more, my manager seems to think I don't know how to do my job: I've got emails from him where he lays out in excruciating detail each step of a process I have been doing every month for the last four years. He makes basic annotations on my reports (on printed copies in red pen because he doesn't know how to use track changes in word), with things like "are you sure this is the right thing to do?" and I just want to scream at him, "of course that's what I think, this entire 20 page report is justifying why I think it's the right thing  to do, can you read the fucking report?". He's always giving me instructions as though it's my first week, and it shits me. He's apparently like that with everyone, so it's not an age or gender thing (thank god), but it still feeds my imposter syndrome.

        Honestly this just sounds like the kind of manager who is constantly trying to cover their ass and be super on-top-of-things. Are they otherwise a good manager? If so, I'd let it go. If not, then maybe it's worth having a frank conversation with them about this, rather than doing it pseudo-passive-aggressively?

  What are some good ways to improve your rationality? I'm thinking of making a 
  daily rationality challenge for myself, but I'm not sure how to implement it. 
  Or better yet: I'm not sure how to map the territory.

  Let's do simple prioritising for now. The "fundamental question of rationality":
  How do I know what I know? Is there a way to determine my current level? After
  reading *Thinking, Fast and Slow* my guess would be taking 1000 rationality
  challenges, nealy split into a difficulty range from 1-10, and notice when 
  things get difficult.

  Now is the *real* test though: I think this "solution" is rather bland, and
  somewhat textbook. So I'm asking /r/rational what I could possibly miss. And
  while you're at, good rationality exercises?

    If you're looking for a fun way to practice making probabilistic judgements and getting immediate feedback on if they're true or not, the Future of Humanity Institute have just released a tool for doing this on simple Fermi estimation tasks and determining veracity of news statements. [Check it out here](https://thinkagain.ought.org/)

    Another website that's useful for being graded on your judgements is metaculus, which has more sparse and carefully curated questions. However the feedback is more on the scale of months there.

    You could also try putting a rationality technique into a randomised flashcard deck and every day pulling one out and making a goal to use that technique that day.

  I recently had occasion to roll my eyes at [an edit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index?v=a9b19216-22c3-11e7-ac72-128763c683de&v2=e55ccc9a-684b-11e7-8481-0e1e02ebdfd0) that someone had made to [the wiki's list of recommended stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index):

  > [*Time Braid*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644) (Content warning: Contains child rape, torture, mind rape)

  It's my opinion that either *all* the stories on the list should have ""warnings"" or *none* of them should. (Doesn't the list contain *several* other stories that depict torture and mind rape in graphic terms?) However, out of an abundance of ~~respect~~ ~~caution~~ cowardice, I took it upon myself to [delete](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index?v=02b9f006-7b11-11e7-beac-0e38c7f6c7fa&v2=08538c00-24aa-11e8-9bf5-0e044fc19876) only the `child rape` portion of the ""warning"", since, IIRC, it's false. (On the other hand, of course, my most recent (sixth) reading of *Time Braid* occurred *at least* a year ago, and [I've accidentally made false claims about the story in the past](http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/54bz8l/q_recommendations_similar_to_mother_of_learning/d80l4s8/?context=9).)

    I think this is one of the cases where idealism has to give way to pragmatism. Ideally, we wouldn't self-censor. But pragmatically, the point of a recommended reading list is to recommend works. If a reader tries to read Time Braid blind and gets majorly turned off by some of the more objectionable elements, then it's likely that they'll trust the recommendation list less, and avoid reading the other works simply because of their association with Time Braid.

    > It's my opinion that either all the stories on the list should have ""warnings"" or none of them should. 

    The suggestion of fairness is an ideal that we should aim for, but isn't practical here. After all, to fairly add warnings to all the stories on the list, an editor would naturally have to read *all* the stories on the list. Effectively, you would be saying that people cannot add content warnings unless they first invest hundreds of hours of time reading all the stories, even the ones they doesn't like.

    Perhaps an alternative approach would work: add content warnings to all the stories, but leave them blank or with some kind of "todo" marking. That way editors who have read the stories can fill in the blanks, and blank warnings for stories would mean "unknown content" as opposed to "safe content".

    Given you were wrong about the story in the past, and I personally am *not* willing to read stories with children being raped in them (partially because they are *illegal* in Australia but mostly because, gross), can we have someone verify the existence or absence of that sort of thing in the story?

      I'm rolling my eyes even *harder* now&mdash;but, off the top of my head, here are some reasons for which people might think that the story contains child rape&hellip;  
      \- [Some people inexplicably care about spoilers](#s "The main characters are time-looping children. Whether or not they should be considered adults or children at any given moment in the story, given their wildly-varying mental ages but invariably-low physical ages, can be disputed.")  
      \- [Some people inexplicably care about spoilers](#s "Looping Sakura uses a lust-enhancing technique on non-looping Anko, who takes it not as a request for training but as a romantic advance, turns the tables with a much stronger lust-enhancing technique, and engages in mostly-offscreen BDSM shenanigans of dubious consensualness.")  
      \- [Some people inexplicably care about spoilers](#s "Looping Sakura uses the Sexy Technique to get non-looping Ino into a threesome with non-looping Sasuke, in an attempt to seduce non-looping Sasuke in the longer term.")  
      \- [Some people inexplicably care about spoilers](#s "Demon Looping Sakura tricks non-looping Hinata into signing away her soul's ownership, and then \(non-consensually?\) fingers her so that she'll verbally confirm Sakura's ownership of her soul in the throes of orgasm.")  
      \- [Some people inexplicably care about spoilers](#s "On several separate loops, Looping Sakura gives various flavors of brain damage to non-looping Naruto \(her willing test subject\) in perfecting her memory-editing skills. To make it up to him \(even though he doesn't remember what he did for her\), in several subsequent loops she shacks up with him.")  
      \- [Some people inexplicably care about spoilers](#s "Looping Naruto's aura of chakra eventually becomes so overwhelmingly powerful that, when he unleashes it \(for example, during intercourse\), females in close proximity to him tend to become intoxicated and incapable of giving consent. Inuzuka Hana is the only non-looping person shown to fall under his influence in this fashion, but Naruto implies that there were others in the past.")
      ```

      - u/MagicWeasel:
        ```
        I'm not joking, text depicting sexual actions of minors is defined as child pornography in Australia - here's a newspaper article about someone who was imprisoned for writing such stories: http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-04-14/man-jailed-for-depraved-texts-about-young-children/6391718 

        If the acts you're describing happen between bodies of child age or appearance, then consensual or otherwise, they're illegal in my country. (I believe we also have laws that say that adult actresses can't depict children in pornography, for example).

        I don't know if anyone's been prosecuted for *reading* such material, but still. (And yes, I do use a VPN)
