  tl;dr:

  > The Schelling Protocol just was one line:

  > > If an Authority Fleet vessel encounters an unidentified, non-human object, it must destroy this object immediately.

  #

  > > Several centuries ago, during the first phase of human expansion, the Human Authority recognized the possibility of encountering alien life. The Authority assembled Earthâ€™s foremost xenobiologists and asked them to formulate a practical first contact protocol.

  > > The first conclusion is that intelligence capable of constructing spacecraft must arise from a predatory or omnivorous species.

  > > The second conclusion follows from the first, and that is that this intelligent species would have a well-attuned combat-oriented psychology.

  > > The third conclusion is that any intelligent species we encounter in space displays in-group preference, and that preference will naturally exclude humans.

  > > The fourth conclusion is that communication with these aliens is impossible.

  > > The Committee concluded that any alien encountered would have a long history of conflict, and would be willing to use it. Communication would be impossible with the aliens, and therefore no realistic attempts at negotiation for surrender or parley can be made. With the lethality of spaceborne weaponry, even in those early days, it is guaranteed that if an alien ship fired on a human ship, the human ship would be destroyed before it has any chance to retreat or retaliate. Therefore, the conclusion the Schelling Committee reached was that the only rational first contact response is to destroy the alien ship, before it has a chance to destroy one of our ships.

  When I saw the protocol, I thought there'd be a good reason behind it, but then the reason was bad and the end was worse than either of the two other ways.

  Let's discuss better reasons, such as technologies the setting allows, that would lead to that protocol.

  By the way, wouldn't constant evasive maneuvers no-sell any sub-lightspeed ranged touch attack at those ranges?
