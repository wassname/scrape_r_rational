  The escalation's pace was great. The problems raised were interesting, but they were handled poorly. The requirements of the plot are the main reason anything happens. The meme wars shouldn't have been determined so much by chance, strategy and strengths and weaknesses of each meme should have been described.

    I thought that was one of the overarching messages of the story- that we erroneously attribute outcomes to design when in fact the large majority of outcomes are simply chance.

  I've submitted this once before, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ouxcm/xrisktransdimensional_brain_chip/). People seemed divided about it - there's a lot of good ideas, but it's badly-drawn and written in the author's second language.

  Well, it's finished, so you can read it at your leisure now.

  I made a plot of the rate at which Ulfs are dying, calculated from the number shown:

  ugh. no. really generic dystopia ending that shouldn't be new for anyone here, stilted narration/speech, awful art. i feel like choosing to make fiction in comic format rather than plaintext ought to add something, rather than a default for when you can't be bothered to describe things. the art is garish and attention-grabbing enough that it makes everything else seem juvenile by association. so on and so on. i feel like there might be something worthwhile there, but i couldn't stomach any more than the beginning/ending (to see if the art had improved) (spoiler: literally no difference). can't see why anyone would enjoy this.

    But the comic format does add something - the parallel panels/parallel universes thing. You can't really do that well in text.
