## The power of Truth

### Post:

So, inspired by the liar in a truthful world post, I had an idea..

You wake up after a night on town with a headache, a very strange tattoo on your left arm, and a very funny (dis)ability.

First: You can no longer speak with deceptive intent. 

You can tell stories - if it is clear they are stories. 
You can use parables and metaphors. - if you believe said parables and metaphors communicate your point clearly to the audience you are speaking to. 
You cannot intentionally mislead anyone by spoken or written word. Being "Technically truthful" just does not work for you. Basically, in everything you say or write, you find you are trying to communicate as honestly and clearly as your powers of communication and knowledge of the subject at hand allows. 

This is not an oracle. You can be wrong. You cannot, however, pretend to greater certainty than you actually possess. 

Nor are you compelled to talk to people - silence is always an option. 

Now, for the upside. 
Everyone is compelled to believe you are telling the truth as best you know it. Cynical politican, jaded 4chan member, religious fanatic? Noone ever believes you to be a liar, no matter what you say. 

How do you use this?

  I would become a news reporter or political commentator similar to Jon Stewart. Everything I say would be considered to be truthful, often funny/entertaining by revealing what others leave unsaid, and I'd be able to exercise an incredible amount of influence over state/national discourse.

  If I could figure out a way to tattoo others and compel them to speak truths as well, I'd start a movement to have all public speakers pre-commit to receiving the tattoo before they address large crowds. Before receiving a tattoo, they'd have to take courses in logic, rationality, and they'd be tested for delusional tendencies as well as their ability to admit when they are wrong. The process for receiving a tattoo of truth will be open for revisions via a democratic forum and all of the tattooed will publically renew their vows on a yearly basis to adhere to the Principles. I think this will go far towards creating a group of reliable leaders.

  Granted, someone could fake a tattoo and if everyone in the world has the tattoo... then we're in the Invention of Lying territory. Hm. I don't know how to prevent that from happening.

    Fake tats obviously don't grant the second compulsion. They'd just  be ink.

    NOT PARANOID ENOUGH! Anybody who wanted to deceive the masses wholeheartedly and completely would simply need to manipulate you. Hmm, using this power to ones advantage seems irritatingly difficult.
    ```

  Let's look at the evil side as well: Sell myself as the ultimate ad. Customers will have to convince me, then I can easily convince the rest of the world. I'm not especially robust against manipulation, so Coca Cola should easily be able to convince me that Pepsi is disgusting or harmful.

  That makes for a paradox loop. If someone convincingly lies to me and I repeat it back to him, Will he believe his own lie?

    It doesn't make people believe that you're right, it just makes them believe you're honest.

    You can't lie about how certain you are. if you know you're not robust against manipulation it doesn't work out too well, since you might feel obligated to add that.

  Run for office, try to make the world a better place by fixing the parts that I know are wrong, and we can ignore the parts I feel iffy on.

    Problem is that just because they believe you doesn't mean they don't also still believe in whoever they'd have voted for instead. That and it is hard to get campaign funding when you can lie to neither your sponsors nor your constituents. All a reporter has to do to blemish you is ask you about one of all the shitty things you had to do to come to office. Your awkward silence will be damning as hell.

  That sounds almost exactly like the Iregara in [_Deadly Silents_](http://www.amazon.com/Deadly-Silents-Del-Rey-Books/dp/0345287800) by Lee Killough.

    Also, halfway like Elspeth from *Radiance*.

      In particular, I'm thinking of the ability to tell stories if they were clear they were stories. In the novel, a character tells the protagonist a story in "classic" Iregara style. Every other paragraph starts with a disclaimer. "It is said that the hunter looked like this." or "We might suppose that the man sought his wife for so many years."

      I've just ordered a copy from Amazon just so I can go into more detail when I have the text in front of me. This should be a classic, it's a crime it's not available as an eBook.

  So, Messiah powers? You'd have to be mildly deluded, but then again, you did just wake up with superpowers.

  >You can use parables and metaphors. - if you believe said parables and metaphors communicate your point clearly to the audience you are speaking to.

  Whether something communicates a point to the audience is on a spectrum.  You might think that something is only understood by 99% of the audience, or 95%, or 50%.
  ```

  - u/Izeinwinter:
    ```
    The tattoo doesn't care that someone in a large audience might misunderstand. It cares about your intentions. As long as you are being as clear and honest as you know how, it passes muster.  The entire idea is that it is pretty darn immune to the sort of gaming which is standard in stories with truth magics, but it is also not out to cripple you socially more than it has to.
    ```

    - u/Jiro_T:
      ```
      It's always possible to be just a little bit more clear and honest.  Add just one more disclaimer, so that you're understood by 99% of the audience instead of by 98%.  Then there are other things you can do to get to 99.5%, and then to 99.7%.  If you refuse to go from 99.7% to 99.9%, knowing that it is statistically likely that three people in the 1000 person audience will misunderstand you, have you "intended" that three people will misunderstand you, and does the tattoo therefore prevent you from refusing?  (And if the tattoo allows this, why doesn't it allow you to refuse to go from 51% to 95%?)
