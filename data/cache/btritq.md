  Fuck me, this is great. PGtE manages to create a kind of impact with pivotal moments like this that I don't think I've ever seen matched by another author.

    EE is a master of setup and payoff, the only other book I think does it as well is Worm, though it is a tad more depressing in its promises and fulfillment.

      Unfortunately, Ward has had almost none of that. Maybe it's just flavor, but it feels inferior in a lot of ways.

        Ward is a very different beast to Worm, I very much enjoy it, because Wildbow is an even better writer now than he was while writing Worm, and while you are kinda right, though I still think Ward has it's moments, Ward is also far from done, and most of the serious 'oh shit' moments in Worm, especially the early arcs are in Worldbuilding and scope escalation. 

        Ward is a Sequel which has its advantages and disadvantages, comparison to its predecessor being both, I Very much enjoy Ward as well, and intend to do a re-read and catchup pretty soon. Which the existence of the Audiobook Project makes goddamn Delightful.

          As much as it may see me lynched on this subreddit, I never read Worm or Ward.  I've never read comics, and don't really care for marvel/DC movies.  Reading about costumed heroes/villains doesn't really hold much appeal to me.  After Pact I feel even less inclined to try and start reading them.

          I picked up Pact since the writer is recommended so often, and while it is really well written, I still ended up dropping it after maybe thirty chapters or so.  Reading it felt too much like watching a little kid just get stomped by a bunch of adults, it felt like the setting was decided first, the story written as realistically in it as possible, and no changes to either were allowed to make it enjoyable to read from a plot point of view were made.  It might end up less like that further on, but the metaphorical kid kicking lasted too long for me to tough it out.

          PGtE is **much** more palatable to me, like watching a little kid get stepped on by adults who don't even see them, followed by a rocky montage and then a couple scenes from Punisher.  I could see it coming about as a concept of interesting and satisfying characters, and the setting created to support those characters coming into existence.  It scratches all the right itches, while the setting supports satisfying outcomes and the outcomes are still realistic to the setting.

            That's Pact for ya. I recommend Twig or Worm, they're both great reads and less 'oh Blake lost again'. They definitely have that realistic-underdog feel, where the protagonists get hurt pretty bad, and they're darker written than PGtE, but I think they're easier than Pact by a long shot.
            ```

          - u/AntiChri5:

            Honestly as someone who loves *Worm* and *Ward* I had almost the exact same experience with Pact, the only difference being I didn't last as long as you and dropped it sooner. That's kind of just how Pact **is** and I didn't enjoy it.

            I would still say you should give *Worm* a try. Like you I never read comics much, though I do like the movies. At it's core *Worm* is in many ways a repudiation of Marvel/DC style costumed hero's and villains. I think quite often people deeply invested in those would dislike *Worm*.

            The big difference I found between *Worm* and *Pact* was that while both have an unrelentingly harsh world in *Worm* the protagonist is competent and ruthless enough that the world needs to be as wary of her as she needs to be of it. In *Pact* the protagonist just isn't up to it and gets steamrolled.
            ```

          - u/UltimateRockPlays:
            ```
            Yeah, Pact is just like that; bad things happen in Worm as well but it isn't any nearly as severe of a beatdown as what Blake gets in Pact.
            ```

          - u/ArcTruth:
            ```
            Yeah I can see why you'd have trouble with it. Worm has a somewhat similar scale of escalation to Pact, in that the Rocky montage doesn't kick in until very late in the story - and even then, the beatdowns continue. I still recommend it obviously, based if nothing else in how it gripped me hard enough to blow through 800k words in 4 days the first time I read it, but I totally respect that you feel it's not your kind of story at this time.
            ```

          - u/Yosarian2:
            ```
            Worm was great, and I could barely get through Pact.  It was well written but it was just torture to read, there just wasn't ever much of a light of hope.

            Worm isn't like that at all. It's more one of the stories where the world is dark but the main character is so great you always have hope that she'll probably figure out a way. Pact never quite managed to do that, somehow.

  ```
  W.r.t. the Dead King, I think the reason he keeps invading is that he *has* to.  If the living stop whispering his name, he loses his Name.  His apotheosis gets reversed.

  So, in the end, his choice is either trying for an eventual victory and risking a final defeat, or a prolonged fading from existence as the Dead King becomes a legend, then a myth, then an indecipherable reference on a paper written in a dead language, and then nothing at all.
  ```

  - u/GeeJo:
    ```
    Even if he becomes legend, myth, and lost in Calernia for lack of proactive conquest, he would remain in the fullness of his power through the worship of the people in his pocket dimension. They have no less moral or narrative weight than the peoples of Procer and Callow; we just don't get to be the audience for their stories.
    ```

    - u/Nimelennar:
      ```
      That's right; I forgot that he kept living people in his own realm.  Scratch that theory, then.
      ```

      - u/MythSteak:
        ```
        It could still be true, but more in an “if I want to stay connected to creation kinda way
        ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Doesn't explain why he doesn't try to keep a peaceful relationship with the other living nations. Even if Good leaders opposed him on principle, he could get a lot of new recruits with the right PR campaign and underworld networks. "Don't want to die? Sign up for the Dead Kingdom's life insurance policy! We smuggle your corpse to His Blessed Lands and bring you back to a semblance of life!"
    ```

    - u/Nimelennar:
      ```
      To be fair, the only nation that he seems to share a border with is Procer, and they're not especially interested in keeping a peaceful relationship with *him*, either.
      ```

  - u/Don_Alverzo:
    ```
    I disagree, because in that scenario there is no way for him to achieve any sort of victory, all he can do is postpone his defeat. There's still a lot we don't know about Nessie, but one thing we can be damn sure of is that he would never play a game he can't win.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I think he's aware of the fact that as long as he does not have complete dominion of Calernia the Heavens and the Intercessor especially will eventually spawn a Hero capable of killing him. This entire invasion is a risk, but one he is willing to take because waiting millennia for a chance to take over the continent is likely to lead to a situation where he has a good possibility of succeeding. 

    But at the same time every year that goes by has a small chance of seeing the creation of a Heroes great enough to kill him. This small chance is *almost* negligible for such a short time as a dozen hundred years but with an infinite amount of time it becomes inevitable. He has to conquer Calernia because he wants to be undying and a free Calernia is the Heaven's blade against his throat, one he never knows when it will stirke.
    ```

    - u/synonimic:
      ```
      If that holds true it leads to a couple interesting questions, are Saint, Pilgrim, and Cat really powerful enough he's worried about them growing in power and becoming a risk?  Or are they still considered small fish who don't really have a chance against him?  If the latter, how much more powerful could Above and Below make Named beyond a swordswoman so singled minded she's literally Sword, a blessed pilgrim who can literally resurrect the dead, and the very complicated, kinda sorta still a (lowercase) god, Black Queen?
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        The danger isn't necessarily with the Heroes themselves but the situation at large. There is near infinite potential for stories where it's feasible that anyone be they Hero, Villain or other kinds of beings kill him. The danger isn't so much that a Hero capable of killing him appear, there are probably some every few generations. The danger is that his defenses aren't perfect because he isn't omnipotent nor omniscient. There is always a chance that the Intercessor or Catherine or some random self insert Mary Sue will get the drop on him. The Heroic band of five with the White Knight, Saint, Pilgrim, Champion and Witch are already capable enough, they just need a story and an opening. The Dead King has been playing wack-a-mole for more than a thousand years but he only needs to miss *once*.
        ```

    - u/Mountebank:
      ```
      I wonder what the rest of the world outside Calernia is doing. Even if the Dead King subjugates the entire continent of Calneria, can't the Heavens just send Heroes from across the sea? It's often been mentioned that Calneria is a primitive backwater, Dwarves excepted, when compared to the rest of the world. So even if the Dead King conquers the entire continent, there's still an entire world of stronger people the Heavens can send.

      I wonder if EE is ever going to expand the scope beyond Calneria, or if those bits of worldbuilding were just for flavor. If he does, the power level will jump up just like in a xianxia when the MC ascends to a higher realm.

  Finally caught up! And God am happy I waited, I sucked out to wait back in the everdark, and only read bits and pieces since, to see if I should jump in. I couldn't hold back after a chapter title like *Small Slights*, and I'm happy I didn't starting from the beginning again I made my way to the *Long Prices*, and golly was it worth it.

  This story is a goddamn master piece of storytelling, EE's understanding of stories is just fantastic and this isn't any more clear than in their use of Three beats, they are the motif and the theme that make this story amazing, twice has Catherine died in This city, twice has she fought devils in its streets, and twice has she been offered a sought a Crown there.

  Each of these unfinished stories is the windup for the arm that she is going to slug the dead king (and likely the wandering bard) in the face with, I'm not certain how but I can't wait to find out.
