  I might be gullible for believing the stories about Welexi, but this felt out of character for him.

    ```
    Yeah me too at first... But remember, rule of three, Welexi thinks in stories and is in heavy denial about his methods and morals... So not too far.

    I'm wondering how many of the other stories that were relayed by Wealwood in (IIRC) chapter four were true. Or stuff sung by the Blood Bard.

      By omission, not *this*. This is a new side of him.

  > When Welexi slipped Dominic’s hand inside the artifact, it sounded a single loud tone. Dominic’s shadow armor disappeared in an instant [...]

  > “Fascinating,” said Welexi. He held the artifact high, looking it over. There was no visible change in it. Without any seeming forethought, Welexi stuck his own hand in the mouth of the artifact.

  So, Welexi knew how the artifact worked. 

  You'd have to be crazy to confidently apply *on yourself* the *same procedure* that just stole a guy's power, hoping that doing the same thing twice produces different results. This is *not* how a level 1 intelligent character treats an unknown, horribly dangerous ancient artifact, and I trust /u/alexanderwales to keep his characters level 1 intelligent. 

  And (using the outside view) if anyone *was* crazy enough to do silly things with unknown, horribly dangerous ancient artifacts, it should usually not result in them getting exactly what they want.

  I can only hope that the other characters have noticed this too.

      WHY
      ```

      - u/protagnostic:
        ```
        If you were another author, I might suspect a trick: That [Spoilers for this chapter](#s "Vidre was merely pretending to kill Dominic, that Gaelwyn would restore his mobility the moment before he fell, that he would catch a window ledge and swing in - or that he might abruptly be saved by Faye and her comrades.")

        But I remember [spoilers for Metropolitan Man](#s "what happened to  Superman"), and now I cannot be so sure.
        ```

        - u/eltegid:
          ```
          It still makes a lot of sense, given the evidence, that [Vidre](#s "did something to avoid killing him. She was clearly unhappy about the situation and specifically asked to dispose of him... Of course, it could also be that she was being sincere and just wanted to say goodbye")
          ```

          - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
            ```
            My tip is glas fibre to slow the fall.
            ```

          - u/protagnostic:
            ```
            I want that to be true, and therefore I'm suspicious of any reasoning that seems to point toward that conclusion.
            ```
