  HTADDB is about 2/3 snark and digressions. Bitter is more straightforward plot. HTADDB is much longer and is rated higher on topwebfiction. Read Metaworld Chronicles on RoyalRoadL instead

  It's worth noting that Bitter is very slow in its progression. Although he posts a new chapter daily, each is quite small. 
  Personally I like HTADDB better.

  They’re not too close to TGS, but they’re both great in their own way. I’d go with HTADDB, just for the snark and ridiculous plot.

  Bitter is definitely better IMO. I stopped following HTADDB then stuck in plot problem "protagonist become too strong". The only solution for such problem is an endless escalation, which become kind of cliche.

  I felt like neither of those were nearly as good, but of the two Bitter is more like TGS. He also has some short stories about a magical thief that you can dig up various places, those were good.
