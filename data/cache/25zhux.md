  Is it normal to have a crazy person leaving a treatise for a review?

    ```
    I was curious about that myself. Odd to have a review that's longer than the thing it's reviewing.

  ```
  I like it! The incredulity, empirical inquiry, and quick propagation of new beliefs to change the entire mental map remind me more of the HPMOR opener than any other rationalist fanfic I've seen. Keep them updates coming!
