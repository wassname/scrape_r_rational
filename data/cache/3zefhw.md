  ```
  "Thinking, Fast and Slow," by Daniel Kahneman. There's more "useful" psychology in it than an entire Bachelor program's worth of classes. Hell I'd throw my Master's in there too, if not for the profession-specific value. If you legitimately want to know more about how you and people in general think, and why, it's the first book I'd recommend.

  ```
  Superintelligence by Nick Bostrom (For me it served as a unified explanation of all the little tidbits about FAI that I had gathered from blog posts.)
  ```

- u/CthulhuIsTheBestGod:
  ```
  "GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid" by Douglas Hofstadter, a book about philosophy, music, math, and consciousness.
  ```

    ```
    +anything by Hofstadter
    ```

- u/Subrosian_Smithy:
  ```
  Recently I read "Napoleon's Buttons" and "Creations of Fire", about historically significant molecules, and about the history of chemistry, respectively. Pretty interesting stuff.

  ```
  How about [The Disappearing Spoon](http://www.amazon.com/Disappearing-Spoon-Madness-Periodic-Elements/dp/0316051632/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8) and [The Violinist's Thumb](http://www.amazon.com/Violinists-Thumb-Genius-Written-Genetic/dp/0316182338/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8) by Sam Kean. They are great books about chemistry and genetics.

  ```
  [Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062316095?ref_=nosim&tag=vglnk-c319-20&pldnSite=1) and [Good and Real](http://www.amazon.com/Good-Real-Demystifying-Paradoxes-Bradford/dp/0262042339/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1451932679&sr=1-1&keywords=good+and+real) - each could be considered a canon of rationalist thought on evolution of humankind and ethics respectively.
