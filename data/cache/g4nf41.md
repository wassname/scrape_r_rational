  Ch. 60 refresher summary:

  >!Ryouko, Asami, and Simona practice in simulation for their upcoming mission: using Project Armstrong's wormhole apparatus to launch an attack on the Ceph's pulsar mines. The simulation ends in their deathsâ€”not an uncommon occurrence, a fact which weighs on them, especially Asami. But Ryouko works hard to support her girlfriend, even genetically engineering an exotic plant for Asami to wear in her hair as a gift.!<

  >!Yuma's investigation into the AIs involved in Ryouko's life turns up no TCF corruption, but indicates that the conspiracy she faces may have simply covered their tracks. Her investigation into the mysterious deep space coordinates yields more: a hidden asteroid base. Yuma plans to personally lead a field mission, using experimental anti-IIC technology to prevent any occupants from revealing Yuma's conspiracy to their own. Excluded from Yuma's planning, Kyouko unknowingly organizes a Cult-sponsored expedition to the same exact coordinates.!<

  >!On Adept Blue, Clarisse van Rossum hears the Goddess's voice telling her not to go to the pulsar.!<

  Getting into fanfiction through Code Geass has left me with a crippling fear of reading anything unfinished.  Is there an end in sight for this story?  It looks really good but I just can't start until it's done.

    The last estimate I heard was that the author expected to finish it in 3 or 4 years. I have high confidence the story will in fact be finished, but if you're not okay waiting for new chapters, now is not the time to start.

    Edit: The story has a planned outline and ending, if that's a specific concern.

    I was thinking the same thing. First I was excited that it's gone as far as 60 chapters and three quarters of a million words, but then I realised it was first published in 2013. Could be years more for all I know, or never - the longer the timescale of publishing the more things are dropped.

      *To The Stars* is on volume three out of six. I'd say we're nearing the climax of Volume III, in three or four chapters. Each of the volumes is easy to consider as their own book. I don't know what the pace is like; I know that it's drastically slowed down recently (read: the last two years) but there's a chance things might pick back up.
      ```

        Pace slowed down because the author got their PhD and started working fulltime. I would expect the pace of the last ~3 years to be instructive: between 3-6 chapters a year. However, it's plausible the rate will speed up as the story starts getting tied up - this might be expected as part of the 3/4 years completion estimate, but that's just speculation on my part.

        (Also: AO3 thinks the publishing date is 2013, but it's actually late 2011, since it was first only on fanfiction.net.)

        (I think Volume III probably only has 1 or 2 chapters left personally, but it's hard to say.)

  Welcome new tidbits!  This makes my hopes more subjectively likely that the underlying truth of this conflict is >!Homura versus the Incubator/s!<.
