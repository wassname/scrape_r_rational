  This is one of my favorite novels. Robert Gu is an Alzheimer's patient that gets cured and has to adapt to life in 2025. Though technology hasn't progressed as fast as the novel predicts, it's still very good near-future Singularity fiction by one of the men who pioneered the concept. If you have not read "The Coming Technological Singularity" (by Vinge), you can [read that here](https://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/vinge/misc/singularity.html).

    I actually spoke to him about his novel and whether or not he felt that recent developments in AR and interactive media bore the world envisaged in Rainbows End--he still holds it to be a fairly accurate potential depiction of the future.

    In the same vein, but further, I'd recommend reading The Golden Age (if you can stand Galt-esque speeches).
