    You know, this comment had me puzzled for a few hours, since I couldn't figure out why someone would have paid attention to what I was saying and reddit isn't friendly about letting people search histories. It finally dawned on me that I must have made a blog post about it, and sure enough, I found five or six paragraphs about what I want out of Superman. It's weird but not all that surprising how closely much of what I wrote there parallels what I ended up writing in the fic. Out of curiosity, how on earth did anyone ever find that blog post? I feel like I must have linked to it at some point, but have no real recollection of it.

      Why did you not like kryptonite?
      ```

        Mostly it's because ninety percent of the time when it's used, it's a cheesy plot device that's introduced only to add in some tension to a man that's got absurd powers. There are so few things that you can really do with kryptonite, and so much of the time it's either "Superman is still super even without the powers" or "Superman can still figure out a way to punch hard enough". As an obstacle to throw in front of a protagonist, much of the time its just ... lazy.

        In my opinion, the very best Superman stories are character studies, where failure isn't a matter of not being strong enough or fast enough, but instead about what Superman's values are and how he goes about trying to satisfy them. There are some really great Superman comics, and the ones I love don't include kryptonite, because they don't need to - the conflict and tension are there without taking away Superman's powers.

        (I also hate how every two-bit villain seems to have kryptonite for usually poorly explained reasons. The backstory for it is constantly shifting, but usually it doesn't satisfy me.)

        So yes, I do dislike kryptonite, most of the time. I probably wouldn't include it in this story, except that Superman isn't the protagonist (which changes the narrative aspects some).

          I thought that Kryptonite was used reasonably in the graphic novel "Luthor", but in that graphic novel it's not the tool Luthor uses in his attempt to win. It's often a patch for lazy writing though, and I can see why you dislike it.

          As an aside, your thing to the right of your name reminded me to reread A Fire Upon the Deep.

      You didn't link to it, I just did a magic trick to find it. Cheated, in other words - your name was visible briefly on a Google Doc you linked to here as one of the users with it open. I googled it and found my way to that post and your blog. 

      I can't believe you'd forgotten writing it! I was extremely interested to find that you'd apparently been sitting on this fic for 3 years at least.

          [Sure, here it is.](http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2011/08/what-i-want-out-of-superman.html) Though I should warn you that this is my personal blog, and as such is full of a bunch of disorganized thoughts, musings on things I really don't know anything about, and basically, a bunch of stuff that I only wrote to get stuff out of my head with the assumption that few, if any people would ever read it. (Also, I had completely forgotten about that particular blog post until yesterday, so while I agree with much of it, it doesn't have much bearing on the story.)

    This kryptonite seem to be more 'depleted uranium than granite', the whole green rock from his home world kryponite was very weak, with every mastermind on earth apparently possessing a piece. However this power source kryponite which was shielded from the infant *before* he got his powers suggests it is a highly dangerous radiation which would destroy both human or kryptonian. This makes more sense.

  This chapter might go through some after-the-fact revision, but having a first schedule slip makes having a second and third schedule slip far more likely. There are almost definitely two chapters left.

    I am thoroughly enjoying this.  Thank you.

    And with that said, the chapter for 7/7 is going to be delayed at least a day while I figure things out. It's done, it just needs to be massaged into shape, and I think that posting it late at night because I have a deadline would probably make for a weaker chapter.

  "She would have run herself ragged trying to improve the world if she had Superman's powers." 

  You know this kind of thinking really annoys me, Lois is perfectly capable of making changes for herself but she actually spent time cleaning up her apartment (instead of working at a soup kitchen for example), and as far as we're aware she doesn't do anything more charitable than an every day person. Not only did Superman explicitly remind her of all the suffering going on around her, she apparently thinks of it, decides that of course she could never do anything about it (when she easily could) and then decides that Superman isn't doing enough, even the whole goddamn message Superman is sending is that everyone should try to be good. People are always like "Oh I would rescue that hobo if I won the lottery, or I would do X if Y happened, no one does it when they're in that position", there's probably some psychological phenomenon for the name of that.

  So yeah, fucking hypocrites goddamn.

  Yeah, don't know if that was deliberate the intention of that writing but that's my thoughts.

    It comes down to a question of opportunity costs. Let's say that Lois Lane and Superman both sit down in a movie theater together to watch *Anne of Green Gables*.

    The opportunity cost for Lois is relatively low - let's say that she makes the equivalent of $60,000 a year. It's almost certainly more efficient for her to push her comparative advantage (writing/reporting) than it is for her to donate her time to a soup kitchen, since a well-written essay on women's rights is likely to do a whole lot more than a single hour of labor. She could also work at her job and donate the money to a soup kitchen, which would almost certainly give a better expected payout than donating labor to something she has no particular skill in. Let's be generous and say that her opportunity cost for going to the movie is about $30 plus whatever a ticket costs.

    The opportunity cost for Superman is relatively high. Even if he prohibits himself from making money (except as Clark Kent), advancing technology, or doing manual labor, his opportunity cost is still much, much higher than Lois's. Lex figures this at about one life per hour, but it's probably a little lower than that (Superman is actually pretty crappy at preventing disease and infection, which are by far the two largest causes of death during the time period). It's much harder to put a value on something like a human life, but I don't think it would be absurd to put the opportunity cost of Superman going to the movies at at least $100,000 ([a number that I didn't just pull out of my hat](http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1808049,00.html)).

    Here's the steel manned version of Lois's line of thinking; if the cost of going to a movie was that high, she wouldn't go to a movie, and she wouldn't expect any moral person to do the same. It's only because the cost is low that it's worth it.

    Here's one of the potential counterarguments from Superman; if going to a movie with Lois allows him to be better able to handle the psychological stress of being Superman, then that is the correct thing for him to do, because otherwise he would risk breaking down in some unpleasant manner. If he's in the business of getting warm fuzzies instead of [absolute efficiency](http://lesswrong.com/lw/3gj/efficient_charity_do_unto_others/), that's still not all that bad, since a focus on efficiency could lead him to lose his motivation to do good (though in this fic it seems more like he's tortured about the use of his powers).

    I would also agree with /u/Linmark that you're not being all that charitable towards Lois. She's been shown as active in the feminist movement and a hard worker who spends very little of her time on leisure, to the exclusion of friendships and romance. She also legitimately believes that investigation and reporting are good. And at the same time, I agree with you that she's not being entirely charitable to Superman, but there are reasons for that beyond pure hypocrisy - she resents that her primary comparative advantage now seems to be wooing Superman (which, incidentally, is the only reason she seems to have cleaned her apartment in the first place).

      >  two largest causes of disease

      You may have meant to say "two largest causes of death" here.
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I get your point, but Lois specifically thinks that her job is actually changing the world for the better. And maybe you disagree, but she did support progressive laws and has a hand in making them pass (with her books and her bargain with luthor). She's not more charitable than any other man but a) She's a woman in the thirties and can only have so much influence and b) it's because she is just like any other human. Superman is not...
    Also, working in a soup kitchen is overrated.
    ```

  - u/philip1201:
    ```
    She cleaned her apartment *explicitly solely because* she believes the best she can do now is to woo Superman. Do you seriously think she can do better right now by ladling out soup to a hundred-odd bums?

    As the top reporter for one of the most popular sources of news on the planet, she has a massive direct impact, with flow-through effects that include *preventing Superman from going AWOL* and *getting gender equality legislation passed 40 years earlier*.

    Also consider that to Superman, everyone is psychologically-morally close: he can hear their cries, know their problems, and is in the unique position to help in a way that is extremely safe to him and everyone else involved. He can save a life every minute without trying, and people are hypocrites for not being willing to spend weeks of work on a far less certain bet?
    ```

  - u/embrodski:
    ```
    I like her thoughts here, because they provide a counter-balance to Supe's actions, and because I think a lot of people would relate to her. How many people would realize Superman is put in a position where typical human morality cannot apply and try to come up with a new morality? It's cheaper, and signals your own virtue much more, simply to keep insisting on the standard model.
    ```

    - u/RMcD94:
      ```
      >  It's cheaper, and signals your own virtue much more, simply to keep insisting on the standard model.

      My issue is not that she is wrong for believing that people should invest ~100% into improved the world (or however amount that she is doing but superman is not), which sure she is, but rather than being wrong she's just being hypocritical. Why can you expect Superman to not take breaks and not run himself ragged (for a start he is running himself ragged as we've seen by his PoV), but she most certainly doesn't run herself ragged and invest 100% of her life in improved everyone.

      The most obvious example is where she's whining about him spending dinner with her, but she literally spent X minutes cleaning her apartment, which is not helping anyone.

  Hmm, I can't quite understand Calhoun's thinking. Did he simply *want* to die?
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    You know, I very nearly wrote that scene from Calhoun's perspective. He's old enough that if he went to prison for a decade, he would almost surely die there, especially considering that his power base has crumbled away. He was really ready to die if the verdict came back guilty, mostly just to take his life back into his own hands. He gets handed this unexpected victory instead though, and had this feeling of elation, because he pulled out a win that he really didn't think he was going to get. So he does what he really wants to do, which is to rub Superman's nose in it, right in front of all the reporters, and so far as he knows, Superman's as stoic as they come and never responds to provocation, so this some safe, fun, gloating.

    But yes, prior to the verdict coming back he's much more focused on getting revenge/vindication than actually living.

  Approaching the end so quickly? My my. The chapter was very good, as usual. A part of me is upset that Superman finally broke: that's not something that's supposed to happen. But the way you wrote it, it was a reasonable conclusion.

  I noticed a typo "they'd draw up a chart to show that while I was eating while hundreds of people were dying." The "while after "eating" is superflous.
  ```

  - u/gabbalis:
    ```
    Did he break? Or was the trial a test of the adequacy of human laws to Superman? He certainly seemed to be doing his best to ensure that the outcome best reflected human laws. (Though I wouldn't exactly call it a double blind study to say the least.)
    ```

    - u/EndlessStrategy:
      ```
      Well, "thou shalt not kill" is typically Superman's most cherished principle. I personally don't think a policy like that fits every scenario, but the point is that it's Superman's moral center. If he's fine with killing now, who knows what other lines he might cross.

      I suppose it's remotely possible he's just trying to do what's right. But then why kill Calhoun in such a public manner, that is sure to lose him much of his public support? If he was that dead set on enacting justice, he should've done it in a way that wouldn't compromise his ability to do good later down the line. As it happened, with him striking after being provoked, it just seems like he totally lost control.
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        These are all good questions that will hopefully have satisfying answers in the next chapter.
        ```

    - u/philip1201:
      ```
      He definitely broke. Whether Calhoun deserved to die or not, Superman killed him out of anger, not a careful evaluation of his values.
      ```

- u/embrodski:
  ```
  There should be a section-break between Calhoun's introspective jail scene and the scene where Clarence is told to ignore the bribe money by Superman (about 2/3rds of the way through, transition after "His prayers were greeted only by silence"). I'm assuming based on other comments here that Calhoun's scene was a recent addition? Good addition. :)

  Also, I'm still loving the hell out of this!
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Nope, Calhoun's scene was there from the start. Not sure how I missed the section break - I write in Google Docs and I think that ff.net eats the section breaks (but only some of the time). Should be fixed now.
