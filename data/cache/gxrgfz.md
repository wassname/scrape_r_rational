  Life got interesting and for a while there I fell off the wagon viz a viz writing, but I'm back and planning more regular updates.

  Hey, I notice you only post chapters to /r/ rational. This it might get better traction in /r/litrpg.  I really think it would fit better there.

    Thanks for the idea.

    I did in fact post it over there and it got zero traction. That crowd is very different from this one, it seems -- if you aren't posting every day then you aren't worth reading. I would love to do that, but I simply don't have time.

  Those sneaky imps! They removed the 5 mana cap on the second version of the contract.

  Not that Athos is likely to care about lost stats when returning home, but I hope the disappointment isn't too great if the location and time in spacetime end up completely wrong after Athos has to go through doggie hell first. (Is there even such a thing?)
