Additional Recommendation: In case you missed a comment where I mentioned this one--Brandon Sanderson's [*Warbreaker*](https://brandonsanderson.com/books/warbreaker/warbreaker/) (completely online), in part because I think the [annotations](https://brandonsanderson.com/annotation-warbreaker-dedication/) are fascinating.
