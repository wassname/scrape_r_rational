## Recommendation for Small Unit Tactics - the first translation of the popular russian author

### Post:

I have recently found out that  [one of my favorite books ](https://author.today/reader/11619), The Small Unit Tactics, was translated to [English](https://www.amazon.com/Small-Unit-Tactics-1-LitRPG-ebook/dp/B088QQ7VQR). I believe it to be not only a great book, but a rational reconstruction of the Portal Fantasy / LitRPG genre, so here I am, recommending it to the English speaking rational genre community. I thought about posting it as a comment to the recommendation thread, but my review turned out to be too big. 

The author focuses on the internal thinking process of the gamer Echo, who (and thousands of other gamers) was transported into a strange world, which reminds of a game, but doesn't seem to be one. In order to show the MC perspective, the author uses first person ‘slides’ instead of a traditional chapter format.  In my opinion, the approach works great to show all the Echo's confusion from the transportation or the decisions/mistakes the MC makes, but the format may confuse you instead of showing the  character's puzzlement. 

Similar stories in my opinion are:

 • The Saga of Tanya the Evil

 • Battle in 5 Seconds After Meeting

 • Worth the candle


Further on I am going into the spoilers territory, so proceed on your own risk. 

The premise of the book is 7 gods transporting thousands of players to serve as their champions in a fully realistic melee group battle royale game. 

The reason I believe the book to belong to the rational genre is the given rules system, which evolves logically as the story proceeds. E.g. Ranged weapons don’t exist and even if a weapon is thrown it doesn’t do damage. Such a restraint changes fighting significantly, and forces characters to think out of the box. 

It is especially absorbing to observe genre-savvy gamers trying to come up with the optimal tactics without previous experience in the game they occurred in. Thinking about how you would try to win "the round" while watching the MC trying to succed gives you the deepest satisfaction.


 There is also an element of competence porn , as the character (and the author) has medieval tournament reenactor experience. As a result, all the fights descriptions are graphic and thrilling. However, the character is not a Mary Sue, who can fight against an army. As the title reflects, almost all action happens on a small unit level.

 Focus on the tactics, the intergroup dynamics and faction vs faction fights makes the story captivating and believable and serves as an unusual approach to the mainly MC central genre. 

As for why it's a good book? The conflict is captivating, the characters are deeply thought out and easy to root for. The first person narration may seem strange at the first glance, but it makes the story feel more realistic. Overall, it's a great read and I am happy it is feasible now not only to the russian speaking, but to the English speaking community as well.

Sorry for any mistakes, English is not my native language.

  thanks for including the original version as well, I've only read the first slide so far and didn't read your post past the spoiler warning, but since you say it's similar to Tanya the Evil I figured I should check it out
