## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  Zombie Related Hypothetical:

  A genie announces that, a week from now, everyone who dies will have their body vanish and be replaced with an adult grizzly bear.

  The grizzly bears are like normal bears, except they have a bright-red-coloring (to distinguish them from mundane wildlife) and a violently aggressive disposition.  The bears will attack people, within the normal ability of bears.

  Does society break down?  And how much of the breakdown would be due to bears, and not everyone suddenly learning that magic is real?

  ----

  I'm asking because I really like the 'mood' of Zombie stories; it's cool to think of how a few people might survive in a wasteland populated by strong, but not-particularly-smart foes.

  A the same time, it's hard to imagine how we get from here to there, without a bunch of authorial handwaving.

    It's *possible* that society breaks down.

    The big problem is that either *everything* needs to be grizzly-proofed, there need to be grizzly kill-squads, or society needs to have near-total control of when and how people die. That's a whole lot of load added to society in the space of a few weeks, which doesn't necessarily cause societal collapse, but which *does* put pressure on sensitive parts of society that are already load-bearing (pun not intended).

    Big cities are probably one of the weakest points. New York City doesn't have enough food supply to feed everyone in it if the logistic disruption is severe enough, and it's *already* got ~400 deaths per day, though most of those are probably in hospitals. It's not *impossible* that there would be runaway feedback loops that took out a major city like that, which would result in waves of refugees impacting other places and creating logistics disruptions elsewhere.

    Mostly likely that doesn't take out the government, and the wasteland would be unevenly distributed, with "clear zones" that are assumed not to have any grizzlies (and policies and procedures in place to keep them that way) and "wasteland" that's been essentially condemned.
    ```

    - u/frostburner:

      I think the bigger issue would be that the "wasteland" would also be a significant percentage of the world's economic activity. [Just take a look at this map.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/us-gdp-map-2014-2) if the largest cities, like New York, all have this runaway effect causing the city to collapse, then we'd easily see a quarter of the country's economy simply falling apart. Companies like Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon, would be severely damaged as their headquarters become inaccessible. Not to mention the New York Stock exchange would have to shut down for an unforeseeable length of time. More than likely the world would go into economic collapse. Internet services and power grids would slowly fail as the centralized systems have no one to control them anymore.

      I also highly disagree that it wouldn't take out the government. DC is a massive economic area. The things that are true for New York are true for DC, but instead of just taking out some businesses, it's congress, and the FBI, Homeland Security, the EPA, and NSA. Of course the president would get out, along with much of the high level white house staff, but they wouldn't have the infrastructure to manage the whole country anymore. The parts that they could manage would be run essentially like a dictatorship as well. 

      I'm not sure how the rest of the world would fair though. I expect similarly.

      > New York City doesn't have enough food supply to feed everyone in it if the logistic disruption is severe enough

      Couldn't they just eat the bears? (assuming they're not poisonous or whatever)

      The problem with relying on hunting/breeding for food is that the animals you're eating need to eat a lot of food themselves, and oftentimes you'd be better off feeding the food directly to people. Magic bears that appear out of nowhere don't have this problem.

        Logistics is still a huge question mark. You get ~400 bears (before bear murders) that have to be cleaned and butchered so that their meat can be distributed to the people who need it, and that's assuming that you can actually *get* the meat while it's still good, because slaughtering a bear properly without its willing compliance is probably pretty tough.

        (Some math on caloric needs: 400 bears times 600 pounds times 600 calories per pound = 144,000,000 calories, which is enough for 72,000 people per day assuming a 2,000 calorie diet. Population of New York City is ~8.5 million. Not entirely sure that the numbers I grabbed are for the same statistical areas though.)

    Maybe it's my true crime brain kicking in, but it's going to put some unique challenges for murderers. 

    I can see it now:

    "HONEY! It's not what it looks like!"

    "I think it's exactly what it looks like!" \*two gunshots*

    \*two inhuman roars*

    "AAAAAAHHHHHH! OH MY GOD!!!"

    \*three inhuman roars*

    ---- several hours later ----

    "Mummy? Daddy?" \*bedroom door opens* "AHHHHH"

    \*four inhuman roars, heavy footsteps*

    Can we eat the bear meat after the bear has been killed with no side effects?

      >Do these bears need to eat things other than humans? The biosphere is going to collapse really hard, if so.

      Any squirrel or moth or cow or whatever that dies is instantly replaced with a grizzly bear, colored green to distinguish it from the other bears.

      Bears resulting from grizzly cannibalism are denoted blue. Bears that die of natural causes, starvation or being crushed by a tsunami of multi-colored bears, reappear completely black.

    As with zombies the solution is ladders. From there anyone with a gun can kill infinitely, I think society can survive

  I used to watch *True Blood* (an urban fantasy show) back when it was on, and there's a time where one of the vampire characters remarks: "We've got Louis Pasteur working on this scientific problem we're facing."

  Made me realise, with vampires being A Thing, probably one or two historical figures got Turned.

  So, are there any historical figures who might have been made into vampires? Ideally, they'd have to have weird behaviour in their later years, or suddenly disappear from the record with no body. 

  Of course, depending on the number of vampires, it's unlikely that many historical figures got turned; but I thought it would be fun to think about, but I don't know much about any particular historical figures to make suppositions myself.

  Also: I had the idea for a rational *Babysitters Club*. I didn't really have an actual idea, just the idea that a rational babysitters club should happen. I suppose I could do it. Anyone have ideas? Anyone excited? Was anyone else a tween girl in the '90s before the word tween existed?

  EDIT: Thoughts: Stacy would be the rationalist, Kristy would be an economist, Claudia would be a social engineer/PUA, Mary-Anne would be ????.

    I wasn't a tween girl in the 90s, but my sister was, and I read a lot of the books since I was a voracious reader and they were around. I'm not sure that I remember them well enough that I could ape them though, and I'd probably have to read the wiki that probably exists. It would be interesting though - I'd read it if someone else wrote it.

    In a somewhat (but not really that much) similar vein, there was a series of articles that were Babysitters Club in the style of Bret Easton Ellis that I remember enjoying, [link here](http://www.alloy.com/lifestyle/baby-sitters-club-by-bret-easton-ellis-chapter-1/).
