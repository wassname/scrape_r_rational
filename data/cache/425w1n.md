## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  I'd like to renew the recommendation for [Undertale](http://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/) on Steam. Do not read any reviews or spoilers for the game, unless you're VERY sure the reviewer won't spoiler you. This game is much, much better if you're not spoiled. 

  Here's what the author put as the description:

  >Welcome to UNDERTALE. In this RPG, you control a human who falls underground into the world of monsters. Now you must find your way out... or stay trapped forever. 

  >((Healthy Dog's Warning: Game contains imagery that may be harmful to players with photosensitive epilepsy or similar condition.))

  >features:

  >* Killing is unnecessary: negotiate out of danger using the unique battle system. 
  * Time your attacks for extra damage, then dodge enemy attacks in a style reminiscent of top-down shooters. 
  * Original art and soundtrack brimming with personality. 
  * Soulful, character-rich story with an emphasis on humor. 
  * Created mostly by one person. 
  * Become friends with all of the bosses! 
  * At least 5 dogs. 
  * You can date a skeleton. 
  * Hmmm... now there are 6 dogs...? 
  * Maybe you won't want to date the skeleton. 
  * I thought I found a 7th dog, but it was actually just the 3rd dog. 
  * If you play this game, can you count the dogs for me...? I'm not good at it.

  I consider it game of the year for 2015, and so do the good game reviewers (like that guy on youtube who never breathes). It's one of the best games I have played. 

  The nature of the game prevents me from giving it a stronger recommendation, because anything more convincing gives away info about the game, making it less fun. Don't look up reviews, don't look up the OST, don't watch a let's play of it or get ANY info about Undertale. Just play the game. 

  People on r/rational who liked it, make comments saying you liked it so that people get an idea how awesome it is without learning more details about the game! That should work!

  Get it on steam. Worth the money. Worth the time.

    I've really liked it so far.  For one thing, I burst out laughing at Undyne's posing the first time you fight her.  "UNDYNE pointed heroically to the heavens."

  I'm a big fan of stories as circular, mostly because I like parallels, symmetries, and palindromes in my fiction. I recently read a Dan Harmon post on tumblr ([this one](http://danharmon.tumblr.com/post/57779240046/could-you-explain-your-story-breaking-process)) that clears up a few things about how to make a pleasingly circular story.

  So think of a central idea, then break it into halves that please you in some way. One half is your overworld/underworld divide, the other is your revelatory divide.

  If the central idea is "Stories" then our overworld/underworld split might be "False Stories" and "True Stories", while our revelatory split might be "Reading Stories" and "Telling Stories".

  This gives four simple phases:

  1. Our hero starts off as a reader of fictional stories. Then something happens and ...
  2. Our hero starts reading *true* stories (histories, biographies, science books, etc.). Then something happens and ...
  3. Our hero starts *telling* true stories. Then something happens and ...
  4. Our hero starts telling *fictional* stories.

  These phases don't have to be (and probably shouldn't be) equal in size, and I'm leaving out the important "something" that happens during the transitions, nor the character stuff that propels our character through their thresholds (and obviously structure is just a suggestion to be junked when it starts getting in the way of the actual story). But I think this is a pleasing way to arrange a character-driven story, especially a longer one.

  I've been trying to look for pleasing divisions that work well using this method, which means those that have identifiable and interesting halves to them (preferably more than one). Politics is easy, since there are already lots of two-axis models to pick and choose from. Science also seems like an easy one, since there are theoretical/practical divides and soft/hard divides.

  One of the interesting things about this particular structure is that the shape of the story *completely* changes depending on what order you put them in. Once you're slicing up political thought into four quadrants, you have eight different ways that you can circle through them, each with their own "natural story" of character growth.
  ```

  - u/Brightlinger:
    ```
    This might be a very basic question, but Google didn't turn up anything useful, so I'm asking you. What do you mean by "overworld/underworld"? From your example, I gather that the "underworld" is whatever the protagonist travels through during the story?
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      **tl:dr; Yes, the overworld is whatever literal or metaphorical place the protagonists was in, while the underworld is whatever literal or metaphorical place the protagonists travels through.**

      To back up a few steps, in 1949 Joseph Campbell published *Hero With a Thousand Faces*, which was a theory based on comparative mythology which posited that most myths have a common structure to them. Lots of people expounded on this, including TV writer Dan Harmon, who took Campbell's descriptive monomyth and decided that if stories share a common structure across so many cultures, maybe this is just how stories should be shaped to hook into something elemental in the human brain.

      The Harmonian monomyth forms a circle. Starting from the 12 o'clock position and going clockwise, a protagonists is in a place of comfort, something is wrong, they get the call to adventure, they go down the road of trials, they have a death and rebirth, they get some kind of boon, they make their way back, and return, having changed.

      The top half of the circle is the world of the known, the natural world, the ordinary world, the protagonist's home, etc., what I call the overworld. The bottom half of the circle is the world of the unknown, the unnatural, the special, the place to be journeyed through, etc., what I call the underworld (and often, especially in myth, it's literally an underworld).

      So for some examples:

      * In *Die Hard* the overworld is the office party and McClane's wife. He gets the call to adventure when terrorists attack and goes into the underworld, which in this case are the unfinished upper floors of Nakatomi Plaza. He goes through trials and tribulations, shows his wife he really does love her, kills Hans Gruber, then returns to the overworld again, wrapped in a blanket and surrounded by civilization.

      * In most sports movies, the overworld is playing for fun and the underworld is serious competition. Usually the call to adventure happens when they need to raise money, or they get challenged, or something like that, and from that point on they're going through these trials and tribulations until they have the metaphorical death and rebirth, after which they win the championship and return to the overworld, sometimes with promise of another adventure in their future.

      * In *The Breakfast Club* the overworld is normal life and the underworld is Saturday detention, where our heroes get broken down and come out the other side, having changed.

      So depending on how you align your axes, you can make pretty much anything into the underworld. If a starry-eyed teenager joins a political campaign and quits in disgust after he's been disillusioned by the election process, the campaign office can be his underworld. Or if we're watching someone take hard drugs until they suffer a near-fatal overdose, after which they battle addiction until they can return to a normal life, the underworld can just be drugs (or addiction). We can make the soft sciences into the underworld by following an undergrad who gets seduced by not having to use qualitative data, until eventually he loses his grasp of the truth and comes to his senses at a crucial moment of change, then returns to the hard sciences (the overworld), having changed.

  Here is [an interesting article](http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-ideal-marriage-according-to-novels) about how male vs female authors tend to write about romance and marriage differently. I found it largely convincing, even though it suffers from overgeneralization from a few examples (which I think is almost inevitable given the subject matter). Others [have remarked](https://twitter.com/awfulfantasy/status/643466605154955264) on these kinds of patterns in sci-fi and fantasy (as opposed to the sort of literary fiction discussed in the above article).

    >Will we crave food? Will we feel clear-headed or experience brain fog? Etc.

    As someone with superbad appetite who as a result does a lot of intermittent fasting... Nobody can tell you that. These kind of things are very different from person to person. Totally depends on your individual reaction to low blood sugar etc. If you dont react badly to 24 hours you should be alright, I suppose. Hope your friend has experience with fasting already? 

    I'd keep some fructose ready in case things go badly and you really need to get some sugar for your brain right now. EDIT: looked it up, science says glucose is a lot better than fructose for replenishing glucogen storage; only advantage of fructose is that it avoids the insulin spike from too much glucose.
    ```

      My friend doesn't have much experience with fasting, so much so that she thought I had an eating disorder the first time I casually mentioned intermittent fasting.

       The experience of a 24 hour fast has varied each time for me, though some consistent experiences for me have been that:

      a. not eating at all is much easier than small meals or candy during the fast

      b. fat can stay off hunger far more effectively than equivalent calories of carbs.

      c. meditation help me with the mild hand tremors I get from fasting, and meditating helps me with the unpleasantness of fasting.

      Yeah I'll keep some candy on hand for emergencies if need be.
      ```

      - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
        ```
        As for your friend, I probably wouldn't go from zero to 72 hours. Some people react really badly to fasting; some of the worse things that can happen: 

         if I go too long my body first stops thermogenesis (and I become really cold as a result), then get heavy panic attacks/depressive symtoms. Bad headaches/migraine are also common. Good luck with the project!

       I'll have some quasi medical supervision in that I'll obviously look for any warning signs of the fast like the symptoms of severe hypoglycemia or ketacidosis.

    I've done intermittent fasting (1 meal/day) for a little over 6 months now, and have done around 4 48-hour fasts during that time period, just for my own personal enjoyment. I also did a couple 72 hour fasts 4+ years ago, when I was still religious.

    I don't feel hungry at all when doing intermittent fasting normally, but neither have I felt hungry when doing 72h fasts. I personally really enjoy drinking tea (or hot water, if I'm doing a water-only fast) while fasting, much more than I do when not fasting. I generally feel (all at once) light and happy and serene and foggy and like all of the world's problems can be solved by friendship and self-sacrifice when I have been fasting for 36+ hours, and this sensation is heightened when taking casual walks, and diminished when playing games or being unproductive online. I definitely recommend doing this fast over a weekend (eat your last meal before the fast on a Thursday evening, so you can eat again on Sunday evening). This will allow you to distract yourself with e.g. games if you want to.

    Regarding clear-headedness vs. brain fog, my experience is that you feel a sort of pleasant fogginess (the same one I described I described in the paragraph above) that you can recognize as such, but that feels, ah, um, *righteous and correct* if you're in the right state of mind. This fogginess is somewhat conducive to meditation.

    Obviously, your mileage may vary, and this is all just anecdote on my part. 72 h fasts can be rewarding, but if you feel like doing a 48 h fast first, that could be a good intermediate step. Good luck :)

    Can you explain what you do to meditate? I kept reading that it is very good for emotional and mental health while I was in school, but I couldn't stand the idea of taking time out of my day to just sit still. I have more free time now and would like to give it a serious try. Is there a guide or anything you would recommend or advice to start what would become regular meditation?

    This is the first time I can remember it being mentioned on this subreddit. Do any other redditors have advice for meditation?
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      My meditation practice is anywhere from 10-20 (used to do longer, but I've fallen out of the habit this year) minutes of focusing on the breath.

      I put earplugs in, find a nice quiet spot (ranging from the library to a big community garden to my apartment), set a timer on my phone after putting it on Airplane mode, and sit with a straight back. Then I close my eyes and focus on the sensation of my breath going in and out. That's it. I spend a lot of my time being distracted, wandering off into other thoughts, etc. but I always try to bring my awareness back to the breath.


      Good places to start:

      I should note that meditation is hard work and relatively boring to most people when starting out. But it can be quite rewarding in the calmness and self-awareness it brings.

  I'm in a proselytizing mood, so--here's another spiel for my brand of "friendship"!

  ---

  [Description and discussion of the underlying mechanics](http://i.imgur.com/VCZSnwZ.png) (warning: 933×10959-pixel image)

  In a nutshell:

  1. Person A asks a question, which is labeled with an ID number.

  2. Person B gives for the question an answer with the same ID number.

  3. Person A gives for the question an answer with the same ID number.

  [Example image](http://i.imgur.com/oRSHNws.png)

  A participant can ask or answer multiple questions in the same message, as long as each inquiry or response is labeled with the proper ID number. It's recommended to set solid guidelines for frequency of participation--e.g., "Each participant should ask and answer at least one question every three days." The questions can be delivered through any text-based medium: My own first six "friendships" were/are conducted through Facebook messages, but two ancient precursors to this system were conducted through emails, and "Friendship" Seven was conducted through Reddit messages, whose formatting I absolutely *loved* after dealing with Facebook's plain text for such a long time.

  Obviously, this arrangement offers over ordinary friendship (as far as I'm acquainted with that system--which isn't very far) the advantage that upon neither party is imposed the burden of participating in disliked activities at the demand of the other party. What could be a lighter task than asking and answering questions? Who doesn't want an opportunity to say what he thinks, or to extract the thoughts and opinions of a fellow human? And coming up with even many *hundreds* of questions isn't *too* difficult--I am *by no means* an original person, but I've still managed to think of several hundred unique questions over the three years during which I've been conducting these relationships.

  ---

  A quick overview of "Friendship" Six, my most productive:

  * Part 1 (721 questions between 2015-02-20 and 2015-08-24, averaging 3.9 questions per day): [Graph of question-asking ratio](http://i.imgur.com/whHrWCn.png), [list of asked questions](http://pastebin.com/5UFFzJst)

  Here, there was a hiatus because I was both low on creativity for thinking of new questions and disgusted with myself for putting up for so long with so many people for whom I had little personal liking--so [I ended all three of my active "friendships"](http://i.imgur.com/GH6Kux6.png). Soon enough, though, I found the social contact available through my semi-regular participation in r/narutofanfiction and r/rational to be insufficient, and was forced to come crawling back.

  * Part 2 (198 questions between 2015-10-14 and 2016-01-19 [the day on which I typed this comment and uploaded the following three items], averaging 2.0 questions per day): [Graph of question-asking ratio](http://i.imgur.com/0vaDkWA.png), [record of activity](http://i.imgur.com/iqiHXgh.png), [list of asked questions](http://pastebin.com/t3X32v5r)

  My plans for the future of my social life are somewhat uncertain ([1](http://i.imgur.com/tZ3U3kO.png) [2](http://i.imgur.com/aF9QZyw.png) [3](http://i.imgur.com/TwikKNt.png)). It's most likely, though, that I'll try to go after a "Friend" Eight a few days or weeks after "Friendship" Six eventually ends.

    I've looked over what you've written, and have become fairly confident you are either socially starved and have warped views of socialization due to inexperience, or have a mind that values other intelligent beings in a way that neurophysiologically differs from most humans.

    If the first, follow my other advice.  If the second, I think you should consider what you desire in human companionship.  Is it intellectual validation?  Is it just people with whom to share your accomplishments, thoughts, or opinions?

    From what you've written, it appears you feel curiosity for other humans, but do not empathize, sympathize, or otherwise care for their well-being; for example, if the sole life goal of someone with whom you had spent quite a bit of time was to revolutionize the field of knitting, and that person were to gain renown by succeeding in a knitting competition, would you feel genuine, visceral joy for their accomplishment?

    Even if the answer is no, it doesn't mean the above supposition is correct.  It might, however, inform your introspection and recollection of what you value in companionship, and help target your efforts towards more directly and efficiently satisfying that value.

    Some hypotheticals and a corresponding suggested course of action for each:

    * You want to share and have others recognize things you spend effort in producing: use LW study hall or join a related forum in which to post your progress.

    * You would like conversation partners for discussing anime you enjoy: ask people in the LW IRC channel, or the people of the IRC channel dedicated to that anime, whether anyone would wish to join in such a discussion (careful not to interview).

    * You enjoy the intellectual stimulation of engaging in interactive discourse with other sentients: take improv classes.

    Wow, that arcanine guy is really rude.  That said, I think you're underestimating ordinary friendship.  One of the nice things about a good friendship is that the other person knows you well enough that if you decline to participate in a particular activity they'll think nothing of it and invite you to do something else later.  Also, while real conversation involves more than just a reciprocal exchange of questions and answers, this works in real life too.  I've made friends with strangers by just walking up to them, introducing myself, then just asking a question that interested me about their field of study or how they dyed their hair, then continued that into a conversation.  Questions are good ways to meet people, but friendships should eventually evolve to be more than just that.  Glad to see you're trying though.

    This is really interesting, and I can't believe I haven't seen it before now. 

    It's been my experience that because people seek out particular benefits from their connections, rewarding relationships arise when both partners' objectives align. Verifying (either by asking or through a test) that a friend's motivations are in line with your own creates trust- which allows further interactions with less degree of risk. You wouldn't ask someone you just met to help you bury a body, as an example, but instead work out an arrangement with someone doesn't want to see you arrested.

    Would you say your relationships are driven chiefly by the participants' underlying curiosity? Do you have a selection process in place to adopt friends who value that exchange of information as opposed to valuing something else, like physical companionship?

      > Would you say your relationships are driven chiefly by the participants' underlying curiosity?

      Well, "Friend" Six at least has said as much explicitly, IIRC--I don't know much about the others' motivations. On my side, though... [is "wish fulfillment" the right term?](http://i.imgur.com/46hD8PI.png) Even if I'm not as awesome as Yagami Light or Lelouch vi Britannia, this is a nice little pretense that makes me feel a little better. If I can't make people write books for me and give money to me, I can at least get them to give random information to me.

      > Do you have a selection process in place to adopt friends who value that exchange of information as opposed to valuing something else, like physical companionship?

      In order to use a selection process, I'd have to be well-acquainted with the people being selected beforehand, wouldn't I? No, I just pick acquaintances who've seemed relatively-friendly toward me.

    Referring to them as "Friend 1", "Friend 2", and so on seems a bit dehumanizing/clinical, no?

    I any case, I think lists of questions are great under the right circumstances -- I've made ample use of them on long road trips and hiking trips on occasion, and they've provided a springboard for plenty of 10-15 hour long conversations. I think one issue with the ones you're using is that a lot of them are really boring and don't really provide fertile ground for followup discussion. I've probably most enjoyed going through Greg Stock's books (e.g. [1](http://smile.amazon.com/The-Book-Questions-Revised-Updated/dp/0761177310?sa-no-redirect=1), [2](http://smile.amazon.com/Book-Questions-Love-Sex/dp/089480619X/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8), [3](http://smile.amazon.com/Book-Questions-Business-Politics-Ethics/dp/156305034X/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8), which you can pick up used for a few bucks each), as well as the ["If..."](http://smile.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=if...+questions&rh=n%3A283155%2Ck%3Aif...+questions) series and books of [thought experiments](http://smile.amazon.com/Pig-That-Wants-Eaten-Experiments/dp/0452287448/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1453572385&sr=1-1&keywords=pig+eaten+thought+experiments). Each question usually provides 5-120 minutes of conversation, with median time being, I dunno, 15ish minutes.

    And I'll second recommendations on getting out and doing other things while conversing with people **in person**. It doesn't have to be too active -- a walk will do.

Of them, I'd have to say that [In Good Company](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8614734/1/In-Good-Company) is by far the best.

    Are there any other fanfiction in that fandom that you can recommend? I've read a few, but a lot of them seem to suffer from being in complete. I think my favorite was one where Jon Snow was the Gamer. (Similar to RWBY - The Games We Play, by Ryuugi)

It's a crossover with Lord of the Rings where the Westerlands and the Lannisters suddenly get transported into Middle Earth and get involved in the war. It's not complete, but it updates often.

      I think other people here have recommended Oh God, am I the Mannis Now? and I second that. It's a decent SI fic and the main character tries to industrialize the Stormlands a bit. 

      [And, the Giant Awoke](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10379763/1/And-The-Giant-Awoke) is a fic where Tyrion escapes to Essos and uses his brains to become rich from various enterprises. It's a decent munchkin fic, though sometimes it seems like things go a bit easily for him. 

      [Westerosi Internet](http://archiveofourown.org/series/48797) is a pretty hilarious set of crackfics with the premise that it follow canon exactly except that the characters have Instant Messaging and the Internet. The character interactions, especially with Tywin, are pretty hilarious.

      As far as more general fanfics go (i.e. no munchkinry, crossover, or SI), [No Featherbed for Me](http://archiveofourown.org/works/317779/chapters/511035) is pretty good. It's an AU where Gendry is the first son of Robert and Cersei so no war happens. It follows Arya growing up and dealing with the difficulty of being forced (as a woman) to act like a medieval noble lady. This one is complete.

  I had this idea for a fanfiction about SOIAF but I don't have the time nor will to write it. Yet I'm intrested in discussing it so could I post it on this subreddit or it is against the rules.

  The idea is based on this video

  tl;dr Westeros is a post-apocalyptic world. Long winter is a nuclear winter and there is race of telepatic aliens trying to destroy westeros.

  Reasons I find it intresting: most of fanfcitions lack any good villains. This could provide nice enemies once the character finished munchikin the world.
