  I like some of the counterintuitive choices like Lewis and Adams... there's more to rationality than just atheism and mundanity.

    I read quite a bit of translated work, and I think translation can be really tricky thing. A bad translation can destroy tone and beauty of the language, as well as stripping out a lot of the idioms, puns, etc. Douglas Hofstadter (of *Gödel, Escher, Bach* fame) writes about this a lot in *Le Ton beau de Marot*, which I recommend.

    And don't forget all the stories, fables, legends, and oral traditions lost in the currents of time, which no translator can ever revive.

    This is a problem with fiction, I think. Niche fiction (like sci-fi) has this problem to a greater extent.

    It also created another problem: Hardly anyone writes sci-fi or fantasy in Dutch (to give one example) because the market isn't big enough.

  ```
  >Robert Zemeckis, Back to the Future 2 (movie, 1989). Another complex model of metatime -- I set my students to work trying to figure out the model of time travel here, and they at least got close. (Chalmers)

  That's always a high-scorer for [nerd-sniping](http://xkcd.com/356/)... always feels like a consistent model is *just slightly* out of reach; that you could hammer out the last details with a little bit more thought.
  ```

  *Copy-pastes half of that list onto my wishlist.*

  Thanks for posting this.
