  Fairly slow chapter today, but necessary set up for the coming offensive. The fact that they keep describing the details of the plan makes me very nervous that something is going to go terribly wrong. Now that everyone is together and the plan is laid out I'm fairly certain that next week we'll get into the actual offensive, and see what it looks like to march against the Hidden Horror.

    Should anyone in command fall to the Dead King, he'll know what they're doing and why.

    Cat should know this - which suggests to me that their plan somehow takes this into account.

      I like that. An intricate plan designed to fail with the true plan ready to be deployed the second it does. Unless Quartered Seasons is prepared though, Cat is running out of aces up her sleeve.

      Speaking of which, what the heck is going on with the elves chasing the Crown of Spring? Has that been mentioned again?

  The comment of General Abigail climbing the tower to become Dread Empress Reluctant gave me a big belly laugh!

    ```
    Oh god yes, and the reasoning for "it's a trap!" is just even better.
