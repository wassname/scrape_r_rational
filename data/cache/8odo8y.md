  Astute readers will note that *last* week I published chapter 3, "Malpractice." Now this week I am publishing chapter 3 again. 

  This is because reader feedback last week was that the jump between the end of "A Donnell Thanksgiving" and the beginning of "Malpractice" was jarring and represented material they would really rather I had described than skipped over.

  I was persuaded, and spent my writing time this week on the missing material. The new chapter this week goes **before** "Malpractice," which is now chapter 4. I also made some very slight modifications to "Malpractice" itself, but if you read it last week, I don't think any of the changes are major enough that you have to read it again. 

  I want to sincerely thank everyone who recommended I back up and write this material. There were opportunities to introduce interesting details into the chapter that I think will enrich the story as a whole. It will be a better book because I received honest criticism.

  For those disappointed that the story ends the same place that it did a week ago, I hope this explanation mollifies you. I'd love to hear more of your thoughts and speculations here or on the Delphic Discord server.

    Pretty sure this is the crowning achievement of author responses I've ever seen. Thanks for taking the time to flesh out the interval!
