## Dealing with magic in worldbuilding.

### Post:

Hello, this is the first time i post here.

I have a world with "soft" magic ( I know this place is not for something like this, but because of my personal reason, i did not develop a hard system ) and i am in the process of developing it. But in the process there is some trouble :
 1/ how do you develop magitech if you dont treat it as a alternative law of physics, rationally
And
2/ What is the difference between educational system of magic and engineering.

I know it may sound awkwark, but still thank you for reading.

  It's fine to post soft-magic works here!  Your magic system doesn't have to be explicitly detailed, it just has to be consistent.  If Bob can throw a fireball on Monday then he should be able to do it again on Tuesday unless you show a reason that he can't.

  I'm not sure what you're looking for with your post -- do you want help doing the worldbuilding?

  Daystar Eld and Alexander Wales run a great podcast called Rationally Writing [here](http://daystareld.com/podcasts/rationally-writing/) that has two episodes on magic systems [here](http://www.daystareld.com/podcast/rationally-writing-6/) and [here](http://www.daystareld.com/podcast/rationally-writing-7/). Those should be able to answer most of your questions, if I remember what they covered correctly.

  The short version is that we can't really answer your question without knowing details of your setting.   

  The long version is a bit more complicated...

  No matter what style of system you want to use, you need to start with a foundation.  Thus, you need to get much more basic than this.

  You need to answer the fundamental question of:  *Why does this world have magic?*  And I mean that in the "meta" sense.

  The answer will always be one of two things. 

  1)  You want to create a system of magic and then go forwards, positing how it will influence the development of civilizations and nations until you reach a certain point in this developmental timeline you want to place your story/RPG.  You take the skeleton of hypothetical changes and then flesh it out with details according both to what would logically follow and what you need to 'add' to ensure you get the setting you want.

  2)  You want your characters (both pro- and an- tagonists) to be able to do a specific thing or have a certain set of capabilities that normal beings of their type (usually humanoids) can't normally do.  You build the system backwards from that point to establish how and why it works as it does.  The "Magitech" and "education" will follow from this depending on the nature of the setting and the civilization you've designed.

  40 milleniums of cultivation deals with this pretty well.
