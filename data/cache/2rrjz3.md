## [RT][HF] Feedback requested for a fantasy short story

### Post:

I have a short story out as a bit of a test piece for a fantasy novel I'm working on. I'd like for the novel to pass the rational fiction litmus test, so I'd appreciate knowing what works vs. what doesn't in the sample piece.

I know ~5500 words wasn't really enough to get a thorough grounding in the magical mechanics, and the plan is to get into more detail in the full version. That said, consider everything there up for comments or criticism.

The story, "Luck's Touch", can be found on [AO3](http://archiveofourown.org/works/3119456/chapters/6759845) or [fictionpress](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3229480/1/Luck-s-Touch). Comments can be posted on either site or here, and are appreciated.

**Edit:** As is noted below, I am working in someone else's IP, which means I have limited influence regarding existing characters and locations. As a result, I am primarily interested in feedback geared toward characterization, storytelling style, problem solving, plotholes, logic breakdowns, and mechanics fumbling, etcetera. Essentially, if my storytelling skills aren't up to par, I'd like to see where. If I'm doing something right, I'd like to know what.

That said, I do welcome **all** feedback.

  Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

  In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

  Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

  “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

  The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

  Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

  Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

  L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

    Wow, thank you very much for the thought and effort you've put into this. This gives me a lot to work with and consider.

  If I were looking along a bookshelf, essentially the challenge of a novel based on this story would be to do something to interrupt my sense of cliche, and to do it quickly.

    Thank you for your response.

    Is that sense of cliché from the lack of a synopsis here, the synopsis posted for the short story on the sites, or the story itself?

    I can revise my description or post a hook of some sort here if you think it will help, and I'm open to suggestion if you feel there are overused tropes you'd like to call out. I can't, however, do much to change the basic premise of the story.

      I don't know what this borrowed world is, and there are plenty of people who would find all this comforting, but basically all this stuff just kind of sounds like every other fantasy book, so if you want to appeal to anyone looking for something more than every other fantasy book you need something early on to indicate that it is something more than every other fantasy book. Indicate it with your tone or subvert a trope or do something to make it all your own rather than something that feels very borrowed.

        Thanks for elaborating, I'm grateful for the feedback. As I am writing in someone else's IP, it's difficult to address the existing character and location names, pantheon, or genre, so it seems that this story might not be up your alley.

        I'd definitely appreciate your opinion on my own solo IP when I have something to show for that project, as I think it contains unique spins on old concepts that might appeal to you more.

        Thanks for your time!

          IP? Is this a fanfic of something? It was posted as original fiction.

            This is written in the Shades of Venaya setting, which is owned by [Andrew Rowe](https://andrewkrowe.wordpress.com/2015/01/01/new-years-book-update/). I'm one of three writers, including Andrew, working on novels within this setting.

            As a result, I am primarily interested in feedback geared toward characterization, storytelling style, problem solving, plotholes, logic breakdowns, and mechanics fumbling, as these are the elements that I have the greatest control over.
