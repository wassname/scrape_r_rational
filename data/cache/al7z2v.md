  Ethics professor is off to be the sacrifice for the Demonblooded Festival, I guess.

  &nbsp;

  The code phrase Ms Name Generator used is somewhat more suspicious now that we've heard about the Pathists in, like, the *chapter immediately afterwards*:

  > “Are you a traveller on the path made by others?”

  Raven *really* shouldn't have tempted fate about 'dead cabals' like that.

  &nbsp;

  I would've thought Valencia would bring up Snape as the stand-in for the Slytherin professor when Joon explains she's not *actually* evil. The same thing can be said about Severus, after all - a non-evil conspirator who looks and acts evil as needed.

  &nbsp;

  The final part of the chapter can be briefly summarised as "Joon takes some time out to go to Burning&nbsp;Man with a bunch of fellow students." He's managing to get a great college experience already, I think.
  ```

  - u/Prezombie:
    ```
    The code phrase definitely fits, but I'm not convinced that it means that it was a coffee phrase for pathists and others on their side. The way it's phrased, I have a sneaking suspicion that it's an anti-pathist code, since the whole point is that a pathist makes the path.

    Yeah, when she came up, my first thought was "Wonder what she'd have to say about the festival."

    It didn't occur to me that she'd get... quite that personally acquainted with it.

      Which is weird because you'd think the local government would execute some poor dispossessed demonblood who nonbody likes, rather than a respected professor who works in an institution thats effectivley its own sovereign state

      - u/CouteauBleu:
        ```
        On the other hand, like Juniper pointed out, finding a convenient poor demonblood delinquent who happens to be in the region during the festival might be too hard if the demonblood are sufficiently rare.

    Agreed! I didn't even consider it, but now that it has been brought up, it feels like exactly the kind of red herring that the author would put in to make us scramble to argue about it. She didn't do it though! That would be waaay out of character, especially with her mild trauma from what the elf did to her, and their is no way she would think she could get away with it, if Bethel even heard a tiny breath of it, she would be somewhere between mince meat and dust in moments, Bethel already doesn't like her, giving her an excuse to act on that disliking by callosaly breaking Joon's trust like that, No, that is waaay not her.

  - u/eroticas:
    ```
    Before reading the thread *my* first hypothesis was that she really wanted Joon to snoop in her soul so he would see that she loved him without her telling him. But that would be out of character. I think her editing him to be more of a hero is totally in line with her character. 

    At the end of the day, the eerie narration surrounding it (Joon making note of the last thing he saw, etc) and the fact that Mary of all people rushed into a memetic hazard with no prep, consultation with others, or testing, *and* the unexplained loyalty boost when he consented, *and* the flash of disappointment followed by relief about the mustache, needs to be explained. I don't know what's going on but I feel that something is going on.

    Also the argument that she made his affection raise more is silly.

  What a great line. I was really tired when I read it, and had to go back to understand what exactly was happening.

  I liked how Mary's loyalty increase came about from kinda the inverse situation of the first night she and Jun traveled together. In that case he completely blew off "watching her back while she was asleep" to go play with his shiny new litrpg mechanics, whereas in this case his offer to watch her back was something she could count on.

  Which is maybe evidence that the loyalty increase mechanic is governed by his companions' thoughts rather than Jun's actions? Maybe it was Mary's recollection of Jun's initial unreliability contrasted with where they were in the present, and her recognition of the progress he'd made, that triggered this loyalty up. (Which is evidence for the Six-Eyed Deer being sapient, if true.)
  ```

  - u/JustLookingToHelp:
    ```
    That makes a lot of sense, and would explain why such a seemingly minor statement would create a loyalty increase.

    It might also be further evidence for the theory that Loyalty is not a measure of others' loyalty to Juniper, but *his* demonstrated loyalty to *them*.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      That would be a great inversion of the expected pattern and explains  why he can't "grind" loyalty. Since his own motivations mean he's not actually coming to like them more
      ```

  - u/HeckDang:
    ```
    I actually think that it happened because of the "Amy edited June's soul" theory, and him allowing her to mess around with his soul made him more trustworthy to her and her more loyal to him because she was editing him to be more to her liking.
    ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    I think maybe Joon is overthinking the significance of loyalty increases a bit. I think Grak had it right when they met: people just have a tendency to like each other more the more time they spend together.
    ```

  - u/Bowbreaker:
    ```
    Or her loyalty increased due to her expecting Joon to be more in alignment with her and generally more competent after she's done with editing his soul.

  A few things:

  * I really am trying to have chapters out a little more frequently and not just sit in my basement writing more without publishing them until they're in almost-too-big chunks like this. I'm just not doing a very good job. (For this one, I thought that the chapter that came immediately after these two would be best included together, but it would have probably been another week, which would have turned into another two weeks, and that's always what gets me into trouble.)

  * Special thanks to everyone who's put in work on [the wiki](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Worth_the_Candle_Wiki), which now has enough stuff on it that I can start reading it as a resource/refresher. If you'd like to contribute, [there's a channel on my discord](https://discord.gg/9htcTuc). (I don't have anything to do with the wiki myself, since it's one of those things that would eat into writing time too much.)

  * As always, thanks to everyone who [supports me on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/alexanderwales). I generally exchange that money for goods and services like food and healthcare.

    Was the burning man inspired by [this xkcd](https://www.xkcd.com/1582/)?

    The "what about multimages" question felt far too vague, it could have been interpreted in quite a few ways, and it felt a bit out of place.

    Asking if there were any common synergies would fit the response and topic far better, maybe mention how several volatile compounds can be detonated at range by even a novice.

  I bet that the 'twin-sister' girl was behind Joon's meditation guidance. Since she can control sounds, she could have replaced teacher's voice with her own made-up voice, and directed it to Joon alone.

  Discussion from the earlybirds chat touched on these points:

  Amaryllis edited Joon in some way when she was inocculating herself against the meme, with various small bits of evidence for this theory.

  Still magic should allow Joon to basically walk on air by freezing his feet or shoes and pushing off then. Would require some decent timing to use in combat, but would allow quite a lot of mobility if feasible.

  A mage circus idea would be pretty funny.

  Joon shoots down Valencia's comparison of S&S to Hogwarts, and then had a study session in which two guys and a girl write essays on magic, essays measured in inches, and the girl then criticizes the guys' essays because she's the "smart one".

  The Urquhart stone is named after the castle near Loch Ness.

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    I'd like to publicly register that I think Mary doesn't soulfuck Joon in this chapter. 80% confidence. 

    Couple reasons: Mary rightfully demands full disclosure of Joon, down to his erotic worldbuilding details. She also is a strong advocate of narrative. Opening up a narrative trap of this party shattering magnitude isn't NOT in character for Mary. There are meta-narrative reasons why she might be doing it, but the evidence weighs against.

    Joon's love for Mary flares when they are in close proximity? Thats not new evidence and happens all the time.

      > What's some of the evidence?

      I was skeptical at first, but search the chapter for Fenn and it starts to look likely:

      > Fenn and I,” my voice caught, even though I’d tried to steel myself, “We always talked about what it would be like for us to go to society balls with you, how much we would like stomping all over everything, and all the nobles would have to hold their noses, because we had superior firepower.

      And right after:

      > “Fine,” I said, still giggling. She just looked so serious, and then had that ridiculous mustache on. It was a little crooked, which just made the whole thing funnier. Fenn would have loved it, and for a moment, that thought wasn’t accompanied by regret and loss.

      > “She would have loved this, you know,” said Amaryllis.

      > “Yeah,” I said, and then I started laughing again, because she still had a mustache on her face.

      June was nearly unable to talk about Fenn but is laughing in the same sentence only a few paragraphs later.  Mary probably turned down the sense of loss.  The change might not even revert since it would happen naturally over time.

      The key is that Mary would have seen this as compassion, not manipulation.  I don't think Mary would make selfish changes for the many reasons outlined in other posts.
      ```

      - u/Fresh_C:
        ```
        I just wonder what the actual plan would be though. Since it's clearly stated that they don't touch each other often, these changes would just revert.

        Unless she also plans to simultaneously increase their amount of physical contact (which is certainly possible given the particular change that she made) then it wouldn't actually work long-term.

        I suppose that maybe repeated lowering of his already naturally diminishing grief would perhaps be easier to take hold in his soul than a change which wouldn't have happened naturally.

        edit: Also, doesn't it take a lot of concentration to mess around in someone's soul, especially considering she's only at half Joon's level? If she were going to do this multiple times Joon would likely notice what she was doing. And I don't think Mary is shortsighted enough to risk doing this only one time, when simply being patient would likely produce the same results.
        ```

        - u/691175002:
          ```
          I don't think the changes were as broad as some posts have speculated.  Manipulating Juniper into liking her would be absolutely insane - any change that robs Juniper of his agency would be a narrative death sentence.   
           Making Juniper more ambitious toes that line.  I'd rather the ambition and cheerfulness be a reaction to having Fenn's death lifted from his conscience.

          Assuming that Mary *only* helped get Juniper past Fenn's death, its possible that she gives Joon some time to enjoy the change then tries to talk him into maintaining it himself.

          I think there are also situations where the change is permanent (accelerating the natural process, or loyalty + spirit + soul) but Joon needs to find out at some point so all paths lead to the same endgame.

          Agency has been a recurring theme of the story, and this particular self-editing conflict developed in the time-chamber and has yet to be resolved.
          ```

          - u/Fresh_C:
            ```
            The idea that she did it knowing she'd soon tell him is definitely a lot easier to swallow. It makes more sense as a plan.

            Though I'm still not 100% convinced that Mary would risk something like that. Afterall, messing with someone's soul behind their back is a major breach of trust. Even if she did convince him to alter himself in the process, it's possible that the damage done once he found out would be way worse than what was gained.

            It just seems like a big gamble without much benefits. Especially considering that Joon was pretty obvious that he's still into Marry and just needed a little time.

            The risk/reward ratio seems all off on this one for someone who is as careful and calculating as Mary. But I suppose I could be wrong.
            ```

            - u/DaystarEld:
              ```
              I agree, I would be massively surprised if Mary did something so obviously stupid and self-defeating. Especially since she knows all she had to do is wait and not alter herself and they're almost literally fated to be together.

              I'm trying to think of circumstances that might accelerate her need to do this, and the only thing I can think of is she's insecure about Raven swooping in. But even that doesn't make something this extreme feel natural.

              - u/UPBOAT_FORTRESS_2:
                ```
                I am now in a mild panic about whether the following narrative arc is destined to occur:

                * Mary and Joon start dating
                * They have a fight
                * Raven comforts Joon and things get physical
                * Mary obviously finds out
                * Joon knits things together, possibly ...
                   * Obviously leaning on SOC, to his existential discomfort
                   * Overcoming his puritanical midwestern impulses
                   * An IRL flashback to his relationship with Tiff
                ```

                - u/DaystarEld:
                  ```
                  I mean in terms of showing personal growth, yeah, if Joon is put in a similar situation and learns from it, that would be pretty narratively satisfying.  But I think he's already shown many signs of that growth, and also Raven isn't Maddie on a number of levels that would make the situation less morally fraught.
                  ```

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      I personally think it was mostly fitting evidence to a theory, but specific things mentioned were how he started thinking rather positive thoughts about Amaryllis almost as soon as she touched him, how he isn't grieving as much for Fenn even when he thinks about her, and purposely not calling an athenaeum a college.

      Edit: college was crossed out in the earlybirds link to the chapter, but isn't on AO3. I'm assuming it just didn't survive the copy paste.

      > Also, you know, asshole teacher, teacher suddenly disappearing because they're arrested, main character doesn't know a ton about magic... Valencia is totally correct and will probably come up with some theory that ends up being way too relevant in retrospect.

      I don't think that that is as distinctively Harry Potter. They kinda fit, but they're not particularly unique to HP.

      Also, who's the asshole teacher here? Still mage lady is shady both figuratively and literally, but hasn't been an asshole, Mr. Handy is a soldier but not rude or anything, human dude is a stereotypical professor, and Ms. Horny was nice enough. I think there are HP parallels for each of them to different degrees, but I don't see any as an asshole.
      ```

      - u/Green0Photon:
        ```
        Eh, I was trying to add as many HP parallels as possible. Even though they weren't a teacher, but the person who prevented Juniper from listening to the lecture. It's the same sort of petty assholeness that Snape does, and both happen because of "personal" reasons, which is really them being annoyed for reasons the protag can't really help.

      ```
      I don't think it's completely implausible, I just don't think it's that likely. While the fawning over Mary directly after she touched him is a bit suspicious, he is twice the soul mage she is, it's a deep breach of trust on a number of levels, and he would likely reciprocate romance if she initiated it meaning there is little reason to risk all this when she doesn't particularly need to. I could see it if she modified him to be more disciplined, more goal oriented, but the risk reward for making him like her more through soul magic just doesn't make sense here.
      ```

      - u/Escapement:
        ```
        >I could see it if she modified him to be more disciplined, more goal oriented, but the risk reward for making him like her more through soul magic just doesn't make sense here.

        There's an entire paragraph where it basically implies she is doing that. From the story:

        >I found myself wondering what I was waiting for. Why hadn’t I tried to make a better case for myself? Why wasn’t I trying harder to be the person that she wanted me to be, especially if it was the person that I wanted to be too? Uther was my point of comparison, and while I didn’t want to be him, the things that he’d accomplished before leaving were so far beyond what I had managed to do that they seemed more like myth than reality. Amaryllis … left to her own devices in a parallel timeline, she had conquered as much of the world as she possibly could have, with only a slight bit of cheating. I wanted to be with her, whether as a friend or not, and I knew that if we were going to keep things copacetic between us, I would have to be more like her, more driven, more ambitious. I knew that I should be anyway, even if she wasn’t around.

        >I should have gone home and faced whatever terrible thing the Dungeon Master had planned for me there. 

        I think that Joon is likely going to evince no desire to closely look at his own soul to check that his values haven't changed or been forcibly altered - because that's probably the first thing Mary changed, before she did anything else. Right after that, she made sure his desires to see her own motivations / mind was less than his ethical prohibition against it (see later on, when he hits her mind and decides not to look at it b/c he's been made to view it as an invasion of privacy). If she was really cunning and clever, she might have hit tertiary desires. Like, make him want to be different (see paragraph excerpted above) and ease back on his worries about self-editing (which Mary has already been doing herself) so that he makes the direct major changes she wants him to make to himself - giving the other party members a plausible narrative and excuse for Joon's eventual major personality edits, that Joon himself will tell them, when Joon 'changes himself'.

              He wouldn't, but a DMPC doesn't necessarily share the same motivations as the DM. The DM is still trying to play a character, it's just that they designed the character to have a certain effect on the story. In this case, maybe the effect he wants is to have Joon realize that Mary tweaked his values at some point in the future and have him experience a sense of betrayal that he wouldn't have experienced otherwise. Betrayal is great for story-telling, and the DM wouldn't get that if he edited Joon directly.

        I think there's ways that wouldn't be a deep breach of trust, particularly given the implications that Amaryllis' interface is entirely unlike Joon's. At least, I think that was an implication? Joon sees something like expanded character sheets, but the other soul mage descriptions (as far as I remember) aren't like that.

        If someone reached into my mind and reduced my akrasia, I would probably go, "Oh! Good idea." That's one example. If I really go looking, I can find more - but basically, there are things in all (most?) of us that we are unable to do anything about - even to ask for the help of others - even if those things are small and otherwise unnoticed. 

        Amaryllis knows Joon really, really well. One of Joon's biggest issue is the issues he has with all of his issues. If she just poked something inside to let stuff flow and shift - well, I'd be in favor of that. And I can think of at least one thing Joon desperately needs but I think would never be able to ask for: Feeling like he can forgive himself for his mistakes.

        Or, to more clinical / SCP - some memes are parasitic (aka, harmful) and self-reinforcing (you believe that you should maintain the meme because you believe you should maintain the meme). Not only do you need outside help to deal with them, you literally cannot recognize, ask for, or accept that help.

          If I had the ability to lower my own akrasia I would just do it myself. If joon hasn't done it, it is because he doesn't want it done, and having it done secretly by Mary doesn't make it any better, even in hindsight (unlike the willingness-to-self-modify attributes, changes to that *would* seem sensible in hindsight).

      Isn't soul editing, by its very nature, temporary, though?  Part of the whole quest for Spirit magic was that Level Up kept creeping up Joon's list of priorities and having to be shut back down.

    Ohhh...

    I felt it was suspicious somehow and thought maybe Amaryllis suggested this foolhardy course of action because she was in a very roundabout way trying to get Joon to snoop around her soul and see that she had removed the Joon-love blocker. 

    But this explanation actually makes *much* more sense.

    Interesting that we all more or less independently found the whole scene suspicious. I also thought it was eerie how Joon focuses on the last conversation and sight he saw, as if he's not going to see them again.

    I wonder if Raven sensed Mary's intentions and that's the *real* reason she hesitates to let her alone with Joon, all romantic plots being a red herring.

        An ice cream truck is parked at the side of the street, a cheerful, subdued song winding from its speakers. It is a warm summer day, dappled with roadside shadows. You approach the ice cream truck. Inside is a burning man, clad in armour. He is swearing softly to himself he cleans the melted remnants of ice cream from his gauntlets with a sopping wet cloth. He looks at you, and his eyes are sharp, white, hot. "Just a second, please," he says. "I'll haunt you and fuck up your brain in a moment or whatever. I need to get this ice cream out of my armour or it'll be sticky for *eons*."

        The hazardous part is not necessarily the exact idea of a "burning man". The burning man could be a mere *expression*, a door or a seed, a small part of the larger entity which, if allowed, would channel or generate the rest of its being in the victim's mind. Potentially, it instead can be expressed as a broken lightbulb in the hallway, as a sick bird in a flock, as a slave-trading nation in an utopian world, as a dead pixel on your computer screen...

        In general, imagining "the wrongness of the world" as a concrete entity, focusing on it, putting it in a "calm" environment, potentially letting it interact with you mentally... That doesn't *sound* safe, if you're worried the Narrative is out to get you.

        Sure, it's probably safe now. But if r/rational gets trapped in a horror movie, many of us will probably die even *faster* than h-zombies, since we'll be too busy admiring the abomination.

        Long term meditators may experience a resurfacing of traumatic memories from the past, probably due to relaxation of defense mechanisms. It's called Dark Night of the Soul.

        In the even that happens, a practicioner is supposed to face those horrors the same way they faced their practice till now- with nonjudgemntal, calm awareness. While difficult (and requiring support from an expert), it's very cleansing.

  I recently reread the whole thing. I noticed a couple of things:

  - People on Aerb cannot see to the bottom of the hells. But Valencia can see all 9000? I would think that would make Mary and Jorge interested.
  - Mary never mentions Narrative with regards to her and Joons romance. But she is clearly thinking it. She wants to keep an unresolved romance thread going, this is the real reason she is sending such mixed signals (which is not like her). It seems like a solid plan to me.
  - Many parts of soul magic are excluded, like changing age. Joon says that most things that can be done with soul magic can also be done with spirit magic. Does that included the otherwise excluded changes? It seems like some good exploits Joon should examine. The fact that there are less users means that it may have less exclusions.
  - They promised to give the tattoo book back to the tatooist if he told them the truth - and he did. But Joon is still using it? (or maybe he just copied it)

  And a couple of less insightful observations:

  - They should harness Reimer to help think of exploits, luckily it looks they are going in that direction
  - When Uther & Raven found the woman in the wine barrel it was the medieval equivalent of women in fridges. And it was the DM saying that women will be in fridges either way. Ok, that was probably obvious to most people but I missed it up until now.

    She is getting scary. She's like an abused parent perpetuating the cycle of violence. And in her house they better not disagree with her verbally or even in their dreams because she is always watching.

    She has quite a poor moral position. She was abused and threatened by Uther and now she perpetuates the cycle of violence and threats by 10x. Sure there was a sexual component to Uthers abuse but she admits it didn't bother her in the slightest. 

    She felt abused by Uther and her solution is to kill, threaten, maim, torture etc everyone. She doesn't want honest apologies she wants submission and if she can't find the perpetrator she will find someone close to him. Then she can feel secure.

    In the beginning, she demanded they be on her side, not because she is in the right - overall shes not, since she wants them to overlook her own similar behavior but not Uthers. And not because they are friends - because at first, they were strangers. But just because of threats of violence.

    The sad thing is it works for her and has got her everything she ever wanted. Violence got Uther what he wanted, and now it's getting her what she wants which is tenants.

    What can they do about it though? Perhaps take her power away and show her they still want to live in her? That's assuming she has human psychology I guess.

  I'm looking forward to the character realization that delayed quests will continue to rise in difficulty while dropping in benefit.

  Twice now we have seen a quest be delayed untill it was forced. The first was the quest to meet other dream skewered. Which, if it had been done when Joon was weaker, would have been an infodump, with some helpful NPCs and a pile of very high level loot. But delayed, it became a high level encounter that cost a party member and required a lot of careful RP to get part of the previous reward.


  Next, finding the body's origin. If done early, Joon could have reconnected with people more easily, and maybe gotten effectively a actual rule book. But delayed, now trust issues abound and any information they do get must be coerced or bribed.

  The only remaining early quest is God Brother, where he is to meet one of the gods,and maybe join their ranks. Following the pattern, if done early he might have met on good terms, had his divine yada yada awakened by a god that viewed him as some kind of apprentice or lackey, or maybe even friend, but at minimum Ally. Now, he is a contender, any god on the hex is more likely to try to cut him off at the knees than help him.

    Also, Joon has a crapload of quests, he can't do them all at once. Some quest or other will always be delayed. He should prioritize companion quests, probably, if he knew how to even start the only one he got atm.

  Sorry just to help me understand Tiff's problem with the woman sword thing is that in her opinion gender is at the very least a continuum and as such a box will always be bad because the minuscule difference between the edges will never be justified.

  The same way a sword that say lit up when exposed to red light wouldn't work because the point where red stops being red is in some shaded area that no one can place.
  ```

  - u/Wereitas:
    ```
    I think Tiff is replying to an argument along the lines of "the sword lights up when touched by a woman, so 'man' and 'woman' are real ontological categories in this universe."

    The counter example, following your analogy, is that the sword isn't tapping into any "true" notion of redness.  It's just lighting up when exposed to light with wavelengths between X and Y.  Then the narrator describes that behavior as "lighting up with red light" because that's how people talk.

    So using the first sword to come up with an objective definition of gender is like using the second sword to find a true meaning of "red."  

    You're not leaning a "true" meaning.  At best, you're learning some swordsmith's implementation of his opinion of red.

    Like, it's possible that the particular spell used to light up on red will also light up on responsible to bursts of X-Rays because (magic technobabble here).  The correct conclusion is, "huh, that spell is buggy and weird" and not "X-rays are red in some deep and meaningful way."

    So, swords have a decision rule, but not an objective or privileged one.

  Joon struggling with those New Year's resolutions (or just being a rational decision-maker). He wants to take a step towards a nebulous future of godhood, but doesn't want to do quests to get there. Wants to meet the other Juniper and find out what his life was like, but doesn't want to "go home" and meet the doppelgangers. Wants to be a better person, but can't find true motivation since he's barely crawled out of the homeostasis of depressed, heel-Joon. Hopefully all the fan speculation of Amaryllis soul-editing Joon isn't true, or the moral of the story would be "seek pharmacological help." Which is further corroborated by his noticeable improvement in the interpersonal department after those SOC points, though I guess the more psychologically helpful moral would be to "seek help" in the first place and *want to be the change* he wants to see in himself or Aerb.

  P.S. Is it just me or is there a running theme of only being able to know/commemorate (dare I say memorialize) someone secondhand? Cypress, doppelganger Aerb-Joon, Arthur-as-Uther, Urquhart Stone-as-Uther, teenage-Arthur-via-vignettes.

But if we're getting into theological territory, there's no room for squeamishness in a would-be god. Besides what it reveals of his psychological readiness, I can't imagine him playing god better than the reigning DM when he hardly has any conviction to buckle down and do the less pleasant chores and choices that inevitably come with divine governance.

So there is, somewhere on Aerb, an unmapped exclusion zone, containing the remnant survivors of this first exclusion, who are even *smarter* than they were historically, and likely also fairly cranky about the whole thing.

    Placing my prediction here - Amaryllis altered Joon's soul values in chapter 146: 10%

    Amaryllis believes in narrative and that most/all secrets are going to come to light at some point; this would be a colossal mistake from that standpoint. Amaryllis is unlikely to be able to make any changes permanent as she lacks the Spirit virtue Joon received. Amaryllis is taking a huge risk that Joon doesn't just check his own soul and see the changed values. Amaryllis is risking all this to...make him more likely to complete a side quest? (Unless she can make permanent changes his ambition would revert back by the time any further quests are due to be underway and, honestly, the changes would revert back before this current arc is even done and the side quest is underway seeing as she would only be able to slightly modify his values if she wanted it to go unnoticed).

    The change of heart Joon has while Amaryllis is within his soul is also entirely plausible as a sign of character growth, helped along by the conversation he just had with Amaryllis and a desire to be the sort of person Amaryllis would respect, seeing as he has feelings for her.
    ```

    - u/Watchful1:
      ```
      Yeah, it just doesn't make sense personality wise. Why would Amaryllis just completely betray Junipers trust like that for a temporary change? Even if she was confident she wouldn't get caught, I think she respects him too much.
      ```

      - u/PHalfpipe:
        ```
        I think it's just too much temptation. I'm not 100% sure she did it, but if she sees five minutes of soul fuckery as the only thing standing between her and all her goals, ambitions and dreams than I think she might take that chance.

      I was skeptical at first, but after a second reading am convinced it happened.

      Before:

      > Fenn and I,” my voice caught, even though I’d tried to steel myself, “We always talked about what it would be like for us to go to society balls with you, how much we would like stomping all over everything, and all the nobles would have to hold their noses, because we had superior firepower.

      After:

      > “Fine,” I said, still giggling. She just looked so serious, and then had that ridiculous mustache on. It was a little crooked, which just made the whole thing funnier. Fenn would have loved it, and for a moment, that thought wasn’t accompanied by regret and loss.

      > “She would have loved this, you know,” said Amaryllis.

      > “Yeah,” I said, and then I started laughing again, because she still had a mustache on her face.

      Juniper was nearly unable to talk about Fenn but is laughing in the same sentence only a few paragraphs later.  Mary probably turned down the sense of loss.  The change might not even revert since it would happen naturally over time.

      There is additional evidence, the strongest being that Mary continuously brings up Fenn throughout the chapter. (Is she gauging his reactions?)  From a narrative perspective, June and Mary have already clashed on the topic of self-improvement without reaching an agreement so a revisit shouldn't be surprising.

      I do not think Mary performed any selfish changes, only what could be described as compassion.
      ```

  - u/HeckDang:
    ```
    80%

    Too many convenient pieces of evidence that are difficult to explain via other means, and the theory explains/resolves a number of details

    - the entire paragraph about suddenly wanting to be more like what Amaryllis wants him to be
    - explains why they hadn't tested on "D-class personnel" first (because Amaryllis didn't want to be immune to the meme so much as she wanted to soulfuck him and it was just the excuse she used)
    - the inexplicable loyalty level up makes sense if you consider she's more loyal to joon because she'll get to edit him more to her liking, or at least recognizing the unquestioning trust of him giving her free access to his soul without suspicion
    - her wariness when woken back up suggests she was worried she might have messed something up (joon laughing could have made her concerned that something she had done had caused it)
    - wanting privacy to do it, walking to get the plate when it wasn't necessary. Her hesitation and care and extra time taken when asking to get access to his soul and distracting him by mixing the request with a different topic that Joon himself recognized wasn't a debrief for the purposes of a quest and out of character since she doesn't generally talk about her past
    - brushing off Juniper asking whether they should consult Raven and invoking the narrative to persuade him to just do it because she knows he doesn't like talking about it
    - immediately being able to recall fenn without twinging when just prior to Amaryllis being in his soul he was
    - this line: "Back near the beginning, when we weren’t so close, I’d had some fantasies about Amaryllis, fantasies that I’d done my best to squash, and **fantasies that were returning, unbidden**." It is in her interests that Joon is more positive towards her, and the phrasing of "returning, unbidden" is pretty interesting.

And the manxome foe is slain by the vorpal sword in Lewis Caroll's poem. There's quite a few problems with taking it literally: it seems lazy, it could just be another false lead that can't actually permakill Fel Seed, does a vorpal sword entad even exist, how would they know a sword is *the* vorpal sword when the canonical sword has nothing to really distinguish it.

  Excellent stuff, as usual. Though it kinda clashed with my personal interpretation of the story, at one point:

  >Special Liaison on Existential Emergencies

  Wait what, this is an actual title that Amaryllis held? Like an actual job that makes sense, back in Anglecynn?

  Lets back up to Chapter 7, when Joon and Mary sit down and reintroduce themselves properly:

  >She held out a hand. “Amaryllis Penndraig, tenth of her name, Special Liaison on Existential Emergencies for the Kingdom of Anglecynn, long may it stand.”

  I thought this was a joke. An Amaryllis kind of deadpan joke, being a princess stripped of power. A "Well, I guess my job is guiding this madman around, now" kind of joke.

  With the setup being paid off in chapter 13, when Joon meets fireteam Blackheart:

  >“So who the hell is our mystery girl? ..." Asks Fenn.   
  >“Amaryllis Penndraig, Princess of Anglecynn, Special Liaison on Existential Emergencies,” I replied.

  Joon repeats without thinking about it - being a blithering idiot - and nobody moves to correct him, given the tense circumstances.

  I guess *that* explains why nobody moved to correct him. Huh.

  Edit: Wait. The joke still works, just on a higher level, I think? Now it's a cosmic kind of joke. Wales you cheeky madman.

  I’m onboard with the whole Mary editing Joon theory.

  Sure, it’s a breach of trust. It’s also Mary’s highest priority to save Aerb, and if it took killing Joon to do so (let alone editing him) then she would.

  There’re some more benefits to having Joon malleable to Mary: her worldly ambitions, for one; the well-being of the people she cares for; her personal well-being; and his well-being. I dare say Joon being a bit more focused and ruthless would make him significantly more useful as a tool for Mary.

  Also, there was a stark difference in how Joon felt towards Fenn before and after the editing. I’d say Mary edited his despair towards Fenn.

  Student council girl was really irritating. I don't agree with him not just calling her out. The professor would be quite pissed off, and it would weaken her ability to mess with him further. Who knows what he missed. 

  I'm also unconvinced that she wasn't actually in the meditation room with him editing his hearing to get him eaten by a memetic horror. The skeleton meditation was super creepy, well done.

  Man, that Tiff argument this time is some real r/badphil. There is nothing about "woman" that makes her argument special to the concept, so the argument applies to all things. Atoms aren't real, whether we call something an atom is just convention. The conceptual boundaries between what is and is not an atom is purely convention. Everything is convention and interpretation, there is no thing for which you can say that thing is real. You can't even say what is real is some undifferentiated uninterpreted mass of physics because "undifferentiated" and "uninterpreted" and "physics" are themselves conventional interpretations placed upon realty. Reality then becomes some thing about which nothing can be said.
  ```

  - u/lolbifrons:
    ```
    I think the point is that the variance of the plot of all conventions for defining the referent of "atom" is much smaller than that of the referent of "woman".

    "Woman" means different things to different people, and there's social baggage behind this ambiguity.  "Atom" tends not to have any of that baggage.
    ```

    - u/carminis_vigil:
      ```
      And on top of that, I think she was trying to argue that the sword's way to define "woman" should not be viewed as the "definitive" meaning of the concept. Which is something it could easily be viewed as since the sword was made by the DM, who in a TTRPG can in some sense be seen to have the power to define concepts.
      ```

    - u/alexshpilkin:
      ```
      Tiff’s argument irks me to no end, but we’ve also heard less of it than needed to actually engage with it; that is, I’m itching to scream “wrong!”, but I don’t actually know which of a couple possible weak points it actually has.

      This argument, though, now that’s something I can engage with.

      Not going to defend the atom analogy, as I don’t think it’s good either. The social baggage argument, however, looks wrong to me.

      Specifically, one doesn’t get to discard a notion because there’s social baggage attached to it, no more than one gets to discard a piece of physics because it was done by a Nazi, or a piece of medicine because it was discovered by making holes in people’s skulls. (If that helps, I also think that the measures described in _Delphic_ ’s “[_In re_ Stevens](https://delphicserial.com/2018/03/25/interlude-stevens/)” would, in the real world, be wrong and actively harmful to humanity, regardless of how depraved the real-world Dr Stevens were.) Yes, the baggage attached to “woman” is quite a bit heavier than being discovered by a Nazi, but the principle stands: one doesn’t abandon a piece of truth about the world because of social issues incidentally attached to it.

      The claim, then, would have to be that “woman” is a notion that does not represent a piece of truth about the world. That... would require a lot of justification, I think. My purpose here isn’t to argue one way or the other, only to point out that “has social baggage attached” would be orthogonal to such an argument. Still, here’s a list of other points against that wouldn’t work:

      * Pointing out that it’s not the ultimate truth: the test is having a relation to the truth, not encompassing it completely, otherwise progress would be stuck; in particular:
          - Pointing out that the boundary isn’t completely well-defined: something that’s true even, say, 60% of the time is still telling us something;
          - Pointing out that it conflates several things into one; the fact that they did get conflated also tells us something, even if realizing that there is in fact several separate things is extremely enlightening;
      * Pointing out that it’s a social construct: just because something exists in people’s minds doesn’t mean it’s not real (if possibly more mutable); how it got there is also bound to be an interesting topic.

      Note, however, that something being related to truth doesn’t have anything to do with it being related to morals, being suitable for usage in law, being suitable for a first introduction to the subject, and so on. These all need to be argued separately.

      Which brings me to another baffling (in-universe) thing about the original argument depicted in WtC, because whether a magical sword that classifies bearers into women and non-women is feasible in a particular or any fictional world, whether building such a world is a good thing to do, &c. are all good and non-obvious questions, while whether there exists a well-defined class of people that includes most people commonly called such and excludes most people not commonly called such... seems to be trivial, along with the fact that the _exact_ description of any such class would have to be long and not in any way simple.

      As to why I think u/yagsuomynona’s atom analogy isn’t of much use: the way it equates the subjective fuzziness of “woman” and “atom” only works against trying to categorically exclude any fuzziness at all, or any subjectivity at all, but not against trying to exclude unreasonably subjective fuzziness. *Atoms are not subjective*. If we admit physicalism and a fundamental mathematical model, an approximate formulation of that model, in a limited range of situations, as a model of weakly-interacting local degrees of freedom... is a thing that exists regardless of anybody’s idea of what they want to find in that model. (This needs qualification — in particular, we shouldn’t be speaking about a single formulation, but about a family of related formulations for different possible values of “approximate”, “limited” and “weakly”; but it is morally true.) That we currently suck at finding these formulations except by following our preconceptions doesn’t make them any less objective.
      ```

      - u/lolbifrons:
        ```
        I think you’ve misunderstood me here.

        I’m not arguing the social baggage around the concept of “woman” should _do_ anything; certainly not force anyone to discard the concept.

        Further, I’m pretty sure Tiff doesn’t know what she wants, other than to object to the notion that a magical sword can authoritatively tell someone who believes they’re a woman that they aren’t one.

        Trying to create magic that operates on non-reductive concepts in a reductive world is pretty inherently difficult.  Having to make authoritative statements about how _the magic_ classifies things is necessary in the same way that a decidable algorithm that doesn’t have a deterministic output is in most cases useless or even harmful to rely on.

        Reimer was right that there should, eventually, be a “way the sword works” and if you run enough tests you should be able to determine the algorithm.

        Tiff was right that the existence of that classification isn’t definitive, it’s just the magic’s interpretation among many many other interpretations.  That privileging it is dismissive, even harmful, to people without any real benefit other than disambiguation.

        Joon was right that creating such a magic item in your game is more trouble than it’s worth in more ways than just the difficulty of drawing hard boundaries around fuzzy things that have no attached social baggage.

        They were all right and all still arguing because they all cared about completely different things.

  >It was some other Reimer, essentially the same but from a completely different culture, and with none of the shared history. I wouldn’t have wanted the real Reimer, let alone this imposter. But if Lisi had sensed weakness and latched onto him, then he was a liability, and if he knew things about the previous version of me, then he was an asset. The only logical thing to do was to keep him close, as much as I didn’t like it.

  Juniper's reading of Lisi's intentions feels wrong.

  Let's look at Amaryllis's description of their friendship:

  >“Motivated friendship,” said Amaryllis as she started walking. “It wasn’t the first time, but it was definitely the least subtle. I don’t know what she thought I would get from her company, but she was abrasive in a way that I never found entirely appealing. We Penndraigs are destined for politics and governance from birth, but not all of us are suited to it, and Lisi … there’s a reason that she’s studying to be a combat mage instead of doing something a bit more prestigious. In another ten years, she’ll be a multimagus, but she’ll still be sitting outside of the traditional spheres of power within Anglecynn.”

  I think Lisi was abrasive to Amaryllis, and Amaryllis stopped being friends with her. Lisi was abrasive to other important Anglecynn royalty, and found herself shuffled off into a do-nothing position. Lisi regrets how her friendship with Amaryllis ended.

  I think Lisi is trying to improve herself. I think she's trying to strike a friendship with Reimer for the sake of improving her ability to make friends.

  With that, I'm going to register a prediction:

  Text: Lisi offers an apology to Amaryllis; Amaryllis judges the apology to be sincere.  
  Timeframe: I predict this will happen within two chapters.

    The good news is the updates tend to be pretty large. Think of it as being on a similar schedule to MoL, but with updates 5x the size.

  > Amaryllis held the glove out and a hand mirror popped into existence. She stared at her reflection for a moment, then looked back up at me with a raised eyebrow. “Really?” she asked. For a brief moment, she seemed disappointed in me, but then her eyes went down to the mirror again, and she cracked a smile. “You’re ridiculous,” she said. She gave me a skeptical look, then her eyes returned to the mirror again. “You didn’t even draw it right!”

  > “I didn’t want to spend a bunch of time on it,” I explained.

  > Amaryllis set the mirror down. “You know that this means retribution, don’t you? A Penndraig is not to be trifled with.”

  > “Wouldn’t be the first mistake I’ve made,” I said, smiling at her.

  > “She would have loved this, you know,” said Amaryllis.

  > “Yeah,” I said, and then I started laughing again, because she still had a mustache on her face.

  Death flag tripped, RIP Mary.

      It was a wholesome moment of reminiscing about a dead loved one, that is kinda death flaggy, but not excessively, no more than the more directed attraction that Joon has been showing towards her recently.

        I don’t think I’ve ever noticed reminiscing about a different dead person being a death flag.  In fact usually that’s a flag that the dead person is going to come into play in the story - that they’re going to find out something new and material about them or they put something in motion that would affect the main characters post mortem.

        If they sleep together, that’s a death flag.

          Bonding over helping one of the pair overcome loss is one of the oldest and strongest *romance* flags in fiction.
