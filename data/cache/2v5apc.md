  >Sasuke stopped chewing. “Dude… can you really not tell what’s going on?”

  >“What? Why? What’s going on?” Naruto asked.

  >“Man… for a smart guy, you sure can be blind sometimes,” he said. “It’s so obvious.”

  >“What is it? Just tell me.”

  >“She’s *obsessed with revenge.*”

  Clearly, romantic obliviousness is a ninja trait. There's an alternative theory for the rarity of ninja, right there.

    I actually, physically facepalmed at this line.

  - u/kaukamieli:
    ```
    It's just Sasuke baing obsessed with revenge himself, so he thinks it's natural.

    I laughed out loud at this revenge line. I was completely sure Sasuke had it right... But hey, maybe Sasuke is right and we are wrong! Would not be the first time this fic surprises me.

  ...Well, they're pretty screwed.

  EDIT: Also, Sasuke and Naruto talking about Hinata was *hilarious*.

    I may have missed something, how are they screwed? I would think Jiraiya/Tsunade are going to help Team 7?

      They're staging a preemptive attack so they don't get squashed by the Sannin "avenging Orochimaru."

  No one died this chapter?  That is the first death free chapter in what, like 5 or 6 chapters?

  Sasuke manages to be even more oblivious than Naruto.  That section was hilarious.

  > “Well I already told you how stupid that idea is, but I meant you should do something nice for her,” Sasuke said. “Something personal she can appreciate, you know? Like teach her a really deadly assassination technique.”

  Wow.  This topped off that little section perfectly.

  Kabuto is a pro:

  > Kabuto inquired about their familiarity with medical ninjutsu, while they walked. Naruto didn’t think it would be revealing too much to admit their ignorance, and on hearing his reply Kabuto offered to give the three of them some instruction in the basics, on the way.

  > He was really doing his best to be useful—Naruto could see why Orochimaru would have liked having him around.

  -

  > Naruto had planned to ask Kabuto to head back to Sound on his own once they’d arrived, so that the three of them could have some privacy to try out the new techniques, but Hinata’s lessons were going too well to interrupt.

  So Kabuto basically is continuously ensuring that they will find him useful.  He manages it such that they let him stay with them and he learns all the techniques that they take with them.

  > It seemed inconceivable that the Sannin would have been sent after a group of rogue chuunin. They must have somehow found out about Orochimaru. They were after him, personally.

  You manage to top the dramatic irony from canon knowledge almost every chapter.

  - u/Jello_Raptor:
    ```
    Why exactly was that dramatic irony?
    ```

    - u/scruiser:
      ```
      They've completely screwed up assessing the motivations of various characters in a way that is known to the audience (the part of the audience that knows the canon. I think that meets the [definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony#Dramatic_irony).

      In this case it is funny because they are assuming that the other Sannin most have been allies and thus are out to avenge Orochimaru and in no way have any interest in Naruto.  In fact, the other Sannin's are enemies of Orochimaru in canon (and likely in this fic too if they know the type of experiments he does) and Jiraya is personally interested in Naruto.

        >This type of irony is the device of giving the spectator an item of information that at least one of the characters in the narrative is unaware of (at least consciously), thus placing the spectator a step ahead of at least one of the characters. The [OED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OED) has:

        >>


        >the incongruity created when the (tragic) significance of a character's speech or actions is revealed to the audience but unknown to the character concerned; the literary device so used, orig. in Greek tragedy. 

        >According to Stanton,  dramatic irony has three stages—installation, exploitation, and resolution (often also called preparation, suspension, and resolution) —producing dramatic conflict in what one character relies or appears to rely upon, the *contrary* of which is known by observers (especially the audience; sometimes to other characters within the drama) to be true. In summary, it means that the reader/watcher/listener knows something that one or more of the characters in the piece is not aware of.

        >For example:

        >


        >* In *[City Lights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Lights)* the audience knows that [Charlie Chaplin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Chaplin)'s character is not a millionaire, but the blind flower girl ([Virginia Cherrill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Cherrill)) believes him to be rich. 

        >* In *[North by Northwest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_by_Northwest)*, the audience knows that Roger Thornhill ([Cary Grant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cary_Grant)) is not Kaplan; Vandamm ([James Mason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mason)) and his accomplices do not. The audience also knows that Kaplan is a fictitious agent invented by the CIA; Roger (initially) and Vandamm (throughout) do not. 

        >* In *[Oedipus the King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_the_King)*, the audience knows that Oedipus himself is the murderer that he is seeking; Oedipus, Creon and Jocasta do not. 

        >* In *[Othello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello)*, the audience knows that Desdemona has been faithful to Othello, but Othello does not. The audience also knows that Iago is scheming to bring about Othello's downfall, a fact hidden from Othello, Desdemona, Cassio and Roderigo. 

        >* In *[The Cask of Amontillado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cask_of_Amontillado)*, the reader knows that Montresor is planning on murdering Fortunato, while Fortunato believes they are friends. 

        >* In *[The Truman Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Truman_Show)*, the viewer is aware that Truman is on a television show, but Truman himself only gradually learns this. 

        >* In *[Romeo and Juliet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romeo_and_Juliet)*, the audience knows that Juliet is already married to Romeo, but her family does not. Also, in the crypt, most of the other characters in the cast think Juliet is dead, but the audience knows she only took a sleeping potion. Romeo is also under the same misapprehension when he kills himself. 

        >Tragic irony is a special category of dramatic irony. In tragic irony, the words and actions of the characters contradict the real situation, which the spectators fully realize. The [Oxford English Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary) has:

        >>


        >the incongruity created when the (tragic) significance of a character's speech or actions is revealed to the audience but unknown to the character concerned, the literary device so used, orig. in Greek tragedy. 

        >[Ancient Greek drama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_of_ancient_Greece) was especially characterized by tragic irony because the audiences were so familiar with the [legends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend) that most of the plays dramatized. [Sophocles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophocles)' *[Oedipus the King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_the_King)* provides a classic example of tragic irony at its fullest. Colebrook writes:

        >>


        >Tragic irony is exemplified in ancient drama ... The audience watched a drama unfold, already knowing its destined outcome. ... In Sophocles' *Oedipus the King*, for example, 'we' (the audience) can see what Oedipus is blind to. The man he murders is his father, but he does not know it. 

        >Further, Oedipus vows to find the murderer and curses him for the plague that he has caused, not knowing that the murderer he has cursed and vowed to find is himself. Irony has some of its foundation in the onlooker's perception of [paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox) that arises from insoluble problems. For example, in the [William Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare) play *Romeo and Juliet*, when Romeo finds Juliet in a drugged deathlike sleep, he assumes her to be dead and kills himself. Upon awakening to find her dead lover beside her, Juliet stabs herself with a dagger thus killing herself.

  [Written Before Reading]:

  Yay! This is totally the chapter where Team 7 takeover Sound smoothly and painlessly and reform it into a Rationalist Utopia where no one dies, ever, right?

  [Written After Reading]:

  Well, no butchery. Surprised that both surviving Sannin are being introduced so quickly. I have to think this is just them having become aware of Naruto and the shenanigans that are going in and around Leaf and coming to support him. At least, that makes sense for Jiraya. Tsunade is less clear. I'm not sure if she was in on Naruto being Minato's son in canon. Gonna be harder to conceal their presence in Sound from Leaf than Team 7's, though, if that's the case. Makes me wonder how exactly the Sannin tracked them to Sound, given that Leaf's dispatch suggests that Leaf doesn't know they're there.

  Pein "Nighting" Akatsuki seems a little weird, but if he's being setup as a foil to Naruto, each taking control of Mist/Sound in their own way, I guess it makes sense.
  ```

  - u/kaukamieli:
    ```
    My theory is that Kabuto knows Jiraya, as he had his card. Kabuto noticed Naruto has the beast and contacted Jiraya to do some sealwork, telling him Naruto killed oro and has the village now. That's why Jiraya got Tsunade easily with him.
    ```

- u/eaglejarl:
  ```
  What big good-guy canon characters are left at this point?

  * ~~Hokage~~
  * ~~Kakashi~~
  * ~~Gai~~
  * ~~Neji~~
  * ~~Sakura~~
  * ~~Shino~~
  * ~~Kiba~~
  * Naruto
  * Hinata
  * Sasuke
  * Shikamaru
  * Chouji
  * Rock Lee
  * Jiraiya
  * Tsunade
  * Kurenai
  * Tenten
  * Gaara
  * Temari
  * Gaara's brother whose name I don't remember

  Anyone else?  I know Pein and Akatsuki are alive, I'm looking for the hero types.  Did I miss any of the above being dead?  This list was done mostly from memory.

    > Gaara

    Actually, with Naruto's Battlefield Psychology, Gaara is a Complete Monster (literal) Blood Knight. 

    With the crapsackness of this world, it's possible he's actually possessed by his tailed beast already. Perhaps their mental acuity is inversely proportional to their power, explaining why the Nine-Tailes is prone to trickery and dumber than Naruto.

  ### [Written before reading]:

  Hmm, I have no clue what I'd do in their position. It comes off as a little too trusting for this environment but something like the following is probable: 

  Naruto: Kabuto, we need to talk. 

  Kabuto: Ok. 

  N: What do you want? Other than me not killing you that is. 

  K: <Says things> 

  N: <Sees how it can fit into plan for world optimization> 

  #### With some pre-planned side jaunts: 

  N: You can see why despite fear being a wonderful motivator. I would rather have someone like you on my side because they want to be.

  and 

  N: That technique that I used to kill Orochimaru is a dead man's switch. Do anything that would otherwise kill me and it would automatically activate. Do anything that might kill my teammates and I will activate it. However I don't like to use as it erodes my will to want to keep other people alive. If I use it too much, I will want to literally kill everyone.

  N: In that state I will have enough power that you'd need an entire army to stop me. Additionally, I become more intelligent and ruthless in that state. Knowing this makes you a threat to the psychopathic version of me, and as soon as I urn psychopathic I will find you, every Kage, and every administrator of note, and kill them well before anyone notices that I might be a problem. That way the chance of any group raising the army that would be needed to defeat me is radically dropped, and I can proceed to exterminate the human race at leisure. 

  N: The me of now does not want to do this, but rest assured that I will as soon as that dead man's switch strips me of any semblance of care for the lives of others. It is in your interest to keep me alive, and help me gain power so that others can't kill me. Likewise it is in my interest to give you what you want as there are costs to my use of that power, and there are many instances where the costs of my deference to you will be less than the cost of activation. 

  I expect this tactic to backfire horribly, but i'm not sure how. A lot depends on Kabuto's goals. 

  Also, holy crap, rereading that dialogue makes me keenly aware of why I'm not a writer. 

  ### [Written as Reading:]

  Finally, Nuruto is creating backups, I hope he sends some to Jiraya for training. I'm quite curious how this one differs from the one in canon. 

  Oh god, Hinata's life is hell. However, I love how what Sasuke says makes perfect sense given his life experiences and a perfectly reasonable case of "extrapolating from a single data point". 

  Oh hey, the Sannin are here. Wonder what they want. I'd expect that if they run the Sannin could catch up (Even if they couldn't kill Naruto). So my best bet, would be to send susuke and hinata away with a clone, and go to talk to the Sannin.
  ```

  - u/Jello_Raptor:
    ```
    Ahh, I thought of some failure modes for my plan: 

     - Kabuto would immediately realize Naruto is a jincuuriki, and know that there are others capable of resealing him.
       - This means that he knows Itachi is after Naruto
       - Similarly he'll be on the lookout for the knowledge to reseal a tailed beast, and have a way to defeat Naruto in the near future. 
       - He does *not* know about the backup shadow clones, so he will be less wary of trying that too early. Though he may very well suspect it. 
     - Sasuke is much less powerful than Sasuke + Orochimaru. He could be caught out in a lie easily enough.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Would this story make any sense for someone who's not familiar with canon Naruto?
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Mostly, I think.  Basically everything I know about Naruto is from fanfiction and it's working for me.  The one thing that isn't covered is the starting point; it's not much of a spoiler, since it's the start of canon as well, but I'll tag it anyway:

    Naruto is the dead-last in the academy, the complete screwup.  He fails his final exam, so he can't become a ninja.  [At that point, ](#s "Mizuki, one of the teachers at the academy comes to him and says "There's an extra-credit assignment which, if you can do it, will let you graduate.  Break into Hokage Tower, steal the Forbidden Scroll and bring it to me at midnight."  Turns out that Mizuki is a spy from another village; when Naruto steals the Scroll, Mizuki shows up intending to steal it and kill Naruto.  While waiting for Mizuki to show up, Naruto read the Scroll and learned one of the techniques on it:  the shadow clone.")  

    I think everything else important is covered in the text.

      That should be established in ch1, or did you mean it was unclear?

        ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        *goes back and re-reads*

        Nope, actually, it's fine. For whatever reason, I remembered it as having skipped that part and just started from the point after it was over. Never mind; nothing to see here, move along.
        ```

- u/Anderkent:
  ```
  Holy fucking shit [!?](#s "no one died!?")
  ```

- u/kaukamieli:
  ```
  Waaait, 3 foreign ninja? Who is the third one with Tsunade and Jiraya?
  ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    We don't know yet. That's part of the cliffhanger. But I think it's Tsunade's apprentice, Shizune.

    As the weakest member of the trio, I bet that Naruto plans to kill her first, which would make Jiraiya and Tsunade to change their minds from helping to murdering Naruto. Let's hope his plan fails and that they are really there to help him.
    ```
