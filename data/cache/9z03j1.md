  The munchkining of powers continues. Throughout the last few chapters one thought has been most prominant.

  NOW YOU'RE THINKING WITH PORTALS
  ```

  - u/Agnoman:
    ```
    I'm waiting for Cat to just straight up cut people in half with her gates. Since chapter 67 we've seen a bunch of times that she can form a gate passing through the middle of objects, and that this ends poorly for the objects, and here we've just seen how quickly she can open gates... using the ol' [portal cut](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalCut) seems like an obvious conclusion.

    Unless Cat for some reason can open portals through solid stone but not through people, I guess (which might be the case, I don't know. Honestly my mind is still reeling from the reveal that Cat's portals could apparently cut things this entire time).
    ```

    - u/ahd1903:
      ```
      Yes, she can. The last time was in the middle of the  Spellblade, which is how she preoccupied him enough to violence him properly.
      ```

      - u/Agnoman:
        ```
        Right, I forgot that section because, honestly, I have gone back to Cat's overly comicated plan there since we skipped the actual climax of it all.

        But it's worth noting that there's a lot of weirdness going on there. For one, the Spellblade wasn't actually cut in half by the gate, like everything else we've seen have a gate formed in the middle of it. (Which is actually the strategy I'm talking about / the new ability of Cat's I was surprised by).

        Now, whether that's a rule about "no cutting living/undead people" or "no cutting the Spellblade in particular" is hard  to say, because the Spellblade in general interacted with weirdly, and so did the locale where they fought him.
        ```

        - u/tavitavarus:
          ```
          The reason the Spellblade wasn't cut in half was because he was an elf, and he decided he was ok. Elves can decide to ignore one Creational law at a time. We first saw that in the Book 2 Epilogue, when two elves simply decided that no one would be able to see them, and so they were completely invisible.
          ```

        - u/ahd1903:
          ```
          Elves get to ignore one rule of Creation at a time. 

          In this case, Cat was quite intent on cutting the Spellblade in half with a gate, and he was overriding the rule that says gateways do that when opened within people. 

          But *while* he was doing *that*, he couldn't do the other OP rubbish.
          ```

          - u/Agnoman:
            ```
            Yeah, I think we can write that one up to Elvish bullshit like you/tavitararus said But now I want to know why Cat hasn't been using this tactic against all her opponents who *can't* control the laws of physics. 

            Opening and closing portals that cut  opponents in half, and doing so faster than superhuman Drow can react to, seems like the most efficient way kill anyone who doesn't have the kind of bullshit to counter this.
            ```

            - u/ahd1903:
              ```
              Sheer lack of clue. Clue is slowly trickling in. This is barely two decades of life experience, without even a complete apprenticeship as a Named. But the thought of not being a girl from the mean streets of Laure is sinking in. 

              (And /u/ErraticErrata won't let Cat think of looting anything more significant than a language or two from Akua to compensate for the gaps in her education.)

              Also, luck; if Cat had cluelessly flashed around portals that much, one of the Mighty with the Fry Lacusomancer secret would have used it.

    You took the comment I wanted to make and made it better
    ```

- u/TideofKhatanga:
  ```
  Cat has evolved past fighting everything with a sword. Now she fights everything with two lakes and a drow. Much better.
  ```

- u/IgnatiusFlamel:
  ```
  Lakeomancy for the win!

  All hail Catherine Foundling, Calernia's foremost lakeomancer!
  ```

  - u/ahd1903:
    ```
    Lacusomancy, please. (:
    ```

    - u/notagiantdolphin:
      ```
      If you use Lacusomancy, Ubua wins.
      ```

      - u/ahd1903:
        ```
        Oh, good.
        ```

      - u/CouteauBleu:
        ```
        Yeah, but if you don't use the proper term, you're going to make Masego sad :(

        (plus lacusomancy sounds so much better)

  >No, Catherine Foundling had no place at that table. But maybe the Back Queen did.

  Is this some weird pun I'm not getting?
  ```

  - u/BaggyOz:
    ```
    It's not a pun. She's just saying the girl she was wouldn't have a seat at the proverbial table but the Black Queen does with a typo thrown in.
    ```
