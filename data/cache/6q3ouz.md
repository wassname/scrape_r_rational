  Okay, this is *really* good. I was honestly not expecting it, but you're weaving in a hell of a lot of amazing things. I'm particularly digging the emotionally-deep RPG group asides; they're managing to be commentary of life and plot at the same time. That's really well done, sir.

  Also, mad props for the rationalism of the main character - well, of all the characters so far. They feel really real; I can feel them thinking in every interaction. Joon particularly is a nice balance of "wanting to freak out", "if freak out then die", and "discomfortingly familiar".

  > This is a self-insert litRPG portal fantasy, loosely based on my personal experience of falling into a portal to another world and discovering that I had a character sheet attached to my soul.

  Another week, another four chapters, so if you were one of those people who doesn't read serials when they first start, you'll be pleased to know that it's up to 44K words now, long enough that *things* have actually *happened* (and [here's a link to chapter 1](http://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126), my personal preference on where to start).

  Edit: Also, one of my favorite features of AO3, the [entire work](http://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249?view_full_work=true) link so you can read the whole story in a single page load.

  It also is starting to seem more and more of a bad idea to actually teleport to civilization, what with the potential dissection waiting him. But also because things seem to be getting harder not easier as time goes on and effort is piled up. Like, if he could get some way to get food and water, then his original plan of just grinding seems hell of a lot better then what's going on right now.

  Seems like it's time to nope out of here. Particularly if leveling up cures hunger! Shame about the soulcycle, though maybe you can replace that rubber hose.

  I found an error in the eighth chapter when he accesses settings.

  The setting table appears after the line

  > The problem was, the stats werenâ€™t exposed.

  instead of being after the word/line "SETTINGS" which is more sensible and won't be as immersion breaking.

  {insert incredibly positive review}

  I'll post a more thought out review when I'm not feeling less like I'm coming down with the plague, but I really like this.

  ```
  Well, I'm hooked.

  I'd explain why, but /u/narfanator already said everything I want to.

  I like it.

  One thing; it's mentioned that food scarcity is a major issue, and that this has resulted in survival rates dropping a great deal. I assume this means that eating zombies isn't a good idea? 

  There's also cannibalism, but other humans appear to be much rarer than zombies, especially as time goes on. You'd have to be pretty sociopathic to immediately kill someone and then haul their carved-up corpse along with you as food.
