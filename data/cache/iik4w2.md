  I read your story, and while I find the premise interesting there are some serious flaws. If you want a more detailed review I can post one, but I think you need to reread and edit your story carefully. Be especially careful about run-on sentences, and try to make the dialog flow better.

  As for this being a rational story, so far it seems like you're going in the opposite direction. There's a huge *Deus Ex Machina* in your first chapter, which doesn't really bode well.
  ```

- u/Blaiselle:
  ```
  Summary: 
  A dungeon core, a quasi-divine tool that can make or break empires and challenge the gods themselves.

  Busar√≥n, a remote island whose few inhabitants had been forgotten by the world. 

  A necromancer brings them together, starting a series of events that even the makers themselves wouldn't have imagined.
  ```

  - u/MimicSquid:
    ```
    Rather than just copying the summary, can you explain what makes this rational or rational adjacent? Some explanation of how rationality is a central element?
    ```

    - u/Blaiselle:
      ```
      The story is going to be a hard fantasy rationalist take on both the "Dungeon Building" and "Kingdom Building" genres with an emphasis on trying to avoid a lot of the less rational tropes associated with this kind of story (Like having a single character knowing a ridiculousy amount of information on how to make different marvels of engineering or simply not bothering to explain the different mechanics on how a dungeon would work).

      The story will also have a strong emphasis on characters developing their rational thinking skills in order to survive on an island with very limited resources.
      ```
