    That's La Morte Normale. La Grande Morte requires something of Shia scale, or maybe even a kiloHitler. Possibly followed by La Morte Totale if AW is not feeling generous.

    Could you explain what "La Grande Mort" mean? I couldn't understand the reference after several minutes of googling...

      ```
      omg yall suck at explaining

      "Le petite mort" means "little death", is french euphemism for orgasm, *and, also important to explain*, when he first gave Fenn an orgasm the DM hit him with an in game achievement called "la petite mort", making him highly uncomfortable.

      So now, it would make him even madder for the dm to write "the big death".
      ```

        Be pretty funny if he got a 1/7 achievement for getting Fenn killed. One Down, Six to Go!

      ```
      Le petite mort is a small death and a orgasm
      ```

      - u/Rouninscholar:
        ```
        To add, in case he doesn't know "Le petite mort" literally means "The small death" but is frequently used to mean orgasm (Don't know if it is the actual translation or a euphemism).
        "La Grande Mort" would mean "The big death"

        Joon got a "Le petite mort" after the first time they had sex.

  Blegh, sorry about the delay on these. I found them particularly hard to write, mostly because of the emotional load. *Hopefully* things will be a little faster going forward, but I don't like making promises, so I won't.

  The worldbuilding doc is still being written, in case you were curious about that; the current outline I'm filling in has sections for Magic (~26 varieties), History (pre-Imperial, three empires, two inter-imperiums), Geography, Races (~140), and Cosmology. If you have anything else you think is must-include, let me know (the big one, Gods, is probably going to be written and then left out until/unless they appear in the story, since I don't want spoilers for things that haven't appeared in the text).

  - u/jaspercb:
    ```
    If it could be done without spoilers, I'd really enjoy a summary of some of the exclusion zones we haven't seen. Maybe that falls under Geography.
    ```

  - u/Bowbreaker:
    ```
    This was definitely emotionally heavy. Having lost someone relatively recently I could identify with a lot of Juniper's thoughts and it wasn't pleasant. It was definitely worth reading though. Thank you.

    Regarding the world building doc, I think exclusions and events related to them are a must-include. And Athenaea, though I guess those could be considered part of the magic section. I'd also enjoy entries for the most important/impressive Entads. And maybe something about cultures separate from races, what with the more numerous ones having multiple disparate nations, not to mention the existence of multi-racial cultures.

    Edit: Entads, not enters.

    ```
    > Blegh, sorry about the delay on these.

    I think we all appreciate that you take the time to do them right.

    (Even though I was the one on discord asking for a nano-update because I was jonesing...)

    > Races (~140)

    Oh man. Sounds like a tome.
    ```

  - u/Agnoman:
    ```
    Perhaps obviously, I think the main criteria for what's in the doc should be things that you already know about and things you're interested in writing.

    But in terms of this game *I'd* like to see - which is admittedly somewhat different from what's a "must-include" - most of it relates back to the people of the world. Who lives where, what the cultural quirks and values of different groups looks like, where and why the alliances and tensions between people lie, who's producing what and who are they trading it with, how the power structures and politics are set up, the vibes of different cities, etc. Etc.

    As a general rule I personally find, say, the effects of a magic system on the society and the setting as interesting if not more than the exact rules of the system.

    - u/adgnatum:
      ```
      I am going to divide that into two claims, that (a) her emotions were not like that and (b) she understood how her statement might rouse him.

      Based on everything about the mental affliction imposed on her by the Crown, I think (a) is false. Claim (b) is probably true though.

    The dream was actually the first time I got truly broken out of my SoD in this story. No way does someone witness a coherent debate in a dream about something that still seems interesting and is logically followable after waking up.
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      The point of fantasy writing isn't the exact content, but how it makes you feel. The dream makes you feel like you're listening to a sensible discussion, which is what Joon would feel like in the dream, so it fulfils its purpose. A more "realistic" dream wouldn't make you feel like joon felt, and therefore would fail at its purpose.

      It's kind of like how all speech in novels is heavily stylized-- it's unrealistic, but without body language and shared context, it does a better job of conveying what actually happens than actually including all the stuttering and stumbling and inspecificity even high-charisma people do.
      ```

      - u/Bowbreaker:

  ```
  Goddamn, Valencia makes it so freakin' difficult to parse what's truth and what's lies even when she's not using any devils. This chapter she told Amaryllis she doesn't love Joon, despite that little conversation she had with him back in chapter 77-

  >‚ÄúToo easy to see the paths in front of me, too hard to know which one to go down,‚Äù said Val. ‚ÄúNone of the parts and pieces help me make sense of who I am or what I feel.‚Äù She looked up at me. ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI know that you don‚Äôt love me back yet, and Amaryllis says that‚Äôs just misplaced attachment, something that I‚Äôm going to have to find a way to get over, but she has her own issues with you, so I don‚Äôt know how good her advice is.‚Äù

  So now I have no idea if Valencia is simply lying to Amaryllis, or if she's lying to *herself,* or if she's actually just grown past her fixation on Juniper.

  Also, absolutely fantastic work by the author here. I was so caught up in the flow of emotion these last two chapters that I was actually getting frustrated that Juniper wasn't lashing out and hurting someone. I was emotionally primed for violence just from the specter of grief I got following Juniper's thoughts, so his own display of self-control in his conversation with Valencia was all the more impressive given how much more powerful his own desire to pass off some of his pain to others must have been.
  ```

  - u/thepublicinternet:
    ```
    That's the tricky part of Valencia. If you lived your whole life getting instant mastery-level insight of physics, for instance, even when you shut it off you're going to be pretty good. Checking she isn't using a soul to help just shows she isn't making up new lies or mega-analyzing new situations. 

    This is part of why Juniper was wise to insist on a total blackout of her looking at him with those skills. Hard, falsifiable rules are how you build trust with socially challenged people (which this is, I mean, plusses and minuses to it, but not being able to be sued is a legal problem too - who would do business with someone like that? - invulnerability isn't so great for trust).

      I don't think she ever got devil abilities until she started eating them - which is to say, post-Joon.

          Not the thoughts of a devil. Also, the devils would likely torture and deceive *her* as much as anyone else.

          Actually, is that the case? I mean, non-anima can't be magically healed, so surely there would be a ton of permanent self-disfiguration on Valencia caused by devils if that were the case, right?
          ```

          - u/LupoCani:
            ```
            It wouldn't be standard operating procedure, since Infernals wouldn't want non-anima to be easily identifiable. They might make an exception for exceptionally poor vectors like pre-jailbreak Valencia, but don't appear to have done so.
            ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:

      I'm curious. We're the skills of the human soul she ate of any use to her during that confrontation?

      - u/xamueljones:
        ```
        There are a lot of souls being mass-produced and therefore wouldn't have any skills at all. So I assume that she ate one of those generic souls.

      There's also the part where she's wrong in her analysis about everything but the results of whatever manipulations that particular soul excells at.

  This story is really incredible. The characters feel real in a way that I don‚Äôt get from other stories. And I love the loss that happens. While it‚Äôs really sad that bad things happen to people we want to be happy, the realism is so essential to a good story. 

  Thanks for writing!

  So the latest chapter has Arthur alive after the premiere of 'Captain America: Civil War' (April 2016). After his death, Joon grieved for *months*. WtC began in mid-2017.

  We're closing in on the actual timeline, assuming it's not dynamic.
  ```

  - u/russxbox:
    ```
    I don't know that we can say that for sure, since that scene was a dream sequence that also involved Fenn and the Dungeon Master. It's possible that the first part of the conversation was an exact replay of a memory, but I wouldn't call it certain enough to say it helps nail down the timeline.
    ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      What we do know though is that June must have, at the very least, seen trailers of that movie before going to Aerb, even if it may have been after Arthur's death.

        The dream sequence contains no information about the movie other than it's title, which [was announced in October 2014](https://www.newsarama.com/22573-marvel-announces-black-panther-captain-marvel-inhumans-avengers-infinity-war-films-cap-thor-3-subtitles.html).

  Trying to figure out what's going on with Valencia is really interesting.

  On the one hand, Valencia deciding to break Joon and Fenn up because she can see all the flaws in their relationship is very reasonable.  It's a perfect instantiation of what we know about how devils see the world, and it's subtle enough to be plausible.

  On the other hand, everyone in-universe seems to have so much respect for the ability of devils to manipulate people, that it seems really hard to believe that Valencia didn't know Joon would be super suspicious of her therapy breaking him and Fenn up, even before Fenn's death.  I think there's still a real possibility that we haven't gotten the full story.

  (Also, Joon burning Wisdom and *actually acting like a wise person as a result*, at least for a few paragraphs, was wonderful from both a narrative and emotional perspective.  Forgiving Valencia had a biggest emotional impact of the update, at least for me.)
  ```

  - u/xachariah:
    ```
    If Fenn didn't get killed, then there would have been a little suspicion on Joon's behalf, but nothing a devil couldn't manipulate her way out of.  (Especially if Val's plan was to swoop in as a romantic partner, which I still think is the case regardless of what she said to Mary.)

    It's just that Fenn's death knocked the whole plan off the rails, so now that it's impossible the plan just looks stupid in retrospect.

    That I can recall there don't seem to be many permanent immunities available in the setting. Valencia has a fair number thanks to what she is, but then that also has social drawbacks and probably isn't duplicable  by others. 

    That seems to leave things that can be done with forms of magic we don't understand well yet, things that can be done with entads that are theoretically accessible by the party, and temporary immunities used alongside methods of knowing when to use them ahead of time.
    ```

    - u/xachariah:
      ```
      Well, there's one path...  We know that Fel Seed is so invincible he can't even be *theoretically* beaten by anyone other than Joon.  

      Joon knows Fel Seed's power, and per chapter 114, Joon's defining trait is that he can use excluded magic outside of an exclusion zone.  It's probably really^really^really evil to use so that makes them a non-option, but Joon has a direct line to literal invulnerability if he really wants it.
      ```

      - u/CouteauBleu:
        ```
        > Joon's defining trait is that he can use excluded magic outside of an exclusion zone

        What?

        EDIT: Oh, you mean when he wished for a hot dog?

        > ‚ÄúYou used an excluded magic outside the exclusion zone,‚Äù said Pallida. The pink of her skin had gone somewhat pale. I glanced at Grak, and he shrugged. Apparently, he hadn‚Äôt known that.

        I'm not sure it means Joon has exclusion-bypassing powers. I think it's just a one-off thing with the wishes.
        ```

        - u/WarningInsanityBelow:
          ```
          Joon also had a gestalt skill outside of its exclusion zone (Deception see chapter 64) , though he couldn't keep it. This is second instance of some Joon/exclusion-zone weirdness going on, and potentially worth investigating, though I think saying he can flat out ignore exclusions is probably jumping to conclusions.

  > ‚Ä¶ only if you wrote them like I did, you called them suicide notes instead.

  This seems pretty significant. June wrote suicide notes. Before coming to Aerb. Where the only other person to go there apparently died before doing so.

  June's struggle with Fenn's death, and the way he lashed out at his party, was both hard to read and really well done. I feel like the implication made by the above casts a lot of his actions in a new light.

  Was there any hint of suicide earlier on?
  ```

  - u/Fresh_C:
    ```
    I'm pretty sure June actually said that he tried to kill himself somewhere in an earlier chapter.

    He's never told this to anyone, but he said it in narration.

    Yeah, I also noticed that Arthur went to Aerb after apparently dying, but Joon was apparently just sitting in class. I've always wondered if there was more to it, like that Joon committed suicide (but doesn't remember it, maybe because he's built using a brain snapshot from a few hours before).

    And yes, I'm pretty sure Joon mentioned considering suicide or trying to kill himself in an earlier chapter, but I don't remember where.
    ```

    - u/MuonManLaserJab:

      > I've always wondered if there was more to it, like that Joon committed suicide (but doesn't remember it, maybe because he's built using a brain snapshot from a few hours before).

      If that's the case, then if Joon had refused to take the DM's offer and go to Aerb he probably would have just... stopped existing, since on Earth he was already dead.
      ```

      - u/tjhance:
        ```
        Yeah although it's interesting that... Joon is really gung-ho about existing, now, even near the very beginning of the story. Doesn't quite line up with having been suicidal beforehand. Not sure what to make of that.
        ```

        - u/Sarkavonsy:
          ```
          Eh, I've been suicidal before, but even then I always planned to sign up for cryonics and genuinely wanted to live as long as possible. I don't get it either, but it's totally a thing that can happen.
          ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    I don't think Aerb is supposed to be any kind of afterlife, Lost-style. I don't know if we're ever going to get a full explanation about the nature of the game, but if we do, I expect it to have transhumanist aesthetic, so no afterlife.
    ```

    - u/TrebarTilonai:
      ```
      I don't think it's an afterlife; I think that accepting the DM's offer is what caused the deaths in the first place. AKA Arthur decided to come to Aerb and his "Real World person" got hit with a truck to explain his absence.
      ```

      - u/CouteauBleu:
        ```
        No real reason that would happen. The DM would probably be able to duplicate Arthur without killing him.
        ```

        - u/TrebarTilonai:
          ```
          When he meets the DM and sees the recording of the initial offer: 

          >‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúCan I ‚Ä¶ what happens to me, when I leave Earth? I‚Äôd like to leave a note or something.‚Äù *If I was really here, was Earth even real?* ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to hurt anyone.‚Äù  
          >  
          >‚Äú\[REDACTED\],‚Äù he replied.  
          >  
          >\*\*\*  
          ‚ÄúThere were parts of that you left out,‚Äù I said, once I‚Äôd finished reliving the memory. ‚ÄúDo my parents think that I‚Äôm dead?‚Äù  
          >  
          >‚ÄúI‚Äôm worried about potential spoilers,‚Äù replied the Dungeon Master.

          Then later:

          >‚ÄúTell me whether he‚Äôs real,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúNo, tell me *how* he‚Äôs real, how that‚Äôs even possible, because he died nine months before I came here, and we didn‚Äôt have this technology then.‚Äù  
          >  
          >‚ÄúHe‚Äôs real,‚Äù said the Dungeon Master. ‚ÄúI know how much he meant to you. I‚Äôm not going to say how that‚Äôs possible, but you can draw your own conclusions, if you decide that I‚Äôm not lying. And he‚Äôs out there, somewhere on Aerb or one of the other planes. He spent most of his life on Aerb, he‚Äôs not going to be how you remembered him -- you know that, that‚Äôs not news -- but the Arthur that came to Aerb wasn‚Äôt just Arthur as you remembered him. He‚Äôs the real deal, Arthur as he actually existed.‚Äù 


          To me, this seems strongly like the DM is the cause of Arthur dying. Joon even explicitly calls it out when he asks if his parents think that he's dead, and that would explain why everyone thought Arthur was dead when he got transported to Aerb.
          ```

  - u/TrebarTilonai:
    ```
    The connection between death and the Game World is something that I noticed way back during his conversation with the DM. I think it's the other way around though; I suspect Arthur died in the real world because he took the DM's offer. Similarly, I don't think Joon committed suicide, but he is probably dead in the real world due to taking the offer.

  It's interesting that nobody mentioned soul hacking as a way to deal with grief.  Losing a loved one is not that dissimilar to being in an unrequited love situation.

  It's something Joon wouldn't approve of, but if I had a button to 100% turn off the pain when I lost a loved one, I'd use it ASAP.
  ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    Joon wouldn't do it because of various reasons, primarily because he feels it would feel like erasing her memory from his life. Or some similar form of disrespect, to erase feeling bad about her being gone. He does mention that Amaryllis might do so, but I kind of doubt that she would for the same reason Joon doesn't, although she might consider it if they didn't have the time chamber and needed to deal with something urgent without being crippled by grief.
    ```

- u/dabmg10:
  ```

    On the contrary, I think this is literally the only way the story could have gone and still have Fenn come back to life. If they just acted like they could resurrect her and then went and did it, it would become all but impossible to actually kill any other protagonist. We would just expect them to come back.

    But if they go through two whole chapters of emotional turmoil and then suddenly bring her back somehow, it's much more of a plot twist and we won't automatically expect it in the future.

    Dunno if they actually will, but I would say these two chapters increase the chance rather than decrease it.

  None of the characters seem to understand the actual problem with the women in refrigerator trope - Why it is such a hated trope. Which.. okay, that actually fits most of their characterizations, but would Tiff not have hit them upside the head? 

  The issue is not only that this trope involves female characters dying. It is also, and most egregiously, that their deaths have nothing to do with them. 

  They are murdered - *in story* not just by the author, but from a Watsonian perspective, to hurt the male protagonist. Which is just insult on top of injury. If the love interest jumps in front of a bullet to save the protagonist, that would not be this trope.  (Nor is Fenn, really. Fenn died a soldiers death.)
  ```

  - u/tjhance:
    ```
    man, I thought Arthur's argument was super-obnoxious. Tiff (I think) is trying to say that authors need to get less attached to gender roles so they can start writing more balanced stories. And Arthur is like "lol you're saying gender doesn't matter so the fridge trope doesn't matter".

    Like geez dude, no wonder Tiff lost interest in him. (I mean, it's not totally clear if this is how Arthur actually felt since it's a dream, but I assume it's based in reality.)

      ```
      Wait, he was just calling out what he thought was an unfair objection, there. He wasn't actually saying gender doesn't matter, he was saying that Tiff was being inconsistent about when she considered gender to matter.
      ```

      - u/tjhance:
        ```
        He's still being obnoxious.

        There's a difference between "representation and gender balance in media as a whole matter" and "one doesn't actually have to pick the same gender for this character archetype every time for whatever convoluted reasons they think they have". Arthur is equating those and then saying Tiff is being inconsistent, then declares that he "won the argument".

        Tiff elaborates later,

        > ‚ÄúThe whole argument is about stories and their impacts in aggregate, ‚Äù said Tiff. ‚ÄúSet aside your pet theories on causes for a second, if ninety percent of protagonists are male, and ninety percent of love interests are female, and writers kill off love interests half the time, then that‚Äôs -- I don‚Äôt know, some math, but you‚Äôd run into it a lot of the time, and most of what a girl sees growing up is women having horrible things happen to them as a way of motivating the main character or increasing the stakes. Which sucks.‚Äù

        Then Arthur just brushes this objection off,

        > Arthur shrugged. ‚ÄúOkay?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúI never said that it didn‚Äôt suck.‚Äù

        Honestly I'm not sure what Arthur's thesis statement in this argument is (or how he thinks he "won") but he doesn't really seem to be listening to Tiff.

        If he really had already understood how much it sucked, he wouldn't have tried to trap Tiff in an inconsistency like he did, because he would have understood what she was trying to say.
        ```

        - u/MuonManLaserJab:
          ```
          I think you're misreading the thing about "winning". He's not actually claiming that he's won the argument; he's saying that if she arbitrarily says that gender doesn't matter when it suits her, then she's torpedoeing her own argument. Maybe he's wrong, but not maliciously so.

          I think Arthur and Tiff are both partially correct, but Tiff is more correct, and Arthur is being somewhat insensitive to the social implications of his argument. He's definitely over-argumentative and a little socially stunted. But he's not being *awful*, and I think the WtC readership is being a little unfair because we now view Arthur as compromised while Tiff is still perfect in Joon's memory.

    could you explain why the trope is so hated?

    ```

    - u/Izeinwinter:
      ```
      Because it is a prime example of the denial of individual importance and agency to female characters. 

      Contrast this trope with the "Mentor always dies". Mentor is an even more hazardous occupation than love interest in narrative, but the mentor is invariably killed for reasons relating to the mentor. They sacrifice themselves, they are hunted down by their ancient enemies and so forth. Their death is about them. 

      Fridging is not. The killer does not care about the victim at all, except as an emotional bludgeon to point at the hero, and would be equally happy to burn their stamp collection. Which is dehumanizing as all hell.
      ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I'm not great at literary critic, but here's my take on it:

      When you only use the female love interest's death to get at the main character, you're reducing her final moments to a plot device. That is pretty demeaning to her character, kinda like the "use me for spare parts" thing Fenn's letter suggested.

      Often a character's death can have meaning to them (besides being an endpoint); like someone consciously choosing to sacrifice their life for someone else, or jumping off a cliff rather than face trial. Having a character just *killed* takes that agency away from them and turns them into a victim.
      ```

      - u/MuonManLaserJab:
        ```
        In real life, people are generally not killed for "satisfying" reasons that say a lot about their character and represent great and honorable sacrifice etc. Sometimes you get hit by a bus.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          However, in fiction something like this rarely happens to important characters. So *if* they become a victim of circumstance, it means they weren't important characters.

  - u/MuonManLaserJab:
    ```
    But that's explicitly the point -- you have an invincible character, so their enemies strike at their social weak points.

        Unless we concede that she was murdered by DM, Fenn is not an example of this trope.

        Fridging is an enemy killing a love interest with the express purpose of hurting the protagonist. The demaning part comes in the loss of agency the woman suffers, she is a plot point and motivation, killed not for *who* she is but *what* she is to the MC.

        In this case Fenn died in combat as a part of the party where everyone was in danger.

        As I said, this only goes if the DM didn't intentionally kill *specifically* to mess with Juniper.

          Very debatable!

          However, I was just trying to force the metaphor. Fenn's not the typical woman stuffed in a fridge, but her death here does evoke the trope, at least in a meta way. The DM could definitely have nudged it so she lived, but she died, with Joon aware of the DM's omission (and implicitly aware of *why* it was her who died, i.e. love interest, just broke up).

  I have a new working theory for how Juniper got to Aerb and it's all because of this one line in chapter 120

  >only if you wrote them like I did, you called them suicide notes instead.

  I hypothesize that the last day Juniper experienced on Earth before coming to Aerb, Juniper chose to commit suicide for some reason and was put into cryonic preservation.

  The part that makes me suspect this possibility is a throwaway line all the way back in chapter 1:

  >Five seconds ago, I had been passing notes in fifth period English.

  Perfectly innocuous, right? What teenager hasn't passed notes to their friends in class? Except...what friend? Juniper talked about how all of his relationships were wrecked or drifted apart after Arthur's death and there were no mention of him making up with his old friends or making new ones. Only Reimer and Tom was still in the DM group at that point and I'm not sure they were getting along well enough to be passing notes. I speculate that he was actually passing notes with someone who was trying to help him or talk about Arthur (could be Tiff or someone else) and his memories cut out right before he reads or writes something that causes a fight or something awful at his school. So he then chooses to die later that day and is frozen with his memories of his suicide (and its cause) erased or forgotten.

  Another weaker supporting point for this theory is how he never explicitly thinks about just exactly *what* he was doing or seeing in fifth period English. Every time Juniper thinks about how he got to Aerb, it's always how he could possibly suddenly transition from everyday life to Aerb (or the meeting with the DM in chapter 79). But there's no review of the classroom memory for any clues about his impending fate or any flashback to the scene itself of when he transitions (nor does he ever talk about it with his party) and I can't help but think it's a small clue about what is missing from the 'story'/memory.
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    > and there were no mention of him making up with his old friends or making new ones

    Actually, there were a few. The narrator mentions that he was starting to shake off his depression and trying to repair his relationships at the time he was ??? to Aerb.

    E.g. in the notes that describe all his different RPG universes, the last one is one he was building as an apology to his friends.

  Otherwise, awesome chapters. 

  I was, and still am, skeptical of the timing of Fenn's death immediately after the breakup, because I hate that trope ("oh, relationship becomes difficult to write? just kill it off"). But the trope is more bearable due to its in-universe discussion and the Narrative being part of the world.

      Sorry, I explained myself badly.

      So, there is a trope where character X moves into a position that makes the story hard to write, and lazy/coward authors just kill off character X. 

      Imagine that Fenn does not die; imagining the group dynamics afterwards is not easy, and probably not easy to write. Now, it is something that we're not gonna see. In other words, her death cheapens the breakup and robs us of seeing how they struggle to have a working relationship, how Joon does or does not move on, and the same for Fenn.

      That stinks. It stinks somewhat less due to the fact that the story talks explicitly about the timing.
