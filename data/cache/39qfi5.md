## [Q][D] Seeking advice: Writing workspaces and skills

### Post:

Yesterday, I set a personal deadline: If I haven't started writing more "S.I." by Canada Day, then I'm going to start writing up the fast-finish version of the plotline to at least tie up the story and stop having it hanging over me.

Never underestimate the power of precommitment.

Now that I've started thinking in terms of my writing more of SI as a simple fact, I've realized that, due to complicated/personal/private home-life stuff, in order to actually have a reasonable chance of even writing the short ending, I need a new low-distraction work-space, and nowhere in my home is suitable. The most likely candidates are my local public library when it's open (Tue-Sat, 10am-5/6/9pm), and, elsewhen, a particular local coffee-shop with a customer-available power outlet. And, in fact, my not noticing the lack of a suitable low-noise typing location may have induced an ugh field that kept me from even trying to catch up with suggestions and comments to SI even as my depressive episode has waned.

It occurs to me that there may be further options I'm not considering; and that there may even be other aspects to the process of writing which could be hindering my progress. And so, I come here, to inquire of the local hivemind: What advice can you offer?

  Personally, my writing workflow was made a lot better with the addition of [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php). It's got a lot of really neat features. I use the following:

  * Divide project up by chapters and scenes ([like so](http://i.imgur.com/KfZkXqt.png)) so that you can get a skeleton of the whole section *before* you start writing, or move scenes around within a chapter more easily
  * Set word count targets for a scene/project
  * Compile to various formats
  * Easily drop references materials in a folder
  * Folders for character sheets, locations, etc.
  * Quick and easy full-text searching (divided by chapter)

  It's got a free trial of thirty days, which should be enough to evaluate whether it's for you. I personally consider it the best $40 I ever spent on writing. My only hesitation would be that you're in the process of currently writing a novel, which means there would be some costs associated with making the switch. The other problem is that it's somewhat worse for collaboration; Google Docs gets my thumbs up if what you want is to share with people online (though for one or two people, Scrivener is probably still better). (*Edit: My condensed pitch for Scrivener is that what you're probably using now wasn't designed with novel writing as the primary use case. Scrivener has novel writing as its focus.*)

  I do recommend turning off the internet; divide your time up into research and writing, and you'll probably be happier, because every time you have to stop to look something up, you're breaking the flow of writing. I've taken to peppering my writing with TODO statements instead of stopping to look for something. That goes for general things that stop the process. Realizing that you need a name and thinking, "Wait, uh ... Rob? Too modern? Did I already name a character Robert?" can kill the zen of prose writing. Because I don't tend to write things with dollars in them, I can also use $guy notation and then do a find+replace later when I'm not in the middle of actively writing a scene. If I really want to get writing done, I push the key that turns off my laptop's WiFi, then push the key that shuts off the trackpad. That at least makes it so there's some conscious thought that has to happen between, "I should check Facebook" and "I'm on Facebook". Reflexively going my comfortable places on the internet is one of those things I have to actively curb.

  I *personally* write in complete silence, but that's completely a matter of personal preference. I sort of feel like making a sculpted soundscape/playlist is one of those non-writing things that writers do to procrastinate from writing, like someone who doesn't want to go running deciding that they need to go get some better gym shorts and new shoes before they'll be ready. But I don't have a great relationship with music or sound in general, so perhaps there's some real benefit that I'm missing.

  Physically speaking, my biggest advice would be to eat right, drink lots of water, and get a good amount of sleep. But that's not writing advice, that's life advice.

  I recommend checking out Coworking Spaces. They are not too expensive and **really** help me to focus. They have fantastic atmosphere, cool people, and no distractions - there's really nothing to do there except to focus on  writing.

  In terms of tools, if you are good with tech I **highly** recommend you to learn how to use emacs. It has a learning curve but will make you 100 times more productive. I use emacs, markdown, git, and a pelican blog. Most awesome writing environment *ever*.

  Alternatively, you could use an iPad. It blows my mind how awesome and convenient it is, software for it is also fantastic.

  In terms of productivity tools - read on pomodoro method. Basically you set a timer for 20 minutes and then do *nothing* except for writing. Focusing for a short time is easy, and then you just take a break, then repeat.

  Some anecdotal data for you: When I do programming, I find the environment very distracting. What helps me is having headphones that block out sound ("closed" headphones that cover the entire ear) and playing pink noise (for high-focus tasks, designing/problem-solving) or voice-less music (for medium-focus tasks, implementation).
