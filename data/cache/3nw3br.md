## Seeking examples of growth mindset in fiction

### Post:

As people who care about rationality and winning, it's pretty important to care about training. Repeated practice is how humans acquire skills, and skills are what we use for winning.

Unfortunately, it's sometimes hard to get System 1 fully on board with the fact that repeated, difficult, sometimes tedious practice is how we become awesome. I find fiction to be one of the most useful ways of communicating things like this to my S1. It would be great to have a repository of fiction that shows characters practicing skills, mastering them, and becoming awesome, to help this really sink in.

However, in fiction the following tropes are a lot more common:

* Hero is born to greatness and only needs to discover that greatness to win - I don't think I actually need to give examples of this?]

* Like (1), only the author talks about the skill development or the work in passing… but in a way that leaves the reader's attention and system 1 reinforcement on the "already be awesome" part, rather that the "practice to become awesome" part. Examples of this are HPMOR, and the Dresden Files, where most of the implied practice takes place between books.

* A training montage, where again the reader's attention isn't on the training long enough to reinforce the "practice to become awesome" part, but skips to the "wouldn't it be great to already be awesome" part; [TVtropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingMontage) has many examples of this.

* The hero starts out ineffectual and becomes great over the course of the book, but this comes from personal revelations and insights, rather than sitting down and practicing. [Nice Dragons Finish Last](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20426102-nice-dragons-finish-last) is an example of this.

*Examples of exactly the wrong thing*:

* [The Hunger Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games) - Katniss is explicitly up against the Pledges who have trained their whole lives for this one thing, but she has … something special that causes her to win. Also archery is her greatest skill, and she's already awesome at it from the beginning of the story and never spends time practicing.

* [Ender's Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game):  Ender manages to beat a more experienced player 2 out of 3 without ever touching the game controls prior to the contest. Later on, he trains his troops, but he is already magically there himself.

*Examples that approach the right thing*:

* [The Pillars of the Earth](http://www.rakuten.com/prod/the-pillars-of-the-earth/204583267.html?listingid=-1&ranMID=36342&ranEAID=je6NUbpObpQ&ranSiteID=je6NUbpObpQ-ZyCNGK4.s2vUzJ2bdIwDOA&scid=af_linkshare&adid=18094&siteID=je6NUbpObpQ-ZyCNGK4.s2vUzJ2bdIwDOA) - Jack pretty explicitly has to travel around Europe to acquire the skills he needs to become great. Much of the practice is off-screen, but it's at least a pretty significant part of the journey.

* The [Honor Harrington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor_Harrington) series: the books depict Honor, as well as the people around her, rising through the ranks of the military and gradually levelling up, with emphasis on dedication to training, and that training is often depicted onscreen – but the skills she's training in herself and her subordinates aren't nearly as relevant as the "tactical genius" that she seems to have been born with.

* [Groundhog Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day_(film)) and similar types of stories. Shows pure growing mindset and determination, no extra talent.

  I bet you've already read it and included it in your Groundhog Day bullet-point but just in case, Mother of Learning does this. 

  The Tamora Pierce series Protector of the Small does it, though my memory of them is about a decade old. The fanfic crossover with HP called Ambiguous Artifice seems to combine born to greatness and a lot of hard work if that appeals.

    Protector of the Small is a great example. Tamora Pierce's other works fail on this front: Daine is born with a unique system of magic. Alanna is better, as she trains a lot, but she's also chosen by the Goddess and was born with a magical Gift and a talent for healing. 

    Protector of the Small has Kel doing good old fashion work to improve, and highlights the skills she starts the book with as a result of the same sort of training throughout her life.

      They do train, but there's a lot of strength-from-personal-reflection and strength-from-bloodline which we can't replicate in the real world.

  All shounen anime ever, but *especially* Hikaru no Go, the amazingly addictive show (and manga) from which I generalized Tsuyoku Naritai.
  ```

  - u/TennisMaster2:
    ```
    I was always suspicious *Hikaru no Go* was where that came from; it's not nearly as prevalent an explicit Japanese cultural facet as your article made it out to be.
    ```

    - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
      ```
      It also appears in *Mahou Sensei Negima*, thereby proving the point.
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Weirdly enough, for an otherwise *utterly* irrational show, it tends to show up a lot in *Jojo's Bizarre Adventure*, in which clever tactical thinking, hard work, and raw luck are often the *only* way for the mangaka to get his heroes through fights with strictly-more-powerful villains.
    ```

- u/Transfuturist:
  ```
  Luke's journey in Star Wars is a good example of this, specifically his time on Dagobah in The Empire Strikes Back. He levels up between Empire and Return, which isn't seen, but the difference between Luke in New Hope and Return is apparent, and Dagobah was a good part of it.

  System 1?

    ```
    From [*Thinking, Fast and Slow*](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555) (but also a common bit of LessWrong jargon). Wikipedia sez:

    > The book's central thesis is a dichotomy between two modes of thought: "System 1" is fast, instinctive and emotional; "System 2" is slower, more deliberative, and more logical.
    ```

- u/Predictablicious:
  ```
  Baby Steps, the Anime is entirely focused on training and reasoning about repeated failure as a way to improve the main character's skills. The show is about a guy learning how to play tennis from scratch and while he has some talents in visual cognition and analysis most of his improvements come from practice.

    Why isn't Western media more like anime? They have so much more creativity and freedom to experiment, it's ridiculous!
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Welllll because it is, really.  I mean, just because anime tropes allow for a higher level of baseline weirdness, doesn't mean *most* anime aren't just repeats of the same crappy tropes over and over again.

      I mean, consider how many anime deal with cute girls doing cute things in high school, *and don't even have airsoft battles or zombies*.  Or harem romantic comedies with soulless, no-personality male protagonists obviously meant to let the otaku audience fantasize about being surrounded by adoring beautiful women without having to relate to others.

      With anime, the import process pre-filters things, so you see a selection of higher-quality material without having to browse through all the crap.  There's actually quite a lot of good Western media when you exercise an equally strong filter.
      ```

      A fair part is inherent to the medium. A large assembly of people in a musty church is about as expensive to draw and render as a large assembly in space. Hell, if you go detailed enough the church might actually be more expensive in some cases, so why not do it space? While live action can send actors to a church for cheap, rendering a spacescape is horrendously expensive in CGI. This means that smaller companies can pump out crazy shit at a lower cost, allowing them to take greater risks.

      I mean, imagine trying to shoot Attack on Titan or Gundam in live action. Sure, you could technically do it but the price would be astronomical (no pun intended). It gives them much greater freedom to be off the wall. 

      Think back to western attempts on the same medium and you'll find they can be pretty damn creative as well. Consider Courage the Cowardly Dog or Wren and Stimpy or even South Park. The differences between that and live action are many and obvious, because they do just have more freedom.

      Say you're a creative young writer in the US and you want to do a zombie scene. Just a throwaway zombie scene for a gag on a low budget live action show. It's a huge hassle and like as not just not going to happen. In an anime you can totally do it pretty easily.
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        Definitely agree with this. There's a reason that most film students make films set in their city with people their age as cast members, and it's not that they're completely lacking in creativity.
        ```
