## [FF][RT] The Two Year Emperor is back, and free

### Post:

Short version:  2YE is publicly available again and can be downloaded here: ﻿﻿https://www.dropbox.com/s/w6279gwfusrdcsx/The_Two_Year_Emperor.zip?dl=0﻿  This is an archive of all the original HTML files in book 1 (the part about Jake), including author's notes and such.  I haven't had time to add nav links, but Ctrl+O is a thing.  If anyone has time to strip the files and combine them and/or add the nav links I would really appreciate it.

Long version:

2YE is a D&D fanfic that I originally published on FFN.  When I went from being a programmer to being an author I stripped the copyrighted D&D elements out and published it on Amazon. (After giving it away for 6 weeks first so that no one would get caught short if they were in the middle of reading.)  I put it in the Kindle Online Lending Library program because that's where an author makes 40% of his money on a book.  The TOS for the KOLL program requires exclusivity, so I had to take it offline at that time.  

Yesterday someone pointed something out to me that I had forgotten:  when I was originally writing 2YE and posting it on FFN I started publishing spinoff stories.  At the bottom of most 2YE chapters I put a short ad pointing to those stories, along with the note "Don't worry, 2YE will always be free, no matter how many spinoff sales I do or don't get."  

I thought about this when it was pointed out to me, and then I went over to my Amazon dashboard to see what the deal was with 2YE right now.  KOLL requires exclusivity while you're in, and you only have the chance to opt out every 90 days.  As it happened, I was able to get the book out of the KOLL program.  

2YE is now available for free again.  I may or may not repost it on FFN -- their interface is a total pain, and uploading and then posting 71 chapters (plus 14 more for Book 2) would be annoying.  At some point I'll probably take the time to add "Next" and "Prev" links and strip all the Author's Notes and other cruft, but for now this is the exact dump of what was on FFN.  It's currently posted over on my [Patreon](http://patreon.com/davidstorrs) as a free download, and when I eventually get it cleaned up that's where the polished version will be.

EDIT:  I forgot to say:  Book 2 (the part about Suze) isn't included because it needs some rework.  It'll go up as soon as I get enough tuits.

  /u/Mraedis is right, your work is awesome. I had a lot of fun reading 2YE, when it ended and I started reading Team Anko I guess I wasn't done processing so I didn't give t a fair chance before quitting. A couple days ago I started reading Team Anko again and it's really freaking good, I binged it. I don't know what I want more, Team Anko or Marked for Death.

    Wow, that's quite flattering.  Thank you.

    Speaking of, I should probably get cracking on the TA chapter for Sunday.  After all, Naruto's seal isn't going to crack open on its own.

      ....I need to just not read any of your Team Anko related posts. You have way too much fun fucking with us. Damn you /u/eaglejarl!

        I do.  I really do.  It's like a drug.

  Already read it all, but I loved your work, just wanted to let you know.

    Thank you, I'm really grateful you would take time to let me know.

  Great; now I have something to reread during the car trip this weekend!

  I don't suppose there are any takers for putting the nav links in?

    Save [this pastebin](http://pastebin.com/dWm3LWYS) as a .bat script, place in the folder with all the chapters, then run it. That will put in "Previous" and "Next" links at the top and bottom, along with a line below/above the link to separate it.

    I'd be surprised if you needed it, but [instructions on running a .bat from Mac here.](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110818171632AA4szz5)

    (Note that this is a quick hack, apologies for any programmers who have to look at the thing. Should be short enough that it's nearly human readable though.)

    Edit: I just realized that I have your e-mail, so I sent you a .zip of the html files. They look good to me, YMMV.

      Not that bad, aside from the hard-coding. Apology accepted, though I only had to look because you apologized.  I am giving BOD and assuming you've tested it though.

      That's really kind of you, it's great seeing the community help each other.

      Nice, thank you. I'm on my phone right now but will check them later.

  I definitely enjoyed the series when you first published it. FWIW, the FFN iOS (and i guess Android) app is pretty decent for reading once you get the UI set up.
  ```

- u/elevul:
  ```
  Thank you! 

  I had made the .epub already. If you want I can upload it so you don't have to make the work all over again.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Sure, go ahead.

      Here it is: http://www.mediafire.com/download/1km9vv259bd913i/The_Two_Year_Emperor_-_Eagle_Jarl.epub

      Should be fairly straightforward to convert from this to .pdf and .mobi.

        ```
        Thank you for making it an EPUB. Perhaps you could offer to let him bundle it into the download so it's all in 1 big download.
        ```

  ```
  Thanks. It's clearly time for a re-read.
