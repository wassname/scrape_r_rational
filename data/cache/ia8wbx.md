## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  Meta-Magic Munchkinry: Degrees Of Reasonableness. Take this magical system, and cross it over into a setting you like and munchkin that setting's magic using this magic.  In Worth the Candle, there is a concept of Degrees of Reasonableness, and one of Juniper's powers is to bend them.  For instance, if you have a magic spell that affects dogs, it would only take a single degree of reasonableness to make the spell also affect wolves or coyotes or dingos and 2 degrees of reasonableness to make the spell affect foxes.

  We only have a few canon examples... so with apologies to Alexander Wales in advance if I give the audience bad headcanon by firming up the rules and inserting a few more examples for the purpose of this Saturday Munchkinry threads.

  To give the canon examples:

  * Holding an improvised weapon just so that it is "three times less likely to break" takes one degrees of reasonableness.
  * "Reflection Blade provides a reflection of wounds for someone that youâ€™ve cut".  One degree of reasonableness is enough to increase the axes of reflection from just "between left and right, which was called  the sagittal plane" to also "between top and bottom, which was called  the transverse plane and between front and back, which was  called the coronal plane"
  * An amulet lets the user shapeshift into non-magical animals.  One degree of reasonableness is enough to include humans in this definition.
  * "defining the letter A as B took five degrees of reasonableness"
  * "defining A as 1 would be six"
  * "defining A as banana would be seven"

  And to generalize some rules:

  * One degree of reasonableness is enough to bend common definitions between technical and colloquial definitions.  Defining a square as a rectangle or a square as not a rectangle takes only a single degree of reasonableness.  Or wolves/coyotes/dingos as dogs.  Or defining a tomatoes as a vegetable or a fruit.
  * One degree of reasonableness is enough to stretch plausibility slightly in a way that would require a bit of luck.
  * Three degrees of reasonableness is enough to stretch plausibility have highly improbable luck.
  * Standard Munchkinry of Harry Potter spells requires 1-2 degrees of reasonableness.
  * Two degrees of reasonableness is enough to broaden a definition by one conceptual level i.e. by dogs, the spell/magical effect means all Canidae, which includes Foxes.
  * Three degrees of reasonableness is enough to stretch fuzzy limits on mass/volume/weight limitations and to bend the conceptual category as well.  This is enough to make the motive name from Unsong (which turns wheels) unlock the Panama Canal.
  * To increment by one requires 5 degrees of reasonableness. Example: the Bulletproof name from Unsong can now protect you from the next two bullets instead of just the next bullet.
  * At seven degrees of reasonableness you can basically bend reality with even the slightest of spells.  Seven degrees of reasonableness with Wingaridum Levioasa would be enough to place anything the spell hit under your complete telekinetic control with high level of acceleration/max velocity/maximum force.

  Degrees of Reasonableness users is a bit of a mouthful... so let's just call them Benders.  This power works on instantly on anything a Bender is doing themselves, but requires an extra degree to be applied to something someone else is doing if they are physically close to, cooperating with, and allied with the Bender.

  ***So what can you do if you are a Bender with 1, 2, or 3 degrees of reasonableness in a setting of your choice?***

  **To add some rules about learning time:** after a year of study of both the relevant magic you will be applying it to, related conceptual definitions, and seeing other Benders at work this power can be acquired with 1 degree.  Further practice for a year will get to 2 degrees.  Another three years of practice and careful study can get you up to 3 degrees (for 6 years total to get to 3 degrees).

  **Some additional modifiers:** Being directly involved in the creation/utilization process can get you an additional degree.  Complicated, long rituals with lots of symbolism and setup can add another degree.  Lots of Benders, working together at once can add yet another degree (to the degrees of the least skilled Bender working in the group).

  So in total you can reach 6 degrees.

  **And if you want to munchkin it in the real world with no other magic:**

  * Two degrees is enough to increase the durability of a material in accordance with the maximum "probable durability" it would have
  * Three degrees is enough to keep a perpetual motion machine in motion (with the bender's mental focus) but not output any additional energy
  * 4 degrees of reasonableness and a perpetual motion machine that abuses the difference between a layman's understanding and actual physics is enough to get a perpetual motion machine that can maintain a slight positive output of energy so long as the bender stays focused on it.
  * 6 degrees is enough to make that perpetual motion machine stay active and outputting energy with only initial construction and periodic maintenance from a bender.
  * For shapeshifting, (one of the more straightforward applications).  Two degrees is enough for a bender to make themselves subjectively (up to the level of good hypnosis) seem more like an animal to both themselves and outside observers.  Three degrees is enough to cause minor physical changes.  4 degrees is enough for moderate shapeshifting into a humanoid animal, and 5 degrees enough for complete shapeshifting.
  * For a boring application, 5 degrees to make two platinum bars into 3.

  **Edit**: First nerf, of the example effects listed at varying degrees of reasonableness, you can't apply multiple different effects at once or the same effect to multiple different things.  I.e. one degree of reasonableness bends one conceptual definition, if you want to bend another conceptual definition you will need an additional degree of reasonableness or another Bender working on the other definition separately.
  ```

  - u/jtolmar:
    ```
    If you can stack enough six-eyed like effects to hit +5 degrees of reasonableness, you can increment how many degrees each of those effects grants you, shooting up by however many effects are in the stack. If we assume that incrementing again takes another 5 degrees of reasonableness (ie, +2 takes 10, +3 takes 15, etc), then this blows up to infinity if you can find at least five separate six-eyed like effects.
    ```

    - u/scruiser:
      ```
      As written... I failed to specify how many effect a Bender can apply at once, so that works.  You don't even need to get it to blow up to 10 necessarily, 8 should be enough to start warping reality, but as written 10 blows it up to infinity which should be arbitrary godhood.  Good job getting the Locus excluded.  I wonder if Solace would try to kill Juniper if that happened.

      I edited to nerf this, but even as nerfed, if other groups Benders can participate indirectly, each group performing a side-ritual can modify a step of the main ritual by an increment (+3 from skill level, +1 from ritual, +1 from group, +1 from involvement in process, but -1 from indirectness) to get the main ritual up to degrees beyond 6.
      ```

      - u/jtolmar:
        ```
        Good fix. It also goes away if there's no way to stack that many six eyed effects (which is true in Worth the Candle), and mostly goes away if the scaling is superlinear (+1 at 5 degrees, +2 at 11, +3 at 18, and so on).

        Also, I really like your thought experiment of using degrees of reasonableness in a different setting.

        (But no proper response from me, as the only place I can really think of to apply it is D&D 3.5, and I'm not opening up that can of worms again.)
        ```

  - u/chillanous:
    ```
    Bending social skills could be nasty strong.

    One degree of reasonableness probably lets you make an argument (diplomacy/intimidation roll) in any  language capable of being expressed by humans. In a language you already speak, even a weak argument has a high chance of landing with someone neutrally inclined toward you or better.

    Two degrees lets you try to win over animals too.

    At three degrees of reasonableness, you can get a "highly unlikely" favorable outcome. That sounds to me like allying with BBEG's, finding out that every girl at every bar you choose to hit on has a thing for guys *just* like you, finding out that the guy sent to kill you had a nightmare where you said the exact same intimidating line right before killing him...you get the idea.

    And with rituals to get to higher levels? Extraplanar beings, inanimate objects, loose concepts. You could politely ask a bullet to hit its target (or not hit you!). 

    You could talk the universe into bending physics as a favor, convince a chunk of lead it better turn into gold *or else*, and otherwise bend reality to your whim.

    The world is your oyster.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Delve: there's a class called Worker that grants a 50% bonus to all non-combat skills. Most magic can be modified by several metamagics at once, the MC's specialization of auras being particularly extreme in this department. One degree of reasonableness to have the boost apply to non-combat spells' metamagic applications, three to classify metamagic skills as "non-combat." The main character's build revolves around a very fast mana regeneration rate, but even this highly specialized build can be beat by simply applying the Worker class buffs to all metamagic skills and activating Winter. It's even more dramatically better in combat.

  You have the supernatural power of making other people in your vicinity think you are cheating/getting ready to betray them/getting away with something outrageous. You can't turn this power off - it's always on when people are near, and it's going to make a lot of people just flat out hate you, but never the less - I think it's a power we should be able to munchkin. So, how do we exploit this? Ideally without getting shot.
  ```

  - u/ulyssessword:
    ```
    Nothing too high impact:

    - Become a street magician.  People will *pay* to be outrageously betrayed.

    - Become a consulting negotiator.  Most people want to negotiate in good faith most of the time...but some don't.  Inducing paranoia can be a valid strategy regardless of whether you're out to get them or not.
    ```

  - u/vanillafog:
    ```
    If you disguise yourself as someone else, will people in your vicinity think the person you're disguised as is getting ready to betray them? You could really mess up someone's personal relationships or public reputation this way. One obvious application would be to disguise yourself as a politician you don't like, then attend (or just stand around near) as many meetings and events as you can without blowing your cover.
    ```

  - u/RetardedWabbit:
    ```
    In X vicinity around you:
    1. You emotionally force paranoia/hatred against you
    2. You unnaturally stress people out

    I see four general situations to exploit this:
    1. Situations where the other party can't harm you
    2. Situations where you exploit the vicinity limit
    3. Situations where you want others against you
    4. Situations where paranoid emotions harm others

    My initial thought was to make a law firm, specializing in defense, to take advantage of the prosecution acting irrationally. Being defense is essential: stalls or failures of the system inherently benefit you. If you can keep the judge far enough away during trials you get to win a lot of cases you shouldn't and unnaturally stress out the opposition. The real fun is when the judge is in range: you eventually win even more cases for even more money. 

    Making the judge oppose you along with the prosecution loses you that case, but then you just appeal to higher courts! Higher courts will see the lower courts paranoid/discriminatory rulings and throw them out. Even if this requires more in person hearings you can just send another lawyer, you yourself aren't tied to the case.

    Edit: This would give you an extraordinarily weird reputation as a lawyer. Being in this position would also give you a good opportunity to give cases/politics you are against the "hug of death" and establish precedent: by overly supporting a case you are against you can turn people against it. If you can do this at the highest court or in other specific cases you can establish precedents and have a huge impact. You could also do this for political issues.
    ```

    - u/Weirdyxxy:
      ```
      You would probably also make your clients and your co-workers paranoid, so I wouldn't suppose that to work well. Even with a great reputation, your client will expect you to be a mafia goon trying to lock them up for every crime they didn't commit, and it would even fit to the weird reputation (assuming bribes or intimidation could be a convincing rationalization for this phenomenon, for example)
      ```

      - u/RetardedWabbit:
        ```
        You would definitely have to take those things into consideration. I think you could avoid contact with your client if your firm is big enough by using other lawyers outside of the trials themselves. Co-workers would be harder, I guess you could try to pay them well enough that they think "he may be ripping me off somehow but the money is worth it"?

        I didn't even think through how messed up the reputation would be since on top of your weird career results there's still the power. Mafia lawyer seems like a good fit
        ```

    - u/chillanous:
      ```
      My takeaway from other comments is that controlling your distance from other people is key.

      You'd be basically unable to live a normal life, since I'd assume all in-person interviews and transactions would fail. 

      It seems to me that if you could foster enough trust with an accomplice online, it would be easy to scam people. Just have your accomplice feed them the scam, then walk up and tell them it's a scam and your accomplice cannot be trusted. Since you yourself will not be trusted, people will be likely to take your accomplice at their word. Just make sure you stay physically separated from your accomplice or you'll need a new one.
      ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    Play Poker for money. (Or any other gambling game involving bluffing and close proximity to opponents.)

    That supernatural power will make it really really hard for opponents to read your true intentions, because they will always feel like you are cheating. Even when you lose they will feel like they are falling into your trap. And if they call you out for cheating, rejoice, because they cannot prove it and you can demand compensation.
    ```

    - u/Roneitis:
      ```
      The casino runners would just throw you out though?
      ```

      - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
        ```
        So the casino will throw you out just because you look particularly shifty, without any proof that you are actually cheating? Sue them. Sue them to heck!
        ```

        - u/CompactDisko:
          ```
          Businesses have the right to kick you out if they want to, as long as it's not for certain protected reasons, like race or sex. If you start winning with this power, they'll definitely think you're cheating and can legally kick you out because you're "too good for them".
          ```

          - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
            ```
            Huh. 

            I must admit I am not familiar with the legalities, but it seems a bit odd that a store of any kind could just point to an arbitrary customer and say "Your face is ugly! Get out!" and kick them out without any consequences. I mean, if the customer is just loitering around instead of buying anything, or breaking the rules/laws somehow, sure. But otherwise, it seems kind of discriminatory.

            What if you livestream yourself? Since your power is proximity based, viewers won't be affected by it. Then they can all see you get thrown out of the casino for no good reason.
            ```

            - u/meangreenking:
              ```
              Its totally a thing casinos do. If they think you are cheating even if they have no clue how they kick you out. Hell, if you are winning too much money even if they know you aren't cheating (notably card counting) they kick you out anways.

              Now obviously if you can prove it being actually discriminatory instead of it being about them losing money then you can sue, but unless the person who kicks you out explicitly says so it isn't going to be a suit you would ever win.

              E: I also feel the need to point out that (in America at least) businesses can arbitrarily kick you out without even needing a reason. Obviously if the reason is Rasism/Sexism its illegal, but unless you can prove it is discrimination there isn't really anything you can do.
              ```

  - u/CompactDisko:
    ```
    You could probably get an edge in an acting career if you play exclusively villains. Your power wouldn't work for TV or movies, but it should definitely work for theater. Your inherent hateablity could even be explained as you being a method actor trying to stay in character.
    ```

    - u/chillanous:
      ```
      You'd have a very difficult time in casting, though. Even if you claim method acting, they have to trust you to buy that line, and they won't. 

      Maybe you could find a casting director that loved the energy you brought enough to ignore his feelings about you.
      ```

  - u/ArmokGoB:
    ```
    This seems most obviously useful for false-flag debating, negotiation, and misc. memetics.
    ```

- u/CaramilkThief:
  ```
  You can take any physical action you've seen, and recreate it perfectly. The action has to be physically possible for a human being, *and* done by someone else for real (so no fake martial art moves or priests with the power to exorcise demons from crowds). What are the possibilities?
  ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    Password theft.

    See someone entering a password anywhere? You can recreate their password entry perfectly.

    I assume this works even if you don't see their fingers, just their back.

    &#x200B;

    Actually I wonder what the precision on this ability is. Say you see someone leave a fingerprint on something. Could you perfectly recreate that action and leave the exact same fingerprint? Because that action IS physically possible for a human being, just not for you.
    ```

    - u/CaramilkThief:
      ```
      The precision depends on how long the action was seen for, and the resolution of the action. Basically the more uncertain the action is the less precision you get. 

      If you're just seeing someone's back as they're standing, you'll be able to perfectly recreate that pose *as seen from the back*. However, there will be significant uncertainty on what the front of the body is doing (like facial expressions, eye movements, etc.). However, if you see multiple angles of a karate kick from close up and encompassing the whole body, you'll be able to recreate it to the millimeter. The more angles and time you see it for the more precise it gets. The action automatically gets adjusted for your body proportions and level of fitness, so you may be able to perfectly recreate the moves of a 1000lb deadlift, but you won't physically be able to do a 1000lb deadlift. You also keep your own fingerprints and other unique identifiers. So you'll be able to leave the fingerprint within a millimeter or less of where the other person put it, but it'll still be your fingerprint.
      ```

      - u/scruiser:
        ```
        How does this interact with internal body states?  There are reports of monks that can alter their metabolic rate and other aspects of homeostasis through meditation.  Copying this ability seems pretty useful.
        ```

        - u/CaramilkThief:
          ```
          You need to see the parts of the body that are doing the action. So if you somehow found a video of a monk's heart as they lowered their heart rate, you'll be able to do it. And so on for the other aspects of homeostasis.
          ```

  - u/RetardedWabbit:
    ```
    Become the world's most versatile dancer and be perfectly tied for best in every style. Every time someone else innovates, you're going to be able to match them shortly and pull out their once in a lifetime moves every time. 

    This power would also in general make you a world class athlete even without the physical ability to be the best. Perfect technique and no choking. Throw textbook perfect spirals every time, never miss a free throw, always have the perfect serve/pitch etc.

    Edit: Golf seems like a sport you could dominate: replay the best strokes in history for that hole or just mirror the best strokes from your competitors until you think you can beat them.
    ```

    - u/RetardedWabbit:
      ```
      I actually think you could dominate almost any sport: you have perfect technique and have to spend essentially zero time on it. Your body is the weak link but you can work out all day instead of practicing which would make up for a lot.
      ```

      - u/Roxolan:
        ```
        It depends on whether, for top tier athletes, the filter is execution, adaptation (perfectly replicating an archery shot can still fail if the wind condition is different; perfectly replicating a fencing move is useless), or physical ability (ultimately limited by genes & willpower, neither of which you necessarily have). Varies from sport to sport.
        ```

        - u/RetardedWabbit:
          ```
          Your power let's you cheat all three of these categories to an extent. The biggest general hack is the time savings: you have so much more comparative time to work on everything than your competition without technique practice.

          Execution: Your execution is perfect every time if you're physically able.

          Adaptation: Others are thinking about both what to do and how to do it, you only need to think about half of that. Other archers are guessing the wind AND how to adapt to it, you're still guessing the wind but then you recall the perfect shot for those exact conditions. It's not useless for fencing, you do have to recognize the situation fast but the response needed is still technical. You can also copy the world's fastest moves, even for initial lunges or flicks this would be devastating. You can also totally change your style without technique cost.

          Physical ability: Current world class athletes are genetically and mentally gifted enough to get better results than everyone else while doing essentially the same thing everyone else is. You don't need to do the same as everyone else, so you don't need the same mental or physical advantages that benefit that schedule. You don't need the same talent if you can spend more time on it and do it differently. You can also hack these in execution: you have perfectly efficient form unless you flat out quit, there's not a gradual technique breakdown due to willpower/focus issues like everyone else.
          ```

    - u/interested_commenter:
      ```
      Lot of variance in how good it would be for sports, but in general if you're not already an excellent athlete it's probably not

      Pretty bad for baseball, for example, since even a perfectly placed pitch isn't gonna do that much without the muscle and leverage (pitchers usually tall with long arms) to make it fast, and replicating movements wouldn't help your batting much.

      Almost completely useless in football, so much of being an NFL-level QB is decision making and reading the field, and again arm strength is still a huge issue.

      Basketball it would have potential. Forget never missing a free throw, an average person has plenty of strength to make a half-court shot. Still wouldn't be amazing though, since the other team could lock you off on offense and you'd be a huge liability on defense. You'd be good enough for the NBA, but not a superstar.

      Soccer lack of speed on the field and power on shots would be an issue, though being perfect on set peices (like corner kicks) might be worth it in such a low-scoring sport. Again, you'd be able to play, but wouldn't dominate.

      Golf your main issue would be be wind/grass conditions. Would likely have the most potential if you could learn to adjust for them though.
      ```

  - u/ArmokGoB:
    ```
    Can you copy a *recording of yourself*? Perfect repeatability, trying something thousands of times and succeeding by luck, then reviewing the footage and being able to recreate that 100% of the time, then iterate this, and build several of these independently made movements together as modules, is far more powerful than just having the same skill level as others.

    Also, "to the millimeter" is actually a really bad resolution for this. Many movement that *most* humans can make have far greater precision than that, and would fail if only done with that precision.
    ```

    - u/CaramilkThief:
      ```
      "To the millimeter" is the lowest precision you get, applied to the move the *first* time you see something (given that you see the most significant part of the action, not someone from behind). This applies to full body moves like kicks and squats as well as more precise stuff like forging a signature. The more angles and time you view the action for the more precise it gets. I'm not gonna write a mathematical expression for the increase in precision each time you see something, but suffice it to say at the higher limit it's more precise than modern transistors.
      ```

      - u/ArmokGoB:
        ```
        In that case, my iterated method would work great, and once you start getting exploitable skills you should definitely invest in a high end motion capture setup, slow motion cameras, and a hemisphere around it all covered densely in normal cameras. 

        Skills to use this with are primarily extremely fast small hand movements, that require extremely little energy and thus cause no strain to do all day and night; one of the biggest advantages of perfectly repeating something as a human is not doing it the first time, or the first 8 hours, it's being able to force yourself to do it flawlessly even given extreme fatigue and your brain having almost completely shut down, when a normal human would be shaking violently and unable to even stand up. If you set up a long chain, you might even be able to keep your body doing work while your brain is 100% asleep, and still wake up rested. 

        To be more specific, sketching and drawing with pencils or a computer tablet is the first thing I'd try; while there is obviously a lot of mental skill and creativity, and some dependence on style, motor learning is also many years, especially of photorealistic styles. And you're not limited to copying stuff other have drawn; you dont copy a whole drawing, you copy drawing a single line that doesn't look like anything on it's own, and then layer lots of them. At the very least you can translate and rotate them by moving the paper on the desk, and most likely once you've learned lots you might be able to interpolate between them. I expect you might become especially known for drawing fractals. 

        Exactly HOW fast and precise you can become depends on how exactly the power works; Does the signal need to go all the way from the brain? Does it generate at the end of the nerve into the muscle? Directly trigger the myosin proteins inside each muscle fibre? The muscles and bones of the human body can handle a faster oscillations and higher precision than the brain can conceive or the nerves have the bandwidth to convey.

    Art theft. Draw exact copies of famous paintings by watching artists drawing them

    I watch a ton of baseball. Armed with my new ability to throw any pitch anywhere in the strike zone totally perfectly, I become the greatest pitcher of all time. I'll be able to throw as fast as the strongest pitchers ever, I will never miss, and I will be able to change the way my release looks to throw off the batter at will.

    I also go to the olympics and fighting world championships every chance I get in order to have amazing body control.

    I observe surgeries to get footage of hearts beating healthily (and whatever other organs I can physically see working correctly) to boost my longevity.

    If I want to learn a language, I watch native practitioners speak in order to gain a flawless accent.

    I use my baseball money to hire two absurdly talented and expensive high-end escorts, one male and one female, and just watch them go at it for a couple hours a night for a week or two. Now I'm also really good in bed.

    I watch artists and craftsmen and chefs at work just for shits and to round out my awesome skill set.

    How does the animal's age/physical health interact with your own?  As /u/ShiranaiWakaranai suggests, the [Hydra Jellyfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydra_(genus)) is an obvious choice for the immortality.  If you can change back and forth quickly and at will, and reflect the Hydra's physical condition onto your own, then you can periodically deage yourself with the Hydra's regeneration.  There might be some quirks with the way Hydra's regeneration works and the characteristics of the species.  For one, regeneration from maiming occurs without cell division, the cells reorganize themselves.  In the case of switching back and forth, this means if you use the transformation to regenerate a leg, you might lose size/mass from elsewhere in your body.  In addition, the Hydra never progresses beyond the Polyp phase, unlike other organisms in it's class, which might mean that you revert into a child form when using the transformation to reset your human body?

    Alternatively, if the animal's form is always the same and completely independent of your own... the obvious choice is human.  Transform into your new human form and use that most of the time, only periodically transforming back to your original human body when you need to reset the age/health of your transformed human body.

      You can change anytime you want, but your animal form and your human form retains memory of it's body state. So basically both forms have their timers and they only tick when you are currently transformed.

      If you have regeneration on your animal form, then you can regenerate your animal form, but it won't grow back lost leg of your human form.

      So, if your goal is immortality, then yes, you can choose jellyfish, but at some point, you will have to start spending most of your time as jellyfish

  You can temporarily change the laws of chemistry in a relatively small area, specifically increasing or decreasing the chemical potential energy of any configuration of atoms. You can't break the laws of thermodynamics, but you can "store" around a hundred thousand calories by making reactions that lose energy relative the normal rules, and draw from that to make reactions that would otherwise create energy. You can make effects conditional, but the condition-evaluation has limited computational power and can only condition on low level physical configurations, like "Is within N nanometers of [specific transcription factor] attached to [specific DNA sniper a few tens of bases long]".

  You can control this either in real time directly with your brain, or hook it up to a computer controlling it faster and with more precision using an API, but you need to actually acquire the computer and write the code. With a lot of work, you might be able to mass produce machines that have this capability. Regardless of where and how it's used, it consumes a significant amount of energy, be prepared to need to eat more or have beefy power supply and cooling on the computer. 

  It is generally known this kind of thing is possible, and there are probably about a thousand other people that also gained these powers; it's statistically unlikely any of them is as good at creating a startup or documenting and filing a patent as the average reader of this subreddit.

    I'm not too versed in chemistry, but it seems like you might be able to purify elements from compounds by changing the laws so that compounds are more likely to separate than stay together. You could also kill people pretty easily by changing their brain chemistry, if they stay in one place.

      That's one of the crudest things you could do, yes, and one unnecessarily convoluted out of the many many ways you could kill someone. You could also make it so that all elements acted like noble gasses to separate them with a centrifuge, or turn all the water inside someone into gaseous H2 and O2.

    1. you'd be an excellent scientist for investigating material properties
    2. you could generate energy by maintaining a temperature gradient (or convert from food?)
    3. you could make a lot of money precision engineering parts at a microscopic level
    4. chain conditionals at the atomic level for an ultra-dense analog CPU (and achieve grey goo unity)

  I posed this on the Discord a week or so ago but I just saw this thread pop up in my feed and figured I could give it another spin. 

  The power is increasing or decreasing temperature, it's done by will and sight, so you look at something and it grows hotter or colder. There's fine control over temperature and the exact area of the substance affected. It's kind of like heat or frost vision, you could look at a car's tires and make them melt, or make the whole car melt. On the larger end, you could look at an Olympic-sized pool and start raising the middle of the pool to boiling, or all of the pool, or everything in the vicinity of your sight of the pool. 

  Maximum size is more than an Olympic sized pool, no minimum size but the person must be able to see it directly, the power would work through direct sight, so my ignorant ass assumes lens-based magnification would work and digital image reproduction of magnification would not. Please, please correct me here. 

  Maximum temperature would be higher than enough to melt diamonds, minimum temperature would be just above absolute zero. There's an intuitive sense of temperature but it's not precise, so if a person for example wanted to use it for a specific materials application at certain temperatures they would need help, but with the assistance of temperature measurement they could easily bump it up or down a degree. 

  My main question was asking how it could be used to make money (seems the standard create steam drive turbine was best) but I'm still curious about stranger ways such a power might be used or things you clever lot might come up with.

    Creating super low temperature is really hard and expensive.  If you can get things to just above absolute zero, I think you could get a lab or get grants for low temperature research, for example studying Bose-Einstein Condensates.  The Olympic sized pool area means you could create low temperature at a larger scale than any research before.  The only reason this wouldn't necessarily pay better than powering turbines is that the funding setup that most Research Institutes and Grants may not be able to and/or allowed to pay you your full worth.

    Depending on how the control works, you could ablate extremely complicated patterns for manufacturing, become an artist by using heat-sensitive paint that can instantly create any image they can imagine several times per minute, or use a cooled surface and IR camera as a  high-bandwidth brain machine interface in one direction.

    how much does it cost to keep giant servers and like NASA computers cold? It can't be cheap.
