## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

        In short, from chapters one through fifty,>!the MC accompanies the heiress of a dying kingdom across the world to her home, Malten. Along the way, he learns basic magic that can be modified with scientific knowledge, of stone behemoths called heathens that invade from the coasts, and meets a faerie that can read emotions. He doesn't become OP in the strictest sense, so he has to rely on building infrastructure and connections to survive.!<

      I just read it, and it's very similar to Release That Witch. Unfortunately, I can't say that's a compliment .

  - u/Prince_Silk:
    ```
    [Enlightened Empire](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20920/enlightened-empire) has some flaws in its its prose and plot, but on the whole it's probably the best, "uplift," story I've read.

    It does a great job of interesting overbuilding, follows a relatively plausible uplift timeframe and has a plot that provides realistic and balanced challenges for the MC to overcome.
    ```

    - u/CaramilkThief:
      ```
      There's a big caveat after the first arc ends though. The pacing and development slows down massively as Corco has to navigate through politics, and I can't really say that the politics are well done. There are moments of excellence in there, but the rest of it can be quite aggravating at times.
      ```

      - u/Amonwilde:
        ```
        Yes, I enjoyed the first part, and the story just seemed to...reset? Gave up on it.
        ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    Death Mage Who Doesn't Want a Fourth Time is a ridiculously over the top Japanese web novel that ends up including a degree of uplift (and nonchalant body horror). The uplift isn't particularly well done - even in universe - as it pretty much all depends on the MC's ability to generate an infinite number of golems, but he does at least use his over-powered abilities well.

  I recently got into the works of Morgenstern--[Blood is Mine](http://bloodismine.com/) and [My Delirium Alcazar](http://mda.wtf). There's all kinds of weird shit in there, including body horror, eldritch gods, strange magyyks, and futuristic technology. It's extremely fun and very bizarre. The comics are both quest-style, with readers inputting commands for the characters, so you get that good gestalt hivemind rationality; the settings themselves are also internally consistent and NPCs are played according to their motivations & capabilities. 

  They're set in the same future Earth and BiM precedes MDA, but they can be read in any order.

  Are there any well-written stories where necromancy is viewed in a positive/neutral light? Or even just stories where necromancy is used, even if it's viewed as a sort of necessary evil?

    As for simulated consciousness fics, I recently read [Transcendent Humanity](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9271192/1/Transcendent-Humanity), a Mass Effect AU where the Mars beacon didn't contain tech but a warning to stay away from Mass Effect tech, causing humans to develop more into computer/AI tech and upload themselves. It's very HFY-heavy, basically in order to enjoy it you have to stop treating the humans as main characters, and look more at how *humanity* is developing in the aftermath of the contact with the galaxy.

    An original fic that's very heavy on the subject is [Grand Design](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21216/grand-design). Basically, humanity was wiped out some thousand years ago, and civilizations have developed in their abandoned space stations. The protagonists are two human-ish gynoids who are still searching for the cause of Humanity's extinction and a means for revenge. The mind upload stuff only really starts to appear about a third in, and becomes increasingly important. This is an *actually* good story, not just compared to most of RR.

    Johannes Cabal the Necromancer is a nice fantasy series about a necromancer who sold his soul to learn necromancy, and is now working to get it back. It's charming and witty, and sometimes really funny.

    Inexorable Chaos on royalroad has the main character be a necromancer. He's overpowered, but imo it's done in a fun way. He's also supposed to be a Hero of the world, but he was hired to destroy it. It's a fun mindless story.

    This story is fun but warning for teenagers being impulsive, etc. It's fairly well written, I liked the main cast, and necromancy is treated very positively and there are some fun uses of it.

    If you are familiar with *Worm*, then the fan fic [Hebert: Wind of Death](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/hebert-wind-of-death-worm-warhammer-fantasy.486847/threadmarks), a "Warhammer Fantasy" crossover (knowledge of Warhammer not required), may be worth a look.

She is young and emotionally damaged, so things don't always work out, but that's the Worm universe for you...

        I am afraid not. There were 10 updates in early 2017, one in 2018 and another one in 2019. I guess it's "on life support but not quite dead"?

        Also, I should probably add that although the MC starts out *trying* to do the right thing using necromantic tools, things don't always (or even often) go as planned. Events escalate, bodies pile up, evil masterminds plot, supposed "heroes" are not exactly paragons of virtue, etc.

        In other words, it's pretty close to the canon *Worm* universe, although the body horror aspect is not as pronounced and the pacing is not as suffocating. Bonesaw would find it somewhat underwhelming.

      I started reading this a while back, but I found the flippant attitude of the isekai'd characters to be too disruptive for suspension of disbelief. There's one moment of trauma that the main character struggles through and then he's cured forever. Also the comedy can be pretty hit or miss, and it was miss for me most of the time.

  Okay, so. Uhm. I have about had it up to here with the standard mildly-sociopathic male protag. You know exactly the guy I am talking about. No more hufflepuff bones, no more "hard choices". I am suffering from Exhaustion by over-exposure as regards this entire Stichk. 

  So. Recs for things with a female lead that is *not* worm fanfic (Also overexposure) or things with a male lead that has actual empathy. Please. Does not have to be web fiction, books, movies ect are all fine and dandy, but it does need to be available in electronic format.

    I'm currently reading [qntm's](https://qntm.org/) SCP [Antimemetics Division](http://www.scpwiki.com/antimemetics-division-hub) (he wrote *There Is No Antimemetics Division* and *Five Five Five Five Five*). It has a female lead, but still falls prey to the "mildly-sociopathic" trope you mentioned. Also, it's completed.

    [r!Animorphs](https://archiveofourown.org/works/5627803/chapters/12963046) has multiple main characters, with a 5:2 ratio of male to female, although it starts 3:2 in the first few chapters, and each chapter is from a different person's perspective. The characters all have feelings, and undergo constant emotional struggle throughout the plot (moderate spoilers: >!they struggle emotionally with the harshness of war, make human mistakes in heats of passion, mourn losses, etc.!<. also, be warned, just because the characters have emotions doesn't mean they don't make harsh decisions). This one is not yet complete, but it does have >!64!< chapters, and it took me a few days to catch up.

    Edit: if you want something a bit more fun, then I suggest [I Became a \[Biologist\] in a Fantasy World!](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/33378/i-became-a-biologist-in-a-fantasy-world). It doesn't have a female lead, but there's no hard decisions, and it's pure escapism.

    Edit 2: Thinking about this a bit more, I think what you're looking for is [Friendship is Optimal](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal). It's short, it has a female lead, no hard decisions, the characters feel emotions in a broad sense but there's not much character development. It may induce some existential angst, but hey, what doesn't?

In this story, the mc just wants to help people by becoming a doctor like his father. The standard cliche sociopathic xanxia characters exist, but their inclusion only shows just how different MC is in comparison.

  I played a game a while ago in which time worked like a large circle instead of a line, everything repeated in an interval of a few thousand years (seamlessly, without a hard reset that time loops stories like mother of learning do and without anyone able to act 'outside the loop'). It was done well, in part because it was never stated explicitly. But the game also tried to do a lot of other things, with less success. I wouldn't recommend it unless it seems like exactly your jam. The game was >!evoland 2!<. Title is in spoiler tags in case you'd rather stumble upon it without knowing this.

      - u/CaramilkThief:
        ```
        Okay I started reading it and am on chapter 20 now. This guy's absolutely right. It's really enjoyable in that Joffrey takes the time to enjoy his loops, going to the different parts of the world in different roles. This results in short 2-3 chapter arcs that flesh out the world of GoT really well. The author also does a good job of showing Joffrey's descent into madness, ascent from madness, reconstruction, and development throughout the loops. And I'm surprised to say, but Joffrey becomes really likable! Highly recommend.

      You'll definitely miss a lot of context if you don't know anything about game of thrones. There's definitely mentions of characters that the author assumes you know about.

      Watching the show is fine though, you don't have to read the books. Or reading a plot summary of the whole thing might be enough.
      ```

    - u/ricree:
      ```
      Hard to say. On one hand, it definitely feels written as if the reader is familiar with the characters and setting. On the other, I'm pretty sure everything gets introduced satisfactorily eventually so long as you don't expect everything to be fully established at first appearance.

      Also, it spends a lot of time in parts of the world that are mostly unexplored even in supplementary material, so knowing the series doesn't help much there to begin with.

      Looking at a map of the known world probably wouldn't hurt though. Especially once the story gets past the initial sequence and he begins exploring more.

  I would prefer the podcasts be about writing or something similar to Welcome to Nightvale. To be more specific, I love the off beat comedy of Nightvale and how it manages to gradually build up a sense of what the mythos and structure of the town is like.

    The Magnus Archives is a series of horror stories that slowly tie into a greater plot. It's from the point of view of an archive manager who works at an institute that handles paranormal events, and he's digitizing the archives in recording.

    Wolf 359 is a scifi audio drama taking place on a spaceship of the same name. Mainly follows one goofy guy and his antics aboard the ship, but later on gets serious as you learn more about the world beyond the spaceship, and intrigue.

    Honestly, there's a whole subreddit for story based podcasts in /r/audiodramas.  Check out some of their recs for good dramas.

      I'm ambivalent about the Bobiverse as well, but it's what I would give as an intro to a lot of the ideas for Transhumanism / rational / optimization strategies. It's a kinder into than HPMOR at least. 

      Bob never optimizes as much as possible, and he let's his own emotional hang ups stop his duplication's when he might literally be the last Human alive. It's frustrating.

    As for simulated consciousness fics, I recently read [Transcendent Humanity](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9271192/1/Transcendent-Humanity), a Mass Effect AU where the Mars beacon didn't contain tech but a warning to stay away from Mass Effect tech, causing humans to develop more into computer/AI tech and upload themselves. It's very HFY-heavy, basically in order to enjoy it you have to stop treating the humans as main characters, and look more at how *humanity* is developing in the aftermath of the contact with the galaxy.

    An original fic that's very heavy on the subject is [Grand Design](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21216/grand-design). Basically, humanity was wiped out some thousand years ago, and civilizations have developed in their abandoned space stations. The protagonists are two human-ish gynoids who are still searching for the cause of Humanity's extinction and a means for revenge. The mind upload stuff only really starts to appear about a third in, and becomes increasingly important. This is an *actually* good story, not just compared to most of RR.

    There's nothing rational in isekai manga. If you're willing to go afield in media, I can recommend webfiction and fanfiction. Likewise, if you're fine with budging on the rational bit, I can reccomend some isekai stuff I enjoyed. But the best I can do with the overlapping venn diagrams is get "sorta close."

    Youjo Senki has some themes you'd often see in rational works, and I enjoyed it, but its structure is more of a misunderstanding comedy. It seems to be fairly popular among people here as well, from what I've seen, so insofar a rational fiction is a tallying symbol of "things people on R/Rational like," it's there. It's not rational, though, and everything else I can reccomend is even further from the search criterion.

  hello everyone, can You please help me find a web series I read some months ago.

  Its a magic school setting with a male MC that is socially awkward and has an (initally) rather weak skill. THe skill itself is something like a magic crafter.

  The main dungeon ist a tower, which members of the school climb as an entrance exam (which is also the beginning of the first book). ALso, the goal in the first book is for him to climb the tower as high as possible to find his brother. He never came back from his entrance exam in the tower.

  Last time I looked there were two full books available with the autor working on the third

  Thanks in advance for Your help!

    The first arc of [The Promised Neverland](https://mangadex.org/title/19531/yakusoku-no-neverland) is possibly the most rational story in manga ever. From there on it switches genre but it stays good, or at least it kept good as far as I've read.

    Not a lot of people seem to recommend it, but I think [Ajin](https://mangadex.org/title/9570/ajin) is the most rational manga I ever read as a whole.

    Besides that you can probably take your chances with betting manga, such as [Akagi](https://mangadex.org/title/3148/tohai-densetsu-akagi/chapters/4/), [Kaiji](https://mangadex.org/title/1874/tobaku-mokushiroku-kaiji) (both from the same author) and [Liar Game](https://mangadex.org/title/104/liar-game) all of which I've heard a lot of praise but haven't actually read yet, so, take your chances.

    If you actually want to forgo the high stakes, fantsy and sci-fi and actually want some slice-of-life romantic comedy, then I can recommend [Koi Dano Ai Dano](https://mangadex.org/title/1171/koi-dano-ai-dano) and it's prequel [Warau Kanoko-sama](https://mangadex.org/title/1708/warau-kanoko-sama) (read the prequel first; it's not as good as KDAD but you need it to understand it); [Oregairu](https://myanimelist.net/anime/14813/Yahari_Ore_no_Seishun_Love_Comedy_wa_Machigatteiru/) is also a good recomendation for slice-of-life romcom. Obviously, been romcoms, the rationality of these last few titles is not exactly in the same level of the first few, but they are enjoyable nonetheless.

    Most of the recomendations have animes which you may or may not prefer, but, with the excetion of Oregairu, which I've only seen the anime, I haven't seen the anime version of any of the others, so I can't speak for how rational the anime is. Most anime will be just a straight up adaptation from the manga, but I know for a fact the Ajin anime is different from the manga, so you might want to be on the lookout for that.

      Absolutely not recommending *The Promised Neverland*. It went so incredibly bad in the latter half, it can only be rec'd as a prime example of fucking up what started as a good writing. First arc is great, but I recommend dropping the story after finishing that arc. There is still good stuff after that, but only to get your hopes up so they can be violently crushed by the later chapters.

      *Liar Game* is awesome, but its finale is a bit underwhelming. Still, I enjoyed it a lot. The main character is a trusting, innocent cinnamon pie abused by smart participants of the Game; she gets a very intelligent friend who quickly starts using her naïveté to trick people in very imaginative ways. It's a great example of an otherwise annoying trope done right.

      [Edit] Content warning: one of the *Liar Game*'s deuteragonists is trans, and it's not handled as well as a person spoiled by modern Western media might expect. Yet, it's one of the better representation pieces in manga.

      The author of *Liar Game* has also done [*One Outs*](https://myanimelist.net/manga/11327/One_Outs) which is a rule-breaking wank. Not rational but somewhat adjacent in a sense that one of the main characters superbly munchkins the rules of baseball.

      *Kaiji*, I think, is as rational as manga gets, though there were some parts which I disliked.

      As for rational slice-of-life rom-coms, you can't go wrong with *[Kaguya-Sama](https://myanimelist.net/manga/90125/Kaguya-sama_wa_Kokurasetai__Tensai-tachi_no_Renai_Zunousen)*.

    I'm surprised [Qualia The Purple](https://myanimelist.net/manga/51493/Murasakiiro_no_Qualia) hasn't been mentioned. I would recommend going in blind. It's a short completed series, that picks up steam after playing with it's concept at the start to barrel headlong into the consequences of the ability the protagonist acquires. 

    For those who don't want to go blind, 

    >!Essentially a time looping optimization story, with the ability to traverse 'alternate' quantum realities only tangentially related to the starting universe. So one universe is normal, one universe the protagonist is a Magical girl, another her own Mother, another the head of the evil organization after her ability, etc. All of this wrapped around a fairly generic love story that serves as the end goal of the loops more than the plot focus. !<

    Ajin is a really good manga with reasonably smart characters (for the most part). It's about these humans who revive to perfect health upon death, and how they are faring in a ruthless Japanese society. 

    20th Century Boys and Monster by Naoki Urasawa are really good mystery mangas. Monster is about this surgeon who saves a kid, but later on the kid turns out to be a serial killer. 20th Century Boys is about this group of adults that start to realize that the story they wrote in their childhood is happening for real, and they try to stop it.

  With all the webcomics getting recommended over the past month, I'm surprised no one has ever mentioned *[Awful Hospital](https://bogleech.com/awfulhospital/intro.html)*.

  The world has weird but consistent rules >!that are slowly getting broken by higher powers in weird but consistent ways!<; the story is fueled by readers' suggestions which leads to sometimes absurd, sometimes very rational choices (with very few in-betweens); readers are a part of the setting which leads to some fascinating interactions;  tons of foreshadowing; characters have well-defined goals that they pursue.

  Not rational, but a very fun read regardless, IMO.

  I have to warn though that the story has a lot of body horror and gross-out, and having nice, detailed art style definitely doesn't help if one is squeamish.

    I binged it all in one day and absolutely second this recommendation. I'll add that while there are many cardboard cutout characters as a necessity of the choose-your-own-adventure MSPA-style format, there are rational actors with complex and even sympathetic motivations, both antagonistic and allied to the main character. It also does a good job of justifying certain absurdist aspects that seem counter-rational at the beginning, namely that
    >!the reason the Hospital is so awful and dysfunctional but still functions and receives patronage is that a conceptual, antimemetic corruption has taken root in the facility as well as the greater uni/multiverse to a lesser extent!<.

  I'm looking for physics data on the hardness of materials, average strength of human thrown javelins, how to calculate penetrative power and damage levels etc. Can anyone point me out in a helpful direction ? Maybe a forum or subreddit where people know these things and can answer questions.

  &#x200B;

  Been making due with speed of thrown baseballs, force equations, and armor protective levels given projectile speed and mass but it's been quite convoluted, and I can't be sure it's accurate..

  I'm trying to build a magic system that's very grounded and low powered but with high utility for a story and I'd like to check some number so I can put the proper limitations in place without having my characters becoming more powerful than I want them to be, while also having tools be physically useful to mages.

    Course textbooks for forensic ballistics, maybe? They'd be mostly talking about gunshot wounds, but if they provide formulas for armor penetration that could be a starting point.

    I've had a class in ceramics, and the prof talked about a ballistic vest project they had, I can dig it up if you're interested. But we didn't cover javelin impacts, I'd have remembered that.
    ```

    - u/fassina2:
      ```
      What I was doing was looking up tables on the ratings of armor based on what weapons and at what distance they can protect from what weapon, with projectile speed, mass and density.

      To get the forces applied to a javelin and how likely it'd be to penetrate said armor I just imputed the data from javelins, mass, speed, material density and doubled the minimum required force to penetrate because the javelin has a higher surface area than a bullet.

      With the forces I was using things got confusing and I'd need to determine the damage it'd be likely to inflict if it didn't penetrate, effective range etc.

      If the penetration didn't happen frequently enough people would likely use something simpler and cheaper like rocks or metal balls. But I like the aesthetic of the javelin more for the setting. 

      I want it to be unit on unit, and military applications in general. Nations of mages vs nations of mages warfare where magic isn't overpowered and common.
