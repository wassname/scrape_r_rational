## Recommending stories of protagonists with mental disorders

### Post:

I found a very interesting story called [See Noir Evil](http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-16978/MMcGregor+See+Noir+Evil.htm). It's a fanfiction of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and it stars Xander who is not entirely sane. It's very well-written, but it involves him going crazy due to months of torture and while it's not overly gory, it doesn't shy away from describing his trauma and fears of never being sane again. It starts with him escaping from his captives and the first two or three chapters are a good measure of the worst the story will get with its descriptions.

Summary:

> They say Xander killed them all. They say Xander’s crazy. Xander says he’s crazy too. It’s only Xander’s imaginary friend who says otherwise.

However, the really interesting part of this story is the fact that due to his madness, he's capable of performing magic. Basically [Power Born of Madness](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerBornOfMadness) or Insanity has Advantages.

Note that while I wouldn't label this story as rational, it's very well written and in my opinion worth recommending here (as long as you ignore the very last two chapters which seems to be meant as a very confusing sequel hook).

So I'm wondering if anyone here can recommend stories involving a crazy protagonist or or someone who is trying to function in spite of a mental disorder?

  Steins;Gate doesn't outright explain the protagonist's eccentricity, but I think he is a high functioning schizophrenic. Whenever he's under stress, he pretends he's fighting against an evil conspiracy that he claims is real in the moment to excuse his behavior, but later admits it's imaginary. I have no idea if this is an accurate portrayal of schizophrenia, and he does have other quirks based around him acting like the over the top mad scientist he sees himself as, but I bought into him as a man trying to live a satisfying life outside of his delusions.

  My recommendation for the show is only appended by the fact that while I positively adored the characters, some of whom also might have mental disorders, the plot is not very rational and the villains are just evil for the sake of it. It's really a drama about people's relationships with each other and the tough choices they make that effect them, with a sci-fi gadget to get the plot going and a threat to add tension. If you can enjoy a story just from its characters, then I say check it out.

  [The Northern Caves](http://archiveofourown.org/works/3659997/chapters/8088522) involves some altered mental states; Scott Alexander wrote an interesting interpretation of it [based on several characters in the work sharing a particular mental disorder](http://slatestarscratchpad.tumblr.com/post/131724464066/spoiler-warning-tnc-my-interpretation-of-the). It's a pretty good story IMO.

  I REALLY like the madness depicted in Susanna Clarke's Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell - the depictions of madness from Strange's POV are particularly interesting and horrifying (if not particularly realistic or based on modern medical practice/knowledge).

  There's a [story](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8923291/1/DID-You-Hear-The-Rabbit-Cry) where HP has [Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)](http://did-research.org/), written by [someone](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1950194/demon-lilith) with DID.  Very illuminating.  All links are to that person's content.  /u/ToaKraka linked it in a recommendation thread.

  Best I've found is The Eyes, an HP fanfic. But the universe is Lovecraftian, and HP actually behaves in a remarkably sane way given that problem, so this may or may not fit.
