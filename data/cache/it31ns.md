  Bless my innocent mind, I thought the 'lucky' part was about their having started having sex at all ; and that the 'four of us together' meant Joon, Mary, Grak and Solace.
  ```

  - u/Luminous_Lead:
    ```
    I missed that "two clones on a ship with us" line the first few times I read it, but I still think your initial reasoning is sound, especially since Mary always refers to the clones as "me", and doesn't treat them like they're a separate person.
    ```

    - u/WhispersOfSeaSpiders:
      ```
      Err, 'four of us together' can definitely be parsed as the Marys (?) and Juniper.

      Me and Juniper = us

      Me and me and me and Juniper = us
      ```

  I think this is a good opportunity to specifically say "I don't know". It can certainly be parsed as euphemism for sex, or it can just be Mary appreciating platonic relationship time.

  Three things point toward the null hypothesis imo --

  * (Pri-)Mary likes spending time with Joon, and the other clones have relatively less fun jobs -- and this is why she's so bubbly of late, because she's the locus of "fun" for all 30 of her. Now there are 3x as many Marys in the "fun" role
  * Joon makes an incredibly big deal about sex, and he doesn't make another peep about any hypothetical orgies with him involved.
  * I almost forgot the obvious one - Mary is still ace, yeah?

  I almost wonder if I'm supposed to parse this as "the DM dropping bait for Joon" -- like, hey buddy, nudge nudge, the newspapers are writing the most *salacious* stories about you and your loving wife who would totally indulge you in anything that would make you happy. Too bad they're just stories, totally unlike this virtual universe that definitely doesn't ever run on anything resembling storybook logic...

  Then they just play a board game and go to bed

  It often occurs to me that Joon is way to depressed for this harem story.

      "Oh no, here's a girl who seems to have been literally designed specifically to appeal to me as deeply as possible!"

      "Oh no, we're in a relationship!"

      "Oh no, we're married!" (but it's fake and we acknowledge that and lots of people are trying to get me to have sex with other women)

      "Oh no, she's been cloned and we're all having giant orgies and she's 100% OK with that! Woe is me!"

      Everyone else ever: DUDE.

        Idk I think it’s important that your partner is happy in the relationship, and specially with the romantic/sexual aspects of it.

        That's kinda overlooking the whole "torturing countless people forever" thing, though. Things would admittedly be great for Joon if he was a sociopath, but he's not.
        ```

      - u/ConscientiousPath:
        ```
        rofl and he doesn't even focus on taking advantage of his class-defining super power by leveling up either. He doesn't even consider that if he were to have a super high level, being OP all the time would be considered normal and would potentially help avoid more exclusions.
        ```

        - u/Argenteus_CG:
          ```
          I think it's a side effect of the way he patched his levelup obsession.
          ```

        - u/xamueljones:
          ```
          He set his level up value to be as low as it could possibly get. While he still knows it's important intellectually, he doesn't act as if there's any value to leveling as quickly as possible in an emotional sense. Which fits with how low he set the level up value.
          ```

    - u/Luminous_Lead:
      ```
      That she's not sexually attracted to him and treats it as manual labour is a key part of his insecurity.
      ```

  - u/GreenSatyr:
    ```
    That part is actually quite realistic. Try being polyamorous sometime,  you will find it does not cure depression at all! The only thing that changes is that you don't have the excuse of being lonely to blame it on anymore. And Joon is monogamous on top of that, he doesn't even want this situation.
    ```

  - u/ClaireBear1123:
    ```
    He's amazingly non-masculine. It's pretty weird how essentially every character in this serial is a woman or acts like one.
    ```

    - u/GreenSatyr:
      ```
      Listen buddy you can be a man or you can be a three dimensional character with a complex inner life but you can't be both!
      ```

    - u/DXStarr:
      ```
      Arthur, Reimer and Fallatehr all read as "masculine intellectual/nerd" to me.

      But a lot of the story is about how Joon feels. So anybody close to Joon also is going to be shown responding in some way to Joon's introspections, or the story wouldn't have a good way to include scenes focused on that character.

      They might care with rolling eyes or with self-hating frustration or with sadism, but all Joon's companions treat his thoughts and feelings as worth noticing.

      And "interested in your feelings" traditionally codes feminine, or else a man who's romantically interested in you.

      Classic masculine tough-guy antics? Those go well with "it's just business, we get the job done, and in between witty quips we bite down on our feelings."

      Which is a fun story, but the exact opposite of WTC. WTC is protagonist navel-gazing turned into art.
      ```

      - u/CaramilkThief:
        ```
        Speaking of navel gazing, have you ever read a story which has positive navel gazing? It seems like any book with a lot of introspection inevitably goes towards having a depressed mc. Robin Hobb's Farseer, Savage Divinity, Prince of Thorns, etc. Are there any books with a mentally well-adjusted-enough person who introspects?
        ```

        - u/DXStarr:
          ```
          Lois Bujold and T. Kingfisher both specialize in effective, thoughtful, introspective protagonists.

          But in their case the introspection is more about sensibly facing the situation you're already dealing with, rather than getting better at your life or career *by* better mental hygiene.

          On the other hand, their characters are a whole lot saner and sweeter than the heroes of Lord of the Mysteries or Time Braid.

          I definitely recommend Lois Bujold and T Kingfisher (aka Ursula Vernon) if you're looking for smart, sweet, 70% sensible characters who do genuinely heroic things for smart, sweet, and 50% sensible reasons.
          ```

- u/Memes_Of_Production:
  ```
  They definitely had a foursome, I think its the only logical read. Which means [I have a job to do](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/fq9t4q/worth_the_candle_chapter_192_cooldown/flqybjm/?context=3) the next time I am in Tokyo...
  ```

- u/BoojumG:
  ```
  > I am reading too much into it?

  No, it seemed pretty straightforward to me. I don't have anything that fits the text better than what you suggest.
  ```

- u/DXStarr:
  ```
  I think the author's whole point was that it's awfully tempting for us to just eroticize the harem sex, like the in-world newspapers are doing. But if we do that, if we think it's all about hitting a kink scorecard, we'll miss things.

  Yes, they're having clone-augmented sex. But it's not the important thing about her clones to Mary, and it's not the important thing about their sex to Joon.

  Which in turn ties back to the disconnect that drives the whole story: the disconnect between playing a tabletop RPG hero and living as one.
  ```

  - u/DXStarr:
    ```
    Though it tells you how cool WTC is that the story pulls this off. I mean, AW has written a story with "clone orgies" as a perfectly logical consequence that barely rates discussion by the characters, even when they're talking about their sex lives!
    ```

- u/gramineous:
  ```
  Eh. The first bold bit comes across as teasing, and the second bit could easily be more generally about hangups on monogomy and how that becomes blurred with clones. The last bit does imply intimacy in a group manner, but the specific depth of which isn't a given, due to the variety of paths they could take and Joon's general hang ups with expressing his sexuality.

  Something probably happened, "foursome" unlikely the fully accurate term, but given the text before is talking about how the actual action is less important than the specific details I don't think this is going to matter in the grand scheme of things.

  Also, I used to spend time in the kink/bdsm/queer club scene (pre-quarantine, pre-best place in my city shutting down) and there are a variety of ways of being a variety of levels of intimate, but given such places haven't been explicitly mentioned in Aerb I'm assuming the comments by the general public are prone to simplifying the situation a lot too from a lack of experience/knowledge. So grains of salt on everything being talked about in universe too.
  ```

- u/Ricen_:
  ```
  >"**She had two clones on the ship with us.** "

  That bit right there makes it clear to me.  That the author felt he needed to clarify that there are 2 other clones at that specific point makes it obvious they are having sex.

  Yes, they are having foursomes.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I'm not sure about that, them having ahem PiV is fairly important as it seals the deal on their marriage thus seals the deal on the trial by combat which grak was complaining to joon in earlier chapters.
    ```

- u/LazarusRises:
  ```
  Hijacking this post to ask if anyone can remind me what the Couch Potato is. The last chapter of the latest batch mentions it, and I know it has something to do with why TV can't exist on Aerb, but I forget the details. The wiki isn't very helpful.

    > There’s a planar entity,” said Raven. “Under certain circumstances, it’s capable of altering the electron stream within a television in order to produce moving images of its own design. Some of those designs are capable of producing … effects.”

    > “Specifically,” said Amaryllis, gritting her teeth.

    > “Mental changes in those who view them,” said Raven. “The effects vary.” She continued on quickly, because it seemed like Amaryllis was going to press the issue again. “The best case scenario is increased mental acuity, decreased reaction times, better impulse control, and lessened emotional response, which comes packaged with a direct line of communication to the entity itself. Non-replicable when the moving pictures are recorded, in case you were wondering. The ‘gifts’ are temporary and used as leverage. In the worst case … there are a lot of worst cases. The entity can make people into flesh puppets. It can leave them comatose. It can hold them hostage in their own bodies, locked in, which it does if it thinks that will give it an advantage.”

    > “And why wouldn’t you --” Amaryllis paused. “Ah. Cultists.”

    > “Cultists,” nodded Raven. “Not like those that worship the infernals though, because there’s every indication that the entity is forthright in honoring the promises he makes. There have been scenarios where knowledge of the entity was presented to the world at large, as you suggest, in the hopes of mutual cooperation. The result, every time, was a race to the bottom as the nations of the world attempted to be the first to get on the entity’s good side. World population undergoes a precipitous drop once the entity has its toehold, until eventually the last one percent of survivors live in something approaching a paradise for a decade or two before the entity is brought to immanence. From there, it’s a paradise with bodily sacrifices. The contorted writings of those living in that world are something to behold.”

  Related question: Have Joon and Mary had full blown intercourse as of yet? I do remember that she's given him handjobs and blowjobs, and they've kissed a fair number of times, but I can't recall if they ever made a home run happen. AW is good at keeping that stuff subtle, so it's likely I read over the detail and missed it.
  ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    No, they haven't. Some people interpret the quote in the OP as them having had sex, but it doesn't make any sense from a character/story perspective. Joon is repeatedly shown to place importance on full sexual intercourse, and to have the leadup and resolution of that in his relationship with Amaryllis *happen off screen and only be mentioned once* would be pretty terrible story telling. My interpretation of the above is that Amaryllis is giving Joon blowjobs, and he feels guilty that he isn't really able to reciprocate.
