  Thank you for the story, I'm really enjoying it!

  I like the narrative shenanigans similar to the Practical Guide and look forward to reading what you will come up with!

  I'm enjoying the story so far. The worldbuilding is nice and the characters feel 3-dimensional. Looking forward to see where this is going.

  I am wondering about the title. Haven't seen any eschatology in the series yet.

    Eschatology means "the part of theology concerned with death, judgment, and the final destiny of the soul and of humankind." I think the relevance to an apocalyptic story is pretty clear...

  ```
  Can someone give me a summary of what to expect from this? I've liked roughly 50% of the things I've seen posted to this subreddit, and I'm hoping to avoid wasting a couple hours before deciding it isn't my cup of tea.
