### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I've been reading a lot of comics lately. The variety of stories and aesthetics are a refreshing palate cleanser from manga's more homogenous storytelling and art.

  **Comics -- Completed**

  [Alt-life](https://readcomiconline.li/Comic/Alt-Life)

  * Humanity flees into virtual reality to escape a dying earth. Philosophical.

  [Pride of Baghdad](https://readcomiconline.li/Comic/Pride-of-Baghdad)

  * Lions escape a zoo during the sack of Baghdad (2003). Based on real events, though naturally the lions are quite a bit more introspective in this comic that they would have been in real life.

  [Aether and empire](https://readcomiconline.li/Comic/%C3%86ther-Empire)

  * Steampunk mars expedition.

  [Guinea pigs](https://readcomiconline.li/Comic/Guinea-Pigs)

  * A little like "flowers for algernon" except the pill inverts some personality traits instead of directly making people smarter.

  [920London](https://readcomiconline.li/Comic/920London/TPB?id=172150)

  * A period-accurate comic set in a distant, romantic past complete with exactingly accurate costume aesthetics. Specifically, it follows scene kids in London in 2005. Also everyone is a furry and on drugs? Or it might just be a [Lackadaisy Cats](https://www.lackadaisycats.com/) thing where it's just an artistic aesthetic chosen by the author? Or it might be a [Child](https://mangadex.org/title/ad42a9f3-8e8e-405e-88be-2ca2bbe4847b/child)/[Child 4koma](https://mangadex.org/title/4f665ec1-a93a-46e4-936d-54bfde53063b/child-4koma) thing where it's intended to represent altered states of mind on the part of the main characters? Anyways, it's surprisingly good, so go read it and decide for yourself.

  **Comics -- Ongoing**

  [Crashing](https://readcomiconline.li/Comic/Crashing)

  * Medical drama in a secret supernatural hospital.

  [Eight Billion Genies](https://readcomiconline.li/Comic/Eight-Billion-Genies)

  * Everyone on earth gets a single wish. Things go very wrong.

  [Public Domain](https://readcomiconline.li/Comic/Public-Domain)

  * This one is about copyright and superheroes. Much better than it sounds, even if you're the kind of person who already cares about both copyright and superheroes.

  [Animal Castle](https://readcomiconline.li/Comic/Animal-Castle)

  * Animal farm spiritual sequel where the animals nonviolently protest against their dictatorship.

  [Radiant Black](https://readcomiconline.li/Comic/Radiant-Black)

  * Superhero comic. Does some interesting stuff with its protagonist, and doesn't require you to read a bunch of ancillary works.

  [Birdking](https://readcomiconline.li/Comic/Birdking)

  * Hard to explain, but the aesthetics are great.

  [Squarriors](https://readcomiconline.li/Comic/Squarriors-2016)

  * Darker-and-edgier redwall.

  **Manga -- Completed**

  [Andy](https://mangadex.org/title/088803b7-961b-4100-b728-8a331d5a5f77/andy)

  * Fascinating little oneshot by the same author as Deus.

  ["A Manga Where Everyone Except Me is Drawn by AI"](https://mangadex.org/title/13ab94bd-d49d-45ab-9356-78ef91eecac0/boku-no-kanojo-wa-ai-sakuga)

  * Oneshot. Exactly what it says on the tin.

  [From Star Strings](https://mangadex.org/chapter/52b5c842-5d58-41d1-8358-b5e86199e699/70)

  * Oneshot from the same mangaka as Made in Abyss. Same gorgeous aesthetics and worldbuilding, 95% less pedophilia.

  [Ultimate Rock-Paper-Scissors](https://mangakakalot.com/manga/be919195)

  * Exactly what it says on the tin

  [BIBLIOMANIA](https://mangadex.org/title/d22ae7a1-cfae-475a-a8fc-589ef85eece4/bibliomania)

  * Wack. Good stuff.

  [Farewell, Eri](https://mangadex.org/title/c9926df8-a200-40ba-8c05-0f5b375180c9/sayonara-eri)

  * If you haven't read this oneshot yet I don't know what you're doing with your life.

  **Manga -- Ongoing**

  [Deus](https://mangadex.org/title/f5b41dc4-16af-4c13-b22b-154836ec2b82/deus)

  * Only a single chapter is out for this manga and I'm already hooked. I really, really hope it gets picked up.

  [Virgin Extinction Island](https://mangadex.org/title/574b07c1-8094-47c5-b704-5d9b6b00bbc4/virgin-extinction-island)

  * No manga with a premise as dumb as this one's deserves to be so good. Sometime in volume 5 it [grows a beard](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard) and turns from a truly low-effort comedy manga into something with a surprising amount of heart. Not that it ever stops being a low-effort comedy manga, but I happened to find it hilarious so YMMV.

  Are there any hopeful cyberpunk stories, where the protagonist makes a meaningful impact to making the lives of the people better or sets the world on a path towards healing. Something akin to breaking down the current toxic systems and implementing new ones.

      Another note on Pact: Normally in stories the protagonist gains new options and is able to solve new situations through clever use of reasoning and their powers or whatnot. In Pact, the protagonist is under so much pressure that the only thing keeping him alive is his survival instinct and luck. The last quarter of the story feels like a cornered rat sacrificing its limbs one by one to live one more hour. It's a bit of a harrowing experience.

  - u/nullmove:
    ```
    I have a similar request to yours, though maybe a bit more specific. I would like to see a rationalist crushed by the sheer weight of the ambition itself. Basically an impossibly audacious ambition, but a protagonist with sheer grit, willpower and executive function (intelligence is secondary) to boot.

    I am actually thinking of Amaryllis from Worth the Candle (and also her alternate timeline self, Cypress). I think I am looking for same qualities as you, but brutal and relentless circumstance perhaps limits the protagonist to have to be always reactive (and indeed Pact is a great suggestion there), whereas I am looking for a more proactive ambition (cue that Amaryllis quote of reacting to problem generation source vs heading straight for the end goal like utopia).

Reinhard is decisive and angrier, and has wanted to unite the galaxy since childhood.

  Can anyone recommend stories which work towards either tech-ing up or introducing magic / artifacts but in a relatively modern setting?

  IE, based off the real world, or a tv-show based setting, but trying to move it towards a high tech or high magic setting?

  I don't mean as a result of societal upheaval, like for example the stories which has a "system" introduced into a modern day setting or for example a [Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gate_%28novel_series%29) story, but instead one where an individual, has the ability to invent tech or use magic, perhaps working with others, trying to figure out how to effect large scale change of some kind. Even if that's as simple as make life in their town / community better.

  Bonus if they're trying to intelligently stay under the radar or they have to engage with other groups / manage politics as they start growing in capability.
  ```

  - u/Silphendio:
    ```
    The obvious examples are Release that Witch (chinese WN) and A Hero's War (on RoyalRoad).

    Both feature an engineer being transported into a world with magic and starting an industrial revolution.
    ```

    - u/folconred:
      ```
      Sure, but unfortunately they're both set in a quasi-medieval fantasy setting from what I recall? Don't get me wrong, I've read and enjoyed both, so other examples of those would be interesting, so thank you for the recommendations.

      However, that's missing a lot of the modern part I think. Even something set in the 1800's or 1900's could work, as you'd have things like recognisable institutions or a modern military.

      I'm just envisaging someone with abilities having to deal with functioning institutions, even if only in their very earliest incarnations, so if it's set in the US, having to work around or with law enforcement, politicians, organised crime, unions, the judicial system, factories, business owners in a chamber of commerce. As well as them having to deal with, some person who can make things like cheap food, ray guns, rapid fabrication of small to medium goods or large structures (sup com style tech with a limited library anyone?), complex repair tech, high speed transport which could be used for smuggling, or magical equivalents like summoning, artificing, teleportation, duplication.

      Uplifting fantasy is fun and all, but it's rarely different than uplifting medieval ones. A good writer can make it entertaining, but I'm wondering if anyone has innovated in the other direction, what does it look like when someone tries to uplift our society?

      A really simple example might be someone dreaming up a simple high tech setting like, a space opera setting, an FTL capable society, or supcom tech and going, ok, take someone from there and bring them to now or a few decades before, maybe their the equivalent of an engineer or they've got some basic bits to start from, what happens next?

      A engineer from Star Trek in [Peaky Blinders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaky_Blinders_%28TV_series%29), original Sherlock Holmes London, or [Castle's New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_%28TV_series%29) who ignores the Prime Directive for some reason and just decides to go uplift? Idealistic, competent and willing to work with others to bring society back to what they're used to? Having to dodge entrenched interests of all the other players who aren't really ready to move to this new future.
      ```

      - u/Silphendio:
        ```
        Whoops, I totally misread your question. Must have been the lack of sleep.

        The only thing I can think of is a DC fanfic, With this Ring, but it takes a while until the uplift part, and then the protagonist is already so powerful that politics is just an afterthought.

        I think our modern world is so open to innovation that the greatest problem for the alien/genius inventor would be keeping control of their tech as competitors crop up.

        How about real world examples like Thomas Edison, or maybe Steve Jobs? Both have movies made about them, though those focus more on drama than the impact of their inventions.
        ```

        - u/folconred:
          ```
          Thanks for the recs, I've not thought about the Thomas Edison film, so that's worth a look.

          With this Ring really does succeed in not accepting that the status quo is inviolable, so that's a plus for it. Though it does drag a bit for me in the later chapters. 

          It's definitely a challenging ask I think, but I'd be really interested in seeing one done, I was really hoping I've missed someone writing something =)...

          I've seen things that are adjacent, but they're largely set in some other settings, similar to With This Ring such as [A Song of Chaos](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-song-of-chaos-mtg-young-justice-crossover.324537/), it's not very complex and the MC has their dumb moments, but I've read it a couple of times and would like the author to continue it one day.

          Thoughts that I've had about how to do it:

          1. Take a fairly fleshed out setting that's technically more sophisticated either tech-wise or magic-wise and then create a pathway for how we get from modern society to some of those developments. So for magic that could be Harry Potter or Mystborn and I've mentioned Star Trek before.

          2. Dig into sourcebooks like GURPS Ultra-Tech, Traveller, Eclipse-Phase, GURPS Magic, Ars Magica (the spell system is very open-ended), DnD magic, pick a few things that could "reasonably" be done by our enterprising person who's a fish out of water in our modern day, who's looking to improve their lot in life and perhaps take society with them =)...

          By focusing relatively narrowly on the main character and limiting the ripple effects to a few key people who are able to aggressively innovate on what abilities the MC is adding to the setting, due to fear of the new or unknown, or just not being smart enough or lucky. Innovation is hard after all. It should be possible to reduce the chaotic aspects a bit and keep the story threads under control.

Over time it gradually evolves from "trying to find enough cash in the dungeon to pay the rent while not getting killed" to slowly developing ambitions to uplift and reform modern society using magical powers and resources pulled from hidden dungeons.

  Thoroughly enjoyed reading [Hard Enough](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/hard-enough-pokemon-si.102511/#post-23596192) mostly for how the story weaves together a story about a person involved with dramatic adventures while also writing significantly about the mc' family life and interactions.

  Did not realize just how much I enjoyed how the story combines a good overarching action plot with slice of life storytelling. Found it extremely satisfying to see an action/adventure story mc actually have and care for his family. Especially with how that family isn't relegated to being single chapter minor characters.

  Looking for recommendations of stories where the mc and their family is a part of the story. Especially if that family is not extremely relevant or integral to the main action plot. Very important that there is a main plot though. Not interested in a pure slice of life story or even one that could be considered a slice of life story with some plot elements. Looking for the opposite.

  To be more precise, looking for a action/adventure story with significant slice of life (preferable with family) elements. Something along the lines of a 60:40 split is what I'm looking for.

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    Have you read [Ar'Kendrythist](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26727/arkendrithyst)? The family in the story is really just the protagonist and his daughter. The premise is that a middle aged dad and his 22 yo daughter gets isekaied to a world with magic. The daughter takes to magic like a fish to water, while the dad struggles to adapt, though he *does* adapt. In terms of the main plot though, the daughter is mostly a side piece, relevant but not part of the main plot. The ratio of slice of life to action is more like 50/50, with some chapters being more action when the climax of the arc hits. What I really liked about the story is that even the slice of life sections manage to be relevant to the plot instead of being pure filler.

  I started reading "Pound the Table" after noticing it recommended here several times and I have to ask: when does it get rational? I'm on chapter 6 so far and while it's a deliciously over-the-top satire of liberal feminism I haven't seen anyone act rationally yet.

  Edit: I can't reply to the below post even though I can see it in my inbox so I'm appending my response here.

  > I have no idea how you came to the conclusion that the story was a satire of liberal feminism, it very clearly is not.

  Perhaps the story changes tone later on, but up to the >!voir dire!< section of chapter 6 the main character:

  >!* Demonstrates she is completely incompetent as a lawyer:
   * She doesn't know the difference between federal and state court procedure and cites [Federal Rule of Evidence 403](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_403) in an *in liminie* motion in her state court case (the equivalent rule in New York  is [4.06](https://www.nycourts.gov/judges/evidence/4-RELEVANCE/4-relevance.shtml), this is a mistake that should shame a 1L).
   * In a flagrant breach of professional ethics she becomes a fact witness in her own client's case by handling evidence at the crime scene herself, which would disqualify her from representing him. (Private investigators exist for a reason.)
   * Commits several violations of federal civil rights law by seeking to exclude jurors based on their sex and race.
  * Blames every problem she has on supposed discrimination against her despite all of them being of her own making:
   * She hasn't been promoted to partner at her firm yet. She somehow thinks it's because she's a woman, and not that she's an idiot who deserves to be disbarred (see above).
   * Continually complains about having to wear high heels, ignoring the fact that *she has illusion superpowers* and could wear flats or even Uggz and just glamour them to look like heels.
   * Resents being judged on her appearance (petite, attractive blonde) despite using aforementioned illusion superpowers to look like a petite, attractive blonde. (Not that it stops her from judging other people based on their appearances.)
  * Somehow believes she's underprivileged when she's a *literal multi-millionaire with superpowers*:
   * From Chapter 6: " We wanted people from underprivileged or more diverse areas – my own neighborhood, Greenwich Village, was the gold standard here". For those that don't know Greenwich Village is one of the richest neighborhoods in the entire country.
  * Ohh, and in Chapter 1 she becomes a willing accessory to murder of a guy who catches her burglarizing a house and the only thing that seems to upset her about it is that she didn't get to interrogate the victim before he died.


  >!In summary, the main character is an overprivileged buffoon who grandstands about morality and fairness while acting as a rank hypocrite whose only guiding principle is her own advancement. Basically a female Harry Flashman, minus the self-awareness.

    It only gets more ridiculous later on. If you end up reading further, please consider extending your list of legal errors and professional conduct violations.

    I don't know if it was intended to be satire or not, but it's funny either way.

    I don't know mate, I think some of that is a bit off. I can't say some things because you're on chapter 6, but: 

    While it is weird she doesn't use her super powers to make it seem like she's wearing heels, it seems implied that she has a hard/harder time making illusions larger than the base object, so that'd explain the petite. As for the blonde, I imagine the blonde is how the SI looked liked before the reincarnation or whatevs, so prolly just comfortable, and for the attractiveness, I imagine it's just easier to be more attractive. It's well established people who are attractive are usually more convincing, so for a lower it makes sense to edit oneself to be attractive. I also think it's totally possible to benefit while resenting the fact that those things are a benefit. 

    Next, I think the bit where she feels underprivileged is more in regards to being a mutant (though I do * think*she mentions how she's one of the lucky one's as she can disguise herself, though I can't quite remember) than wealth. While having superpowers does help, it's still probably pretty damn inconvenient having a decent portion of the population hate you on sight, especially since, as shown with the case, if you use your superpowers to try to defend yourself, it might make the whole thing worse. 

    As for the murder, to be fair, more specifically it was a murder of a Nazi, specifically who, along with being a wanted war criminal, was still, as far as I can recall, having connections to Hydra. Add that she herself is Jewish, it's pretty understandable why she doesn't exactly feel *too* terrible about dude dying. 

    I can't talk about the law bits because I'm not a lawyer, and the Author seems to be lawyer (implied with a couple of their self-inserts being lawyers in their og lives) and you seem to be more knowledgeable then average so I have no part in those bits. 

    Anyway, even if all of the above was untrue, I don't really feel like it'd neccesarily a satire of liberal-feminism.

    Recommendations in this thread do not need to have people acting rationally, many of these recommendations are just something people have gotten enjoyment out of. 

    I have no idea how you came to the conclusion that the story was a satire of liberal feminism, it very clearly is not.

  Any readable popcorn manga / manhwa ? Preferably in a sword and sorcery setting. Doesn't need to be anything great, just a fun popcorn read with a decent number of chapters 50-80+. 

  &#x200B;

  Mostly looking for something fun to read on the second monitor while doing other things. A couple I enjoyed lately, these are quite good though, no need to be comparable. 

  &#x200B;

  [Father, Unrivaled.](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/k9cv670/father-unrivaled) I've recommended this a few times, after his wife dies in childbirth the MC who was a wandering warrior has to find a job. The translation is a bit iffy at the start, as is common on new series but gets better quickly. Kind of like Beware the chicken, but better imho.

  &#x200B;

  [Master Villainess the Invincible.](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/kgbarka/master-villainess-the-invincible) Isekai with a female perspective into a martial arts world. It's a well written and executed version of the genre. Not perfect, but compared to most manhwa / manga it's very good.

    I assume you've already read ***Frieren*** since its the best thing since sliced bread, unfinished, 105 chapters.  

    Bard Lowen is nice, unfinished, bit slice-of-lifey, only 32 chapters but those are pretty long.  

    Faraway Paladin, unfinished, bit too earnest for your popcorn pref, 50 chapters as of this month. 

    Isekai Uncle, unfinished, isekai twist in that we follow the returned isekai protag, 45 chapters. 

    The Elf and the Hunter's Item Atelier, finished, bit cutesy, 32 chapters.

      Faraway Paladin I read the LNs for, then checked out some of the anime and a bit of the manga when that came out. I know saying "go read the books, they're better" is a cliche response, but genuinely they are dramatically better than the adaptations, since a major draw of the work is the protagonist's internal thoughts. Without them he just comes across as a ~~shounen himbo~~ humble/naive warrior with absurd strength, instead of a guy earnestly decided to put his trust in people out of a conscious decision about the type of person he has resolved to be, constantly cognizant of who he once was.

    In no particular order:

    [SSS-Class Revival Hunter](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/7v63sfr/sss-class-revival-hunter) has a clever starting gimmick, played intelligently, and never stops being smart. The protagonist, through some lucky coincidences, becomes Very Stronk. After briefly reveling in his newfound fame and power, he realizes that he still feels unfulfilled -- and he sets about trying to find true meaning in his life by becoming the best person he can be. This one counts as popcorn, but it's *really good* popcorn with a heart.

    [Killer Shark in Another World](https://mangadex.org/title/da7e2b0b-72a9-419c-b667-6a02c2c7c771/isekai-kuimetsu-no-same) is dumb but funny, at least for a while. Our protagonist is a summoner in another world, and her familiar is "a motherfucking shark!!" with all the outlandish powers of cheesy shark movies in one invincible package. It can fly in a tornado, it has up to three heads and a bunch of tentacles, it can swim through solid land, et cetera. This manga takes itself as seriously as it should, i.e. not at all.

    [Otherworldly Munchkin: Let's Speedrun the Dungeon with Only 1 HP!](https://mangadex.org/title/39741b91-7782-452d-984b-70b3df834976/isekai-munchkin-hp-1-no-mama-de-saikyou-saisoku-danjon-kouryaku) Our protagonist and his little sister get transported to another world by an evil goddess, and it runs on a rules-as-written pencil-and-dice RPG system similar to Dungeons and Dragons. He steals her rulebook -- it looks suspiciously similar to the Player's Handbook -- and now is trying to find his sister, in case she's in trouble. The problem is that, due to a curse from the evil goddess, he's stuck with only one hit point. If he gets hit with an arrow doing 1d4 damage, he's dead no matter how the dice fall. He's going to really need that 11-foot pole.

    [Sengoku Komachi Kuroutan](https://mangadex.org/title/a4304d3b-191d-471f-8c78-353d403a35d0/sengoku-komachi-kuroutan-noukou-giga): a student at a modern agricultural high school slips back through time into the Warring States Period. She quickly finds herself a vassal of Oda Nobunaga, tasked with improving crop yields in a village that has been having trouble paying its taxes (in rice). As the series goes on, she keeps moving up in the world and making feudal Japan much less poor. Some of the coincidences strain credulity, but that's mostly so that the author can nerd out about history and farming.

    Survival Story of a Sword king is entertaining imo.

    POPCORN:

    [Love Advice from the Great Duke of Hell](https://www.webtoons.com/en/comedy/love-advice/list?title_no=1498&page=1) (manhwa)  
    Comedy romance manhwa, the comedy is actually funny, quite popcorn-y.

    [Verndio: Surreal Sword Saga](https://mangadex.org/title/4fd4f8c0-fab8-4ee5-ab9e-5907720afed9/iken-senki-v-lundio) (manga)  
    Haven't actually read much, but basically a dude and a fox goddess? start a bar in the middle of the mountains, and have some interesting experiences along the way. Something to do with special swords that have powers too.

    [The Jobless Siblings](https://mangadex.org/title/52d4ad1e-d02c-4fef-81d6-1e758e699d31/hatarakanai-futari) (manga)  
    Comedy manga in ... not 4-koma style but kind of like it. Very chill, very popcorn-y.

    [The Demon Prince Goes To The Academy](https://reaperscans.com/novels/7766-the-demon-prince-goes-to-the-academy) (light novel)  
    Less popcorn-y but basically the author of a light novel gets sent to it as punishment for writing it badly. He's also the demon prince, but the story takes place after the Demon King is killed, so he's just trying to blend in with the humans, while also worried about future events.

    Not-POPCORN:  
    [The Ember Knight](https://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/the-ember-knight/list?title_no=2886&page=1) (manhwa)  
    This is actually really good, follows a protagonist who becomes a knight(basically a superpowered martial arts fighter) but is not any stronger than the average person. Ends up using a combination of social manipulation, acting, luck, and tricks to avoid detection and accomplish his goals.
