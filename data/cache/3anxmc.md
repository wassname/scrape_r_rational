  I hope you're not using the [Unspoken Plan Guarantee](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnspokenPlanGuarantee) (warning TV Tropes), with how vague you were being about Hinata's plan. 

  Your vagueness also made it hard to tell what the motivation behind the characters actions after the scene were. Was Anko actually being harsh with Hinata and Shino, or was it part of their plan? Did something actually cause Shino to snap against his opponent, or was his freaking out part of this unspoken plan? I couldn't really tell. 

  Both of those scenes felt a little off as far as character interactions went, and I wasn't sure if I was supposed to take it as character development, or hints as to what this plan is. One of the problems with having an unspoken plan is it causes your readers to question whether every action that happens after the plan is mentioned is part of the plan or not. I won't be able to stop squinting at every scene and wondering if there's some hidden hint about the plan in it until the actual plan is revealed in the story.

  I do like this chapter though, I'm just being critical of that one thing because it's a trope that just always jumps out at me. It'll be interesting if you end up reversing it, though, and have the plan fail *even though* the reader didn't know much about it.

    As I understood it, Anko was putting on a show because she knew they were being watched. Shino was angry because he thought that Hinata was badly hurt, hence Anko's "she's fine!" 

    It's completely out of character for him to get emotional because of enemy attacking him (it's what enemies do) but it's completely in character for Hinata to assume nobody would be that upset on her account.

    Yes, I am. There's a reason that's a trope; from the TvTropes link you quoted: 

    "Where's the drama in something going wrong if no one knows what was supposed to happen? Conversely, where's the drama in seeing exactly what you were just told would happen?"
