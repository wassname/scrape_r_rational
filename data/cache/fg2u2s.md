  Hi, folks.

  I've decided to try my hand at a short story, exploring the side of isekai that normally just works itself out once the tale is told. I'm looking for feedback on the work, and advice on my technique and ideas.

  My goal as an author is to create something that makes perfect sense when you finish it, but still manages to surprise and delight.

  I've got five chapters up so far. If you would be so kind, please read it and let me know what you think!

  Edit: Hey, just to be clear, it's okay if you don't like it, but useful criticism rather than quiet downvotes would be appreciated. Not much I can learn from, otherwise!

    I've just finished the first chapter and came back to comment:

    >!I enjoyed this quite a bit, and the subversions were well done.  I liked the fact that the temptress was about companionship, not sex.  The truck didn't make a lot of sense to me and I'm unclear what happened to his stick or how the two related, but I didn't have an issue with it.  I didn't see the twist coming where it's actually the devil's story and not the man's, and I'm curious to see where you go with it. !<

    Overall:  Nicely done.

      Thank you!

      >!The truck was a manifestation of a *tormentor*, a demon-like spirit who focuses on pain. Chapter 5 expands on this a bit.!<

      I should probably switch *beast* to *tormentor* in chapter 1 for better continuity.

  I'm enjoying this.

  >Lands of Song and Artifice

  >Wind powers

  >no stars

  I'm reasonably confident they're not in an Incipisphere. They're... they're not in an Incipisphere right? 

  The power of threefold repetition reminded me of Pact, as did the dealings of the *bargainer* and the oracle.

  I enjoy that Surret's power derives from the secrets and names he knows, the debts he can call upon, and his ability to turn those things into leverage. I enjoy the conversational minefields. More mines!

  I look forward to learning more about the power structures of this setting. I imagine, since different fictional worlds seem to be accessible a la *Marriage and Monsters*, there's no shortage of gods drifting about, so I have to wonder what Faustian is planning.

    Thanks and glad you're enjoying it!

    > I'm reasonably confident they're not in an Incipisphere. They're... they're not in an Incipisphere right?

    Heh, well - I actually don't know what Incipisphere is. I did include and will continue to sprinkle in references to actual fiction (*Earthsea*, *Lord of the Flies*, *Scott Pilgrim*, etc.). The *Lands of Song and Artifice* are an original creation. They're intended to be a children's story world, much like Narnia. I didn't want this work to be FanFic, though, so I make my own worlds.

      Makes sense! It's a Homestuck thing-- an Incipisphere is a reality instantiated by a session of a video game (long story) which contains a planet for every player (the planets' size and distance from each other are... *context-dependent*) which is named *The Land of X and Y*, with thematically appropriate values of X and Y for each player, like The Land Of Light and Rain or The Land of Wind and Shade or The Land Of Heat and Clockwork.

      >Somewhere, in another world under the same sky

      So yeah I was pretty sure it wasn't a matter of Faustian grabbing an Incipisphere for his plans-- I think he'd go less postmodern in his selection of battlefield-- but either way I love the above sentence, great work.
      ```

      - u/Brell4Evar:

        Huh. That wasn't too far off of what I was gunning for. There will be more on this in the next chapter, so I'll leave it until then.
        ```

  This is really quite unique and odd.

  The pacing is a little weird, but otherwise I like it!

  >>!The boy shrugged. "I have a specific request of you, Faustian. You will call in no favors for this, and will not seek me out again, afterward. It will take you but a moment. Agree to do this one thing for me, and we are even."!<

  >>!Faustian looked at him suspiciously, but finally nodded. "Very well. Restitution and noninvolvement in exchange for one brief personal service.!<

  >>!"Good," Surret replied, "Sell all your Deals to Munin here for his shiny copper coin."!<


  >!Including the non-involvement deal from just now, and this after having Faistian deal in bad faith just a few days ago AND still go back on his deal. !< For a >!veteran !<Surret sure is bad at this.
  ```

  - u/Brell4Evar:

    Thanks for the feedback! Before I reply in spoilers, I will say that speculation like this is exactly what I want to encourage and reward in the story.

    >!The boy is meant to be a terrifying antagonist, but he hates *bargainers* for a reason. I should clarify a bit in-story how this works. I'll be getting more technical with the start of chapter 6. Short version is that Munin owns the Deals, but the entities involved in the the pacts, including Faustian and even Munin himself, are still on the hook for what they owe. The one owed the services is what changes. That's what makes the Deals such a huge prize for any spirit capable of using them.!<

    >!More specific to the Deal at issue, Surret is now bound not to seek retribution against Munin rather than Faustian. Faustian's service to Surret remains intact. Having this work otherwise would cause Munin to get all of the responsibility along with the bling.!<
    ```

    - u/wren42:
      ```
      I'll chime in to agree with the above that so far making any deals at all seems stupid.  The bargainer twists the results even when worded clearly, and doesn't even uphold the parts he admits agreeing to.  My feeling is "What's the point?"
      ```

    - u/MilesSand:
      ```
      Looking forward to it.

      So far I'm rooting for Surret, maybe Dor, and against Faustian, and slightly against Munin with the caveat that she can get back to 'for' if it turns out >!her actions at the end there are to  Surret's or Dor's benefit.!<

      I notice this ranking matches how much we know about each character's motivations so far so maybe that's intentional.
      ```

    - u/MilesSand:
      ```
      Ohh, I had to read this a second time. Now I get it I think. >!Even though Munin owns all the deals,  she only gets the benefits which Faustian was previously entitled to.  Nobody whom Faustian has made deals with can use Munin's name for purposes she wouldn't agree to, or whatever the specific languagewas in each deal,  but Faustian still owes  Dor a party, presents, and cake in a birthday-like context (which Faustian promised in exchange for making the deal fast and making a counter offer, I guess).!<

      >!speaking of nonspecific language,  Faustian is really bad at this too, for it being his concept  so to speak. How's he supposed to keep track of his agreements if he doesn't insist on standardized language and terms?!<
      ```
