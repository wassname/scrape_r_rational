## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  50 years ago, an alien empire established a new colony at Alpha Centauri that quickly became a major trade route. The colonists decided little would be gained from first contact with Earth so they decided to leave it be, but 30 years ago pirates decided our solar system would be of use to them. Being the morally upstanding people they were, they began abducting and terrorizing humans for recreation. They had no interest in invasion because we had little of value to take.

  The governments of Earth soon figured out what was going on and banded together to stop the threat, but decided not to tell the public since there was no strategic advantage to saying UFOs were randomly attacking people. A new military-industrial complex was build with the goal of inventing and building new technologies with the largest R&D grant program in history. No idea was too insane so long as it would help, even social scientists received funding to examine unusual scenarios.

  The war was long and victories came slowly, but 5 years ago humanity finally forced the pirates out. Surprised by our resourcefulness, the colonists opened diplomatic relations and the truth was revealed to the word. The colonists turned out to be far more technologically advanced than anything reverse-engineered from the pirates ramshackle ships, which placed the fabulously wealthy corporations firmly against any trade. However, they found themselves astronomically outbid.

  The announcement that trade was even being negotiated with the colonists had a detrimental effect on the economy. No one wanted to invent new tech that would soon become obsolete, so millions of engineers and scientists were laid off. Those that stayed were given high-risk projects with minimal funding by morally unscrupulous people desperate to stay relevant. Trade negotiations have stalled over tariffs, which will be needed to pay off the war debt, but the damage will not be undone.

  This is a world where geniuses had to take their work home or on the street, espionage and sabotage of businesses has became commonplace, mad science experiments frequently escape or go haywire, robots and mutants are running loose, aliens and AI have civil rights but morally dubious goals, and there's a global army of special forces cyborgs ready to swoop in on any terrorist who advertises themselves. You've seen urban fantasy, now I give you urban science fiction!

  My explicit intention with this setting was to create a sci-fi analogue to The Dresden Files. Wizards are STEM majors, human-like creatures are mutants, inhuman creatures are robots, The Fair Folk are aliens, and gods are AIs with cyborg servants. This setting could used for pulp adventure, mystery, or intrigue with an eclectic cast of characters. Criminals have hi-tech gadgets, illegal experiments are escaping, dangerous projects are being stolen, and sinister conspiracies are afoot.

    I like it.

    A big part of the appeal of urban fantasy is that it empowers extremely relatable characters in extremely familiar settings.  If you met Harry Dresden or Sookie Stackhouse in reality, you probably wouldn't notice anything unusual about them- and that also suggests that you yourself and people you know could exist in these worlds without any significant changes.

    There's a lot to be said of awe-inspiring settings, larger-than-life character archetypes, and fascinatingly alien cultures- and those can all work to some degree in urban fantasy, but what the genre does best isn't the sort of escapism that transports the reader to another world.  It's escapism that works by recontextualizing the reader's own life and experiences as something more fantastic.

    So, if you want this setting to be distinct from cyberpunk with aliens or pulpy quasi-retro-futurism, my advice would be to design the setting so that the most radical departures from our reality haven't significantly altered the lives of ordinary humans.   Maybe the economy has taken a hit, corporations are releasing some strange products, and everyone is mildly obsessed with the videos from Alpha Centauri, but if you were transported to this world, you wouldn't immediately notice anything out of place, or seem out of place yourself.  The really interesting stuff would be just below the surface.

    Going that route would put some serious restrictions on the world-building, but it could also give the setting a type of appeal that you don't often see in sci-fi.

      Thanks, that's exactly what I was going for. I was originally inspired by the show Gargoyles, [as explained in the second half of this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6g8z4s/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dioeue3), but think I ended up with something closer to Fringe. I like the idea that this setting has the potential for such a wide range of stories.

  I've had this idea bouncing around in my head of a superhero/supervillain whose power is "controlling entropy", but I've more or less hit a brick wall actually trying to define that in a reasonable way.

  I'd like for the power to work in an internally consistent, predictable way, but not just devolve into reality-warping; I wouldn't want him to just turn into Dr. Manhattan or Molecule Man, for example.

    Maybe he can locally accelerate entropy, causing chemical bonds in patches of space to degrade. This, of course, often leaves toxic residue, and is immediately lethal to living things, so they'd have to be a villain.
