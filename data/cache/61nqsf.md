  Hey everyone, this week we discuss creative appropriation, aka "stealing," and the philosophy and benefits behind it. The discussion meandered a bit, but I hope you enjoy it!

  Our sponsor this month is still [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php), the software that helps organize ideas for writing stories, research papers, or articles. 

  Alex and some of my other writing friends have been using it for years, and I recently started too. It's got a lot of tools to help outline and plan out stories, in a much more visually useful and organized way than my usual slipshod method of keeping a bunch of disorganized notes on google docs. 

  If you want to try it out, they offer a free 30-day trial, and if you decide to buy it and help support the show, you can use the code RATIONALLY to get 20% off until May 10th. Hope you find it useful!
