  I thought that the commoner railgun was good; the commoner *self*-railgun is even better. This is a thing of beauty. I love you, grapple rules.

  So who else thinks Hammond is going to share some sort of knowledge that will make everyone go 'oh shit'? I'm impressed so far with the consistent number of quality plot twists, and there's probably more to come.

  It's a good thing that those sonic booms are fluff and not rules text, because otherwise the Meatball would promptly disintegrate when they hit the wall of air. Fortunately, D&D doesn't have detailed rules for supersonic speeds.

    I'm not sure. Max falling speed damage is only 20d6. They have 80d10 health plus constitution, so maybe 400+480. 60 damage vs 880. Does going at mach 11 do 14 times the damage of falling from orbit to earth?

    Besides, if it was an issue you could just cast energy immunity: sonic and energy immunity: fire on the outer landguards.

      Actually, I'm completely ignoring the falling rules. If I weren't, the orbital bombardment wouldn't have worked. 

      And no, a KEW is moving at 11km/second. Running into something at Mach 11 is only 1/3 of that speed, so not nearly as much damage.
      ```

      - u/Nepene:

        Well, the falling rules only specify how much damage is done to the person. They don't specify how much damage is done to whatever they hit so the orbital bombardment would be fine (at least, with regards to falling damage), if it applied to it, whatever it hit would be less fine. Though I'm not sure if the falling rules apply to objects, if they did, it'd still work.

        Milo abused this in another fanfiction. He's more squishy so maximum falling damage would be bad for him but he avoided it with a spell.

        >"In midair, he readied an action. He'd discovered from overhearing conversations between the Weasley's about Quidditch that, in this plane of existence, people had a hard time hitting moving targets for some reason—the faster the target, the harder the shot. Milo had no such restriction (in fact, it was significantly easier to hit a running target), which did not stop him from exploiting this quirk of the local rules. 

        >While falling, he adopted an aerodynamic posture to maximise his velocity. As he came within an inch of the roof, his Readied Action triggered."Dimension Door." Milo's view of the Dursleys' roof was suddenly replaced by a view of the Dursleys' tasteless dining room and Petunia's tasteless cooking. Like all Teleportation spells, Dimension Door placed the target on the nearest solid surface, in this case, the dining room table. Dimension Door, however, does not modify the target's momentum."Feather Fall," Milo cast the instant—literally—he re-appeared, sword in hand, standing on the table—still moving at terminal velocity. 

        >Feather Fall, contrary to popular opinion, did more than simply slow a falling creature, because if it did, the sudden deceleration would kill anyone targeted by it. In addition, it explicitly made the target immune to falling damage. It is this effect that Milo required. Milo appeared on the table loaded with an enormous amount of momentum, but, thanks to Feather Fall, the sudden impact had no effect on him. The table, not being a target of Feather Fall, had no such magical protection, and had to deal with Milo's sudden change of velocity in a manner more in line with the laws of physics, as if he had crashed into it at a high speed.

        >The table exploded the moment Milo's feet touched it, filling the room with splinters, while Milo—now immune to falling damage, thanks to Feather Fall—slowly floated down to touch the floor. Wizards one, physics zero, Milo thought smugly amid the devastation."

        Edit. If you did allow this there are fun ways to abuse it. Create a long diamond tube with a vacuum with true creation (you can reinforce it with walls of force later) create a teleport circle at bottom, leave the landguard member till they reach relativistic speeds, then teleport them at an enemy. Maybe give them immunity to fire somehow too. If the falling damage rules were allowed you would have a relativistic landguard member who took a maximum of 20d6 damage from their fall hitting a target with an arbitrarily high energy. 

        Edit 2. You can further abuse this with polymorph any object to polymorph into a dinosaur killer asteroid.

  At the end of this chapter you say "the remaining five hundred Landguard  ". Where did the other 1000 go? The only place I can see is the platoon which collected the fenfrogs, but a platoon is nowhere near 1000, especially when that platoon is out of action for a week and are only collecting a few dozen frogs.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Hm, you're right. I had 500 of them blast with Mage's Disjunction, 500 beat Hammond silly, and a few scoop up frogs. That misses 500. 

    I'm away from wifi atm (this is being written in my phone), but I'll fix it when I can. Thanks for pointing it out.

      Well, this is all one round? So a lot of them spent it stabbing things in the maze. They *shouldn't* all be accounted for in the show down with the lich. Shouldn't be round numbers either.
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        Fair enough. As to the round numbers -- once you're dealing in hundreds or thousands of people, a dozen or three either way isn't that important.

  ```
  Rules nitpick - it doesn't make sense to say some of the Landguard are on the outer most layer or that one is in the center, since the rules they're exploiting to share the same space already nullifies any concept of them having a position relative to another.  However, all ranged attacks target a random person in the grapple, so you have a solid statistical defense against someone being hit by more than one attack.

  Even more nitpicky rules nitpick - Grappling is transitive (if you grapple someone, they are considered to be grappling you as well), so you can only have a fanout of three people grappling per "layer," not the four in your example.  Person 0 grapples persons 1, 2, 3.  Person 1 grapples person 0, 4, 5, 6.  And so forth.
