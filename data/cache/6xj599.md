## [Biweekly Challenge] Effective Altruism

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6udfhy/biweekly_challenge_metafiction/), the prompt was "Metafiction". Our winner is /u/vi_fi, with their story, ["Hronar the Barbarian"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6udfhy/biweekly_challenge_metafiction/dlsf3l1/). Congratulations to /u/vi_fi!

##### This Time

This time, the challenge will be **Effective Altruism**, partly because Effective Altruism Global 2017 has recently ended. Effective altruism is, in short, using your resources to do the most good. See [this introduction to effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/) if you'd like to know more. I happen to think that this is fairly fertile ground for speculative fiction, namely by thinking in terms of "how does an effective altruist react to [THING]", where [THING] is a portal to a fantasy world, superpowers, the Death Note, etc. As always though, prompts are to inspire, not to limit; feel free to do your own thing.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, September 13th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Next time, the challenge will be **Emulated Intelligence**. [Whole brain emulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading) is a hypothetical technology which would allow a human mind to run on a computer simulating neurons rather than on physical neurons. This would allow things like time dilation, copying minds, reverting thoughts, and all sorts of other things that currently apply only to data (because a brain, in this scenario, becomes data). Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 9/13.** Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat [is available here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6xj6h1/challenge_companion_effective_altruism/).

    Very nice. Just a couple of things:

    Before the first near-death experience:

    >I'll need the practice, soon." She reached into her briefcase...

    You change person from 1st to 3rd, but still are referring to the protagonist.

    A rhythm of 3/4ths with 2/17ths seems really hard to produce. I suppose that's the point.

    Finally, is the point in the end that the protagonist lost? She got caught before she could cause enough deaths.

    >In your manifesto, you claim that the millions of deaths you caused

    Millions is not even a 1/7 of all existing humans. Death can just shrug at that and know that in the future more souls will be coming. However her speech afterwards supposes the door has already been closed. I am confused.
    ```

      > You change person from 1st to 3rd

      Thanks for spotting that! Unintentional changes of person (and tense) are my most common mistakes because I tend to change them from scene to scene while writing. I just can't decide until the story is done, and then I miss things while editing :)

      > A rhythm of 3/4ths with 2/17ths seems really hard to produce.

      (Changed the second rhythm to 2/7ths, because on second thought, I don't think the protagonist could spot it.) Generally, it's possible for an experienced musician to produce these rhythms. If you're not averse to harsh Metal, give Meshuggah a try. It's fascinating how their drummer can keep up with insanely complicated polyrhythms.

      > is the point that the protagonist lost?

      Nah. What she did was test her weapons systems, killing a few million people, thereby alerting Death to the fact that she is able and willing to actually kill everyone. At this point, she has the finger on the trigger, and Death has to close the Door to preserve a steady, if smaller, stream of willingly dying humans. And once it's clear that she has won, she stops trying to evade capture.

      I rewrote the ending so that the judges actually refer to the strange events that are going on in hospitals (such as people not dying/corpses not decaying). This should make it more clear.

      Thank you for your extensive comments! It's always nice to know which points I managed to communicate and which I didn't.

        I didn't realise the author of this was _you_, the author of The Unpublished Library. And you won the last contest. I like your style. Seems you're a rising star :P.

        I listened to 1 Meshuggah song but I didn't find anything special, I'll do more of them tomorrow.

          > Seems you're a rising star

          Considering my current level, I'd call myself a surfacing cave-dweller, but thank you :)

          And regarding the last contest... I'm the guy who wrote *The Library Unpublished* and *Continuity of Consciousness*, how could I not enter the metafiction challenge? Useless bit of trivia: I consider "Applied Cultural Topology" to be one of Cio's fanfics.

          Regarding Meshuggah, the complexity of their rhythms is more easily appreciated in the songs which are a bit less aggressive. Try Dancers to a Discordant System, or Pineal Gland Optics. And if you don't like them, no harm done! They're certainly not for everyone. I only listen to them when I'm in a certain mood, as I usually like to have clear melodies in the music I listen to.

          Nonetheless, I imagine that Progressive Metal would be appealing to an immortal like Death, who's had time to literally see everything. In some ways, it's one of the "cutting edges" of music :)

    I enjoyed this. The core concept of a human trying to persuade Death to permit immortality, and ultimately using her interactions with Death to work out a way to coerce it, was clever and compelling. The Death segments were the strongest parts of the piece, and I felt very engaged with them.

    Some critique: I think a lot of fat could be cut from the therapist segments. The debates with Death are the meat of this story; spending so much time on the protagonist's negotiations with the therapist only dilutes their impact. Considering that the therapist disappears completely halfway through the story, she doesn't warrant the page space currently spent on her. (In fact, the amount of focus she got led me to believe, right up until the end, that she was going to be part of some big twist--I thought she was going to actually be Death trying to analyze the protagonist in a simulated scenario.)  I think you could easily cut those parts down to one or two paragraphs apiece without losing anything critical. You could even, if you wanted, ditch the therapist as a framing device entirely.

    Also regarding the therapist sections (though cutting them down would probably resolve most of this by itself): The narration occasionally describes the therapist's point of view ("Establishing a rapport with the patient was important to her," "she feared what might come next). This is confusing in the context of a first-person POV story, and gives the impression that the protagonist can read minds. I think your intention here was to imply that she is extraordinarily perceptive, which comes across better in the parts where you use phrasing like "she visibly suppressed the impulse."

    I also found it hard to accept that the protagonist would explicitly declare her intent to manipulate the therapist into giving her a clean bill of health--and then succeed in spite of that, not just in securing her freedom but in actually convincing the therapist that she was "healed". I think it would be more plausible for that declaration of intent to be confined to her internal monologue.

      Thank you for your comment! That might be the most insightful critique I've ever gotten, and I really appreciate you taking the time to post it.

      I think I agree with most of your points. This is not to be a justification, but an explanation for how the suboptimal parts of the story came to be. I originally wrote the therapist part from the therapist's view, and it was intended to introduce Jeanne from the outside, because I felt that an extraordinary claim such as Jeanne's should be approached from a position of doubt. The sections where Jeanne seems extraordinarily insightful are artifacts of a version where those were just the therapist's inner thoughts. This explains both the awkward phrasing and the amount of time spent on the therapist; originally, the parts "analyzing" her were only necessary for her to work as a POV character. After I was done writing the story, I realized that there was only one scene not from Jeanne's POV and decided to simplify the story structure by putting it into that POV as well, given that I'm trying to correct my tendency of confusing my readers by unnecessary POV switches.

      So what I've learned from your comment is that I should probably make a viable plan for the POVs in my stories at the very beginning, when I can still consider their global impact. Alternatively, if I have to edit the POV, I should consider a full rewrite of the affected scenes.

      Regarding the manipulation, I see the merit to your approach. At the same time, Jeanne's talents regarding manipulation have to be introduced so that her founding a cult is more believable, which means that she has to overcome an earlier obstacle through manipulation. I do agree that I've probably chosen an over-the-top way of doing this and can understand that it strains your suspension of disbelief.

      Once again, thank you for posting this :)

        Oh yeah, that does make sense! I've run into similar scenarios in my own writing, where I've made a radical rewrite and later discovered that there were artifacts of the original version that no longer fit. I think you have the right idea in keeping it to a single POV. 

        I think demonstrating that Jeanne is able to successfully manipulate the therapist into clearing her is a great foundation for her ability to found the cult; I just think that having her keep her intentions to herself could be part of that. When she explains them to the therapist, it comes across as a misstep that makes me *less* confident in her talent for manipulation. Then when I learn she pulled it off anyway, it comes across as an informed ability rather than a believable one. But if she makes it clear in the narration that she intends to manipulate the therapist, while outwardly playing the role of a receptive patient, I think that would foreshadow her future cult leader status very well.

      By the way, it's not explicitly mentioned, but did Jeanne murder the therapist? She says the therapist is an obstacle she must confront, and clearly isn't shy about murdering people, and then the therapist just disappears. And then there is the fact that Death starts talking to Jeanne about the therapist being sad, like Death has become *personally acquainted* with the therapist...

        I hadn't intended that at all, but it's a superior reading of the text! It's my head canon now.

        Wait, does that mean that it's actual canon? How does this authorial intent thing work again?

    This line is amazing and beautiful and is the entire reason I want to show this story to other people rather than merely enjoying it myself.

    That was an amazing read, I also love that you mentioned Pascal's Wager. It's one of the great tools of rationality, just unfortunately tainted by the specific context that Pascal misapplies it to.

    That said, I find the ending rather worrying. Death never explained what was behind the door, yet the MC forced him to stop feeding souls through it. Given the religious connotations and the fact that Death feels too squeamish to explain, my best guess is some sort of evil gods that demand human sacrifices, so they can munch on human souls. Death sends human sacrifices across the door to appease the gods, and doesn't want to explain it to humans because then they would desperately refuse to enter the door. 

    In that case, what would happen if Death stops sending human souls across the door? Or sends only a relatively small amount? Coupled with the conjecture that Death cannot lie, and that Death said closing the door would "diminish" it, I imagine the evil gods would break down the door and come over to this side to find more souls to munch on, maybe even munching on Death itself.

    What makes this hypothesis even more probable is that Death refuses to explain what's behind the door even when the MC threatens to kill the entire human race and begins carrying out said threat. That means whatever is behind the door, telling the MC about it won't make her change her mind about killing the human race. Given the MC's utility function and methods of achieving her utility, hearing about evil gods being appeased by human sacrifices would drive the MC to kill off the human race immediately, regardless of what Death does. So this hypothesis would explain why Death refuses to divulge any information about what's behind the door.

    So now I'm imagining the ending, as Death crossing its fingers, hoping desperately that the sudden extreme reduction in the number of human sacrifices doesn't cause anyone on the other side to come over...  *gulp*
    ```

      Yes, Death's reason to send humans through the door might well be beneficial to humanity. Some sort of Eldritch Abomination certainly fits the feeling I wanted to create, and I love that you picked up on it. I don't think that I would declare that possibility canon, but you are certainly very close to the author's intent.

      From Jeanne's view, there's still the possibility that Death might be consigning the humans to a horrible fate for much smaller (or personal) gains. Given that possibility, I think Jeanne acted rationally; if Death had been feeding humans to Azathoth, she would have wanted to know, because in that case, the best option wouldn't be to just close the Door; she would try to find a way to kill Azathoth first. And given that she assumed Death would know that she would understand that (and wouldn't mind her trying to kill Azathoth) and *didn't just tell her* she assigned negligible probability to that possibility.

    ```
    what a story. just a question: how was she so sure that Death would want souls? and what if he thought she'd stop if he didn't do anything to stop her, assuming she doesn't want the human race to go extinct?
