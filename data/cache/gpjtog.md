  Man, I kind of feel bad for the author here. They are backed up against the wall by the math of their own system, and their attempt to get around it (cleverly, in my opinion) is obviously not satisfying a lot of the readers.

  Rain is at the most interesting part of his power curve. Strong enough to affect things, but not all things and it takes effort. Knowledgeable enough to see exploits, but not yet able to break things. The next "step" in the power curve will fundamentally break everything though, and I don't really see a way around it without major setting-changing consequences. Rain has to stay here, at roughly level 18, until he has satisfactorily resolved some stuff, because once he reaches the next tier of power, resolving that stuff will be trivial and thus boring.

  I've been messing around with the Delve calculator/spreadsheet. The next 7ish levels are more or less dictated by his build. If he wants to get the Legendary class, which he does, he needs to take some defensive auras and some offensive auras, and he doesn't really have too much choice there. Furthermore, those powers are all useless narratively. Anyone strong enough to hurt him through his armor is strong enough to drain his mana pool and kill him while he is out of mana. Anyone who isn't able to full drain his mana pool probably couldn't punch through his armor anyway. Similarly, the other offensive auras don't really do much that immolate/refrigerate don't do already. The next 6 levels are going to be boring.

  Level 25, on the other hand, is an enormous power spike. His max mana regen goes up by roughly x100, based on a reasonable estimate of what the Legendary Dynamo gives. His mana pool grows enough that due to intrinsic Focus and increased tolerance to stat boosts that it becomes much, much harder to instantly drain his mana pool and hurt him. That in turn makes most fights into battles of attrition, which he wins by dint of being a Dynamo. His max range also goes up x5, making the volume of the sphere he could affect go up by ~x100.

  Level 27 is even worse. If he picks the ability to take multiple auras (Prismatic Intent) and the ability to boost his own focus (Empire of Will), that's basically game over. While in Aura Focus mode, Empire of Will together with Winter boosts his regen more than it drains, so he can slowly but surely strengthen his soul and boost his tolerance to Focus. Even if he never ever got above level 27, it would only be a matter of time before his Focus reaches Platinum-tier levels. Seriously, look at the spreadsheet. He could have hundreds of thousands of Focus with those two skills, if doing so didn't melt his brain. He could then do millions of damage with any aura, killing anyone. Sure, it would take time to strengthen his soul, but he could do so Xianxia style. Go find a little cave, sit inside and meditate for a decade, and then walk out and disintegrate a mountain. That would be... boring. It wouldn't feel earned.

  That's the problem here. If Rain gets any stronger, either it doesn't matter (levels 19-24), it makes him probably too strong for any of his current problems (level 25), or it makes him a demigod who can only be beaten within a time limit of a few years (level 27). The author is doing his best to keep the story moving while problems of this tier still matter, and give Rain some development while doing so, but everyone wants a power boost...

  A lot of people seem to be suggesting that he figure out some way to level up without Blue monsters, but then everything breaks. If he levels up by strengthening his soul by some amount, it is difficult to imagine how he wouldn't just keep doing that and become a god. Similarly, if he levels up by turning slimes into Blues, he also rapidly becomes a god. 

  I dunno. I just feel bad for the author.

    While all you have said is very true. I dont feel like we need the power up *now*. What really annoyed me about the story lately is that it moved from its already slow pacing to almost stagnating. We got all these situations and plots converging onto fel sedanis with rain inside.

    DKE taking over fel sedanis

    Lavarro going after Westbridge

    Velika in power

    Our party got split

    Global and continental Politics

    The attack of the Empire

    The tensions inside the city

    All those things are really, really cool. Finally we have some action, the world gets a little bit bigger and we are looking for that payoff. I thought we could have had it. With the watch and velika fighting each other but what happens after is a bit... weird. 

    Rain gets stuck in a hole for like 8 chapters. Nothing happens, carten has one paragraph of focus as the only party member of rain in the city. Westbridge gets killed OFFSCREEN. We are introduced to some members of DKE which immedentially get killed and we are left to wonder about how should we even care about them. The Empire leaves Fel Sedanis(?) even though they just curbstomped the members of the DKE and there is no sign of the watch or the guild in sight. As one of the posters said on a previous chapter thread. The light guy has a frankly ridiculous motivation that might be explained in the future but now he just looks stupid. The Empire defeating those DKE citizens is just kinda author fiat cuz the guys had a pretty solid plan while trying to avoid detection etc but 100 soldiers and 1 gold (?) is enough to absolutely murdere them cuz illusions(WHICH  THEY KNOW ABOUT)

    there was near zero payoff from the entire situation for me besides the velika fight. and that was just ONE thing that i am still kinda dissatisfied with cuz i guess nobody but rain cares about it ? it feels weird that in a watch controlled city everyone just doesnt care about them and every character is like "meh, those were adventurers and the watch, those things happen". 

    I really dont need a rain powerup or whatever to enjoy the story, i just want to see some interesting stuff happen and ... thats been a dissapointment so far.

      Lightbreaker winning that fight makes sense to me. They may have known about his illusions but they still overestimated their ability to see through them and fell for the trap. 

      The rest of your complaints I agree with. The way I would have done it would be to have added a big climactic fight between Lavarro and Westbridge. Then say end of book one. 

      That would make the cave section feel less out of place. The cave section should be shorter too.
      ```

      - u/RetardedWabbit:
        ```
        Good idea, the cave section could be a great follow up to a catastrophic fight for readers. Use it to hammer home how he still needs to get stronger and to mourn all the dead/how the world works. Breaks in action, excitement, and stakes are great but as is there was already a lack of those before the cave.

        Edit: I really disagree about the Lightbreaker fight though. If his illusions tied up the 3 citizens specifically selected to fight the Empire that's a big enough win. Distract them then slam them with reinforcements, great. Distract them and essentially solo them? Guess the Citizens are super incompetent.
        Also I want to point out that he burned the Citizen who's legendary skills were hot/cold manipulation and conversion to death. He also managed to easily fool them even though they knew exactly who he was. You're fighting the light mage who you know at least makes whole armies invisible, and you have no precautions?
        ```

        - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
          ```
          I would say they didn't know "exactly who he was". They would have had rumours, maybe eyewitness accounts, but that's not the same as knowing what he can actually do. 

          For example one of the citizens specifically thought his illusions were just bending light and he could see through them with mana sight. That was factually wrong. So it's not a case of them having no precautions. It's a case of them being overconfident and their precautions falling far short of what they need. 

          So one guy vs three cocky and underprepared opponents. That's a fight I could see going Lightbreaker's way; even if he wasn't explicitly supernaturally more powerful than any of the three.

      Hahahaha what a great theory! Him getting sent somewhere else is actually a fantastic idea: it wouldn't be hard to explain teleporting the whole dome into dangerous territory. The ancient shield's secondary function is to transport itself to "safety", and once it absorbs enough mana, now that the Empire aren't draining it, this suddenly activates. Have it start another drain and alert everyone, have Rain rush to shut it off but fail/mess it up at the last minute and you're good to go! Send it into the wilderness, into a dungeon for the title screen, or on the outskirts of the Empire somewhere!

      It gives Rain new challenges, and lets the story keep most of what it's built up like all the characters in the city. It also encourages city development by Rain/Velika for future story beats.

    > Furthermore, those powers are all useless narratively. Anyone strong enough to hurt him through his armor is strong enough to drain his mana pool and kill him while he is out of mana.

    I think this isn't true. An Aura that doesn't risk Mage Burn would be a real powerup. 

    Defensive auras could protect rain from things his armour doesn't cover like mental effects. And they can protect others too, I'm sure you could have a plot like escorting some glass cannon builds or even some unawakened through an area that is innately deadly (boiling hot, poisonous misima, etc) where an aura is highly suitable.

    > His mana pool grows enough that due to intrinsic Focus and increased tolerance to stat boosts that it becomes much, much harder to instantly drain his mana pool and hurt him. 

    Skills to bypass defensive auras exist. We saw Lavarro use one when she was angry about Rain and co destroying the dungeon. Rain's build would be great at providing basic protection to everyone around him (that stacks with their own skills). We haven't seen anything to suggest it will provide him with advanced protection against things like pierce skills; and if it did it's likely that self-only defences will have better anti-pierce and single target attacks will have the penetration to match. 

    > Even if he never ever got above level 27, it would only be a matter of time before his Focus reaches Platinum-tier levels.

    Wasn't there something saying your maximum tolerance is relative to your level?
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Yep, roughly 10x your level. Which happens a monolith build would have in a stat with only stat points and no class/skill bonuses. So at best he could be a like a Focus monolith with the regen of a Dynamo.

  I’m getting a bit impatient that he’s still stuck in level 18 for several months real time now. I might drop and come back when I see some progress - I was hoping this oversoul thing might be potentially an alternate source of power.

  Can someone who has Patreon let me know if he gets at all stronger in the next 10 or so chapters? That translates to another 2 months in real time, and if he still doesn’t get at all stronger I might just drop this until 2021.
  ```

  - u/Reply_or_Not:
    ```
    No joke, you should probably just drop till 2021, the last chapter on Patreon finally had the plot move forward on them getting closer to the thing that will let them out of the city.  There has been absolutely no progression on Rain’s part

  - u/Watchful1:
    ```
    People on the patreon have been raving for weeks about how his build is way overpowered, and he hasn't actually substantially changed power level in months now. At least not counting the physical strength stuff from the rings. His aura's do basically the same amount of damage since well before the dome went up. So I'm fairly sure they know something we don't and we'll get something new relatively soon.

    But I'm also frustrated at the slow pace. The author has over 2000 patrons on patreon now. Even if they are all at the $2.50, get early access to chapters level, that's very nearly quit your job to write full time money. But we're still getting one chapter a week. I hate to complain about something I'm getting for free, but you think he would be able to justify some more writing time.
    ```

  - u/thatavidreadertrue:
    ```
    Thanks to all who answered - looks like I should likely drop this until next year then. Appreciate the inputs.
    ```

  - u/ArgusTheCat:
    ```
    I find this a bit silly, because it implies that the only measure of improvement possible is in level, despite the fact that basically every chapter has been him either improving tolerances for his absurdly overpowered artifact ring, or coming up with new lateral uses for his abilities that gives him a far more flexible amount of power. His level hasn’t moved, but it’s not like his character is just sitting around doing nothing.

        Just chiming in to say I agree. It seems like the intended audience is people who love number crunching and build crafting--the thing is, I thought I was one of those people. Turns out I'm not, though. I guess I'm in it for the *payoff* that comes of good decision making, rather than details about all the factors and thought processes and *numbers*.

          Yeah, the numbers are fun and if executed well do mean something.

          But numbers for the sake of numbers isn't what i find enjoyable about these books. I mainly like it for the exploration and new magic systems.

        Eh, the worldbuilding has expanded a lot, Rain has developed as a character.  I can find you 30 royal road stories where the character gets 5 levels a chapter and manages his character build but that's pretty shallow if that's ALL you like about a story.

  Rain uses Purify in town square.

  Rain gets thrown out of guild and nearly breaks a bone by Halgrave for illegal magic use.

  *Looooong* montage of harrowing events before Rain gets back into city and guild.

  Rain uses **intimidate**, Refrigerate, and death threats. They are effective!

  Rain gets thrown out of city again by Halgrave and Watch.

  Have you *learned* nothing Rain!?!?!?!
  ```

  - u/burnerpower:
    ```
    The Watch has no power anymore considering almost all of them just died in their attempted rebellion. Besides Rain is only doing things he already got permission from them to do earlier. Not that any of it matters considering everyone has bigger fish to fry than picking a fight with the only person trying to save the city.
    ```

  - u/ironistkraken:
    ```
    I don't think they can throw him out, seeing as no one can leave the city right now.
    ```

  - u/CoronaPollentia:
    ```
    Rain's learned enough to move from "uppity kid that doesn't know their place trying to fit in" to "only person keeping the city livable for the unawakened" with a small cult following stepping into the void of power and authority left by the wholesale slaughter of much of the Watch. He can get away with things now.
    ```

  - u/RetardedWabbit:
    ```
    Rain can do essentially whatever he wants now, the situation is very different. Rain is a self-AoE specialist and everyone is stuck in the area with him.

    1. Rain is essentially the right hand man of the domes dictator, she's currently injured but likely killed all threats to herself in the dome. Rain is now politically and combatively extremely powerful in the dome.

    2. Rain is the domes only hope of reversing or reducing the domes greenhouse effect, along with purify probably preventing CO2/filth issues. If all he can do is cool water this is even stronger, since he is now creating a resource (cold water) he has a monopoly on.

    3. Rain used to be a walking watch/civilian WMD and is now a whole dome WMD. Instead of cooling he could heat and cook the entire dome. Hopping into flowing water would make this fast but just using waves of heat alternated with self cooling would likely make the dome unlivable for everyone else before the Citizen gets informed and responds.

    Edit: Hell, any amount of water heating kills everyone by heat exhaustion. If your only source of hydration is hot I don't think you can compensate. A warm water source is so unnatural I can't find any research on it, but at some point drinking warm water stops helping you regulate your core temperature at all.
    ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      Are you making the hot water thing up or something? In plenty of countries people drink hot tea during hot summers.

        ```
        >Are you making the hot water thing up or something? In plenty of countries people drink hot tea during hot summers.

        They only do this in dry countries.   Past a certain humidity and temperature, sweat can not cool you and you die.  The person you are replying to is saying that Rain only has to *not act* and everyone dies.  If Rain acts to heat the dome faster, everyone dies sooner
        ```

      - u/Luminous_Lead:
        ```
        I think what he's trying to say is that if everyone is only drinking water that is above body temperature, and if their bodies are producing heat themselves, then there's no reasonable way for people to cool themselves down (since we usually use our environment to do so).  If this happens people will probably get heat exhaustion and collapse.
        ```

    - u/Roxolan:
      ```
      Sweat is evaporative cooling, right? As long as you don't drink *boiling* water (in which case you have other problems) you should still lose heat on net.
      ```
