  Oh man. Bittersweet to see this end for realsies.

  Missed seeing Zach in the epilogue though.
  ```

  - u/shinghand:
    ```
    And Taiven, I feel that story arc never really got resolved.  
    Will Zorian and Taiven be able to remain friends given that now he's an ultra powerful archmage that Taiven can't relate to in any way.
    ```

    - u/I-want-pulao:
      ```
      Honestly I liked the small call out to Taiven showing that she's growing independently of Zorian.. I'm sure she'll do well and grow and learn and you never know, they'll be more like equals again.

    Girl*

    I think it's a possibility, depends how deep she can get, and what powers the primordial Essence has granted her.

    Honestly I think a great continuation of the story would be from the perspective of one of her offspring.

    She makes it down to the core of the world and absorbs more power, directly from the Dragon below, but somehow one of her eggs gets detached and ends up on the surface, blown out through the hole to hatch somewhere in Cyoria, it learns of Humans and in a primal wish to emulate them it uses it's primordial Essence (which originated from panexeth) to turn into one.

    Commence story about awesome spider girl/boy with antimagic powers and the ability to shapeshift and a overarching plot about the birth of a new primordial (her mother) and the fact that she may be the only one who can defeat her, ad in some prophesies from people like Zorian, interaction with the Areana, and it could be an epic almost as cool as MoL

      - u/signspace13:
        ```
        Yeah, but that doesn't mean they are at maximum capacity, something is driving mama spider to go deeper. The Dragon Below has been a background element for a while now, would be interesting if something like the creation of a new primordial, based on the Grey hunter, became a thing. It would as elements to the story and world that MoL glossed over due to Zorian's lack of interest, like more about the church, the way monsters work, and a bunch of other things.

      -just get a hectic upgrade and is now primordial upgraded organj tier murderspider?

      -is it now driven (and able, with help of brood) to release panaxeth?

      -something else?? Going to try and eat the whole damn primordial, and become literal primordial murderspider?

      Lolth* https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lolth

      Primordial essence infused spiders will likely give them hyper regen or shapeshifting capabilities. We also dont know what's gonna happen to Oganj now that he has those divine artifacts. Makes me feel like I want an ending similar to Neverwinter Nights where they summarize the drastic effects of your actions in the game.
      ```

      - u/Menolith:
        ```
        It's Lloth for the drow.

        Best case scenario, the spider goes down deep and its clutch is too magical to survive in the mana-starved upper levels, so it's just one eldritch monstrosity among many down there.

        The crown probably isn't that big of a deal for Oganj since he is already sporting tremendous natural mana reserves, but I'm sure he'll figure out nasty things to do with a massive pocket dimension.
        ```

- u/Makin-:
  ```
  I'm satisfied with the epilogue, but I'm more satisfied with the afterword. It's rare that an online story of this scope is finished, rarer that the ending is satisfying, and even rarer that the author truly admits their shortcomings in such a frank way.

  Overall, this was a great wild ride even considering the addressed issues. I'll be able to recommend this story to everyone in years to come. Thanks, nobody103.

  ```
  I was really hoping for some closure with QI. Maybe a perspective from him or continued lessons.

  While I expected little to no romantic closure, I was hoping Zorian and Xvim would take heart in Taiven's advice and exercise some more.
  ```

  - u/beffyman:
    ```
    I was thinking the drunkard was QI until it cut out.  He can disguise himself quite well so it wouldn't be surprising if he could sneak up on Zorian for a chat after all that's happened.
    ```

    - u/AKAAkira:
      ```
      Interesting thought, but assuming Zorian made a habit of maintaining his spiderweb presence-detection trick, if QI came in mind-blanked Zorian would immediately know a powerful mage is in his presence, and if QI tried to come in with a fake mind it's not very likely to be convincing enough to fool Zorian. He'd probably need to directly teleport right next to Zorian to ambush him, in which case I estimate there's a moderate chance Zorian is able to defend himself, a very high probability that Zorian ends up needing to out his real skill level to defend himself, but also a mild chance that QI would need to abandon his new body when he tries to escape in the aftermath, and will take a while before returning to Ulquaan Ibasa if he doesn't, at which point you question whether it'd really be worth it to him to ambush Zorian.

      Well, assuming Zorian maintains his spiderweb presence-detection trick. There's a mild chance it'd out him as an archmage if another archmage happen to come across him able to actually detect his spiderweb. In which case I wonder what other methods he has to avoid ambush. Constant stealthy divinations?
      ```

    - u/Morghus:
      ```
      I quite enjoyed thinking that myself, that QI was keeping an eye on him from street level. There are quite a few bigger fish in that world, it seems. For now
      ```

- u/thegreatdar:
  ```
  Man, I've been reading this since it was around 15~ chapters in.  Always been a highlight of my day when it came out, and every chapter has left me wanting more. The epilogue is no different, which makes me a bit sad that such a wonderful story has come to an end. There isn't anything else on the internet I have found that has scratched an itch so satisfyingly as Mother of Learning has. 

  I particularly loved Zorian's growth, not just power wise (which was so damn good), but as a human being - the interactions he had with all the various characters. The moment Zorian decided to take Kirielle to Cyoria for the first time was amazing. As was his return to Cyoria, teaming up with Zach, and then Xvim, Alanic and Daimen.


  Thanks /u/nobody103 for all the entertainment you've given me over the years. Looking forward to whatever you write.

  Man, that sequel bait.

  While this epilogue closed up the series pretty tightly, there's still a few things I wish I got to saw, like Zach. Seriously.

  And Kirielle learning magic. She's going to be a terrifying girl when she grows up.

  That said, anyone have recommendations on Time Loop stuff?
  ```

  - u/Banarok:
    ```
    All Zorian can really do with Kirelle is give her a good foundation, since his expertise is not in areas where her interests lie, it's also illegal for him to teach her any spells so if she's gonna go to the academy he really can't teach her stuff except shaping exercises that help her get a grip on things once she is spell legal.
    ```

    - u/Nimelennar:
      ```
      He can also probably hook her up with some witches that would be thrilled to tutor someone with her heritage.

      Heck, Old Silverlake might even do it as thanks for the warning about her looped self, to say nothing of what else Zorian is planning to give her in repayment (maybe a giant salamander and a *different* Grey Hunter's egg sac).
      ```

      - u/Luck732:
        ```
        Zorian would never let Silverlake teach his sister, and I seriously doubt he plans on giving her any sort of repayment.

        Zorian is well aware that Silverlake only stepped in for selfish reasons.
        ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        I still want to see what she could cook up with a sample of Princess's tissue instead. Hydra regeneration > salamander regeneration.
        ```

        - u/Nimelennar:
          ```
          True, but:

          1. The recipe required certain pieces of the salamander that more-or-less requires that you kill it before removing them, and
          2. We don't know how much of Princess's regeneration is due to the divine alteration, and how much of that can be transferred into the potion.
          ```

          - u/thrawnca:
            ```
            1. Princess can *grow heads back*. The usual rules for fatal injuries do not apply.

            2. Silverlake is already ageless. She has time to experiment.
            ```

    - u/Luck732:
      ```
      Illegal for him to teach her any spells? Where did you get that idea? There is plenty of evidence for private tutoring throughout the series.
      ```

      - u/Banarok:
        ```
        in the beginnings like the very early chapters Zorian explain that you need a license for spells, and teaching people without one is illegal so first kirelle must get a Licence somehow and then he can teach her actual spells.

        there are some level 0 spells that i think were legal anyway, but most are bumped up to level one because it's more prestigious to be the creator of a high level spell.

        sure he'll probably teach her a attack spell anyway despite the illegality of it, but then she'll not be allowed to show that one in school since the teachers will probably see she's more familiar with it then she should be.
        ```

        - u/Luck732:
          ```
          Ah, you're saying it would be illegal to teach her spells *before she starts at the academy*.  I thought you meant forever, my mistake.
          ```

  - u/VorpalAuroch:
    ```
    There's the unsubtle inspiration for this fic, the somewhat infamous [Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid).

        The BDSM, yes, the extreme hurt/comfort no. That part is *extremely* integral to the story.

    >That said, anyone have recommendations on Time Loop stuff?

    Groundhogs Day ofc, and Edge of Tomorrow are two good movies with time loop as the central plot. I'm not aware of other novels though

  Panaxeth's not down for the count yet, I see. Well-executed, too.

- u/bucketsofmercy:
  ```
  Oh man I was not expecting this so soon.

  Edit: Wow! A fantastic ending, so many loose ends tied up. Of course I wish we could have another 20 chapters just to see how people's lives progress but it makes sense to end it here. 

  The ending about the Grey Hunter sounds interesting and I hope we get to see a sequel of some sort! It probably wouldn't involve time loops again but it'd be cool to see a new protag take on the challenge and the different branches of magic involved, maybe get to see cameos from Zorian et al.
  ```

  - u/rtkwe:

    There's a second chapter where the author says they'll maybe do a slice of life style sequel later to do just that.

- u/Xtraordinaire:

  Honestly, I've enjoyed the epilogue more than a lot of chapters, recently. Small slice-of-life conversations always were the strongest aspect of MoL. If u/nobody103 decides to write another story, I only hope it focuses more on people stuff, mystery, and worldbuilding and less on epic battles. Anyways, this was a rather sweet closure.

  I'm honestly surprised that Zorian still finds money a problem. Especially with the ability to make simulacrums of himself.

  I also wonder what in holy hell can one shot a Greg Hunter that lives deep underground in this world. Damn that's a lot of Godzilla tiers.
  ```

  - u/sambelulek:
    ```
    Yup. I have this thought from many chapters ago that Zorian would be a toymaker after his graduation. His main product being a 'doll' for small girls. His clientele including Eldemar military, noble and merchant house with too much money lying around, and well-to-do groups of dungeon delver badly in need for disposable vanguard.

    For more immediate money problem, I agree Zorian can craft a persona using his simulacrum. Just like Mr Kesir. But instead telling people about conspiracy, he would supply materials from the Great Northern Wilderness. Or Green Hell, for that matter.
    ```

    - u/MizuRyuu:
      ```
      He is a powerful mage, but it would be very dangerous for him to hunt for material in the Great Northern Wildness. The mana deposit / invader cache was such a large money source for him is because it is a large sum of wealth that get regenerated each loop in the same location. There is no reason to believe he knows of any similar resource in other areas as there was simply no need to search for them when they had a ready resource in the mana deposit/cache
      ```

      - u/AKAAkira:
        ```
        From the sounds of it the Great Northern Wilderness has nothing in terms of danger to the deeper levels of the dungeon. There's just not enough ambient mana to support creatures that are that dangerous, and he's already made some cash hunting down monsters in the Wilderness and selling their parts for raw materials before (like just before meeting Silverlake for the first time).

        More likely for the danger to come in form of accidentally trespassing on someone else's territory, like the shifters', instead of chance of actual personal harm coming to him.

    It's been stated that magical creature needs certain level of ambient mana to continue living. The more powerful a creature, the thicker ambient mana they need just to survive. It would be no doubt there would be all manner of deadly creature in the depth of the Hole.

    Also, this haven't been talked about in the last few chapters, but there's a reason why Zorian never mention about reacquiring magical ability through blood magic. He would be confined to dense cities or risk weakening.

      Well no, you anchor the ability in your mana reserves, which constantly supplies it.  You have less total power from then on, since it's powering the enhancements, but you don't need ambient mana.  That's *way* to big a drawback to be worth it and they've had blood magic abilities plenty of times in the later loops yet weren't always around mana-rich places.
      ```

      - u/sambelulek:
        ```
        Oh, I just put the two together. The phrase sounds like this "by binding such enchantment, he practically turn himself into a magical creature."

        Edit: I did a search, it was on chapter 62. Turns out you're correct. Human, specifically, only need to pay with their mana reserve.
        ```

    - u/MizuRyuu:
      ```
      It probably isn't worth it to reacquire blood magic abilities aside from the permanent mana cost. The main reason they were willing to go the route of blood magic in the first place is that the loops would eliminate any risk of the procedure. Out of the loop, the risk of permanent injury isn't enough for any benefit that blood magic would give
      ```

  - u/GoXDS:
    ```
    (Grey Hunter) I'd imagine some of them may involve soul magic. maybe.

    simulacrums wouldn't matter. he explained every reasonable avenue of revenue and explained why they're not valid. he got most of it from crystalized mana deposits, and stealing from the invaders. first one is depleted for the most part and second is also depleted. he explained that he can sell stuff but that attracted too much attention and thus shut down as well. so he doesn't really have anything

    &#x200B;

    I do wonder what he's spending all that money on...
    ```

    - u/throwthisidaway:
      ```
      That part puzzled me. Zorian has all of these *mentors* like Xvim, who likely would be more than willing to be front men for a cut of the profits. Xvim in particular could invent something incredibly outlandish and advanced and no one would bat an eye.
      ```

    - u/sambelulek:
      ```
      Safe houses, of course. With the war looming, he would want a comfortable pocket dimension with Xvim-certified "adequate" security installed. That means army of golem posed as little girls' doll or ordinary furniture. Not to mention non-perishable supplies and supplier contact to get the perishable ones to entertain his guests once the danger comes.

      And maybe securing instruction from other archmages. Remember 2 dimensional mages Quatach-Ichl recommend? It would be a waste for Zorian to not contacting them before trying Quatach-Ichl again for further instruction (LOL). After all, the Bone's skill expanding Cyorian's Time Dillation facility in only three weeks is nothing but *absurdly* awe-inspiring.
      ```

There is one caveat to this docility however: given the opportunity, the Greg Hunter will, as its name might suggest, doggedly hunt down anyone with the name Greg. We still don't know how the creature identifies Gregs, but it's more than just auditory observation (as demonstrated by the slaughter of four of the Silent Monks of the cloistered order of Somnus in 1426). Perhaps it has some degree of soul perception?

  - u/xachariah:
    ```
    The primary issue in fighting the Grey Hunter is that Zorian was trying to keep its eggs intact (as well as it's impressive sight abilities).  

    He was able to kill it all the way back when he still had the skills of a student mage.
    ```

    - u/burnerpower:
      ```
      No way. Grey Hunters are terrifying mage killers that even professional combat mages fear fighting. Zorian originally planned to use it to scare off Oganj, a Dragon Mage. Getting the eggs just made the already impossible task for student mage Zorian even more insane. There's a reason that even with combat god Zach's help it still took them many tries to get the eggs successfully.

    - u/FairEmpty:

      I don't think so? The eye-beast used a [soul magic](https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2017/12/17/disciplines-of-magic/#comment-7723) attack on Zorian, and soul magic attacks need to overcome the target's magic resistance to work. So I imagine the grey hunter, possessing powerful magic resistance, would probably be immune.

  I'll have you know, you little noble daughter, that not even Vatimah Tinc, the chief of local Mage Guild double as the leader of Cult of Dragon Below, can boast about having more expertise than me. Not his mind magic, his soul magic, his blood magic, or even any of his less sinister branch of magic. None!

- u/AKAAkira:
  ```
  All right, now that I had the time to digest things, here are some of the things I'd like to see in the follow-up story:

  * Zorian rubbing it into his mother's face that it's all thanks to her witch ancestry that giant telepathic spiders scouted him out (and the reason Daimen was so successful)
  * Quatach-Ichl being incredibly petty and revealing Zorian and/or Zach the first chance he gets. I'm thinking soon after the war against Ulquaan Ibasa begins, he'd blow up a portion of the Eldemaran army, face their HQ and amplify his voice, and just bellow "ZORIAN KAZINSKI AND ZACH NOVEDA, I DEMAND A REMATCH!" and see how that blows up from there.
  * Akoja's father vetting Zorian's suitability for Akoja. ...Possibly at the same time as Raynie's father vetting Zorian's suitability for Raynie. Like, one party walking in on the other two's conversation or something.
  * Zorian hunting down Violet-Eyes for that injection of cash he needs. Her imperial staff might even be helpful when fighting against Oganj later, too.

  Thanks for writing this story!

      [They wouldn't oppose it too staunchly, is the author's opinion in this reply.](https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2019/08/31/the-dungeon/#comment-19734) At least, they seem to be more wary of powerful groups in general rather than just a powerful but relatively random mage like Daimen.

      It still would be dependent on Raynie actually liking him and trying to court him herself, though, as opposed to the proactive scouting by her tribe that my bullet point up there implied.

  I'm very happy with this epilogue. This story *is* the one at my top of all time list, ever since I first started reading it, which was when chapter 42 was first posted. So since September 27, 2015, or slightly after that. What a journey.

  I never buy physical copies of books, but come on. If this got published, I would need to get a signed copy, somehow. This story just hits all the points that I want in a story.

  I think people are mostly missing an extended epilogue, which may happen eventually. Maybe Nobody103 will pull a Wildbow and start a giant work in a few years, as a sequel. This epilogue was pretty satisfying, though.

  The only thing I miss is Zach interaction. In particular, I would have loved to see his wakeup scene, though the way this one started mirrors what he probably felt really well. I'm sure we'll start to see some fanfiction now. :)

  Man... This story has been so so good.

    Sign me up for that signed copy, 100%. Honestly MoL has been a huge part of my life over the last 5 years. I've definitely read it more than 5-6 times especially while waiting for new chapters. I've shared it as a bedtime story for my nieces and nephews. I've been an enthusiastic sharer of MoL content in real life. It's been real, MoL. It's been real. 

    And yes, the lack of Zach interaction I think definitely hurts the epilogue a bit.

  No further romantic development between Zorian and Raynie? Aw, that (not too) sucks.

  Actually Zorian placed himself in "only slightly out of reach" by letting Raynie know his most recent role and influence. Given that Raynie herself is an achiever, there's no doubt she would pursue Zorian or at least the position/prestige he is in. Although it's a coin toss whether it would develop into romantic feeling.

  Anyway, Akoja regretting the tone her letter let a chortle out of me.

      That would make the most sense to me, as well. I mentioned in the past that I expected that the author would just remove her entirely from the story once he edited the story into one coherent whole. 

      Probably, he will turn her into a fairly generic Ulqaan Ibasan, but one who happens to be connected to a major family. It would have the same general effect. There was also Kael's coin trick beating Quatach, that might be altered a bit as power creep forced the author to have to increase the lich's strength accordingly so he could remain a threat. According to what we now know of him, it would have been very surprising to be defeated by that, and for him to risk losing his crown, even temporarily.

    ```

    - u/-Fender-:
      ```
      She was the one person that RR and Quatach saw fit to bring with them when they confronted an archmage surrounded by academy professors. She was from a major house of Ulqaan Ibasa, one with a unique tradition of undeads seen nowhere else, that could potentially become more widespread than lichdom. Simply meeting with her or any member of her family would have required a lot of effort, time investment and resources, if they were not initially related to the invasion or intended to participate themselves. *Particularly so* because she was the heiress of this politically powerful house, one which was powerful enough to be able to apply pressure on Quatach Ichl himself. Who was the one who recruited her? Was it Red Robe, or Quatach Ichl? Was that why Quatach went back to Ulqaan Ibasa every month? Or if it was Red Robe, then why did he choose her? What made him go to Ulqaan Ibasa in the first place, or motivated him to seek them out?

      The mere fact that she, and her house, exists, creates a lot of implications for what is possible with magic in this world, and for the power structure of the Ibasan government. You're right that overall, she wasn't particularly relevant to the story. But that's only because the author chose not to include her, because he seems to have decided to drop that plot thread. But if you want to have consistent worldbuilding, then you need to include at least a few passages about her and her family in the epilogue, at the very least.

      But since the author chose not to do that, I expect him to remove her and her family entirely from the story once he edits all the chapters into one coherent whole, which will solve the inconsistencies.

        she was forced on QI, he did not deign to bring her of his own volition and didn't care for her personally (outright hated, actually). she was forced upon him to gain campaign experience and fame/honor for her house and nothing more. she was weak and lost to freakin newbie Zorian (even if by surprise). so again, QI was not going to bring her because he wanted to and RR absolutely had no reason

        QI himself also looked down on the new class of undead (nevermind the fact that she died easily, too). thinks they're too arrogant and overestimating themselves. 

        QI is a military leader but implied not all-powerful ruler of Ulqqan Ibasa. imo you're overvaluing QI's influence and House Zoltan and misunderstanding how their political structure works. remember, QI welcomes an attack against Ulqaan Ibasa because he thinks it'll teach some of the others in power a lesson, implying he doesn't have anywhere near absolute political authority. thus any particular house or necromantic art is very inconsequential to the main story.

        RR outright knows QI beats Zach solo handily. archmage or not (and I don't think RR ever thought Zach to be at that level). plus they brought more than simply 3 people to confront everyone in the hall. plus the teachers have to care about defending students and other importants.

  You don't just leave those kind of plot hooks hanging if you're not going to do more than a epilogue spin-off. Of all things to mention in a epilogue, why the golems? And why twice? Well...

  MoL 2's story begins a full month after the start of the war between Eldemar and Ulquaan Ibasa. When Cyoria comes under attack for a second time, a young novice mage who went on a expedition to the depths of its dungeon finds himself trapped, his only exit gone in a matter of moments, this is how he discovers a hidden facility deep underground and the giant golem slumbering inside. Now protecting his city and stopping the Ibasan forces is up to him and the ~~gundam~~ golem he found. Will the towering machine, along with the ever increasingly complex golems of the Eldemarian Kingdom, be enough to change the tide of battle in their favor and end the war once and for all? Or will the forces of evil triumph once more? Altazia's fate is once more in the hands of an unlikely hero and his mighty companion.

- u/generalamitt:
  ```
  I would argue that based on what we've seen in the last chapters, Zorian is *most certainly* the most powerful human *mage* in the entire continent, by far.

  1. His magical creations are so advanced beyond his time it's like a soldier from the middle ages with a modern machine gun. Sure, Zach or the lich could overwhelm him in a duel, But could they defeat him protected by the cube while supported by a 10-20 Mrva golems? Not to mention all the other tools he can prepare in advance.
  2. His hivemind connection with 10-15 clones of himself and the mind enhancements he developed seems to give him something close to superintelligence. Like finishing advanced math calculations in seconds instead of hours, and reverse engineer a trap *after springing it* while in combat.
  3.  He can basically one-shot anyone now that he managed to bypass the mind-blank spell. 
  4. Non-combat related, he has the most potential to exponentially grow.

  I think the biggest plot-hole in the entire story is that he still goes to school, which should be a complete waste of his time. (He could probably digest an entire lecture in two seconds, with his hivemind of clones and enhancements)
  ```

  - u/GoXDS:
    ```
    Zorian can't store 1 let alone 10~20 Mrva (yet). and both those and his cube can be sieged and drained. while very, very diverse, the cube could potentially have a weakness (like the demon saliva). now that QI has fought Mvra and knows of the flower, he can also build counter measures. after that, Zorian is pressed for an answer. 

    Zorian didn't quite have an answer to Silverlake's creatures. the rose demon stopped Mvra handily. it's doubtful Zorian would actually beat Oganj in a direct fight. well, maybe with the flower. not that those are common by any means. and also probably vastly underestimating how much it costs to build even 1

    one-shot requires contact. gl against QI or Oganj. QI can potentially fight it off via his superior soul defense (as confident RR was in his own, it probably isn't as superb) plus other defenses as well

    you're probably overestimating how much Zorian can still grow. probably still plenty of room, but not exponentially

    it's not a plot hole. how is he going to stay under the radar if he suddenly left on his own? you think he'd go back to Cyrin with his parents? there wasn't even anyone to go back to yet since his parents were in transit still. going off on his own will attract attention. "going to school" is pushing it, considering he personally grabbed teachers for "simply" a study group. he is also doing this more so to pay back his fellow classmates first and foremost anyways

  Anyway, What am I going to do with my life now then? I've been following and looking forward to the bi-weekly/monthly chapters of this for years, it's honestly helped keep me going... now I just feel empty. 

  I guess I'll need to track down some more of these "build 'em up" (well, "[One man industrial revolution](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManIndustrialRevolution)" is the closest genre to MoL, just replace 'industrial' with 'magic') stories, but I don't know if I'll ever find one that "scratches the itch" as much as MoL did.

  So, in one way I'm very happy to see this has come to a satisfying (and well deserved on Zorians part!) ending, on the other I'm sad that it's over.

        I think it's mostly because the author's been updating very slowly, so they haven't had the perspective on how to pace it very well. 3 weeks can be rough to pace, for MoL. But aHW is much more irregular, and goes a lot longer sans update.

        It's a good story, except the recent chapters (and really the whole thing) needs some editing and revision. And maybe for new chapters to be written faster so that the author can keep the idea of how it should be paced in their head, instead of slowly dripping out updates.

        A similar problem happens with Dungeon Keeper Ami, where ever since the Trapped double chapter, the author's updated it so slowly that the pacing feels a bit odd. Though, I think Pusakuronu is doing a bit better of a job in keeping pacing in mind over the long stretches without any updates.

  I think the real issue I'm having is that this entire book is about never seeing ripples go out further than a month, and the epilogue here is....one month after the invasion. Give us some long-term ramifications! Set it on the one- or two-year anniversary of the invasion (or something), so ZZ have had time to seed their paybacks and watched as the benefactors get to actually study the books for more than 30 days at a time. How does the world change when they can *actually* change it? Zach's goal was always to stop the invasion, but Zorian's felt a bit more farsighted, and I feel a bit robbed that I don't get to see the fruits of that foresight.
  ```

  - u/ketura:
    ```
    Oh, and another thing I've realized is missing: a gut punch.

    Like, all of Zorian's relationships, both hostile and friendly, have been colored by his ability to retry over and over until he's spent literal years getting to know people (with the sole exception of Zach). The playing field is now leveled, and with time flowing normally he doesn't have the time to build up those relationships with all those people the same way.

    I'd really like to see the pang of regret as people grow apart from the version he knows, or outright reject him out of suspicion when he accidentally blows his first impression out of habit. Showing the downsides of the loop would have gone a long way to feeling more complete.
    ```

    - u/MizuRyuu:
      ```
      There is also the fact that everyone knows he is a mind mage now, with all the stigma that entails. I would think any slip ups Zorian may have with people he previously interacted with would result in him being accused of reading their minds
      ```

  - u/Magromo:
    ```
    The most jarring is the lack of any interaction between Zorian and Zach, not even a simple dialogue. It looks as if it was supposed to be an introduction to the epilogue, not an epilogue itself, as if ending was cut short. But it seems Nobody103 is finished with the story, so there's that. He probably tried many ways of ending and was disappointed with them, so he's published the least he could stomach, however lackluster it is.
    ```

    - u/UPBOAT_FORTRESS_2:
      ```
      >But it seems nobody is finished with the story

      In the sense of "the author is finished", right? Easy to read "nobody is finished" as "everyone is still invested"
      ```

      - u/Magromo:
        ```
        Yeah, I forgot to mention number.
        ```

    - u/MizuRyuu:
      ```
      I am guessing the main interaction between ZZ would be the moment that Zach wakes up. After that, there probably isn't any significant interaction between ZZ that Nobody103 want to tell. Considering that it would be jarring to jump from a few minutes after the end of the invasion at the start of the epilogue, then a month later in the next scene, Nobody103 probably thought it would be better to cut that scene
      ```

  - u/gridpoint:
    ```
    The intro with Kirielle is a good summation of Zach's relationship with Zorian imo. Pranks. Taking out Tesen's men indicates they have that fight well in hand.

    Xvim appears to have gone back to teaching. So Zorian remains the teacher's pet to a mentor that Ilsa claims produces the occasional thriving student, a readymade explanation for Zorian's future growth. 

    I think Alanic is the most active behind the scenes, as he is surely behind the church's activities helping Eldemar track down miscellaneous bad guys.
    ```

  - u/DDisired:
    ```
    In the afterword, he did say he's thinking about a possible sequel that will address all the questions you listed. Maybe he wanted to keep it brief so he can properly flesh it out later?

    Though I was also hoping for a conversation between Zorian and Zach, but overall, I'm pretty happy with the story.

  “Zorian might be a master mind mage, but there was no way he could compel the entire royal bureaucracy to acknowledge a group of scary telepathic spiders as an ally against their will. “

  I call doubt.
  ```

  - u/MizuRyuu:
    ```
    You assume there is no master mind mage in the royal government? The government have been state to be powerful and overbearing. Especially considering the number of artifacts the government has that might protect the user from mind magic. Way too much risk for compulsion
    ```

    - u/bumbiedumb:
      ```
      Well one master mind mage is nothing. Not many mind mage is also a skilled soul mage using simulacrum with a shared stream of conscious. Mind magic doubles with every simulacrum. 

      Along with your friendly neighbourhood mind reading spiders, with enough planning and effort it will be possible.

      Furthermore, a foreign hostile country was able to organised a whole invasion underneath their city, subverting the high level officials in cyoria. Your over-estimating the capabilities of the eldemar government.
      ```

      - u/AKAAkira:
        ```
        A foreign hostile country was able to organize a whole invasion underneath a city in the country that the royal capital is actually on slightly bad terms with (among the citizens of the royal capital, at least. In contrast, the principal of Cyoria's academy was noted to be a fervent nationalist, though I can't speak for the municipal government). The story'd be a little different if the Ibasans tried to attack the capital, which has a higher concentration of competent mages loyal to the death to the Crown. Zorian even notes on his first visit there that the capital city has soldiers patrolling regularly as a matter of course, unlike Cyoria, so crime is somewhat harder to organize.

        Besides which, if Zorian was to seriously attempt subverting the entire royal bureaucracy, he'd have to get them all at once, which is physically impossible unless he uses something similar to his array network (which would just call attention onto him), or use something like a long-term compulsion that spreads like a virus which other than being somewhat too shady for Zorian and even most aranea's tastes, would probably take enough time that someone skilled enough is almost guaranteed to catch on eventually. Either of those would just escalate a takeover into outright conflict between the government and the mind mages, which is really not where Zorian wants to take this, I'd bet.

        And even all that is leaving aside whatever divine artifact the Royals might be able to dust off and use. Zorian still hasn't figured out how to invade the sulrothums' sand worm's mind, because of its divine protection, remember.

          It is, but Zorian has repeatedly shown he has no interest in doing the types of things you need to do to become a lich.

          Not to mention, he values his normal life to much to become an undead.

  ```
  Conspiracy theory: Zach couldn't show up in the epilogue because he's dead. The angel contract killed him.

  Zorian couldn't handle the grief, so he used mind magic to give himself false memories of saving Zach. "I Win (III)" is no more real than the other "I Win" chapters. Everyone else also thinks Zach is alive because, before modifying his memories, Zorian built an advanced golem to pretend to be Zach (this is what he's been spending all his money on). The golem is good enough to fool others, but not Zorian, which is why Zach-golem is programmed to never, ever interact with Zorian in person. It all fits.

  A big vote for the slice-of-life mini-sequel as mentioned in the afterword, if you are keeping count. With the cast-of-dozens the epilogue could only cover a few of the relevant characters, and in minor ways, so I would definitely be interested in having more of that detailed. And there is still sortof this final "plot" element of Zorian and Zac building a life where they can be honest about their abilities and find a role for themselves, which I imagine that would cover. So if you need votes for that, this is one!

  This is excellent. I can say it now: MoL is my favourite novel of all times - and I read a *lot* of novels.

  A single epilogue chapter is, of course, not enough to touch all plot threads in detail, nor is it meant to. As the author said, that would be sequel material. This, instead, was used to provide a general outline of the closure, and it's certainly up to the task.

  I shall eagrly await for u/nobody103 's next work!

        If we're talking strength only and if dragon mages count, the title might go to Oganj now...
        ```

        - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
          ```
          Unlikely, Zach managed to beat down Oganj and his apprentices entirely by himself, only taking a small amount of time loop restarts to work out a working strategy.

          Meanwhile Zach has never managed to beat QI, ever. Countless loops went by and he still gets his ass kicked with so much ease that the lich can openly toy with him.
          ```

          - u/nytelios:
            ```
            He managed only after repeated restarts of *ambushing* an unsuspecting Oganj. In the actual fight, he couldn't beat Oganj even with Alanic and Xvim. And now Oganj has the crown, which presumably works for dragons. 

            QI is definitely cannier and more versatile than Oganj. Being a lich also makes him immune to pretty much all of Zach's repertoire. All defeats of his physical body are merely a setback.
            ```

          - u/AKAAkira:
            ```
            >Meanwhile Zach has never managed to beat QI

            Possibly untrue, given that in Chapter 105 the imperial crown was relevant to making Jornak a temporary time-looper (and I don't quite see Zach being able to "borrow" it from QI without a battle).

            I did wonder if that part of the chapter was actually very significant...
            ```

            - u/MizuRyuu:
              ```
              It sounds like Jornak was part of a group that manipulated Zach to steal the crown. Considering Jornak is the only known surviving member of the corrupted group, it is probably safe to assume that the battle to steal the crown was intense and fatal for most of the group.
              ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      Eh, he's definitely a contender, but he might fight very differently without his crown.
      ```

      - u/burnerpower:
        ```
        We see him fight without his crown briefly in the time loop. By himself hes still plenty good enough to match Z&Z with Zach using the crown. All of their wins against him were the result of a lot of prep and traps designed to counter him.
        ```

  - u/Calsem:

    Oganj. The angel only had a 50/50 chance at beating him and that was *before* oganj had the crown. Yes the angel was wounded but it was still a high ranked divine being.

  Now there's some sequelbait if I've ever seen any. Come on, there's gotta be material for like 3 chapters or more of follow up. There are so many little things that while not ultimately meaningful would be fun to tie up. 

  Maybe some good fanfic of MoL will pop up.
  ```

- u/LimeDog:
  ```
  We also should remember that a bunch of information was stored in the Palace Orb, and couldn't make it across the dimensional boundary. A large portion of novel research was lost. 

  I'm most curious on whether the Black Room research (if it survived the crossing) will significantly impact the world. All the major governments getting access to the sheer upgrade in Black Room capabilities will immensely shift the political landscape.

  If the Angel keeps the deal with Oganj, I can't wait to see QI come calling to pick up his junk.
  ```

- u/wertwert765:
  ```
  This happened in an earlier chapter but I never fully understood and I wondering if anyone would explain it to me. Why did Zorian kill the original Zorian. I understand taking his body to save the world and all that. But why did he destroy his originals soul afterwards instead of just storing it and giving original Zorian his body back later. Loop Zorian could wait and get a new body for himself and then return original Zorian to his body. Sure there would be complications and it would suck for the original Zorian but surely its better then being dead?
  ```

  - u/AngryPuzzle:
    ```
    Zorian himself explains to Zach why he did so. I'm going to quote from chapter 92 for your convenience.



    >“Oh yeah… what did you do with the–” Zach started to ask, before being cut off by Zorian.  
    >  
    >“I killed him,” Zorian said curtly. “Sent his soul to the afterlife.”  
    >  
    >“I… umm… shit,” Zach fumbled. “That’s kind of… brutal?”  
    >  
    >“What was I supposed to do?” Zorian asked, uncomfortable with this line of questioning. “I don’t know how to make a new body for him. Maybe I never will. I’d have to either keep him in stasis for years and years before finally releasing him into an alien world where a stranger has usurped his life… or having him accompany me as a powerless ghost looking over my shoulder, constantly getting his face rubbed in at the fact I’m so much better than him at everything. Isn’t that a cruel and horrifying fate to inflict on someone?”  
    >  
    >“I… don’t know,” Zach admitted after a while.  
    >  
    >“I know I’m not the same person as him by this point,” Zorian said quietly, “but I would hate that with every fiber of my being. I… don’t think I’d ever get over it. Maybe I’m just a selfish monster trying to justify my crimes, but I think I’m doing him a favor. Alanic says the afterlife is still a thing, even after the gods stopped talking to people. For all his faults, I don’t think the old Zorian had done anything truly heinous in his life… there should be a good outcome waiting for him there. Something he’d never get back here with us.”

Are they just going to turn into Advanced Grey Hunters, slightly larger/more intelligent/more magical, like ordinary D&D monsters that are advanced? Are they going to turn into Hunter-Shifters, given that she consumed Panaxeth's essence? Are they going to have durability-enhancing mutations, like Looper Silverlake? Maybe become general shapeshifters who happen to have Grey Hunter as their base form? If it's the latter, is it possible that they might eventually intermingle with the aranea, or is their brood too deep into the Dungeon for their territory to intersect?
