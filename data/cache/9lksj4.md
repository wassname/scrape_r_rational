## Good rational material to watch? Series, youtube, documentary...

### Post:

I know it's a reddit for "fiction", but the "rationality" reddit is dead and I don't know where to ask.

&#x200B;

Do you guys know any good rational videos/series/documentaries, fiction or non fiction, that are worth watching? Something that can even slightly help broaden thinking and teach something new, including Youtube channels and National Geographic documentaries.

It does not have to be strictly related to rationality, of course.

  The YouTube channel Primitive Technology, if you need a dose of raw competence in your day. Man films himself conducting very basic survival skills and constructing shelter, making fire, doing simple farming, making fire, kilns, etc. with his own hands. He’s recently started working on extracting iron.

  Rationality adjacent podcasts I like:
  * [Rationally Speaking](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/rationally-speaking/id351953012?mt=2) - Julia Galef interviews scientists, philosophers, organizers, etc. about their work and how it relates to rationality. 

  * [The After On Podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-after-on-podcast/id1265002699?mt=2) - Rob Reid, sci-fi author and entrepreneur, interviews scientists, techies, and leaders. It started with interviews related to the tech and concepts in his books, but has grown beyond that. The interviews are higher quality than Rationally Speaking, but less directly rational. 

  * [The Future of Life Institute Podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-future-of-life/id1170991978?mt=2) - does interviews about AI, ethics, extinction risks. The topics are mostly interesting, but the audio is disappointing and the hosts are monotone. 

  * [The Bayesian Conspiracy](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-bayesian-conspiracy/id1085426180?mt=2) - co-hosted by the guy that produced the audio book for HPMOR. It’s much more conversational than any of the other podcasts.

  Other podcasts that are not rationality related, but are fun and educational:
  * [99 Precent Invisible](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/99-invisible/id394775318?mt=2) - my absolute favorite podcast. Covers anything and everything about design in the world around us.

  * [Science Vs](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/science-vs/id1051557000?mt=2) - From vitamins, to ghosts, to nuclear power, what does the science say about common knowledge and fears? It’s an excellent and fun podcast, if you can survive the puns.

  * [The Allusionist](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-allusionist/id957430475?mt=2) - All about words, their meaning, origin, and how they’re used.

    Another one that /r/rational viewers are likely to enjoy is CGP Grey: 

    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs

    Really good at using simple logic to explain why complex topics are the way they are.

      CGP Grey has two podcasts: Hello Internet and Cortex. But they are conversational, not educational. I like the unofficial animated snippets by Hm Boutet:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT1BxBY8_6ZN2Rpe7pHs6wg

  ContraPoints on youtube is good, start with some of her new videos.

    Within the same YouTube neighborhood, I  like:

    * [PhilosophyTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/thephilosophytube), which features videos about philosophy. 

    * [Lindsay Ellis ](https://www.youtube.com/user/chezapoctube) (her newer stuff). She does good movie critiques.

    * [Down the Rabbit Hole ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbWcXB0PoqOsAvAdfzWMf0w) does in-depth histories of obscure internet events.

    In a completely different YouTube neighborhood, [Science and Futurism with Isaac Arthur](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZFipeZtQM5CKUjx6grh54g) is a fantastic channel for scenarios on space colonization, mega structures, Fermi paradox, etc.

    So...I don't mean to stay anything here, but isn't ContraPoints a politically partisan channel? Her subreddit has a [masterlist of left wing YouTubers.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ContraPoints/comments/9j0wgs/masterlist_of_leftwing_youtube_channels/)

    EDIT: I see someone's also submitted a bunch of channels popular with the right wing, so I guess this is only fair. Regardless, I wish that this sub didn't involve politics.
    ```

    - u/narmio:
      ```
      She’s definitely both left-aligned policy-wise and partisan (in that she advocates publicly for those policy positions).


      But I don’t think that makes her less rational. Don’t get me wrong, many partisans are irrational, there’s definitely a correlation.  But I find ContraPoints to do a good job of arguing from principle rather than tribalism.
      ```

    - u/Dragfie:
      ```
      If you're referring to my comment I had the exact same thought as you lol. 

      I was wondering though why you don't want this subreddit to, at least, talk about politics. I would hope that if any non-partisan community could discuss politics without getting heated it would be one that specifically advocated for rationality over emotions?

      As a side note though, I don't really see how my comment, if you were referring to it, has many right-wing political channels recommended? I did split the partisan and non-partisan channels, and believe i split the recommendations evenly, if not even slightly left leaning? Unless you are counting Sargon, Peterson and Bret as solidly right leaning, then i guess just difference of opinion.
      ```

        > Unless you are counting Sargon, Peterson and Bret as solidly right leaning, then i guess just difference of opinion.

        Well, Sargon's with UKIP, and Peterson and Brett have both received lots of positive coverage from the right wing - ContraPoints has done at least one video on Peterson. Overall my point is that the pursuit of critical thinking and good storytelling isn't inherently political, and I dislike politics being brought into neutral spaces as it tends to be divisive.
        ```

        - u/Dragfie:
          ```
          I guess it does. My wish is that it wasn't so decisive, but i completely understand and respect the community rules so will refrain from going into issues.

          For those 3, all 3 are liberals. (as in the proper definition of the word, not the party). UKIP is the only party in Brittan atm which prioritizes liberal values, and isn't even that far right if at all. On multiple occasions Sargon has polled his audience and its almost every time it's 50/50 left-right. He calls himself centrist and used to call himself left leaning.

          In general, lately the right has gone more libertarian and the left more authoritarian. Being libertarian focused has made them seem more right-leaning and left-wing authoritarians and right-wing liberals want to perpetuate that since it helps their strategy. 10 years ago all 3 would be called solidly left-leaning. So in public opinion i guess you could call them right wing channels, but by the traditional definitions of the words i think that is false.

  This video is probably the best overall, bottom up, simply explained description of what makes up rational epistemology.

  https://youtu.be/3MRHcYtZjFY

  Might not have anything new for long time rationalists, but if everyone really, truly understood the concepts in that video, the world would be a very different place.

  Also, pretty much everything from CGP Grey is fantastic.

  So this obviously gets heated. For anyone else wanting to comment, I welcome other political recommendations of people you think fairly attempt to discuss with people they disagree with. If your rec is similar to any of the ones below I probably already know if it though. 

  * ContraPoints as recommended below. 
  * Sargon of Acadd
  * Lacigreen
  * Jordan B Peterson
  * Bret Weinstien (He is also an evolutionary psychologist, you can listen to his things for the educational content too.)

  Also, if anyone else has any suggestions please do gimi, especially on good educational things.

      Assume my knowledge of him ends at him being a public figure, him being controversial (presumably along political lines), and that people sometimes refer to him as "Dr. Clean-Your-Room."
      ```

      - u/oliwhail:
        ```
        He's a sloppy thinker and is at best ignorant (and at worst a deliberate liar) about religion, climatology, and gender politics. He offers nothing you can't get from non-toxic sources, and there's a bunch of pigshit mixed in. Why spend extra time washing it out, if you could just get it clean from people like Charles Duhigg and Angela Duckworth?

        E: not to mention *psychology*, apparently, since he seems to be big on Jung now that I'm digging more into it? Give me a break.

          I'll be replying to all 3 comments here, so I guess (/u/Action_Bronzong)?

          Ok to the lectures; Have you watched them? Because if you have you would realise that:

          1. The lectures were recorded before the controversy, it's a standard university course, and no one had an issue with them until now. I have taken psychology courses and listened to other professors talking on the subject (I believe a video including your other recommendations too) and they all seem consistent. If you want to take the word of some people politically opposed to him who now claim that it's mostly pigshit and not check for yourself then I guess we will just agree to disagree, if you have checked for yourself please show me examples of what you are talking about. I would very much like to know what was wrong for my own sake.
          2. Yes, 1% if politics. Whenever he goes off on a tangent it's most often about myths and stories, and how they relate to his field. Whether he is portraying the stories accurately or not is irrelevant, it's a learning tool and the science is sound (the science is not derived from the stores but the stores twisted to fit the science). If you watched the lectures yourself, you would also know that whenever he does venture into politics, it's non-partisan. He talks about the types of people (as shown through studies and research) who fall into different "wings" and why they are BOTH important, not why any side is most important than another.

          To your first comment, would you mind giving some examples in what you think is ignorant about religion climatology and gender politics? To my non-political recommendation it would be irrelevant because he doesn't mention those in his courses, but I am curious as to what you are referring to.

          Lastly, about the wiki:

          ...I'm at a loss for words. This is the introduction:

          >**Jordan Bernt Peterson** (b. 1962), is a Canadian ~~evolutionary biologist~~[\[1\]](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Jordan_Peterson#cite_note-1) ~~neuroscientist~~[\[2\]](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Jordan_Peterson#cite_note-2) clinical psychologist and professor of [psychology](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Psychology) at the University of [Toronto](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Toronto). He is the author or coauthor of more than 90 [peer-reviewed](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Peer-review)articles on clinical psychology, social psychology, and personality theory.[\[note 1\]](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Jordan_Peterson#cite_note-3) [However](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Inverse_stopped_clock), Peterson is better known because of his [conservative](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Conservative) views on [religion](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Religion), on [trans](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Trans) issues, and on [feminism](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Feminism). His statements are notoriously incoherent and ambiguous, which allows him to [handwave](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Handwave) criticism as mere misrepresentations of his views.[\[3\]](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Jordan_Peterson#cite_note-CurrentAffairs-4) Peterson's fanbase is extremely dedicated and overlaps with the [incel](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Incel) and [MGTOW](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Men_Going_Their_Own_Way) circles, though he is not a member of either.

          Right off the bat, in what is supposed to be a piece of news, not propaganda, resorts to adhomenim and poisoning the well! "and overlaps with the incel and MGTOW circles" Holy shit, this wiki should be ashamed of calling itself Rationalist! what the actual fuck? The author is obviously implying that those two "groups" are some kind of evil, and using a correlation fallacy to try and poison the well. As if it also says something about mental health institutions that their customers overlap with incel's and MGTOW's.This is such an obvious hit piece, I can't believe it.

          Even this piece has to admit that " However, in November 2017, he had 4510 citations with an [h-index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/h-index)📷 of 38 (see [Jordan B Peterson - Scopus preview](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=7403426180)). An h-index of 20 is considered "successful", and 40 "outstanding"." (which is 39 now) That he is an experienced, recognised and trusted professional in his field, and I think I trust field of science over a propaganda piece.

          The rest is very interesting and, where it reports facts, accurate, but so obviously biased its embarrassing. It's obviously designed to target non-religious, left-leaning, anti-discrimination, anti-sexist, readers and imply he is against all those things demonstrated with valid quotes where he criticises issues related with each of them. Being each of those things (so either disagreeing with him or not being happy with the logical conclusion) AND listening to him I can safely say that his criticisms of those are perfectly valid and absolutely not ignorant or misleading.

          For example: The whole part about religion. He says that religion gives people stability and they perform better with it. I'm an atheist and I can tell you he is completely correct! and so what?

          &#x200B;

          Guess if you would still like to discuss specific points I would be glad to, but I think most of this is cleared up if you actually listen to what he has to say. and especially interested in what I mentioned above what you think he is ignorant or lying about.

        This was my reply to oliwhail

        The reason he is controversial is because of his political opinions, chiefly: strongly pro-free speech, for equal opportunity, anti equal outcomes, acknowledges average biological differences in people exist, which all immediately puts him against the mainstream trend and hence "controversial". The reddit rules say no American politics though. Not sure if this would count because pretty much all politics is American politics so i won't expand beyond here. Strongly recommend his lecture series and if you foray into the politics, at the very least watch his interviews. (I recommend after the lectures)
