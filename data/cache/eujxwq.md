      It happens, albeit rarely. The Hobbit was edited after release to change Riddles in the Dark to match up with the events and gravitas of Lord of the Rings (which was then poked fun at by having the original version being the lie that Bilbo told the dwarves).

  This kicks ass. I'm honored that something I said got to be echoed by Jake's mental model of Marco.

  > In that moment, there was joy, and the Visser did not suppress it.  He exulted in his victory, reveled in the fact of his own survival, bathed in the exhilaration of pure sensation.  It was good to be alive, and for a moment he let himself feel it fully, laughing with uninhibited abandon in that chamber where no other could see.

  I don't remember if this or the 1984 reference were in the previous version of the chapter, but I liked both a lot.

  In retrospect, that none of Visser's tests were designed to investigate his relationship/control over Alloran is a bad oversight. He could use some more weaknesses, so that seems fine. I've been thinking about the degree to which values inform and partially constitute cognition for a while now, it'd be interesting to see that angle investigated at some point. (Most epistemological questions terminate in adopting pragmatic assumptions, and those are partly informed by values. Although there's lots of convergence for instrumental reasons, thinkers in very different environments might not experience so much of that. Human minds also all run on similar hardware with broadly similar values, so maybe convergence for instrumental reasons is rarer than we'd typically assume.)

  If I'm lucky enough that I might get to see Visser becoming a pool, it occurs to me that his unease with Alloran's mental merging might be a path toward it. I'm also imagining a somehow mentally ill Visser creating a cloned copy of himself, forcing it to take on Andalite morph, then infesting it, to recreate a twisted version of their original dynamic, with himself in the roles of both victim and master. He couldn't do so in his current form, of course.

    Now this...this is pretty twisted. I like it. Since Visser v2 now has a hybrid brain with no separate Yeerk [(source)](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/eujxwq/rt_ff_ranimorphs_the_reckoning_chapter_39_jake/ffr5tdz/), it's possible that he could be infested by a shard of any of the existing coalescions now too. Hopefully they don't catch on to that. That would be coming full-circle in a strange way.

        ```
        I think this is a decision for you to make, Mr. Author. I could see it going both ways honestly. Visser 3 knows the technology exists, but I can imagine it'd be a bit of a blind spot for a yeerk to think about itself being infested?

- u/notgreat:

  Ok, WTF is up with the multiversal time travel shennanigans. Particularly with Kandrona, which seems to be very close to canon. But notably, the bioogy was still compatible with this universe's pools and feeding.

  I have no idea how you're going to make this all work out, and I eagerly await seeing it for myself.
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Yeah, I was a little confused about the dates and the logistics of it all.

    Like, I think it's a Peggy Sue thing? Like, Elfangor, Elena and V1 were transferred to their respective bodies in the new universe? But then why was Elena still with the yeerks? And why didn't Elfangor remember her? You'd think Marco would have found out about her reading his memories. Unless he never learned her name?

    Also, it seems that the Yeerks and Andalites were sent back in time, but Earth wasn't for some reason?
    ```

    - u/daytodave:
      ```
      > And why didn't Elfangor remember her?

      When they morphed Elfangor one of the times they noticed part of his memory blocked off, I wonder if that was it?

      What's really interesting to me is that Elfangor and Elena seem to be treated differently than the other pawns in the E/C game. Before the field trip, the avatar said that both gods were constrained in their ability to intervene, as though they were both bound by something other than just not wanting debts to each other. Elfangor says he can't tell the kids more or else "Crayak will have leave to.--"; that's the only time I can think of that a mortal has a "move" he can make in the game, with the same kind of consequences/trade off as the players. (I was thinking maybe the rest of that sentence was "--give Visser Three a bunch of information about the other timeline".)

      In canon, the Ellimist and Crayak are genuinely concerned (afraid?) of a human having the Time Matrix, I wonder if the Time Lattice has real power to do things the gods can't undo, and Elfangor and Elena were able to use it as a bargaining chip? *"[Time travel] is [impossible].  In this universe, anyway."* Maybe the Time Lattice came from a universe where time travel is possible, and the gods here never thought to plan a contingency for that, because there's nothing about the physics of their universe that even hints it could be possible in any other universe?
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        The E/C can still move matter around, so even if a law-breaking artifact appeared in our universe, I think they could freeze/kill any person controlling it.

        >Before the field trip, the avatar said that both gods were constrained in their ability to intervene

        I *think* that was implied by u/TK17Studios in the comments to just mean the rules of the game.

I could see that it was there—feel the shape of it, trace the way that it had influenced his thoughts and actions after the fact—but the actual content of it was hidden from me by a blank wall that Elfangor himself didn’t even know was there.

      > The day after that hidden memory, he’d left Alloran.  Had resigned his commission, surrendered his rank, and dropped out of the Andalite military, throwing away a future as the most promising protégé of the most brilliant strategist of the past thousand years—

      ```

  - u/Badewell:
    ```
    Since the kandrona is a holdover from canon, maybe all of the changes between canon and this story are because of iterative usage of the Time ~~Matrix~~ Lattice? I keep coming back to the feeling that it's a monkey's paw thing, and some of the other changes like the new Yeerk biology or the Path might have come from Yeerks and Andalites in previous iterations trying to use the Time Lattice to make their respective races stronger. Using manipulation to get mortals to ask for wishes that will make races more unified seems like Crayak's bag.

    That could also explain why Earth wasn't reset: Elena was there too, she would have wanted to return to her own planet and family and not a weird AU version.
    ```

    - u/daytodave:
      ```
      Maybe, but I assumed the point of changing it to Time Lattice was to signal that it *didn't* come from the canon universe.

      That would mean this is a multiverse where some universes are rational and others aren't. That's real weird.

        Probably not the literal canon universe then, but a universe with the same setting. And with several jumps between that universe and the current one, minor changes like names happen from side effects of the big changes that the jumpers cause.

  As noted in the Authors Notes at the start of the chapter, this is both a rewrite and an incorporation of Jake Part Dos:  


  > Author's Notes:

  >   1. This is a REPLACEMENT for Chapter 39, while also being Chapter 39, Part II. Sorry for forcing you to reread, but I ended up going back and making a lot of changes (hopefully improvements) to the earlier parts, and then just smoothly carried on into the second half. You could technically just ctrl+f "I lay awake on the narrow cot," but you'll have false memories about what happened with Jake and the Visser if you do.

  >    2. Speaking of which, specific kudos to readers u/CouteauBleu and u/hyphenomicon for feedback that was both highly critical AND highly constructive. This chapter is better because of them. (There are other readers who proposed a bunch of stuff that'll help with future chapters that I'll hopefully remember to shout-out later.)

  >    3. I've opened up an admonymous account as a side project, with the goal of collecting anonymous questions that are too personal, too embarrassing, too confrontational, too dangerous, too weird, or otherwise too costly to be seen to ask. It's been fun so far; if you want to drop a question it's just admonymous dot co slash duncan. Note that answers go up on Facebook and pretty much nowhere else, so you'll need to either friend me, follow me, or search for me there to see them (my posts are always public).

  >    4. Next update is planned for two weeks out; we're still On A Roll. May lose steam at some point and slow down, but at the moment I'm still hoping to not go on another long hiatus (and at most, *one* more long hiatus).

  *We're in the endgame now.*

  Awesome chapter. V3's got a new tricked-out body, the gang is back on earth, and stuff's goin' down.

  Great character moments between Jake and Marco. Also V3 seems to be less frozen and indecisive after the rewrite, but I'm not sure because the integration of the edits was very smooth.

  Literally laughed out loud. The gods were waiting for that exact conversation to take place, apparently.

  Okay, so, the time travel and multiverse shenanigans are very confusing. If I was reading that right, the beginning of the Yeerk-Andalite war is just *shifted* in the new timeline, so that it occurs later. In the original timeline, Visser 1 was given a body *after* the war began, and then found Earth after a while of looking around the galaxy. In the new timeline, the war doesn't start until after she (or a version of her) left Earth with the Skrit Na - so how could Edriss have already come to Earth in the new timeline, if the war hadn't started yet?

  Nevertheless, I have a prediction about what's happening. I think there is no time travel or alternate universe, at least in the conventional sense. I think the gods put Edriss and Elfangor through an immersive, extended simulation of the future, seasoning their chosen heroes with experience before instantiating them back into their "present" at the right place and time. The simulation still got some things right early on, like the Skrit Na taking Marco's mother, but then the real world quickly diverged from the simulation. The Time Lattice was a MacGuffin made up by the gods to give Edriss and Elfangor a fake explanation for why they had seemingly teleported through time and space. (Also, this might imply that the much-hated Helmacrons aren't actually real - they were a little joke invented by the gods to get their heroes to the time matrix, thus allowing TK17 to reference them while having them not actually exist in this universe...) That being said, I *still* can't figure out the timeline here, assuming this hypothesis is true. Why does the entire earth appear to have shifted in time relative to the rest of the galaxy? Does this have something to do with the Z-space rift?

  Regardless, if we're just going by what we've seen so far, this is the best explanation I can come up with that doesn't imply an awkward last-minute reveal of some random time-travel tech that was somehow there the whole time, and which we've repeatedly been told is impossible. Also, it explains Rachel's visions - if she can see memories of past versions of herself, why not memories of alternate simulated versions? Same god-hardware, right?

  Anyway, very excited for the finale.
  ```

  - u/daytodave:
    ```
    Every since we heard the words "alternate timelines" I've been trying to figure out how to model them as simulations on the hypercomputer.

    I kind of hope not, though. Because the Time Matrix was real in canon, and powerful enough that the gods were at least a little afraid of it, and it would just be cooler if TK17 has found a way to work a rational upgrade of it into this story.
    ```

    - u/LieGroupE8:
      ```
      I'd be down for it being real, *if* it could be explained well in the last few chapters, but I don't see where it would fit in. On the other hand, I think that having the explanation turn out to be hypercomputer simulations would be really cool, and would fit the evidence so far. I think there are cool story dynamics there.
      ```

      - u/notgreat:
        ```
        How does the Kandrona fit in though? Pre-warp they used a canon-esque light source, post-warp is the nutrient also found in maple syrup.

        If not for that I'd say your hypothesis is very likely, but I just don't see how that would work with the Kandrona change.
        ```

        - u/LieGroupE8:
          ```
          Huh, I didn't notice that. When I saw that  Kandrona rays were in this chapter, I assumed it was just yet another Yeerk innovation like the oatmeal that gave them another food source, this time via microbes in the yeerks manufacturing the kandrona nutrient. But you're right, it looks like more than that by how characters were reacting. I'll have to think on that.

  One thing I've been wondering for a long time is how you can get a universe that prohibits time travel while also permitting FTL travel/messaging. A causality violation is a causality violation regardless of whether you do it through warp fields or wormholes or z-space or what, so unless relativity isn't a thing in this universe i have no idea how it all works out.

  The same objections hold true for universes like star trek, so this is less about me calling the author out on the matter and more wondering how to make the concept consistent.

  - u/TK17Studios:

    > unless relativity isn't a thing in this universe

    You can indeed get this if you nix relativity, right?  I mean, that causes other problems, but if there's a universal reference frame, doesn't that get you there?

    ELI5?

    Like, is there a fundamental reason causality couldn't just work slightly differently to allow that stuff?
    ```

    - u/FenrirW0lf:
      ```
      The problem boils down to the [relativity of simultaneity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity)

      The tl;dr is that FTL travel *is* time travel.

      The longer explanation is that events in spacetime can only have causal relationships, and there's an upper limit to how quickly information from one event can propagate to another event (and thereby potentially exhert an influence it). That limit is the speed of light, which is really the *speed of causality*.

      What this means is that there's technically no such thing as events happening "at the same time". If some event A has causal influence over some other event B, then all observers in all possible reference frames will agree that A happened before B. But if there is no causal relationship between a pair of events (such as 2 events happening light-years apart from each other), then there exists some reference frame where A happens before B, some reference frame where B happens before A, and some reference frame where A coincides with B.

      This doesn't come up much in our daily lives because most events we ever deal with happen rather close by each other in cosmological terms. But if you try to form a timelike ordering between, say, event A happening right now on Earth and event B happening "right now" on the Arn homeworld several light-years away from us, then you run right into this ambiguity. And so if you FTL teleport from Earth to Arn, go on a monster-slaying adventure, then teleport back to Earth, you very well could arrive home before you'd even left it. Same goes with jumping to the Andalite home world through Z-Space or similar.

      If there's some way to tweak causality to allow this stuff while also leaving the universe in a recognizable state, then i dont know about it and I don't really fault the fic for not having an explanation either. It's not an easy problem to solve.
      ```

      - u/daytodave:
        ```
        >And so if you teleport from Earth to Arn, go on a monster-slaying adventure, then teleport back to Earth, you very well could arrive home before you'd even left it.

        Is it possible that a super intelligence could compensate for that using the same "smart adjustment" they used to put the kids back in the same cities they left from, even though the earth has moved? I.e., is there some perfect timing for the disappearing and reappearing that has you return at t=[moment you remember leaving] + [time you experienced while away], that's possible to calculate?
        ```

        - u/FenrirW0lf:
          ```
          The problem is more fundamental than that though, because causality violations place the universe *as a whole* into an inconsistent state. If you want to, from your own perspective, arrive back on Earth after you left it rather than before, then sure. All you have to do is pick some reference frame where A precedes B and all appears to be well. But there are still all those other pesky reference frames where the opposite holds true. And this wouldn't apply to just the Arn trip, but to every other instance and method of FTL signalling or transport.

          Chances are that the Animorphs universe (and Star Trek universe and others like it) either aren't relativistic at all, or maybe they have some crazy form of hyper-relativity that keeps it all consistent somehow despite FTL existing.

    After reading the previous chapter / first draft of this chapter (and reading some comments about it) I thought I needed to go back at some point and read the original canon (especially now as old canon *might* be alt universe canon in *this* canon?).

    I found that exact thing you have the screenshot of, and separately started listening to a podcast which also referenced that.

    I've been reading your fic with the impression that it's almost a "dark and gritty" version of the Animorphs (which almost sounds like an insult, but I only mean it as one facet of the larger whole), but holy hell there was a lot of dark in the original I couldn't see through my rose-tinted glasses.

    At times I'm starting to think the main difference between this and original canon is that V3 is actually competent (and not an over-the-top James Bond villain like he was in original canon) and that's forcing everyone else into positions where they need to work harder.

  But the Elfangor-part of Helium doesn't recognize her - because he split from Elfangor!Elfangor before the time lattice. Yeah makes sense. Huh being Helium must be pretty weird

  Jake trying to force Marco to be real friends with him again was so tense. I've had some friendships that for various reasons lost their warmth and it always seemed so irreversible.

  Making V3 the evil rationalist bioengineered 007 

  Also, in a previous comment section TK hinted very unsubtly that Donna Marina's name was a hint about her character but I can't figure it out and it's annoying me. I assume it was supposed to be a hint that she was double-crossing humanity but I don't see the connection. Donna Marina means, like, Lady Ocean, which reminds me of Galadriel's line when she Goes Evil for a second but that doesn't seem right; Julia Roberts never double-crossed the rest of Ocean's *n*; it's sort of a Spoonerism of Dan Marino who's a Dolphin, so... no that's nothing either. Hang on, he's in Ace Ventura; Ventura, CA; dolphin sex... is it a hint this book is about to turn unnecessarily transphobic at the last second? Or just a nod to the Animorphs being magic pet detectives?

    Shortening him to "Q" just happened naturally, but after I typed it I laughed out loud.

    > Jake trying to force Marco to be real friends with him again was so tense

    It lets me work out some issues from my own past, in a kind of "if only I'd been smarter, or more committed because the stakes were higher," or something.  I'm glad the tension came through; when I've been in these situations it felt irreversible for me, too, and I wanted that sense of teetering on a cliff at *least.*

    > Donna Marina's name was a hint about her character but I can't figure it out and it's annoying me.

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Malinche

    Including this little nod/Easter egg is part of my attempt to make the story feel like it's really truly cosmopolitan—it's America-centric because canon and because I'm American, but early reader feedback made me want to think really carefully and try stuff like a Frenchman's AMA and a long chapter in Finland and bilingual announcements in Brazil.  I like the idea of this being an Easter egg that lands for Latin American readers even if no one else gets it without being hinted at.

    > is it a hint this book is about to turn unnecessarily transphobic at the last second?

    Hopefully not!  There's always a chance I screw up on accident, but I'm not *aware* of being transphobic inside my own soul, so fingers crossed.

  >became an officer after he pre-empted the surprise attack on Melpomenia

  This has to be an Asimov reference. Melpomenia is one of the Spacer worlds in the Robot/Foundation series.

  I knew the Arn's giant, empty cave-mansion and vast tracts of parceled land reminded me of something: Solaria from *The Naked Sun* and *Foundation and Earth*. The Solarians are human but have strange norms and taboos: among other things, their population size is fixed, they never engage in face to face contact unless absolutely necessary, and they rely extensively on robot servants. By the time of *Foundation and Earth*, they use "transducer-lobes" to channel energy from the heat output of their vast tracts of land and have made themselves hermaphroditic, dispensing with the need for face to face contact even to sire heirs/replacements.

  Coincidentally, a major theme of *Foundation and Earth* is the need for mankind to unite against a potential extragalactic alien enemy (there is otherwise no intelligent alien life in the Robot/Foundation series^1 ). But it's strongly hinted at that the seed of mankind's downfall, an unknowable alien enemy, may already be in their midst: the Solarian child Fallom is descended from humans but is, in many ways, unknowable and alien. Maybe this is foreshadowing the Visser's own downfall by similar means, e.g., the division and untrustworthiness of his own thought processes.

  ^1 If *The Stars, Like Dust* is canonically considered part of this universe, I guess the Tyranni might qualify. I was ten years old when I read the book and don't remember if they're actual aliens or just humans with a weird name and culture.

    Quatazhinnikon modeled the whole Esplin-Alloran system as a single brain, and then re-expressed it in a different biology.  It's like the same "book," but now it's on a Kindle instead of being on paper pages.

    There's no Yeerk.

    Also, the body doesn't morph, even though we aren't sure whether maybe V3 has cracked morphing tech; he discovered that morphing means letting your brain be run on the gods' hypercomputer (and possibly fiddled with, as a result) and gave it up forever.

      I'd somehow missed/forgotten that bit about V3 giving up morphing. It makes sense with everything else though.

  so I reread the whole thing and didn't actually notice anything different? I think maybe some stuff was added to last visser section but that was the only thing I noticed.
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    The previous version was 12,000 words and didn't have a final Jake section at all.

    The new version is 24,000 words with an 8,500 word section that wasn't there at all before.  I'd say there are, grand total, about 2,500 words of rewrite and 4,000 words of addition/extension, in that first 12,000?  Like, remove 2.5k and replace them with 6k, plus the final section.

    ... kudos to me for making it feel smooth, I guess?

      Oh yeah, I mean of course the last Jake section was new. I thought something was going to be wildly different in the part that was there last week but whatever it was, I didn't catch it.

  I really enjoyed this rewrite! The Visser Three section especially felt much smoother, and I really liked the details about how he'd upgraded his body. Is the intended interpretation that the Visser-Alloran "merge" happened only after moving from two brains to one? Or that it happened before, and was only noticed now after the disruption. 

  Am I right in thinking that the Visser we have a viewpoint from is the only Visser in the Earth system, and the other 6 are only relevant to the wider conflict?

  And it seems implied that Elena was left on the spaceship, I was surprised to not see Marco say anything about that in the final section.

  The alternate universe section seemed super bizarre, and I noticed myself doing exactly what Elena did of mentally shrugging and ignoring it shortly after reading it, so great writing! It seems crazy to think that there are two different universes that look so similar, yet have fundamental underlying differences eg Kandrona working differently, which suggests something like the simulated universe hypothesis, though that wouldn't explain all of Edriss' memories believing that Kandrona worked differently (and why even include that detail in a simulated universe?! It seems still possible to send people out solo in a cradle in this one)

  How does being Visser One even work if Edriss goes back to the pool to feed? Is she a single Yeerk, or representing a coalescion? Seems bizarre to imagine imprisoning a single Yeerk from a coalescion, yet she seemed to still take part in the sharing with her home pool.

    > smoother

    Thanks, ~relief~

    > "merge"

    It's meant to be clear that it happened before, but that he didn't fully become aware of it until the shock of death and resurrection.  IMO, the Leeran signing off on the clone is strong evidence that he really is "the same as" what he was before dying, at least from a personality standpoint.

    We haven't ever seen any other Visser viewpoint, and yeah, probably we won't, either.  Maaaybe in an interlude?  But if so it will be unambiguously clear which is which.

    > Elena was left on the spaceship

    They anticipated this, although I can't remember if I dropped a sentence about it in previous chapters.  The Ellimist promised to bring them back, not Elena (they guessed that Edriss would probably come along with them, though note they haven't actually seen proof that this occurred).  Elena knows how to pilot a Bug fighter, though, for sure.

    > How does being Visser One even work if Edriss goes back to the pool to feed? Is she a single Yeerk, or representing a coalescion? Seems bizarre to imagine imprisoning a single Yeerk from a coalescion, yet she seemed to still take part in the sharing with her home pool.

    She goes back into her pool every three days, but that pool reconstitutes her essentially unchanged each time; the Edriss shard is clearly "fit" for its position and so doesn't need to be overwritten.

    Her trial before the Council would have included indictment of both the shard and the whole pool; we don't know much as readers about the current geopolitical situation and it's possible the Council can't effectively *reach* the coalescion, to mete out punishment.  Coalescions have been torn apart and distributed among other pools, in the past.  It's possible they would have starved or otherwise punished the Edriss shard sort of symbolically before later bringing the Sulp Niar pool to account.

      I'd be very much interested in hearing more about Yeerk... culture? Politics? Belief systems? How individual shards are given name and rank, despite the fact that they also form a mere part of an individual coalescion.

      How common is it that "individual" shards are continuously re-formed as-is with shared knowledge like Visser One (presumably other Vissers, perhaps a lot more?) rather than becoming new individuals like Perdão (I know his situation was different, given Terra, etc).

        We saw a little of this in the Aftran interlude, where Aftran was remade basically the same over and over again until the disaster, and then was significantly rewritten without some of its memories/desires.
        ```

- u/death_au:
  ```
  Thanks for the rewrite. Beforehand I was a bit confused about the Visser's motivations (that's his adopted name now, right? No longer Visser 3 - or any number. No longer Esplin. Just "the Visser"?) and maybe it was because we'd discussed it already, but I feel like it's much clearer in this rewrite. Also, I don't remember all those biological "hardware upgrades" in his new form, were they missing in the original, or did I just miss them?

  There were some discussions in the other thread about the nature of consciousness, and the idea that being "at war with oneself" is a perfectly natural state of being. Rereading this with that in mind I really started developing my own head-canon that this is correct but Yeerks themselves never really experience that on their own, Esplin included. But an unintended side effect of having a physical brain of his own that isn't explicitly yeerk-based is that he now experiences that for himself.

  As I was thinking that, I thought that it lessened the potential impact I originally thought Alloran had on the first read.

  But then I got to the bit where he's questioning if he really needs the Earth, and specifically, this passage:

  > He was on edge, and he did not know why.  
  >  
  >*Without the Earth, completing the conquest of the rest of the galaxy will take five times as long, and be twice as likely—or more—to fail.*  
  >  
  >He was suspicious of the thought—for being too reassuring, too convenient, for making him *feel better* when he still did not understand the cause of his disquiet.  But even in his suspicion, he *could not stop himself from believing it*.  It simply seemed *true.*

  I feel like this was Alloran's influence right here. Like he somehow has worked out that the Visser's greatest chance for failure would be right there at Earth, and if he could just subconsciously convince the Visser to stay there, it increased the chances of his plans coming undone entirely. The Visser retroactively noticed that Alloran's been quiet since "the bridge" - i.e. since they came to the conclusion that "the Gods" were a thing that impacted the plan. Perhaps Alloran was trusting that "the Gods" would think the Earth is important (which is a sound logical conclusion, given everything he has witnessed)?

  Either way, despite my coming to the conclusion that self-conflict may be a biological inevitability, my faith in Alloran was restored regardless. And I now see the shape of the Visser's goal a lot more clearly than I did.

  or people not wanting me to be able to steal their brilliant ideas anymore

  but anyway I welcome guesses as to what's going to happen next/what's going on with the rest of the world now that the Visser has killed the internet and done his level best to kill the 500,000,000 most-likely-to-cause-humanity-to-ascend people.

  > Seven billion hosts.

  I didn't notice before, but this number is surprisingly low. Wikipedia says we reached 7.7 billion in April 2019, so if we're in 2023 or later, I'd expect 8 billion to be a more natural estimate. Did something happen before the story began, to reduce the population? (Or am I forgetting something in-story? Ventura county isn't populous enough to make a difference here.)

  > Helmacrons

  Oh, I see how this is going to end. They'll be so irritating that the Visser teams up with the Animorphs to get rid of them. Not because he has to, just to make a point of how annoying they are. To achieve this alliance, he'll commit to peaceful coexistence.

  For the Animorphs, it will almost be worth it. But, well, they'll still have been exposed to the Helmacrons.
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:

    I maybe should up the number.  The cheap waffling excuse is that seven billion is what you'd actually expect to walk away with, given losses during takeover, but.

  That sounds like a trap, Visser!

  I'm surprised it sounds like Visser isn't trying to contact his other copies, especially in light of his discovery of the weird incomplete mind merge with Alloran.
