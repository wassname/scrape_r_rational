  It doesn't read as very rational.

  It works with three magical things to make each thing work.

  A magical language that it is impossible to insult people in.

  Magical predictions that mean all laws work perfectly (ignoring any uncertainty).

  Completely obedient citizens who allow the government to do as they wish, up to mass sterilization with untested future technologies, mass forced drug use, and imposition of a government that doesn't favor them. 

  This sort of stuff is an error I often see from those who want to optimize the world. They try to attack what they see as the root issues (ignoring the actual, weighty issues that plague society) with some sort of magic or scifi-technology.

  They don't tend to consider that any society with their magic would be better, and they rarely consider how actual real life issues would impact their society.

  >As a corollary of this principle, the intelligence of a character in rational fiction must never be an Informed Ability. We must see them being smart, not be told that they are smart. They must think of brilliant things to do which we ourselves could have realized are possible. As in a Fair Play Whodunnit, the character must make deductions that we ourselves could realistically have made. Only by solving puzzles which are, from the readers' perspective, at least slightly fair, can the character's good sense be convincingly exhibited. (Note that the ability to exhibit smart options and strategies means that this is not the same principle as a Fair Play Whodunnit; and fair-play insights may happen throughout the novel, not just in ways relevant to a mystery plot.)

  That is what their powers are. Informed abilities that magically solve all of societies problems, without actually ever showing any smart options and strategies.

    >The thorniest problem was moral speech: what should “good” mean in a perfect language? Here the logician-monks spent millennia refining a utilitarian superstructure until it described exactly how to aggregate preferences to create a utility function for the entire society. The resulting book, the Risurion-Silk, was declared to be literally an incarnation of God, who was, after all, only another word for the concept of maximal goodness. “Good” was declared to mean “increasing the function described in the Risurion-Silk” or alternately “increasing the degree to which the Universe instantiates God”.

    Yeah, really.  Dear fucking God.  You do NOT get to just wave your hands and Solve Ethics Forever.  Who was this written by, Luke Muehlhauser?

    Ok, ok, I kid, *but seriously guys, no, this does not maketh the sense.*  Downvoted despite my great liking for Slate Star Codex.

    When I first read Raikoth a while back, I noticed a lot of the unexplained future tech solving problems also. I think a few of the problem solutions are interesting to read about in direct proportion to how likely they are to ever occur - e.g. the personal monitoring devices to deter crime seems like an interesting idea, if you can resolved the ways it is hopelessly open to abuse and possible to cause of a great deal of problems and drawbacks in addition to it's benefits, see e.g. Black Mirror Season 1 Episode 3, *The Entire History Of You*.

    In addition, beyond the technology I thought my personal incredulity was tripped by the fact that this was a utopia that managed to fail pretty hard for no apparent reason. Seriously - it looks to be about the physical land area/size of Great Britain, with a total population less than New York City, and isn't noted as expanding or having a lot of people enter it or otherwise being particularly sucessful at growing and subsuming it's neighbours in spite of spending a huge amount of time discussing how awesome it is and how it makes perfect decisions and everyone enjoys living in it; presumably this is because of the constraints of the constructed world he was creating it within, I guess, but it still feels wrong when judged as single-author fiction - you'd think a society that is amazingly prosperous and happy and sucessful and intelligently governed would be notably powerful on the world stage? Unless it's surrounded by a bunch of other states which are all even more plausible and believable utopias, in which case one wonders why Raikoth is not more influenced by these superior outside ideas and is instead clinging to less-effective utopian ideals with all of it's stuff about effectively making utilitarian decisions? 

    Also, it has a long list of tech advances over our modern era but no note that the tech is still advancing or changing, but instead that everything is perfectly adapted to the tech as it is with long legal and societal adaptations to e.g. perfect personal monitors. Basically, I have a hard time really believing in any utopia in which technological and societal progress is ended - I believe that any utopia we build with the tools of today will be obsolete in fifty years time, as human understanding of everything from computing technology to our own minds to effective political structures advances.
