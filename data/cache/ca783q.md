  Having Goku take control of his inner giant monkey was satisfying, but not as satisfying as the heartfelt conversation he had with his undead grandpa.

  Wow that's a weird sentence.  In any case, I'm excited to see how this story progresses.

  This one took me a while because next chapter was pretty long (and as usual, I want to finish at least one more chapter before posting the previous one). I'm really trying to think carefully about what comes next because the story is getting intricate and it's not easy to keep track of everything, do the proper amount of foreshadowing, and keep it all together while still having a semblance of thematic consistency. Writing this story really has made me come to grips with how hard that can be!

  As an aside, today I've also put up a lesser story, a Harry Potter one-shot that's all but rational, as it's mostly just near-crackfic levels of fun nonsense, but if you're interested in reading it, here it is:

    And once again, thanks for delivering me from MoL delay malaise.

  Fun chapter all around. I think Goku still significantly undervalues beam attacks, but it makes sense because he hasn’t discovered their niche yet, not really. It’s kind of fun to see him spit in the face of conventional DB wisdom of “weak burst blasts have never accomplished anything / has that ever worked.” I liked how Goku has taken on the habit of metaphor correction; it can be done poorly, but I do like it a lot when done well.

  Also, note: do you prefer reveiws here or on FanFiction.Net? I used to do it there regularly but I’ve been switching to here, not sure if you care since it’s not a big deal to do one or the other on my end.

  So, artificial moons are canon for Z, and Bulma figured out Blutz waves in GT, so what are the odds that Bulma can figure out how to do it again here?

  At the very least, if Vegeta tries his 'Fake Moon' trick here, Goku'll have it a bit easier.

    Well, that'd quickly turn into a Kaiju movie...

      Speaking of, Grandpa Gohan implied he didn’t meet any saiyans in Heaven. The most obvious non-earth candidates, Tarble and Broly, are still alive, but are people like Gine and Yamoshi (https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Yamoshi) not in heaven or did he just miss them? 

      Also, I liked the JttW reference with monkeys hatching from stone eggs.

        ```
        I imagine they are just so rare that it is hard to find one, and possibly there are some heaven politics that result in them forming their own corner because even the ones in heaven don’t like them.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          Yeah, I can’t imagine any saiyans in heaven wanting to advertise their status.
          ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        Well, Heaven is big and there’s trillions of sentients. Though I also have my own ideas about the origin of SSG, so don’t rely too much on canon for that, I might deviate a lot there.

        With JttW... really, I think the reference was Toriyama’s own, but basically I realised only while writing this chapter.

  Beautiful chapter.

  I remember thinking how should a more numbers focused dbz videogame be, and realising that big beam blasts would have it hard to be worth the charge time, vulnerability and lack of redirectioning. I'm glad to see it is acnowledge here, but I still don't see how you will justify beam struggles besides showing off. Maybe if you stun your oppoment for a second you can actually hit, but I don't see how anybody with super sonic speed, after seen their enemy begin to charge, wouldn't rush to give a kick in the head
