  So it was, in fact, a work of love. Foreshadowing successfully spotted.

  So, about the time loop. One of the running theories is that time loop has divine origins. This makes sense, since it is clearly stated that time loop is impossible via magic, but gods are, well, gods.

  What did not make sense to me was that for a divine intervention some aspects of the time loop made perfect sense but some parts seemed poorly executed.

  Namely Zach as the starting point of the time loop seems... stupid? He is not the right person to be handled this power. He is not the right person to avert primordial summoning, not because he is a bad person, but because he is woefully under-qualified.

  But then the gods have been silent for some time and they are clearly not omnipotent.

  Suppose gods had foreseen their exile from the world and therefore had created some contingency measure for primordial prisons, in case someone breaks them. It is now clear that invaders had succeeded in the restart Zero. They had summoned the beast even with premature invasion, with Eldemar forces on alert. No matter how 'uninspired' (Zorian's words) their assault was in the initial timeline, it was still bound to succeed. Hence the divine contingency measure was set off. 

  So the gods had to create a mechanism that would save the day, in advance. Like centuries at least. Suppose they decide to appoint a Champion and loop him. If the gods were exiled for some reason and had no way to directly appoint a Champion, they had to write a spell that would do that for them. So they create a bloodline that is destined for this task. The Noveda bloodline. Now, suppose the Weeping was not part of the plan. As far as we can tell a magical plague is not something extraordinary, for all we know the Weeping could be naturally mutated troll flu. Irritating for trolls, deadly for weaker bipedal apes. In the end, Zach was picked by the loop simply because there was no choice, he was the only one candidate alive. The Noveda bloodline also boosted his mana reserves because he became a focal point; normally it could be distributed evenly between all living Novedas. With, say, 5 people alive they get +10 starting mana, advantageous but not revolutionary. Extended mana supplies naturally leads to their specialization in combat magic. But with Zach being the only one alive he gets +50, which is inhuman.

  How does RR fall into this? I have no idea. RR is the product of counter-contingency plan made by Dragon herself! Yep, that's my story and I'm sticking to it.
  ```

  - u/Noumero:
    ```
    This theory has a certain flaw, however.

    The time loop rewinds time at a precise time: 2 hours and 40 minutes after midnight (reference: [end of chapter 40](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/40/Mother-of-Learning)). It is fairly improbable that invaders just happen to always summon He Of The Flowing Flesh 9600 seconds after midnight, so at the end of the month the time rewinds independently of the primordial's summoning. Which isn't terribly meaningful mechanic, if you are correct.

    Albeit... It is possible the Noveda heir was supposed to terminate the loop manually, once he/she had made sure the primordial issue was dealt with permanently, without the danger of repeated summon a day later.

    Yes, this theory looks solid.

    Hm, I have a feeling the Weeping was not just your ordinary epidemic, though. Doesn't seem fitting. But I have nothing conclusive.

      >Hm, I have a feeling the Weeping was not just your ordinary epidemic, though. Doesn't seem fitting. But I have nothing conclusive.

      Wasn't there something said about Noveda family being hit harder than the rest? A semi-targetted superweapon, perhaps?
      ```

      - u/literal-hitler:
        ```
        I thought it was just because of the number of them in service to the government. Kind of like how war hits military families harder.
        ```

        - u/thegiantpossum:
          ```
          But there were other noble houses that contributed just as much. But the Noveda family died off down to a single man, which seems to be quite unusual.
          ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Or cover for blood magic? We hear it mentioned that a blood magician would be easy to spot because of the number of deaths, a large scale plague that killed a lot of magic users would be a perfect cover then. 

        We haven't heard anything about the symptoms of the weeping, so we don't know how easy it would be to confuse it for another form of death. But lets assume its possible, either the weeping was directly tied to blood magic as some sort of deliberate weapon, or it was unrelated and red robe took advantage of the cover. Then he steals a bunch of magical power from one of the most famous bloodlines, gaining it for himself, and in the process tying himself into the looping.
        ```

    - u/SpeculativeFiction:
      ```
      Isn't the whole point of conducting the ritual during the festival due to a precise planar alignment, which grants magic extra power? That would likely be a specific time, and thus the summoning would occur at a fairly regular pace.
      ```

      - u/Menolith:
        ```
        They'd also have to succeed every single time. Then again, they _did_ succeed even with a rushed and sabotaged invasion.

        Although you'd think that someone as perceptive as Zorian would've noticed reality breaking just before the restart since he's been in the thick of things most of the time.
        ```

        - u/Sceptically:
          ```
          Didn't he only just start training his magic senses, though?
          ```

          - u/SometimesATroll:
            ```
            The cracking and shattering of reality was presumably visible to the eye.  He made no mention of using his mana sense to detect it.
            ```

            - u/Sceptically:
              ```
              Checked the chapter, and you're right. On the other hand, was he in a position to see reality cracking around the Hole in the previous restarts? It's unlikely that he wouldn't have been in at least *one* previous restart, but not impossible.
              ```

              - u/SometimesATroll:
                ```
                Yeah, I think the contingency is "Reset at x time, or if the primordial is summoned, whichever comes first."

                Either that, or Zach died/activated his soul thingy around the time it was summoned.

                Or it has the ability to kill whatever it looks at, like that eye monster earlier.

                Or something else.
                ```

                - u/AHaskins:
                  ```
                  Eh, I think you're over complicating matters. I'm going with Occam in this one: the time loop resets when the primordial is summoned. The end. 

                  Every other time that has happened, they carry out the ritual at the moment of alignment, and the reset occurs. He hasn't been able to see the ritual up until now because it happened in the Hole and he didn't have a direct LoS without a concerted military strike on their center.

                  The critical new information is:

                  A) the reset is tied to the primordial summoning

                  B) they don't need to wait until alignment after all - the ritual works just fine without it
                  ```

    - u/Xtraordinaire:
      ```
      I don't think the source can be interpreted to mean that reset happens *precisely* at 02:40:00. If we interpret "a few seconds" as 5, it gives us 02:39:06 - 02:40:05 window for the exact moment of reset.

      And yes, Novedas could have had some knowledge about their bloodline, but since everyone died before they could pass that knowledge to Zach, that meant he was thrown in the loop completely clueless.

      As for the Weeping, it was said to kill off somewhat around 10% of the population I believe? If so, this isn't even close to real world epidemics, like Black Death, that is estimated to have killed 1 in 3 *at least*. It may, of course, be unnatural, i.e. biological warfare designed by someone (maybe even Ibasans?) but I think it's irrelevant for the time loop. The only thing that mattered is that a confluence of circumstances reduced Novedas to Zach. I mean the other factor is proliferation of firearms and that is entirely rational idea.

      The biggest flaw in this theory is that it does not explain Red Robe. But then the only reasonable RR theory I saw (Daimen discovering ancient magic in ancient magical ruins) conversely does not explain Zach.
      ```

      - u/Ozimandius:
        ```
        Well, Red Robe would easily be explained by the method introduced in this chapter - by using blood magic to subsume the powers of other bloodlines.
        ```

        - u/literal-hitler:
          ```
          I think Zorian's earlier guess is just as valid. Zach told someone he was in a time loop during one of his first restarts, then got kidnapped and studied by a soul mage who was able to replicate it somehow.
          ```

          - u/Xtraordinaire:
            ```
            If Red Robe has full understanding how Zach's soul marker can be transferred, he should've had tracked Zorian via that searching ritual. The fact that Zorian is alive suggests that Red Robe used some crude method that brought him into the loop.

            Blood magic is better theory, because it is, at least judging by this chapter, a crude messy way that yields results.
            ```

            - u/literal-hitler:
              ```
              But RR has no idea how Zorian is looping, and may not think it's possible to copy that way since it was an accident. RR may be trying to track Zorian thinking he's using the same method as RR.
              ```

    - u/bassicallyboss:
      ```
      Maybe the timing is precise because it's set to the time the primordial escaped in the initial timeline.  If that's the case, we should probably expect to see the loop's time-of-reset advance to the time the primordial escaped in this latest iteration.

      Well, the prison design is clearly not perfect. But then, this particular primordial specialized in shifting, which lead to using his essence in shifters (not a very wise move, humans) which granted cultist a way to break the prison. Maybe other primordial essences are not useful, and were not recklessly used by humans for selfish purposes. That would mean that this primordial is the only one that can be actually set free, and it wasn't directly gods' fault. So... some redemption for their plan, I guess.

        If using the primordial's blood is the only way to free it, how did they get the blood in the first place?

        - u/Saffrin-chan:
          ```
          The shifter groups could have had it's blood before it was sealed originally. But I don't remember if there's any contradicting timelines for when the primordials were sealed compared to when the shifter tribes first came about, so I don't know if this works.
          ```

        - u/Xtraordinaire:
          ```
          By them you mean shifters? Well, primordials were once terrorizing the world so there was a way to get their bits before they were sealed off. Shifters are ancient magic, so it kind of checks out.

          And subsequent shifter lineages, like pigeons, could have been started via similar sacrificial ritual.

        - u/LucidityWaver:
          ```
          It's likely to be dangerous soul tampering during the loop.
          The use of shifter children indicates difficulty increases with the complexity of one's soul / being (age, soul marker, anything else).
          ```

    - u/SpeculativeFiction:
      ```
      Primordials may be the source of all magic, given the various wells seem to be the various prisons of them, and gush out magic relentlessly. Having the prisons linked to the planet may be necessary for magic to exist, and possibly life (life-force is apparently magic?)

      But it would make more sense to put it at the bottom of the ocean, or inside a volcano.

          Re-reading the story, I realize I've probably gotten it wrong. Primordial's don't cause the wells of power, but they might be attached to them. Otherwise, why place one next to a giant, magical beacon, which is pretty much guaranteed to attract people to settle next to it? Why not just bury them deep underground, with no tunnel?

          My guess is that the primordial we know about is either generating the well of power (and the story about the dragon below generating magic is wrong), or if the story is true, it was placed there because its prison requires magic to power.

          Either way, my guess is that all wells of power have primordials sealed in them. The author has explained warding schemes in detail, explicitly noting that more powerful ones either require huge batteries (which eventually drain), or large amounts of ambient power (thus being next to the wells.)

          If neither of these things are true, I don't see why the gods wouldn't have sealed the primordials deep underground, or on the moon.

          P.S. This is what i'm basing my theory on, BTW

          >According to Ikosians, the world was originally a swirling, shapeless chaos, inhabited only by the 7 primordial dragons. One day, the gods descended from the higher planes of existence and killed all of them save one. This last one they refashioned into the material world that humans now inhabit, turning her body into dirt and stone, her blood into water, her breath into air and her fire into magic. The vast networks of tunnels stretching beneath the surface of the world are dragon veins, now empty of blood that had been turned into the seas but still flooded with magic emanating from the Heart of the World – the fiery, still-beating heart of the primordial dragon that rests somewhere deep underground. Far from being content with her fate, the Dragon Below still rages against her bounds, giving birth to natural disasters like volcanoes and earthquakes. Unable to strike back against the gods themselves, the dragon takes her anger out on their favored creations – humans – by utilizing her heart, the one thing the gods have not seen fit to take away from her. Pieces of it continually flake off from the main mass, giving birth to horrifying monsters whenever they hit the ground, at which point said monsters begin their ascent to the surface to terrorize mankind…

            >why the gods wouldn't have sealed the primordials deep underground

            I thought they did. Deep underground inside a dungeon filled with various really deadly critters, getting deadlier as you go deeper.
            ```

  - u/-Fender-:
    ```
    There is one big problem to your theory. Bloodlines tend to spread far and wide. For example, I personally have the blood of Charlemagne, but that doesn't make me part of any aristocratic family.

    There would be branch families to the Noveda. I'd find it hard to believe that everyone would have stayed related to the family, and never ventured off. Never had illegitimate children, never married to a male member of another one of the great houses and thus taking their name, etc. 

    If it was so easy as having Noveda blood, then there should be a lot more time travelers around.

    Edit: Unless, of course, the Weeping was truly a very focused disease made specifically to target the Noveda bloodline, and that that 10% of the population who died represented all of these branch families.
    ```

  - u/Dwood15:
    ```
    If that's the case about the loopers being all from Noveda blood, then would that not mean that Zach and Red Robe are related?

    I can see how they wouldn't be, but if Zach is the initial key to the party, then how Red Robe got into the loop would be a major question. Perhaps Red Robe is, in fact, working against the Ibasans, but also for his own reasons/goals. What if Red Robe realized that Quatl-Ichl was always going to be the major threat, and was learning how he could fight the Lich, since damaging a soul is the only real way to permanently deal with a Lich?
    ```

    - u/WriterBen01:
      ```
      I was thinking the same thing too; that red robe and Zach might be related. Obviously the loop is able to take more than one person back each time, so could it be that it was designed that way? What if the whole Noveda family is supposed to loop back together. The only reason Zach is the prime user, is because he's currently the Noveda elder. Or closest to the Noveda mansion when the first loop started.

      In that case Red Robe could be some long lost family relation of Zach. Possibly even have ties with the Ibasan forces through adoption.

      Also, bonus observation, it would suck if you would have to spend years looping, while your spouse was unable to. The soul marker would have to be designed in a way that it could be shared with others through marriage. Maybe through a special ritual to induce a soul bond.

      Now, tin-foil hat. Red robe is just someone that Zach married in one of his crazy loops. Possibly while under-cover with Ibasans.
      ```

      - u/ArdentDawn:
        ```
        As another user mentioned, this chapter also introduced the concept of stealing the properties of bloodlines using blood magic, which could extend to the Noveda Bloodline.

    Maybe, but Kael said the corpses looked as if they never had souls at all, which doesn't really fit.
    ```

  - u/Xtraordinaire:
    ```
    But we've seen so far that victims of soul mutilation are reverted just fine. I mean, Nochka has been sacrificed and her soul mined for primordial essence countless times, and she seemed fine. 

    Since it was said that souls contain various information, the loop definitely tampers with souls of non-loopers in some fashion or with the souls of loopers (by adding extra information gained from the previous restart). It is not clear why the loop would fail to restore damage to life-force controlling block of non-looper soul.

  ```
  It struck me the other day that Red Robe probably calls Zorian "Gun Guy" or something similar.

  If the primordial being summoned is what always resets the loop, then Zorian (and maybe Zach also) could work to delay the summoning.
  ```

  - u/BSSolo:
    ```
    Yep.  And Zorian has learned that they can do so by preventing the sacrifice of shifter children.
    ```

  - u/RockLeethal:
    ```
    Maybe "Mind Man"?
    ```

    - u/FiveColorGoodStuff:
      ```
      Perhaps, but I think that the gun-related nicknames are more likely. You can find mind mages everywhere, but how many mages use firearms?
      ```

      - u/RockLeethal:
        ```
        To be fair, recently his whole gun gimmick has been kinda forgotten the past dozen chapters or so. I actually forgot he used guns before you brought it up.
        ```

        - u/FiveColorGoodStuff:
          ```
          You are correct, but, unless Red Robe has been watching Zorian since their encounter, he wouldn't know that.
          ```

          - u/RockLeethal:
            ```
            That's something I completely overlooked, woops. Considering that, he *would* probably think of Zorian as the guy with a gun.
            ```

- u/Kodix:
  ```
  Awesome. Things are moving quickly, now. 

  The conversation with Zach in the next chapter will be *quite* interesting.
  ```

  - u/NotteBoy:
    ```
    I know what Zorian's side of the conversation will be, at least partially. He will tell Zack about suicide rings and how to use his marker (and discovering what the complete marker is like). Maybe Zorian will throw Zack at Xvim to learn mind-magic defense. This is not including about Zorian's information about the entire invasion. Really the only complete surprise is what Zorian will learn from Zack.

  - u/HPMOR_fan:
    ```
    Yes, the first priority is how to keep Zach from inadvertently revealing Zorian's identity to Red Robe. I think Zach would make a good ally but he's got to smarten up first.
    ```

- u/Menolith:
  ```
  Zach is back, baby. I'm anxious to see just how much the dynamic between the two has changed now that Zorian has his own bloodline to abuse and a fair amount of loop-exploited experience too. Zorian has done a good job of bridging the gap even without humongous mana reserves.

  Also, a handful of typos:

  >"Fire the living **mental** rounds."

  metal

  >**long dead** bones

  ”long-dead” or ”long, dead”

  >need **theblood** of an existing shifter

  >Zorian **pain** close attention

  - u/literal-hitler:
    ```
    > long dead bones

    > ”long-dead” or ”long, dead”

    I believe a comma is only used if there are three or more adjectives.
    ```

    - u/Menolith:
      ```
      English comma rules are an arcane labyrinth, it's best not to look too closely.

      You're thinking of lists which do make use of commas with three or more items. Coordinating adjectives, however, are separated by commas. In this case, the lack of comma would create ambiguity since the bones could have been dead for a long time or just long in general.
      ```

    - u/-Fender-:
      ```
      Na, a comma is fine. For example, in this sentence:

      >"Bite my shiny, metal ass!"

      This implies that the ass is both metallic *and* shiny, rather than made of shiny metal. It is a very important distinction.
      ```

      - u/CeruleanTresses:

        But it *is* made of shiny metal.
        ```

    - u/gtsteel:

      Adjectives get a comma between them if they commute and no comma if one changes the meaning of the other.

    It's because of the [last thing that Zach said to Zorian before this chapter](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/26/Mother-of-Learning).

    >"Zorian, you ass! I swear I'm going to punch you in the face the next time I see you!"

        2+6 = 8. 8 is the chapter where Zach showed Zorian the Hole. Primordials are summoned there. What else do we need for a summoning? 5 ~~chri~~ shifter kids! Zorian met a two shifters in chapter one. (5 + 1)\*2 = 10. The story was published on Oct 17, 2011, October is 10th month of the year. 17 \* number of months of the year divided by 2 equals 102 and the author is nobody**103**.

      Man, I was sure Zach had somehow found out that Zorian was looping too, but now I'm wondering if he's just following on that word.

      - u/-Fender-:
        ```
        Nah, he knows. Check out the few lines before that.

        >"Oh," Zach said. "Still, that's... I never managed to do anything even close to that. How... how is it that you knew how to do that? You... are you..."

        >"I need to go," said Zorian, rising to his feet.

        >"Hey, wait!" Zach said, trying to rise up before wincing in pain and giving up on that idea. "You can't just ignore me and go- Zorian! Zorian!"

        And this is after he already suspected that something had changed about Zorian, and after he'd known there had to be another time traveler, since all of the events were happening differently. Of course, before that conversation, he thought that the aranea were the time travelers, but he probably changed his mind here. 

        Either he's correctly guessed that Zorian is the time traveler, either he still believes that it was the aranea, but that Zorian is involved with them somehow. But after all of these restarts in which he's never once been contacted by the aranea, who were the ones who initially contacted him, he has to suspect that it's probably not the second option. And he probably also spent a restart or two in Cyoria, after the aranea were soul killed. He probably saw that Zorian was not there in that restart where he was facing RR alone and blew himself up in the Hole. That was probably enough to convince him.

    This is not the subreddit I usually post these things on, but for ideas as to what you can read now that is in some way similar to MoL, my suggestions would be, more or less sorted by how much I enjoyed them:

    * [HPMOR](http://www.hpmor.com) by Eliezer Yudkovsky. 

    * [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/category/stories-arcs-1-10/arc-1-gestation/1-01/) by WildBow 

    * The Martian by Andy Weir. If you are into audiobooks, this probably moves to the top of the list, the audiobook is bloody perfect.

    * Surely You Are Joking mr Feynman by Richard P. Feynman. No link, but it is easilly searchable through google. chem.fsu.edu hosts a copy for some reason, for example.

    * [How to Succeed in Evil](http://podiobooks.com/title/how-to-succeed-in-evil-the-novel/) by Patrick E. McLean 

    * Packing for Mars by Mary Roach. 

    * [Ra]( http://qntm.org/ra ) by qntm

      All good choices, but sadly there is no time loop in there.

      The best Time Loop story, MoL aside, is Time Braid. The author did an incredible job with it. It's kinda sad he went a little bit too deep into sex with his published works afterwards. Had he kept the careful balance he used for Time Braid he would have had much more success.

        >sadly there is no time loop in there.

        I wouldn't say that time loop is what defines MoL, honestly. Zorian's character can work even without timeloop, and HJPEV from HPMOR or Taylor from Worm seem quite similar to him in those regards.

            Hmm it didn't sound like that to me otherwise you'd have people all over the world finding their old blood magic victims dead at the start of the restart

                Probably the model. It made quite a stir when all of these mercenaries were suddenly found dead at the beginning of the loop, after all. It's impossible that all of these victims would somehow always remain silent and unknown.

                If the ritual sacrifice of the shifter kids is blood magic, and that crossed time-loops, then Kirrelle's shifter friend would not be around each loop.

        But Zorian was murdering things for experience just this chapter!

        And ruining someone's soul is no worse than murder, since it stays in the loop: once the restart is over, the soul will be restored. This is one of the greatest advantages of time loop: the ability to commit an unlimited amount of inhumanly amoral actions at effectively no cost.

        And Zorian declines to use it? Ugh. I hope he had grown more reasonable since chapter 16.
        ```

        - u/-Fender-:
          ```
          There's still the small matter than major changes to Zorian's soul might affect his soul marker. This may be another reason for his hesitance. Otherwise, I would have hoped that he'd become an eagle shifter by now.

            - u/empocariam:
              ```
              Zorian is really trying to hold onto his moral system, but I think it is clearly becoming more and more untenable. Just look at how arbitrary his "sparing" of non-aggro aranea is. He just chooses a random justification on who he can attack (fighting back) because he needs to impose some kind of morality to the need of learning mind magic skills.
              ```

            - u/None:
              ```
              It would be bad to get into the habit.

              Unless he plans to stay in the loop forever, anyway.
              ```

    My guess is Red Robe set something up to lure Zach away so he could look for differences each restart to identify the other loopers.

  Naturally, activating that switch on his soul marker manually releases the primordial, which resets the loop.

- u/Frommerman:

  Blood magic can eat people's power?

  Well, that could explain Zach's mana reserves. He sacrificed a bunch of people (or one person a bunch of times, perhaps his own caretaker), knowing that they would be fine once the loop restarted.
  ```

  - u/elevul:
    ```
    That's possible, but it doesn't seem like something Zach would do. Red Robe would, though, which is probably why he's so ridiculously overpowered.
    ```

- u/JulianWyvern:
  ```
  I wonder if without the primordial blood one can come up with a method to make themselves a shifter that does not pass on their traits. It'd mean you could make yourself one of those dangerous shifter types without fear of the monster's mind damaging your children's. As a matter of fact you could prepare them as they grew up before giving them the method.
  ```

- u/InsaneBranch:
  ```
  Great. Now we can have Zach-Zorian reunion, then Zorian wastes too much time on interpersonal development, the memory package breaks and he goes insane.

  More likely scenario though: Z-Z reunion, memory pack opened and RR appears once again. End of 2nd arc in 1-2 chapters probably.
  ```

- u/Lugnut1206:
  ```
  Am I the only one worried the time loop just reset for the last time?

  Maybe I'm wrong, has Zorian ever noticed the marker activating itself prematurely before?
  ```

  - u/Saffrin-chan:
    ```
    It's activated prematurely before when Zack died early, but Zorian wasn't good enough at soul magic at the time to notice it activating (I think this was even before he was aware of the soul mark)
    ```

    - u/-Fender-:
      ```
      Yup. You're right. The last early restart I can remember that was caused by Zach's early death was back when he was fighting a dragon, iirc. There may have been a single one since, in Knyazov Dveri, before Raynie taught him about how to access a specific part of his soul.
      ```

  - u/SpeculativeFiction:
    ```
    The first arc had 26 chapters, and there will be three arcs (of at least approximately similar size.) Even if the second arc is finished now, I find it unlikely he'll fit the entire third arc into a single loop.

      I've been thinking that the loop is in fact a pocket/splinter dimension. It probably forcibly terminates if it's connected to another pocket dimension, in this case, the Primordial's prison.  To me the question is if the loop alwys ends at the peak of Alignment or if the Primordial summoning is always successful.
      ```

      - u/-Fender-:
        ```
        It could also be something like Bravely Default, where a nigh infinity or parallel worlds are vaguely connected to each other but ultimately unreachable, unless specific conditions are met. This could also imply that what happens is not that everything rolls back, but simply that Zorian's soul, and that of the other time travelers, are transferred to the next parallel world, while the one they just left crashes and burns. It would also mean that once there are no more parallel worlds but the last one, they will be back in the normal flow of time, and the time loop will be over.
        ```
