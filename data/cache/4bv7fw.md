## Rationality-themed Super Mario Bros. level

**EDIT:** An illustrated walkthrough is now [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4bv7fw/rationalitythemed_super_mario_bros_level/d1dukis) for those who can't play it directly.

(This is not exactly fiction, but it is a rationality-based fan work; hope it's okay to put this here)

So there's a game for the Wii U, Super Mario Maker, that lets you make and upload your own Super Mario Bros. levels. I was looking for a theme for a new level a few days ago, and I thought of HPMoR, and then I decided to somehow illustrate something from the Sequences. The result is this:

[Rational Mario: Taboo Tradeoffs](https://supermariomakerbookmark.nintendo.net/courses/58CA-0000-0202-F8EC) (Level code 58CA-0000-0202-F8EC )

The level is very easy to complete, but it has two setpieces that illustrate the concept and punish you for the wrong choice. (Disclaimer: the second setpiece is a quite a bit looser, more metaphorical fit than the first)

I think there's a moderately high chance that no one who sees post ~~wastes their time with Nintendo games~~ will have access to a copy of Super Mario Maker. Nevertheless, I'm ~~not going to explain anything further or show images that will spoil the payoff (yet)~~ **[explanation now posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4bv7fw/rationalitythemed_super_mario_bros_level/d1dukis)**, except for one request: If you choose correctly on the second setpiece, play the level again with the wrong choice.

  I don't even have the game. Got a better shot of the level or explanation?

  Okay, so here's a spolierified walkthrough of the level.

  [spoiler](#s "You start with a choice of two doors, and a preview of what lies on the other side of them:")

  [spoiler](#s "On the top you have an extra life, and on the bottom you have an expanding formation of coins. Which do you choose? The answer:")

  [spoiler](#s "Lives are better than coins, but of course in Mario, you get an extra life for every 100 coins. Choosing the bottom door puts you in a room completely filled with coins and floored with coin-producing pipes; there are over 300 coins to be had, yielding three extra lives (which is the most you can gain in one level in Mario Maker). Choosing the top door puts you in a room with the 1-Up Mushroom, but also five enemies, including a Chain Chomp that you would normally want a much higher ceiling to try to jump over.")

  [spoiler](#s "The two rooms converge to a single path thereafter, where you'll find an impossible-to-miss power-up and Yoshi egg. Walking a bit further puts you at your second choice:")

  [spoiler](#s "At the juncture where you choose, you stand on a floor made of bricks. At the bottom are One-Way Doors that prevent you from changing your mind after you pass them. At the top is a P-Switch, which changes every brick into a coin *and* every coin into a brick — and the top route is filled with bricks. But to get to the P-Switch, you must jump off Yoshi's back in mid-air, leaving him on the brick floor, which will turn to coins and make Yoshi plummet to his death.")

  [spoiler](#s "If you take the bottom path to save Yoshi, you find this:")

  [spoiler](#s "Two Yoshi eggs were doomed to the abyss because you left the money alone. If you had taken the high path, you would indeed have killed your Yoshi:")

  [spoiler](#s "But you would have turned the coins into a floor for the two Yoshi eggs to hatch on...")

  [spoiler](#s "...and gained access to a platform to save them permanently:")

  [spoiler](#s "The final punch line of the level is that taking the high road is the only way to break the goal tape at its highest point:")

  [spoiler](#s "But the low road, which let you save the one Yoshi you had, turns out to end very poorly for him indeed:")

    The first part was kinda reasonable but the [](#s "yoshi dilemma was super contrived and the rationally altruistic thing to do with the information you have available is clearly the losing strategy. If you could *see* the yoshi eggs ahead of you, though, it might have been pretty nice.") Presumably it's impossible to throw a yoshi through a one way door?

    Ok, so watching the whole structure of the level some things jump out at me. The first two biggest problems:

    1. Lives are not valuable in Mario Maker - [Quoting superbunnyhop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGcB8CFUynk), "Here's a Mario Maker tip, the one-ups don't matter. The 100 Mario challenge gives you so many lives that throwing you any more on the pile doesn't do anything. (...) put a power-up there with it." so there's no value whatsoever in the 1st choice.

    2. Players do not attribute values for Yoshi by default, so there is no taboo in letting them fall towards their death. It wasn't that special in the old days of Mario World romhacks when ProtonJon got famous by doing it repeatedly, and it's even less nowadays.

    So to try and work with the concept(and because I lack ownership of an WiiU and this game), here's what I think should be the kind of concept for a more "rational" level.

    1. Get a clear objective for the player to fight for and include it in the title. For instance: "Get the flagtop", and add reinforcement checkpoints for that. If between each challenge there is a checkpoint flag where only the correct behaviour leads to, but they are not 100% punished for failing it(as in, the wrong path does not allow them to activate it, but allows them to continue) then the player will try to accomplish that goal in every iterate of the problem.

    2. Get more phases for the level. Two data points do not serve for fitting any function(well, you fit a line to it, but it's certainly over-fitted). If you just use two steps then nobody will learn anything for it, it will just look like an unfair and random trap.

    3. Attribute value to the things you want your player to lose. Show them that the jump towards the flagpole/checkpoint is only feasible with a Yoshi, then give them the choice towards keeping/letting go of the Yoshi and then invert their choice by level-design. This still does not align completely with the concept of the taboo trade-off, but it's better than the initial version.

    4. Try to really temp the players with things they find highly valuable. A path with a cape where they end up having to face a lot of projectile enemies versus a path done by sacrificing themselves into small Mario and where at the end they get a mushroom is a far better trial for the players. Almost everyone will want to go for the cape unless you train them well beforehand.
