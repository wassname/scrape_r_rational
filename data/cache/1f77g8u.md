## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I’m 118k words into my superhuman progression fiction. I would like to think the protagonist and the way things are approached in this fiction falls under the banner of Rational.

  Would recommend to any reader that wants a superhuman story that takes its time, has realistic-ish, non-quippy characters; it’s also set in Britain (English protagonist) with a cast of British characters. 

  It takes some time to get started with the powers but I would like to think there’s something new to how the power works that hasn’t been done (though it probably has somewhere) like this before.

    It may be a pet peeve of mine, but I'm going to wait until chapter 200 or so before reading more. Especially at the beginning, the chapter length (around 1k) and pacing is just a bit too annoying.

    Other than that, I like the story and where this is going. Even if I find myself mentally shouting at the characters a lot.

      Could you share your reasoning a bit more on the wait until chapter 200? Is there something you think might happen in the story that might make you drop it? Or is it you’d prefer to binge given the apparent pacing? Curious because this insight will help me understand reader wants/expectations better.

        I just feel a little frustrated by short chapters. And waiting until we have more chapters available lets me read more at once, instead of reading 2k words or so a week. Easier for remembering/caring about a story. But that's a personal choice.

        As an actual feedback,  and disregarding my own hate for short chapters and the inevitability of quality taking time, I'd say that the first 20 or so chapters, while necessary and interesting, could be trimmed by a lot. Especially if you want to reach the more typical RR audience, which usually expects to be hooked in the first chapters.

  A bit of self promotion so feel free to skip buuut:
  A long time ago I posted here about a game I designed, and a few of you liked it :) 
  Well, we just completed an expansion for it on Gamefound a little while ago and we are very close to fulfilment!


  This is the last chance to get the expansion along with the base game at a super discounted price as a late pledge before we fulfill so check it out if it sounds like your cup if tea.


  It is a 1-8 player engine building cardgame. The base game has been a hit, the vast majority of negative feedback has been "there's not enough different cards!" Which the expansion specifically is made to fix. I think is exactly what our community is into as well so wanted to give it a post.


  Thank you for reading this far and here it is ;D: https://gamefound.com/en/projects/bigger-worlds/cosmos-empires

    I always reply to your comments to say I bought the original, backed the expansion, and vouch for this!

  I've got a weird TOMT-type request but I saw the story posted here years ago and can't remember the name of it. It's a webfic that had a great initial premise but kind of lost me along the way. 

  Vague plot: A university is mass isekai-ed onto a ringworld with a fairly primitive society near them. A few students go out to explore the world. The MC is gender-swapped after gaining powers from a magic fruit. She becomes OP, gains a pocket dimension(?), and eventually returns to take control of the school. 

  Also if anyone knows other portal-fantasy stories into non-traditional settings lmk?

  Saw it was a little empty, and I have a medium strength rec.

  For any Prog Fantasy or Cradle fans, theres a pretty great Cradle fic called [Eternal Star](https://archiveofourown.org/works/33759979/chapters/83916814). It’s your typical SI ROB premise, but I thought it was handled really well and the later world building and character work has been pretty solid.

  It takes a bit to get going, but I’m definitely hooked.

  Also, I’m gonna keep reccing it, Player Manager is very good. Everyone check that out.

    Thanks, I'm a big fan of Cradle, and haven't even considered checking out fanfiction, since I feel like there's not much room to improve on the original books. Anyway, I started reading it, and... I don't think It's for me. Mainly for two reasons:

    1. I feel like the main character is too Eithan-like, to the point where they speak in exacly the same voice. The main gang in the original books works so well due to their contrast, and having two Eithans in the same "crew" is kinda off-putting. We don't need two all-knowing, witty, sarcastic, and eccentric characters on screen at a time, one is enough.  

    Also

    2. While the author's narrative style is really smooth, and there are some really great lines here and there, Lindon and Yerin don't feel like their canon selves. Lindon *grins* (guy hasn't cracked a smile once in the original books), Yerin chuckles (dosen't fit her no-nonsense demeanor) and overall some of the narrator's modern slang slips into their thought process when we get a third person scene from their pov. I honestly think the author should have just stuck to first person SI perspective.

    Overall, solid effort by the author and I can see why people like it, but not good enough in the characters department IMO.

      I don’t think I really disagree, but I see the fic as almost entirely focused on the Mc and not the main cast as a whole. And I do find the mc and their introspection genuinely interesting.

    Thanks. Incredibly empty here as folks go back to school and etc.
