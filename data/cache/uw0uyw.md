## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I've noticed myself become less and less inclined to try out new books/series. Every new thing just seems so bad in comparison to the amazing stuff I've consumed in the past. So I thought to ask for people here to recommend to me some of the best things you've ever read. Not just good things, but the best, because honestly, many of the things recommended in this sub and these threads seem sub par to me. Especially on the webfiction front. So I guess I'm expecting more published works recommendations than web stuff.

  To give an idea of what I've read and enjoyed:

  I've sampled most of the recommended literature of this sub. Unsong, HPMOR, Worth the Candle, Ra are all fantastic. Some of the most memorable 'mainstream books' were Anathem and Cryptonomicon by Stephenson, Oryx and Crake by Atwood, Wisdom of the Sands by Saint-Exupery, 1984 by Orwell.
  ```

  - u/Izeinwinter:
    ```
    Bujold is *the* recommendation for anyone that likes sci-fi and fantasy. 

    For straight up comedic and somewhat pun-filled fantasy (You did list UNSONG!) hard to do better than Pratchett. 

    In the sci-fi end of things, Vinge (Both of them), Hannu Rajaniemi, Ian M. Banks, Ann Leckie are all good. 
    For fantasy, anything by Naomi Novik that *doesnt* involve dragons is quite good (The dragon series is hornblower-but-fantasy. If that is what you want.. but her more original work is a lot better) and for Marie Brennan the opposite rule applies: Her dragon related works are great - Basically, you follow the long and storied career of a naturalist in a fantasy world.
    ```

      ```
      > For fantasy, anything by Naomi Novik that doesnt involve dragons is quite good (The dragon series is hornblower-but-fantasy. If that is what you want.. but her more original work is a lot better)

      I haven't read the Temeraire series in a while, but in my opinion the friendship between the human main character and the dragon is what makes or breaks it. The Napoleonic wars bit... well, I suppose *something* has to be going on as a backdrop for the character interaction, but I feel like that's probably not what most people are reading it for.

      Not everyone's cup of tea, but good at what it does.
      ```

  - u/Dent7777:
    ```
    I'd like to recommend all of Lois McMaster Bujold's series. Particularly, they have characteristics of Anathem, HPMOR, and Worth The Candle. To quote the author of HPMOR himself:

    >I'd call it rationalist, or rather, rational fic is Bujoldian.  Miles Vorkosigan was a direct inspiration for HJPEV.

    The Vorkosigan Saga is where I'd start, but I believe by the end of it you'll be happy to search out her other series, which are different in setting and genre, but not theme or quality.

    She is, without a doubt, the best author I've read in years.
    ```

  - u/Jokey665:
    ```
    Worm is the best thing I've ever read. Worth the Candle is second, but you already mentioned it.
    ```

  - u/Relevant_Occasion_33:
    ```
    I really enjoyed Olaf Stapledon’s books Starmaker, Odd John, and Sirius.

    Ursula K LeGuin’a Left Hand of Darkness and The Dispossessed were also great. Her books are sort of hit-or-miss with me, but the ones I like, I consider to be really good. 

    Kim Stanley Robinson’s Mars trilogy admittedly has some lengthy, boring sections, but I’d still give it an overall 8.5-9 out of 10.
    ```

    - u/Jokey665:
      ```
      > Kim Stanley Robinson’s Mars trilogy admittedly has some lengthy, boring sections

      Also known as the entire series. I think by the last audiobook I was on 3x speed just to be done faster. Absolutely hated these things lol
      ```

  - u/Tourfaint:
    ```
    I really liked Fine Structure by QNTM, still one of the more interesting books i've read, even though (or maybe because) it gets really bonkers near the end.
    ```

  - u/Cosmogyre:
    ```
    The Extraordinary Education of Nicholas Benedict by Trenton Lee is a pretty good book with strong HPMOR vibes.
    ```

  - u/godlyvex:
    ```
    I used to really love HPMOR, but after reading 'The Pureblood Pretense' I simply couldn't go back to hpmor. It's a less rational, but the characters still make pretty well-informed decisions most of the time. My only warning is that they are only at book 5 currently, and the story updates at an excruciatingly slow pace. If you hate getting to the end only to find out the book is still in the works, maybe wait to read this until it's done.

  Some stories about fun narcissists: 

  * [Dungeon Park](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/52187/dungeon-park-funny-litrpg-dungeon-core-romp) - another of those "dungeons as a business" stories, except in this case the MC is not actually a dungeon core himself; he just appoints himself as a consultant to the core, and points out the obvious "make it nice in here and people won't want to leave". Tries a bit too hard to be Pratchetty, especially at first, but it's good if you can get over that. 
  * [Getting Hard](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/54001/getting-hard-rise-of-a-tank) - a middle aged former CEO uses a VRMMO to relive his childhood dream of being the best tank ever, by exploiting unusual mechanics. Takes a while to get going (but it's pretty realistic about it), and now the MC's picked up an ability he can exploit a little (and used it to good effect). 

  Also, people on this subreddit might appreciate [They Shall Call Me EMPRESS](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/53780/they-shall-call-me-empress-cultivation-tales-of) (yoga instructor with no clue about genre conventions gets isekaied into a xianxia, but fortunately she's a savant at meditation), but I think people would really like the author's other work: [The Shadows Become Her](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/52964/the-shadows-become-her). It's a little bit fantasy Ender's Game (without the bugs), a little bit "what if Hogwarts taught espionage and piracy". The start is a bit long; it takes a while for the MC to actually get to the magic school, but the story's fun the whole time.

    Empress is entertaining, but it’s not at all rational. If she weren’t a cultivation genius who stumbled upon good friends, she’d be dead three times over so far.

  - u/degenerate__weeb:
    ```
    I'd call Dungeon Park kinda funny, but the MC is hardly rational. I stopped reading at this point:

    >Valentine was unmoved by the part where I got kicked out of the gang. "I would have canned you, too. But it's weird you were SO useless. Most builds are viable."  
    "I'm not claiming to be an elite gamer or anything."  
    "No, I get that, but you should still be able to pull your weight."   She scrunched up her face. "Do you have any unfinished quests?"  
    "Of course. Dozens."  
    "One of those is where you get the exploding cards."

    Though maybe the MC does really need to take his meds, I dunno. Bit too wacky for me.

  - u/Ricardias:
    ```
    I honestly cannot believe that EMPRESS and The Shadows Become Her are written by the same person. Empress up to now is RR junk food, decently written junk food but junk food all the same. 

    The Shadow Becomes Her on the hand is a lovelying crafted world, written with a confident, conversational tone where every new character introduced feels grounded in the worldbuilding. 

    The Shadow Becomes Her really needs a signal boost.

      Yeah the opening arcs (up until she gets on the ship, but arguably until she meets the hawk) are kinda just misery porn; I can see how they're important as an introduction to the MC and her world, but it is a little bit of a slog just because of how bad things are. 

      If that makes you think about dropping the story I'd suggest maybe skipping to [Pirates and Prisoners IV](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/52964/the-shadows-become-her/chapter/882075/10-pirates-and-prisoners-iv) (the denouement of the ship arc, which kinda acts as a resolution for the misery of the beginning of the story) or [Scamps I](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/52964/the-shadows-become-her/chapter/888512/18-scamps-i), the beginning of the magic school segment, to see if you like it better from there.

  Recommending [Warhammer Fantasy: Divided Loyalties ](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/warhammer-fantasy-divided-loyalties-an-advisors-quest.44838/) at Sufficient Velocity:

  As high fantasy settings go, Warhammer Fantasy (precursor to the now more famous Warhammer 40k), is the setting of a highly popular tabletop wargame, as well as dedicated RPGs. A rather unique one, despite the clear influences of real geography and its occasional less than subtle parodies of 80s British culture. It always felt significantly more grounded, and *lived-in* compared to most settings, including its much maligned sequel *Age of Sigmar*, focusing largely on struggle of a lossely Holy Roman Empire themed Empire of Man and allies fighting off the scourge of Chaos.

  Divided Loyalties charts the course of Mathilde Weber, a young wizard in a land that only begrudgingly tolerates her kind because of their sheer utility against the forces that would see the end of the world, even if they have distressing similarities in the source of their powers. Barely graduated, she joins an Elector Count's retinue as he fights against a rising tide of Undeath, and is forced to confront the titular division of her loyalties as she fights for the nation that often seems exceedingly unwilling to extend her any more gratitude than they can get away with.

  It's an excellent, long running series, with a character who is well on the rational side of things, while behaving believably for someone raised in !HRE, one that's beset by rather tangible evidence of the existence of malign gods. Boney writes both Mathilde and the supporting cast of characters in a *beautiful* manner, showing both flaws and competence porn as appropriate. The world doesn't revolve around her, but slowly and surely she gains the opportunity to put her own spin on it.

  There's geopolitics, intrigue, battles both large and small, and everything in between, and all of it worthy of high praise. 

  Now, a passing familiarity with the world of Warhammer Fantasy is certainly recommended, but I'd wager it's still a good read even if you're largely new to the setting. It's !Earth, and ordinary humans, armed only with *Faith, Steel and Gunpowder*, hold the line against a litany of foes. There's stereotypical elves and dwarves, and then more exotic races like Orcs that are actually fungi and have Cockney accents, and Aztec Lizards for good measure. But this particular tale primarily revolves around men and women like you and me, who see monstrosities that could end them in an eye blink, and *hold the line* because they're the only thing between death and their families. 

  Honestly, a 10/10 read, and even if it's not nominally complete, there's enough material to last weeks or months. Apparently my own appetite exceeded even the buffet on offer, so the least I can do is introduce more people to the same!
  ```

  - u/XxChronOblivionxX:
    ```
    Seconded. There is no quest that better demonstrates the unique narrative strengths that quests can provide. Participating in the Battle of the Caldera is one of my all-time favorite experiences on the Internet.
    ```

  - u/xachariah:
    ```
    Seconded as well.  The story is well written and smart. It seems to lean more on the Total War Warhammer side of Warhammer lore, but that's fine as it's the only property doing anything with Warhammer Fantasy.

    I'll also second that it is the best quest I've seen to show off quests.  Avoiding spoilers, there's a point well into the story where dice rolls go off the rails, and the whole story gets derailed, and the author (directed by player votes) just runs with it in a new direction.  This happens to a smaller extent many times in the story, but it's the first time I've seen it occur and realized that this could only exist in the medium of a quest.

      Huh when did that happen? I usually don't read dice rolls or notes around them, since I hate trying to parse through "was that good?" and they tend to be placed in a way that spoils the upcoming narrative

  I'm really very much enjoying "Math Games With Bad Drawings" by Ben Orlin. It's a thick book of simple-yet-deep "mathy" games, but besides the instructions, each game includes sections called "Tasting Notes", "Where It Comes From", and "Why It Matters",  to help you appreciate the beauty and value of the concepts.

  Any recs for fiction that has a magic system but does not feel a need to lay it all out for the reader? While characters trying to understand their universe is interesting to me, it's only interesting so long as there is an actual struggle to it. I want experiments. I want many competing theories. I want replication crisis. I don't want engineering.

  - u/Sure-Manufacturer-47:
    ```
    [Pact](https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/2013/12/17/bonds-1-1/) and [Pale](https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/2020/05/05/blood-run-cold-0-0/) do this, protagonists start in the dark with unreliable mentors, and we learn essential elements of the magic system along with them through in-universe texts and experimentation. 

    Pact's protagonist enters most situations at a massive information disadvantage, and often has to weigh the risk and costs of experimentation against knowledge gained. Pale's trio of protagonists have more leeway and are generally higher powered, but their initial mentors are also all suspects in a murder mystery they've been brought on to solve. 

    Both have considerable struggle, and are not progression fantasies. The protagonists take L's and end up weaker/in a worse position from them. Having said that, the magic system is also one with very few hard rules, so the experimentation is directed towards combining advantages and solving immediate and long term problems, and the key to many of the mysteries is figuring out who's being misleading despite the fact that nobody with magic can lie.

      > figuring out who's being misleading despite the fact that nobody with magic can lie

      Yeah, this is one of the great parts about Pact/Pale. When I was first reading Pact, I wasn't putting too much thought into the precise wording of what practitioners were saying until the cafe scene, which really made me focus in more on the contrast between the implied meaning of their statements versus the literal words being used.

    They also have an enormous amount of engineering.

      It should be noted that the Commonweal series is not available on Amazon at all, so you'll have to use some alternative to get it - it's on both the Google and Apple stores which should cover most people.

    - u/Alternative-Carob-91:

      Throwing my rec behind the commonweal, well written and entertaining. The first book at least doesn't lay out much of anything for the reader but gives you enough to figure it out as you go.

    ```
    All of Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere books (Mistborn, Elantris, Warbreaker, Stormlight Archive, etc.), to at least some extent.  Somewhere in the first half of each book you receive a magical education up to modern standards.  Somewhere in the *second* half of each book, the shortcomings of that knowledge becomes apparent.  *Elantris* is the best fit for your requirements IMO.
    ```

    - u/godlyvex:
      ```
      Elantris is quite good. Stormlight archive book 1 was fantastic, and I loved kaladin's struggle, but I really was bored by the politics and pretty much everything regarding dalinar and adolin. I skipped every dalinar/adolin chapter in book 1, and in book 2 I started just skipping the girl's chapters as well, but eventually context from those sections became important, and the story revolved around that stuff, which led to me dropping the story. I do like politics in fantasy for the most part, but SA's politics just were not fun to read.
      ```

  - u/Amonwilde:
    ```
    The Malazan Book of the Fallen series by Steven Erikson does not lay things out. You can figure a lot out as a reader, but there isn't really an in-universe major investigation or anything, but maybe it will scratch the itch a bit. Possibly skip the first one and go straight to Deadhouse Gates.
    ```

    - u/mkalte666:

      - u/Amonwilde:
        ```
        I'd say the first book is a little weak, then the series gets better, peaking about 70% of the way through. Some of it is a bit impenetrable, but just enjoy what you enjoy, and try to figure things out a bit.

      - u/jordynelson7777777:

    [Ra](https://qntm.org/ra), maybe? I'm not sure if it fits other criteria, but there are  two competing theories about _some stuff_, experiments...


    This is from Chapter 4, but I don't think it really spoils anything (backstory). Maybe it'll give some impression of how magic is handled in this.

    > "Rach, what are you--" Douglas Ferno begins, then stops, distracted, as the five pieces of Rachel's two-metre-long magic staff jump out of her rucksack and screw themselves together in mid-air. This apparently simple trick astounds him. He's seen his wife do a lot of magic, and he's seen the staff a million times, but he's never seen her assemble it except by hand, laboriously, taking at least a minute each time. He's a treasurer, no mage, but he knows that a spell like this takes about a month of writing and a month of practice, because of the laundry list of failure cases that have to be handled. How do the pieces know how to exit the rucksack? How do they pick a spot in the air to assemble at? How long should the assembled staff wait to be collected? What if there are only four pieces, what if half of them are stuck behind a wall?

    > (...) "Eset kasta oerinuum OOLO," she adds, which starts her oxygen supply. It's not tuned properly: it blasts her hair downwards like an invisible localised hurricane. Her clothes flicker in the gale and the grass under her feet splays out in all directions. But there's no time for corrections. Here are the components that do matter: "Sedo oerinuum INKEH sedo MOMEH. Kasta esduq jachta!"

    > Douglas Ferno doesn't recognise the phrasing; the words just wash over him. Laura and Natalie fare worse. They have enough basic magical knowledge to understand that what their mother is doing is either nonsense, or so far beyond the modern magic state of the art that it might as well be... well, whatever comes next. Rachel Ferno has just initiated a pair of high-throughput transduction spells with almost fractal complexity. The patterns of mana radiating off her are incomprehensible. More than that, they're as bright as a sun. To a tuned mind, they're blinding. Who can handle spells that advanced? Who can imagine them?

    > Rachel Ferno's feet rise a few centimetres from the ground. She moves her hands around, something like sign language, distributing virtual controls to points in space where she can reach them. She's building a virtual cockpit. And she's just using hand signals and finger and thumb rings to do it. She's not even saying any words now. (...)
    > 
    > (...) he's right to be confused, because the smallest, simplest force fields in the world require a portable module the size of a motorcycle to project, and they categorically cannot be curved. Nothing she is doing is possible. "Rachel!"

    > Rachel reaches out with her right hand and collects her staff from where it was waiting, suspended in air. "Here goes nothing." As she touches it, there's a single pulse of real light, like a camera flash. Then she's airborne, following the exhaust trail out to sea and the plummeting orbiter.
    > 
    >
    > Of course there are witnesses. (...) But even the people who watched it happen - even the people with photographic evidence - don't believe that she flew away. A human being doesn't show up on radar. A human being in the air at 40 miles' range is too small a speck of dirt to show up on the video footage.

She taught you everything you know about magic - you and Natalie - and you were well on your way to catching up with her and then eventually surpassing her. No problem. Then just at the moment when you were starting to be a real match for her, she pulled the rug out from under you both. She did seven or eight completely impossible things right in front of you, things which she had never bothered to try to explain were possible, and then she flew away without telling you what she'd done or how she'd done it. She left you with no idea how much else she was holding back, or even who she actually was, because in that last second, she--"

We could walk out the door and it would take about ten minutes to get there, straight up. I just need the right words to say. I want autokinetics, air UI, the fluid pump spell she used for O2, non-vocal casting, DWIM, dynamic shielding, and whatever it is she used for a mana source. To begin with. I want it all and I want to be the first person to go into space without a vehicle. Today, if possible. And more after that.

    > "Magic's not the Force. It's not mystical, it's a gauge theory. It explains observations. It is, at its root, a collection of dry and unpalatable nonlinear partial differential equations which are known to be not totally accurate. Magic does not speak to us or obey our commands. Getting magic to do anything, let alone what you want it to do, is close to impossible without insanely complex equipment. The equipment itself couldn't be built prior to around 1981, and prior to 1990 computer-aided design and manufacture weren't sophisticated enough. That's to say nothing of the mental gymnastics. You know that people on my course are supposed to spend at least twelve hours a week meditating?"

    And maybe this, about science<=>magic relation

    > The first magic spell is spoken by a 90-year-old retired Indian physicist named Suravaram Vidyasagar on 1st June 1972. It is one hundred and seventy-nine syllables long, comprising equal parts Upanishadic mantra and partial differential equation.

    > The effect of Vidyasagar's spell is nothing at all. He has discovered what will later be called "uum", the empty spell, which expends no mana and fails to rearrange the universe in any externally detectable way, but which then - crucially - returns to the dispatching mind and tells it so. Vidyasagar immediately notices the curious reaction to his new "differential mantra". He repeats it several times. Each time, he receives, in an almost-non-existent part of his brain, a tiny almost-thought: a thought so faint and difficult to get a grip on as to be a tiny elementary dream: "Success!"

    > An inexplicable observation. With no idea what he has discovered, or even if he has truly discovered anything, Vidyasagar follows procedure. He tries combinations. When he speaks the words too quickly or too slowly or in the wrong frame of mind, or if he skips more than a few words or rearranges phrases or loses his train of thought midway through, he receives no such acknowledgement. Some rephrasings are legitimate. Some pronunciations result in clearer and more powerful successful nothingness. He takes notes. He charts patterns. He extrapolates predictions.

    > He obtains a satisfactory degree of certainty about his result. Then, he seeks independent confirmation.


    And maybe this quote 

    > "I don't remember waking up."

    L. McMaster Bujold's Sharing Knife series contains magic that is way more feel than science. The characters involved test, discover, create, and refine magic in a world where magic is highly personal.

    With that said, 
    magic is not always the pivot on which the series turns. It is largely character, plot, and community driven with vivid worldbuilding.

    [*The Powder Mage*](https://www.goodreads.com/series/99602-powder-mage) series by Brian McClellan. It's basically gunpowder + magic, and there's not much else than that.

    [A Budding Scientist in a Fantasy World](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41521/a-budding-scientist-in-a-fantasy-world) might meet your requirements in the future but it is moving slowly so far.

    Chronicles of Chaos might be the only book series I've read that truly involves this, complete with multiple magic systems and characters enmeshed in them who have trouble verifying evidence because their own magic alters it as they observe it, who still manage to decode each other's powers and come up with upgrades they can use.

  ```
  Haven't been on Royalroad in awhile and there are a bunch of new fictions on the top list. Is there any top rated fics there that you guys DO NOT recommend? That goes against everything this rational subreddit stands for? Any fics with obvious plot holes that everyone ignores?
  ```

  - u/lo4952:
    ```
    Most of the fics at the top of RR are popcorn. They just are. LitRPG and OP Prog Fantasy seem to be the bread and butter of the platform, and so the fics that make it to the top pretty much all fit in some way. As a result, the circle of overlap between RR and 'rational' is usually pretty small. However, if you *like* popcorn reading, you'll probably enjoy most of them.



    Just glancing through the first few pages, there aren't any on there that I would give an anti-rec. Some of them are decent (The Perfect Run, The Calamitous Bob), some of them are *great* (Mother of Learning, Super Minion, Essence of Cultivation) and some are guilty pleasures (Azarinth Healer). Obviously your tastes will probably vary, but it's probably safe to give any of them a shot, and if it doesn't click, just move on to another.

        Is super minion not abandoned? I have up on it after it had gone several months without updating a while back

  - u/PastafarianGames:
    ```
    There's nothing on the first page of BR that I would actively de-rec other than Super Minion, and that's mostly because I bounced hard off of the writing.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I had the opposite experience, I really enjoyed Super Minion and read what was there twice. However, I still would not recommend it because the story is unfinished and has not been updated for 17 months.

  Do you have any recommendations for reverse Isekai? That is, someone from a fantasy world is transported into our world with knowledge of magic/chi/supernatural powers.

  The only one I can think of right now is a fanfic where Celestia from My Little Pony is transported to our world as an Arabian mare ,which I really enjoyed it. I forgot the title and my quick search returned empty...

  I find the formula of modern day person with scientific knowledge tries to hack medieval world to be quite repetitive

  Thanks!
  ```

  - u/Revlar:
    ```
    Bokura no Kiseki is an interesting take on the concept. The people who are brought to modern reality do so as memories that their new selves recover over time/with exposure to reminders of their fantasy world. The conflict comes from the fact that everyone who's isekai'd comes from the same medieval fantasy castle. where people from multiple factions with different motives interacted until a particular violent event triggered their isekai.

    The main character is a boy who knows for a fact his past self was the Princess of one of the factions. The genre is definitely drama, but the plot advances as the characters discover the previous identities of other students and details about what really took place before their previous lives ended.

  After books, webfiction. After webfiction, manga. After manga, .... After manga....

  So I feel like I've kind of exhausted the low-hanging fruit, as it were, of most webfiction and manga that I can find online. Books are more nebulous because there's lots of different genres, and more availability, but I'm kind of running dry on them too. Any different mediums I could jump into for some new content? To be clear, I would count different formats too, like glowfic or quests. I don't really like anime or TV shows because they require headphones to listen, and move at their own pace, but I'd be interested in something I don't know about. Thanks in advance!

    How do you feel about Webcomics?

    Ones recommended on this sub frequently are :

    [Strong Female Protagonist](https://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-1/page-0/)

    [Fleep](http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/fleep/) <- Strong content warning 

    [Seed](https://www.webtoons.com/en/sf/seed/list?title_no=1480&page=1)

    And this one that may not be rational but is very fun to read -> [Paranatural](https://www.paranatural.net/comic/chapter-1)

    [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/) and [SMBC](https://www.smbc-comics.com/) are one-page math/science/ psychology/philosophy/academia gags
    ```

    - u/Cosmogyre:
      ```
      I have actually read Fleep, Demon, SFP, SMBC and XKCD, probably should have mentioned it. I *was* looking for more recommendations of different sort, so I'll be trying Seed and Paranatural. Thank you!
      ```

  - u/Missing_Minus:
    ```
    Comics: The Sandman, Lucifer (2000), and Hellblazer are all quite good. Technically all DC but they don't touch on the normal superhero stuff much.  



    Quests: I've been enjoying https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/warhammer-fantasy-divided-loyalties-an-advisors-quest.44838/reader/ (which was linked in this thread), but most quests are meh and there is a lot fewer of them relative to normal fanfiction.  

    SCP? Though I'd be surprised if you haven't read some of them yet.

    Try games, specifically something like slay the spire, very much at your pace, strategic thinking, interesting possibilities. Not a huge time commitment, stop start as you need. It sounds like you have lots of time :p
