  **This Chapter**

  The dynamic shown here between Leet and Uber is really interesting, and it was a surprise to get a [Level 2 Intelligent](http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing) Leet.  If nothing else, the chapter is well written on a technical level and a satisfying discussion of heroism, villainy, and the ambition to save the world.

  **General**

  [I've recommended](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4en57t/rtff_worm_elahrairah_thinkercauldrontaylor/) this story before, and you can check out the link for why I did so, and what others think of the story.  There was also [some discussion last month](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4ppq49/repost_of_repostupdated_todayrtffworm_elahrairah/) about the story's flaws, and the complaints there are pretty on target.  

  I go back and forth myself on whether this story is worth reading, and how "rational" it is, but I think this chapter merits the label.  So, if you gave up on this story, or haven't checked it out, I think this chapter is worth reading.  You don't need to know much: just that Taylor goes by Administrator and is working with Cauldon, and that her power gives her a deep understanding of Shards.
