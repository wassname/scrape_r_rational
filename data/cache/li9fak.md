  This is unreasonably fun. Worth noting the Stargate element is basically a throwaway nod, though maybe it would've built to something if it continued.

    The stargate element is a tradition of the niche the story is in. Plus it's a reference to one of my main inspirations: *Ship of the Line: Forever after Earth*.

  I truly loved this, and I wish it had finished.

  Oh, it's my story. Man that was a long time ago, longer than I was in college. What a disturbing passage of time.

  Anyway, Eliezer appeared in an early review (or pm?) and was like "there's no way you can have conflict here." Basically, I think he was right. My ideas for the story consisted of a bunch of cool scenes I wanted to see, rather than a coherent overarching plot. Plus it was a power fantasy (although maybe that's not so bad, it is our genre after all). Help me think about how to fix this, and maybe the story can resume.

  Other than that, I have a jumpchain story idea I'm nursing (yes, and it's another power fantasy), but it does have a plot.

    Did you by any chance ever read Xander Mercenary? https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-6928/KevinM+Xander+Mercenary.htm ? It's a similar premise in that Xander dresses as Captain Tagon from Schlock Mercenary and the spell creates the Thunderhead-class Superfortress ship known as the Post-Dated Check Loan (affectionately known as Petey). Petey copies himself using local matter so that a version of himself will persist after the spell ends. He continues to treat Xander as his Captain. I was wondering if there was cross-pollination, since your story also involves a massive starship copying itself into realspace to survive after the spell ends.

      No, but it's a pretty common premise. The "Ship of the Line" "challenge" (story prompt) on TtH is basically this.

  From the description:

  >For Halloween, Willow goes as the Mind of a Culture spaceship, and Buffy and Xander, as members of her crew. Then Ethan casts his spell. How will two humans and one small sentient ship, endowed with the heritage of a bright (but apparently fictional) space-faring civilization, respond to the state of the galaxy and world? A "Ship of the Line" multi-crossover.

  No familiarity is required with any of the mentioned fictions. It helps to know the basics of The Culture series, but those are explained through the narrative anyway.

  I remember this. Not favorably. It's 80% fremdschämen by length.

    >fremdschämen 

    I have felt this emotion so strongly for so many years that I can't watch romantic comedies or the majority of live action sitcoms. My loved ones have told me to not watch The Office out of feat that I may burst into flames.

    I should have assumed there was a German word for it, but I always just called it second hand awkwardness. Thank you.

      Your loved ones are wise.

    ... I also feel uncomfortable re-reading it, fwiw. Not sure I can put my finger on what I don't like. My writing was a bit purple, or otherwise bad? The power fantasy? (But many of our other power fantasies don't cause this effect in me, so...)
    ```

    - u/Auroch-:
      ```
      Well, it's been said that if your old writing *doesn't* embarrass you to read, you're doing something wrong, as a writer. Supposedly this is even true of the professionals. So while that's possibly a sign that you were a bad writer *then*, it's not evidence that you're a bad writer *now*.

  Hot damn that was great!
