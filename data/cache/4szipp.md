## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  I have trained an ANN on the full text of HPMOR, you can check out the result [here](https://medium.com/@rayalez/artificial-neural-network-writes-harry-potter-and-the-methods-of-rationality-846126dbe882). (already submitted it to /r/hpmor, just thought you guys will find it curious as well)

    Wow that was beautiful. I had read how TensorFlow was the future for Machine Learning algorithms but hadn't given it serious thoughts until I saw your example.

    I'm very interested in knowledge representation on general AI, will check it in more depth.

    Have you made research with Tensor Flow before or do you use it more as a hobby?

      I am really interested in studying AI/DL, but I don't have a lot of experience yet. I have generated this text by following [this](https://medium.com/deep-writing/how-to-write-with-artificial-intelligence-45747ed073c#.tbgeeyfye) tutorial, it's very simple, and I did not write the actual code or do any research.

      If you're interested in Deep Learning and Tensor Flow, I highly recommend [this](https://machinelearningmastery.com/deep-learning-with-python/) book. I'm reading it right now and it's awesome. It doesn't go deeply into difficult math and does not have a long list of prerequisites, instead it describes an easy way to get started with DL, explains how to quickly start building stuff and learn everything else on practice. It's helping me a lot.

      Also there's a free course by Andrew Ng on Coursera, it's a great introduction into general ML, it was very useful to me as well.

  Coup d'etat attempted in Turkey. I wonder how it will go. Erdogan is kind of a religious crazy authoritarian, so it would be nice if his voter base died of old age soon, but he's also democratically elected. Military coups against democratically elected leaders usually don't lead anywhere happy.

    In Turkey there's a lot of precedent for the military stepping in when the government gets too religious. Historically, these actions have been followed by a swift return to democracy.

      And it seems that this time, they were followed by a switch return to Erdogan, since apparently Facetime is more powerful than the Turkish army now.

        Erdogan had purged the military already in anticipation of a move like this. If this was a desperate attempt by those left who still opposed him before their window completely shut, it would explain why Erdogan's consolidated power base was able to shut them down.

  So, anyone remember me [complaining about my hate of soccer and wanting to do something productive out of it?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4ngpow/d_friday_offtopic_thread/d43tbd0)

  Well... my country won the Euro cup and everything exploded, the soccer nationalism lever was pushed to the max and this pretty much shutdown any possibility of integrating criticism of it into society through the next years. This annoys me more than anything else, but it certainly does not help with my previous problem.

  Just in case anyone had a revelation, any ideas on where to productively go from here?

  So I'm curious, what were your thoughts on the last Re:Zero episode?

  Personally I loved the balance of animation (the battles were short but interesting), voice acting (which IMO was on point) and music. Particularly [the piece that played](https://youtu.be/Hi2Xhg5qpo0) through the episode and how they kept intensifying the sound until reaching the crescendo and rolling credits. It felt like something out of a Western drama.

  An interesting point I saw on the direction of the anime is that they [Re:Zero Web Novel](#s "lowered the gore and shortened the scene. From what I read Subaru took 15 loops to snap out of his coma in the web novel and that people dropped the novel because it was too much suffering for them even if they liked the writing"). I think besides time constraints it also speaks about the need for scenes to make a point and show some aspect of character development, lest it degrade from the impact and turn into torture porn. I think that links nicely with how another member here complained about how unnecesary are sex scenes in adult literature and movies and I think needless violence must also be moderated and exist to advance the story rather than letting the story drag for the sake of mindless torture. Even in hardcore smut a good story and cohesive plot can make a work go from simply shock factor to something truly memorable.

  I think the web novel failed in that aspect and taking from the closest rational work we have, Mother of Learning, it'd be like taking Zorian and making him fail over and over through several chapters without him attempting to at least escape, try to solve the problem or show aspects of his changing psychology. I think that's bound to bore readers and make the scenes lose their impact, leading to readers rage quitting out of frustration.

  Now the villain was a curious mix of creepy and comical. I have mixed feelings about him as while I initially found him very creepy in how he takes glee on suffering, after rewatch the impact is a bit lost and he feels more jarring and even a bit silly. I think in part it serves to lessen the darkness of the scenes he appears in with his silly antics and that has been my justification so far but I'm curious on what you think about him.

  I'm mainly curious on this community's thoughts on that kind of villain given that they are so far from rational ideals. I know that rational literature aims for villains that are on the more gray end of the scales and have a clear purpose and rational approach to problem solving (ex. Luthor from Metropolitan Man) so has anyone ever attempted to tackle a villain like The Joker, [Fate/Heaven's Feel](#s "Matou Zouken") or [Re:Zero](#s "Betelgeuse")?

  Would you attempt to give them a reason to behave that way and a method to their madness or are okay with Complete Monster type of villains? I think not all villains have to be likable or redeemable as long as there're consequences to their actions or they act like bully types/grunts to more manipulative and calculating villains but I'm curious on what the community thinks of them.

  About the relationship, I like how they have been developing Rem and Subaru's relationship and it seems as if their interactions were leading to this episode. I think they still fall for some clichés with the more jarring being that they show happy moments with the character or the character smiling before they brutally kill them. I suppose the aim is to increase the attachment to the character and make it feel more strongly but I think for seasoned viewers it would have the opposite effect as the moment those scenes appear you know the character is a goner and can emotionally prepare for it.

  I've read some complains about how much they have neglected Ram and Emilia but I'm more interested in Rem right now and I like what they've been doing with her so far.

  I like how they showed Rem's [Re:Zero](#s "desire for something more and how Subaru has now become aware of her feelings (and seems willing to reciprocate). Whether he really accepts her or not is to be seen, he seems more concerned on getting revenge on Betelgeuse than anything else at this point").

  Also Subaru finally got forced to face the consequences of what inaction can do and seems to finally have decided to stop avoiding his problems. Whether he will do the right thing or not is also to be seen.

  Personally I've been wishing they also delved a bit more into the politics of the setting as they seem particularly convoluted and interesting but I suppose we're stuck with Subaru for the time being.

  Despite that the guy [Re:Zero 15](#s "twisting Rem like that caught me by surprise and the confession scene") was my favorite and one of the best I've seen in anime so far in emotional depth, can't argue for rational congruence.

  It seems the story points towards a villain origin story and have to say it has been interesting so far even if Subaru still is the weakest link IMO given how little we know about him and how he seems to jump into situations without thinking.

  --------------------------------------------

  On another note that's related, how long do you spend writing a fic before submitting it? And how much do you re-read it to detect wheter there's any irrational element? Do you get help from betas?

  I've always been too impatient so usually wrote my previous fics in a few hours and then hit submit without proof checking because I fear losing patience/inspiration or going into a depression period and forgetting about it.

  It has caused pretty glaring flaws and for the stories to flip flop between dark comedy/drama from one chapter to another.

  Also I tend to take extremes without thinking, for example if I enjoyed how some comedy turned out, then the next chapter ends up having even more comedy even if it was originally meant to be a serious story. Or if some references were well received then I assume it'd be great to have even more references and it ends up cluttering the story. I'm trying to find a way to purge those flaws from my writing.

  After learning of rational literature I've been wanting to adjust to this new style although so far it has been limited to consuming it and trying to find common trends I aim to adapt to my writing style but I'm dying to write again.

  --------------------------------------

  Besides that continuing language learning, about to finish the Kanji now I must figure how to craft sentences with them.

  And finally got to start The Foundation series by Asimov, excited about the beginning of it.

    Wait, Zouken does have the sorts of goals a /r/rational user would find somewhat reasonable. His excecution is arguably off, but his goal is basically just utopia... and then immortality. Did you mean fate/zero caster? That seems a bit more in line with the other listed villains...

    Anyway complete monster type villains are my favorite. I've been on record saying I'm pro xenofiction, pro alien goals. The culmination of that in a villain, is someone that isn't trying to make utopia, they aren't doing it for the evuls, they kill your family because the suffering you feel by seeing them dead is identical to the suffering they feel by seeing them alive. A perfect inversion of the human moral compass, that is my ideal villain.

    Honestly I don't think I've ever seen anything quite to that extreme in fiction, which is a shame.
    ```

    - u/sir_pirriplin:
      ```
      >Zouken does have the sorts of goals a /r/rational user would find somewhat reasonable

      Zouken is more of a tragic villain. He was a good guy who couldn't find a way to stop senility until he was just crazy enough to be evil but not crazy enough to be harmless.

      >A perfect inversion of the human moral compass, that is my ideal villain.

      Unsong has a villain like that. Not a very rational piece of fiction, but it sounds like you would enjoy it.
      ```

    - u/Faust91x:
      ```
      Mostly I interpreted it as sir_pirriplin suggested, Zouken [Fate/Heaven's Feel](#s "being a villain that had a rational goal but lost it due to senility until only his obsession with immortality and sadistic joy remained").

      Zero/Caster is a better exponent though, thanks for the reminder. I always forget about him due to how little he appeared in the anime.

      So you think it'd be possible to have a villain like that and still count the work as rational? It made me wonder because otherwise we would be severely limited on the type of villains we can get.
      ```

      - u/sir_pirriplin:
        ```
        >So you think it'd be possible to have a villain like that and still count the work as rational?

        In Unsong, the Archangel Uriel points out that evil can still be 'rational' if you have an unusual utility function:

        >“I understand this is confusing,” Sataniel said. “I didn’t get it all at once. My first thoughts were the same as yours were – it doesn’t make sense, it doesn’t glorify God, we’d have to smite ourselves – I thought all of these things at first, trust me. But the more Thamiel explained to me, the more it started to come together. You’ve got to believe me, there’s a sort of mental distance here, but there’s a self-consistent position on the other side. Like, for example, if we were to defy God, we could smite those who didn’t defy God.”

        >“But I still maintain that that wouldn’t increase the glory of God very well!” said Haniel.

        >“Right!” said Michael, “and how would we sing songs of praise? If we smote those who didn’t defy God, we’d have to smite ourselves every time we sung a song of praise! There are some serious loopholes here.”

        >“Sataniel’s position is self-consistent,” said Uriel, without looking up from the parchment he was writing his proof on. “It’s like representing our desires in a utility function, then multiplying by negative one.”
        ```

      - u/gabbalis:
        ```
        Sure. Firstly, not everyone needs to be rational for the work to be.

        Secondly, Serial killers do exist in real life. Sometimes they even hold an idiot ball in real life, leaving clues and such, just because that's part of what's bringing them enjoyment. Strictly speaking, that's always a bad idea, but I would still call it rational if the utility of the thrill they get outpaces the chance of getting caught multiplied by the potential cost. They only really stop being rational when they start underestimating that chance.

        Being rational just means legitimately doing your best to optimize utility within the context of your own utility function. You can't call a particular utility function itself irrational.

        That said rational fiction also has to have reasons for things. Serial killers are a real phenomenon. So a few of them here and there seems plausible without much further explanation. But there's still a limit to how evil you can go before you start needing some special reason in your story as to how a villain got to be so mindbogglingly inhumanly evil. Like, once a villain is ok with double-crossing the hero right after the hero spares him you have to start to wonder whether any human could possibly develop a utility function where that's sensible.
        ```

  - u/gabbalis:
    ```
    Oh, and as for Re:Zero 15, it's probably hyperbolic to call it the best anime episode you've ever seen, but some people have in fact been calling it that.

    The rationality of the series hasn't really increased yet (Though the MC growing the fuck up does seem imminent), but if anyone has dropped the series, I suggest picking it back up if only to get to this episode.

    It really depends on what it is. [*Instruments of Destruction*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11685932/1/Instruments-of-Destruction) was written very quickly over the course of two hours, got a single editing pass, then went up that same day without too much thought. [*Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Zombie*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10023949/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Philosopher-s-Zombie) is roughly the same length, but I spent three times as much effort reworking it until I'd gotten everything more or less "right".

  Writing process:

  How much worldbuilding and prep work people tried to do beforehand before...say writing a new web serial.

  It turned out that worldbuilding is very hard for me to do. I tend to worldbuild as I write. Then I run into the obvious problem of writing on the fly with no idea as to the direction I am aiming for.

  Then again, I think you would have the same problem if you try to worldbuild rather than jump into writing stories.
  ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:

    Whatever you do, write with a backlog, preferably one at least three chapters long. (large?)

    I can't tell you how many times being able to go back and change something in an unpublished chapter written a few weeks ago has saved my ass writing Horizon Breach. Just yesterday, I changed the order of two chapters and moved around some sections because I noticed an error in the timeline.
    ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    I do as much as feasible with the understanding that some things are going to have to change when it comes to the actual writing. I usually start writing once I've answered all of what I'd consider to be the interesting questions of worldbuilding. I also usually sketch out a very rough map of whatever area I intend to cover.

    I've done it the other way (the "just write" method) but that's left me with a lot of projects that I put thousands of words into and then don't want to complete because I'm going to have to go back and change too much.

  It's kind of interesting to consider what's necessary to push you away from a website.

  Some months (years?) ago, I noticed that TV Tropes had removed its [article](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeBraid) on *[Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644)*--due, of course, to its portrayals of intercourse between minors. (On [this page](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/remarks.php?trope=FanficRecs.NarutoPeggySueFics) can be found a discussion of how this removal is unfair when the page for *[Chunin Exam Day](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411)*, which contains several similar scenes, is still up.) This annoyed me, but I definitely didn't care enough to declare (to myself...) an official boycott of the site--especially when I wasn't aware of any alternatives, and when I hardly used TV Tropes anyway.

  Some months (years?) later (and ago), I somehow (through checking whether *Time Braid*'s page on TV Tropes had been reinstated, maybe?) became aware of [the All the Tropes Wiki](http://allthetropes.wikia.com), which [apparently](http://allthetropes.wikia.com/wiki/All_The_Tropes:Why_Fork_TV_Tropes) had been founded in response to the TV Tropes crackdown on NSFW pages (most infamously, IIRC, [Naughty Tentacles](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaughtyTentacles), which, IIRC, used to have a warning reading something like "We don't want content like this on this website" rather than a standard "deleted page" message, before the site's recent major update). Again, I didn't care too much about officially switching what little allegiance I had--since I hardly used TV Tropes in the first place, since I assumed that the new website must have significantly fewer editors and less content than the well-established version, and since I already disliked Wikia after once or twice being attacked with browser-redirecting ads on the [Naruto](http://naruto.wikia.com) and [Gundam](http://gundam.wikia.com) wikis (and also because it always seemed rather unresponsive). Still, in the past few months, I've drifted toward linking to All the Tropes rather than to TV Tropes when a link would be useful.

  I still don't particularly like Wikia, but I haven't seen any especially-irksome ads on it in a while--and, in the course of writing this comment, I discovered that there's [a *second* All the Tropes Wiki](https://allthetropes.org) on a non-Wikia site! Thus is completed my slow transfer of allegiance from TV Tropes to All the Tropes, I guess...

  (I wonder--[will a similar process ever happen with Wikipedia?](http://www.reddit.com/r/WikiInAction))

  Some weeks ago, I was very interested to see the esteemed u/eaglejarl [mention](http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4modgn/monthly_recommendation_thread/d42go68?context=9) that he wrote directly in "raw [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)". I've done a few simple things with HTML, just for fun (in addition to some school assignments in the distant past)--copying from *[GURPS](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps)* books ([1](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42443024/Dogfighting%20Combat.html) [2](http://i.imgur.com/FGeKwUx.png)), making [a tree structure](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42443024/Italia%20structure.html) of a [*Crusader Kings 2*](http://www.reddit.com/r/crusaderkings) game, uploading [a chapter](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11746791/1) to FanFiction.net (after seeing zillions of authors whine about how their non-`<hr/>` section-break markings were constantly devoured by the site--tee-hee!), and writing a program to download chapters from FanFiction.net (with everything but the text of the story removed). It really is fascinating, to see how a bunch of complicated, repetitive actions can be moved and condensed into the header of an HTML file, or into the classes and functions of a [Processing](https://processing.org) program, or into the styles of a Word document...

  And, on the topic of forms of address--"**The esteemed** EagleJarl"! ["**Mr.** Yudkowsky"](http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4rv3as/d_friday_offtopic_thread/d54bvcd)! It's an interesting balancing act. On the one hand, anyone who can write a long, interesting, complete story is better than I am, and deserves thanks from me for condescending to allow me to read what he writes--but, on the other hand, exactly *how entertaining* does a writer need to be in order to receive a title when referenced in his view?

  Really, of course, a large part of it is just virtue signaling, both to the subreddit and to the referenced people themselves--I've got to one-up you plebes who call the codifier of your favorite genre so familiarly by his Kira-damned *first name!*--but part of it is *actual* admiration, too. What's the cut-off? Would ShaperV deserve such treatment, if he frequented this subreddit? Would Orson Card? Would Chris-chan? (I mean, he *is* a better artist than I am.) It's a *vaguely*-interesting question, I guess...

    Inclusionists have been complaining about Wikipedia's deletionists policies for more than a decade. It's not going away.

    Many sites were made to try to replace Wikipedia outright, but none found success. What ended up happening is that wikipedia was ~~replaced~~ complemented by a million smaller online encyclopedias, each focusing on one aspect of the world that Wikipedia thinks is not notable. The sites you mention only exist because the deletionists won and people moved that content from Wikipedia to sites like wikia and TVTropes.

    I'm not sure what this means for the potential successor sites to TVTropes. Maybe replacing TVTropes outright is hopeless but separate sites for the discussion and storage of encyclopedic knowledge about all the different fandoms that were rejected by TVTropes will start to emerge.

      Instead of a fork, it would make a good deal of sense to have a complementary wiki with just the content TVTropes doesn't want on their site.

      But that might make it look too much like a porn website, with all the issues that come with it (NSFW, a culture that's too heavy on porn jokes etc.). The Voat problem, basically.

        When Star Wars fans got mad at Wikipedia for deleting non-notable Star Wars stuff, they didn't make a new Wikipedia dedicated specifically to non-notable stuff. That would be silly. Instead, they made a wiki about specifically Star Wars.

        Likewise if Time Braid fans are upset that TVTropes deleted that entry because of NSFW content, it's probably a bad idea to make a TVTropes for NSFW works. It's better to make something like a FanficTropes or even NarutoFanficTropes website.

          Problem is that then you get a bunch of unrelated wikias in many places. One of the things I like of Tv Tropes is that I can search for a specific theme and find all the works that follow that trope.

          Its very useful to find new stories or interpretations of a given theme without having to read all the work beforehand and facilitates deciding whether something is worth reading or not.

    Probably. In a way it reminds me of an event that happened here when the /r/news sub started censoring information about a shooting and there was a progressive backlash towards other subs that allowed those threads.

    Reddit addressed that complaint and slowly have been trying to turn opinion back but Tv Tropes doesn't seem to be attempting to listen to the community.

    My only problem with the All The Tropes Wikia is that they still lack information on a lot of sources but it seems to be doing well and probably may replace TvTropes if those issues of censorship continue.

    I agree that its annoying, particularly because these are fictional works.

  - u/rineSample:

    I think that this might be the first time Chris-chan has been mentioned on this sub. Which is interesting, because CWCville has some (but not all) of the features of an NRX society: most importantly, an absolute czar, and what seems like a strongly reduced presence of "the Cathedral" (however, this is probably because CWCville itself exists only in his mind).

  - u/Drexer:

    My problem with criticism of the TVtropes moderation is that I remember the really bad old days.

    I remember the first time I saw an online post commenting about the toxic elements of TVtropes and having a flashback to some days before when I was binging on it and I stumbled upon what was in retrospect a very pedophiliac comment. Suddenly it became easy to see a very dark side of TVtropes in its comments and interpretations, and that soured the site for me for a long time.

    So I don't really see it as an inherent problem that they remove certain pages when those kind of problems pop up once more, I expect that they might be a bit overzealous but I highly prefer that to see the site burn from the inside once again.
