## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  I am going to take an opportunity to talk about a story I have planned.

  It's a Mass Effect fanfic that might end up being a full-fledged rational fic. The basic idea is to make fun of how the game allows you to pick "Engineer" as your class, but then has you solve all your problems by shooting things anyway. I intend to make the main character into an actual engineer, who is expected to fight all kinds of alien monstrocities even though that's not at all what he is trained to do. The effect is a smartass, resourceful, kind of cowardly doctor of engineering trying to talk and puzzle his way out of the situations he is thrown into. As the story goes on, the characters are revealed to differ from their canon counterparts as well and the plot starts to be less like a heroic space opera and more like a... "HPMOR on drugs" seems like a good term if I get my way. I have only half a chapter written and only a few things planned, so I'm not sure if it ends up going anyway.
