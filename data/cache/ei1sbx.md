  I wonder how long before that chip is standard issue in the royal army. A few years if that, and the nature of war will shift quite a bit.

  I can already imagine how the artificial cybouningendroids could be legitimately concerning 10-15 years later, not that I have a clue how likely that outcome is in this story.

  Going by the "give Sauron the Death-Star" principal, I'm wondering how the wider galaxy is going to deal with kitech, given how big a deal the differences to Earth were in canon. Bulma basically invented the foundations of Freeza / Tuffle battlefield equipment with just a year of RnD. Looking forward to 2024, when either this fic or the Apollo reboot might plausibly make it to space. :) 

  While I consider it rather low in probability, it occurs to me that an ambush implicates a spy, and there were multiple references to Dr. Gero trying to spy on everything Bulma did. I don't think I'd go over 30% on Gero being either a spy, or unwitting cover for some other spy, though.

    I'll say that Gero's androids in canon gave me quite a lot of trouble, because if he could develop those even faster, he'd basically solve the entire plot before it started. Frieza in particular would not stand a chance. I'm not too keen on that happening, and I think that technological power-ups should be more gradual than that. These easy gains were just the low-hanging fruit. I have a plan on how to lay this out but the only thing I can say is, I don't think even in its entirety this story is going to span more than 10 years (in-universe). Just like it happened in HPMOR, I plan on speeding up the time frame of the events, though not as drastically.

    I can also tell you that future threats will all undergo some kind of level up, yes. Some will be stronger, and some will be smarter. 'nuff said.

      Which now makes me wonder, did you 'level up' Gero in your story, or maybe 'level down' him, or just left him unchanged but made Red Ribbon a little bit more moral?
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        I'd say Gero himself is similar, but he's pre-destruction of the Red Ribbon, which means he's still a pretty different person, less extreme. The desire for revenge is what pushed him completely off the edge. The Red Ribbon is less Neutral Evil, more True Neutral. Overall, they're not as villainous as in canon, they just don't care about anything other than their bottom line; they do however have some more or less principled members within their ranks. Though no one would be a beacon of morality, at the very least they're people who grew up in pretty violent environments and ended up becoming soldiers of fortune, so they will have a pretty hard outlook on life. Loyalty to their superiors and comrades trumps loyalty to any specific state or legal system any time.

        In addition, I'm changing a bit how the very principles upon which androids function work. I'm making the critical quantity not the sheer amount of energy available but the energy output that the body can channel (this is somehow consistent with canon: #17 and #18 are said to possess "infinite energy" reactors, but still, their strength is not infinite). #17 and #18 were seemingly not ki-based in canon, as their energy could not be sensed. This is not possible in OWP, as in, there is no non-spiritual technology that can possibly produce those levels of power in such a small frame as a human body is without destroying itself. Ki is the only way to reinforce things to that degree, and virtually infinitely. Therefore, if androids were not detectable by scouter in OWP, it would be just because they're optimised to not leak out any spiritual energy or otherwise shielded, *not* because they literally operate on purely biomechanical principles.

        So I'm inclined to say that building an android as powerful as Frieza would require time and room to study someone as powerful as Frieza, at the very least. This doesn't even necessarily disagree with canon: it could very well be that #17 and #18 were at least partially the result of Gero acquiring data from Frieza and Cold when they landed on Earth. We know for sure Cell was only that strong thanks to Frieza's cells, as well as the Saiyans'. In general, Gero's skill to build androids will be limited by the data he can get his hands on, which nerfs him to the point of being simply reactive, as it'd be almost impossible to pre-emptively build androids stronger than whatever threat will appear next (not to mention, at high power levels, any mistakes with handling the energies involved could literally cause the entire Earth to go kaboom).

  great as always!

  Ok.. I'm pretty sure something in this fragment is a typo, but I'm not sure exactly how to correct it.

    That's weird, in my file it says:

    > I thought I'd go crazy. You certainly don't go out fighting like we're doing now.

    But on FFnet it's wrong. Huh. Probably some weirdness during the conversion to HTML.
