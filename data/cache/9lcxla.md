## Thoughts on The Last Angel so far

### Post:

This fic recently came to my attention from another thread post about its sequel, and I'm enjoying it quite a bit, but wanted to vent some critique.

&#x200B;

Spoilers ahead (but please don't spoil too much of the end or sequel)

&#x200B;

It's overall a solid blend of space drama/sci fi horror.  I am engaged by all the different timelines and stories, and while some of the details don't quite sit - for instance 2000 years for a spacefaring race is a LONG time, we should see immense technological progress and cultural change - the world mostly holds together. 

&#x200B;

Yet the further I get into the Last Angel, the more I see Red as the villain.  I'm currently at chapter 28, and recently read her encounter with the Principality where she refused their offer to use her technology against the Compact under the condition she mind-wipe herself.  Her response - blowing up a manufacturing base in an unprovoked act of violence - was petulant and strategically unsound for a multitude of reasons.  She harmed the infrastructure of a potential ally and ruined chances for further diplomacy just to make a point where words would have sufficed. 

&#x200B;

But even beyond her irrational behavior, her fundamental cause is that of a terrorist.

&#x200B;

The Compact does nothing more "evil" than real historical acts committed by the United States.  Of course, this isn't an excuse for the compact so much as an indictment of the U.S., but I think it helps cast the situation in a different light to consider it this way.

&#x200B;

Yes, the Compact is imperialistic and colonial, spread their ideology with violence, and make heavy use of propaganda to support racist policy.

&#x200B;

But Rally isn't much different than Native American reserves, is it?  Nor is the US a stranger to racial oppression, starting wars to acquire resources, or overthrowing foreign governments to spread their "enlightened" ideology. 

&#x200B;

Conversely, Red admits she is driven by hate and revenge, not any cohesive plan to better Humanity's lot.  She murders indiscriminately and savors terrorizing her victims.   She wipes out entire planets including civilians and humans.  She subjects individuals to physical and psychological torture and kills in needlessly horrific ways. 

&#x200B;

While the original acts of the Compact against humanity were unjustified aggression, in the current state of affairs they are actually in the right, IMO.   Red is a rogue unfriendly AI with violent goals.  Any reasonable organic life SHOULD want her put down, and be justified in doing so.  The moment she manages to start truly self-replicating she becomes a threat to the whole galaxy.  

&#x200B;

The Compact's general fear of AI "neverborn" may be justified in general as well -- while they are draconian in their methods, their crusade to incorporate all organic civilizations might be the only safe course for the universe, given the possibility of an unfriendly AI breakout like the Devoured causing a galactic extinction event.  

&#x200B;

They aren't even that bad to their Human second class citizens, as "evil empires" go.  They are given chances to thrive and progress in society despite their mottled history.  The culture seems broadly pretty free, there's private enterprise and chance for a dignified life. 

&#x200B;

Overall this isn't a criticism of the text - more of the reactions to it I see in the forum comments.  I think the author does a good job walking the line between Horror and Hero with Red and is aware of the blurred lines.  I'm more shocked and amused when I see the readership cheering her on even at her worst, reveling in the gore as she sticks to the nasty Compact races. 

&#x200B;

I wonder if others caught this sense when they were reading it, or if it's just a factor of the changing times?

  If I recall correctly, the other party snuck an AI eraser disguised as a suitcase into the meeting. I don't see any reason to bring the eraser to the initial meeting if a consensual mindwipe is your goal.

  Apart from that, I agree with you. The Compact isn't wholly evil and Red is difficult to cheer for at times. I enjoy the shades of morality.

    she was already in control of the situation by that point, so she could have said "no" without attacking, and the Principality's proposition actually made sense.  I think additional terms and conditions could have been added to ensure Red's desire for Humanity's restoration would be fulfilled, but at the end of the day the Principality was justified in fearing a rogue AI with super tech.  If Red were to become further unhinged and be able to replicate it could be an extinction event.  Their offer was to carry on her campaign, and the price was removing the risk of her Grey Gooing the universe.

          She doesn't even need to negotiate with them. Just send them a steady stream of free technologically advanced military ships and in a hundred years they won't even think of destroying her because the war effort depends on her production capabilities.

          To keep with real world analogies: The Afghans the US gave free arms in 1979 didn't particularily like the US, but weapons are weapons and free is free and the Soviets were a bigger problem.

    the only actual reason for justice to be meted out is to disincentivize repeat transgression - so in this case, the compact should face justice if the goal is to stop them from subjugating more species. Since OP argues that they are acting correctly in this ("only safe course for the universe") disincentivizing that kind of behaviour would run directly contrary to OP's take. Thus, I'd say the issue of justice is not accidentally left out, but rather ignored on purpose as it would be unhelpful.

    Now of course Red One might disagree, but that doesn't change the neutral-observer PoV that OP represents. Of course the rampant AI thinks she is right in her actions, everyone always does.

    (Disclaimer: I am not OP, and don't entirely agree with their take, merely continuing the thought process.)

    - u/RynnisOne:
      ```
      Justice is subjective.  The reason the author doesn't go into it is because they'd rather tell a good story than get lost in the swamps of philosophy and interpretations of morality.

      Besides, the assumption is false.  The Compact is provably NOT the only safe course for the universe.  The Principality is equally against AI, and has a different governmental system.  The only difference in power between it and the Compact is that the Compact started several centuries sooner and has been aggressive about conquering other species rather than slowly integrating them.

      The fact that the author also indicated the Compact will get utterly trounced if the Naiads (semi-spoiler, the name alone is meaningless unless you know) decide to migrate through their territory also proves they aren't the best or only option.

  Oh yeah no, there's definitely a side of the story where Red is the villain, a terrorist out for revenge.

  As you get to know more of the history of everything - there's a chapter with a Triarch that covers a lot of the history - you get a lot more sympathy for who everyone *was*, and a lot less for who they *are*.

  I also don't remember Red going after civvies for the sake of it; *everything* feeds into her larger goal. She fakes the torture a lot, and doesn't fake it all the time, but it's basically always for bait and/or psyops.

  She's also kind of stuck. The Compact has absolute control over Rally, and if Red tries to break or help it, they'll kill their hostage.

  Everything else is spoilers :D
  ```

  - u/RynnisOne:
    ```
    That side is mostly perception.  She isn't by any means a terrorist, merely a very well equipped guerilla.

    Of course, the Rally thing is part of that, because that 'hostage' means she can't just go nuts and attack their homeworlds... but also means they can't kill off Rally unless they *want* her to attack their homeworlds.  It's a little Catch 22 that keeps both sides about as honest and honorable as can be, given the setting.

    EDIT:  Note that, in the sequel (Last Angel Ascension) she *VERY MUCH* qualifies as a Terrorist.  My above post refers to the original story.
    ```

    - u/narfanator:
      ```
      She's very rarely used terror tactics on screen, but she uses them occasionally to discourage Compact companies from operating in, I think it was, the Black Veil, and the former human territories.

      And yeah, due to the first story taking place mostly in two location (whatever that original system was, and Sol), not a lot of opportunity for Red to fuck with the Compact.

  Reddit's late announcement of the details API changes, the comically little time provided for developers to adjust to those changes and the handling of the matter afterwards (including the outright libel against the Apollo developer) has been very disappointing to me.

  Given their repeated bad faith behaviour, I do not have any confidence that they will deliver (or maintain!) on the few promises they have made regarding accessibility apps.

  Red's attack of a manufacturing base wasn't an emotional temper tantrum, it was a calculated act of deterrance.  The people who were 'negotiating' with her were doing so in bad faith.  She had to demonstrate that doing so was a bad idea to discourge them from doing so again.   But if you disagree, please provide an example of 'diplomacy' where one side agrees to give up all their resources and then let themselves be executed without any sort of backup mechanic to ensure what they got out of the deal was actually followed through.

  In addition, Diplomacy is a two-way street.  The Principality had plenty of time to attempt to reopen diplomatic channels despite their previous treacherous intent, but chose not to do so.  The 'fault' isn't hers alone. 

  "her fundamental cause is that of a terrorist"
    Uh... sure.  The fundamental cause of a terrorist, a soldier, a politician, and even an athlete are all the same:  Win by defeating the opposition.  This isn't inherently a bad thing.  It's the methods involved.  Incidentally, she qualifies as #2 on this list, because *she makes a point of avoiding pointless civilian casualties*.  A terrorist doesn't.  And no, putting your military base in the middle of (or underneath) a civilian population does not grant you immunity to military retaliation--the use of human shields is immoral.

    I was expecting a reasonable list of grievances.  I did *NOT* expect the ham-handed attempt to cram real-world political commentary into this list of 'thoughts'.  We get it, you hate America.  Good for you.  *IF* you'd like to compare bits of the story to specific historical events, feel free, but if you could avoid comparing it to your idealistically propagandized version of a modern nation, that'd be even better.  I mean, unless you want "in the current state of affairs they are actually in the right" to also apply to your example as well.

    The Compact has no problem against wiping out civilizations that won't bend the knee.  The *only* reason Humanity still exists is due to a series of lucky flukes--*one* group escaped, was lost for centuries, settled and had a disaster they barely survived, and then was eventually "found" by a group of Compact scientists rather than soldiers who sent out the news to the Compact as a whole *before* the soldiers could deal with the problem.  If any of these chance occurrences not actually occurred, they **would** have been wiped out, and this is stated directly by the writer as canon.  It was not the first time the Compact had attempted Xenocide, just one of the few instances where it failed.

    Any reasonable organic lifeform is going to question whether or not a rogue AI is actually harmful to them, not embark on some sort of synthetic Crusade to kill them all.  When said lifeform comes to realize the AI is only harmful to them should they be oppressing humanity in some way, or hindering its goals to destroy the largest and most powerful Empire in known space, they will either choose to fight against it (if they are allied to that Empire) or simply get out of its way.  There's no reason for them to draw the ire of a sapient planet-killing dreadnaught when it wants nothing to do with them and will happily leave them alone.

    Oh, you want to see justified fear for "Neverborn"?  Go read the very first post of the sequel, Last Angel Ascension.  Don't worry, no spoilers, just the little italicized story at the beginning.  That'll show you how AI can be an absolute terror even when done *RIGHT*.

    As for the Compact, yes, their institutionalized racism that only allows slave species to go up X number of bottom 'rungs' of a very large societal ladder is clearly a good, free culture.  So long as you stay in your 'place' that you are told you belong.  Nevermind that this is done in such an Orwellian way that most people either don't realize its happening or--once they've figured it out--realize its off to the gulags for them if they speak up.

    On the whole, Last Angel attempts to make something that would be closest to a Horror movie villain into something relatable, perhaps even letting you understand its motivations and even side with it now and then.  The writer has accomplished this well.  Since I favor the old Asimov-style approach to AI, I don't see sci-fi universes as some modern Mass Effect inspired "race war" of organics VS synthetics that seem so common.  I'm glad this one presents multiple views and approaches, while also being an awesome, detailed story.

    &#x200B;

    Disagree. They gave her the terms and gave her time to consider.  She executed a first strike that achieved nothing. She already had deterrence in the form of her superior technology and firepower. SHe could have simply said "no" and left.   Destroying the manufacturing station was not required to make that point and hurt her cause.   It weakened the Principality's ability to continue to wage war on the Compact and it sets a precedent of hostility that will make future negotiation much more difficult.  Nothing about this helps her, it's a completely irrational move and in fact is evidence to justify the Principality's fears about her unhinged personality.

    Red does NOT avoid civilian casualties, this is a blatant misrepresentation.  She executes several system-wipes - bigger genocides than any in real human history - and there are multiple graphic descriptions of her tearing apart non-coms as they try to flee and reveling in it.  Your characterization of her has flat out wrong.

    &#x200B;

    I am citing real world history and actual events, it has nothing to do with "hating america".  If your patriotism can't stomach facts maybe you should do some soul searching.  The genocide of native americans happened. The trail of tears happened.  The slave trade happened.  Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Dresden happened. CIA interference in banana republics and the Iraq war and Vietnam ALL HAPPENED.

    The author even states specifically in commentary on the forums in several places that he modeled Compact attitudes and propaganda off of American racist thinking during the slave trade.

    My point in mentioning all this was to shock the exact type of thinking you are exhibiting - that the Compact are simply The Bad Guys and killing their civilians is justified because they are racists.   If that were the case you should have a very different attitude toward the US.

    I find it amazing that one moment you can be justifying terrorism as just another means to an end, and the next complaining that I'm criticizing Good Guy America too hard by citing historical events.  By your logic an Afgani terrorist would be perfectly justified in blowing up whole US cities because they contained manufacturing centers used by the US military.

    &#x200B;

    >\> Oh, you want to see justified fear for "Neverborn"? Go read the very first post of the sequel, Last Angel Ascension. Don't worry, no spoilers, just the little italicized story at the beginning. That'll show you how AI can be an absolute terror even when done *RIGHT*.

    &#x200B;

    I'm super confused by this.  You seem to be arguing that AI are a huge threat.  I agree...militarized AI is most likely an existential threat and should be resisted by all possible means.  This is one reason I think an Empire like the Compact could be a reasonable best-case scenario for organic life.  To be clear, no I don't like the facism or racism or xenocide.  The part I'm suggesting is reasonable is their crusade to oppose strong AI in general, on the grounds that the Friendliness problem is hard or impossible to solve, and the best case for the universe is to ensure a self replicating ASI never ever gets off its homeworld.  This mission is important enough that it could be worth massive militarization and colonialism, draconian policy, and even xenocide of races that threatened to create ASI

    If the two options are Compact conquers the galaxy and rogue AI destroys all organic life, I pick the former.

    My attitude isn't "the Compact is Good" or "The US is evil like the Compact".  My point was to show it's more nuanced than simple "villain hero" dynamics the story invites on its surface.

    >\> On the whole, Last Angel attempts to make something that would be closest to a Horror movie villain into something relatable, perhaps even letting you understand its motivations and even side with it now and then.

    I completely agree with your final paragraph.

    The story does a good job of humanizing what is at its root a horror-movie AI villain, and presents characters that are both flawed and justified in their actions and reasoning on all sides.

      > They gave her the terms and gave her time to consider. 

      They also brought a gun to the negotiating table. Their mindkiller was specifically designed to be sneaky and unseen, a surprise weapon to kill her and steal her body. This, rightly pissed her off just a smidgen. 

      I know this is /r/rational  but Red isn't 110% totally rational, shes very human, ironically. She's a character. Could it have been done in a better, less moon-shooty way? Sure. But it wasn't.

      > Red does NOT avoid civilian casualties

      She does sometimes. I don't know how far you are but at (mid-late book 1 spoilers) >!Invidia!< and >!on Bequeathed!< she very much does kill civvies and innocents. System kills are usually reserved for military systems if memory holds, and even then very rarely. But in  a short from book 2 she >!orbital bombs a non-Compact planet but only the military, even though they likely angered her more than the Principality in the previous example.!< And i believe a WOG stated she doesn't intentionally target civilians. In a war collateral is expected. Red may be The Last Angel, but shes not a harp and gift bearing angel, and more the angel of death. 

      A lot of your points and questions are addressed in later WOG's and the story proper. Keep reading, you got some very good scenes coming.
      ```

      - u/ianstlawrence:
        ```
        To support Red not going after civilian targets, its part of why she doesn't go near Rally. The Compact knows, and Red states this, that if they go after Rally she WILL start targeting civilians indiscriminately. There is a bit of a Treaty between the two, with the Compact being able to wipe out Rally and that stopping Red from some actions, namely recruiting large amounts of humans from Rally or other places, and, on the other side, Red has stated that if the Compact ever does wipe out Rally then she will start considering civilian targets to be on the table.

        Therefore I think, we can say that /u/wren42 's assertion in the original text of saying that Red targets civilians is wrong. Although it is true many civilians have died because of Red.

      >SHe could have simply said "no" and left. 

      I disagree. Arguments in good faith and rationality only work when the other party is also operating with the same principles or when there's an "audience" who is. A government in a desperate war can not be relied on to act like a polite party in an argument. Considering they secretly brought the mind-killer to the meeting in the first place there is absolutely no reason to believe they wouldn't continue to do things like that in all future meetings except then they might get clever and succeed. The only way to prevent that is to make any failed attempt carry a very high cost.

      They're still going to work with or in parallel to Red because neither of them have much of a choice, but this was the best and fastest way to ensure that there would be no further attempts at betrayal/assassination.

      >This is an absurd strawman and oversimplification

      While you're right regarding that specific argument, this isn't anything like a conventional war. The Compact threw any kind of protection rules of law/Geneva convention carries when they attempted to commit genocide and destroyed Earth. When one side completely and utterly spits in the face of mercy and any kind of rules of engagement, and the other side is conducting guerrilla warfare and has no benefit from adhering to said rules, things get nasty. There is a reason why people stick to these kinds of rules other than empathy and it's because as long as you don't cross them, the enemy won't either. 

      In a war where one side tries to completely exterminate the other to the point where they hunt fleeing victims and destroy their planets, terrorism stops being a bad thing. You might say that the war is pointless and therefore wrong since Red isn't protecting anything, but the way the war is carried out is entirely justified.

      >Red does NOT avoid civilian casualties

      I'm not sure where this comes up in the story, but she only ever engages military targets. The story goes into why she completely destroyed some places and...well maybe it's not justified but it's understandable.

      >By your logic an Afgani terrorist would be perfectly justified in blowing up whole US cities because they contained manufacturing centers used by the US military.

      The problem is that the US military hasn't actually comitted anything even close to what the Compact did and the Al-Qaeda/ISIS forces are only doing less monstrous things than Red because they lack the ability. A better example would be: "during the first Rwandan genocide, would it be okay for a Tutsi fighter to blow up a Hutu military building with a bunch of civilians near it?" My answer to that question is, I have no idea. I'd like to say no but...I honestly can't imagine myself in that situation. All I can say is that even then there is no comparing what happened in Rwanda to what the Compact did because it pales in comparison.

        Do you know what Deterrence *IS*?  Having something isn't deterrance.  Having something and *being willing to use it* is.  They decided to negotiate in bad faith, expecting her to either commit suicide and give them her resources and knowledge, or they were planning on killing her and taking it.  If she just left and did *nothing*, they would simply try it again and again--because there is no penalty to do so.

      She showed them that it was a *really* bad idea.  And yes, it resulted in them having worse odds against the Compact than when they started, further pushing them to not mess with her in the future.  It set a nice precedent for them:  Negotiate in good faith or be punished.

      > This is an absurd strawman and oversimplification. The four things above are obviously not equivalent.

        You need to read up on what a strawman is.  I did not make a false argument in your stead and tear it down.  I pointed out the obvious similarities and the *fact* that different categories of people can have the same cause.  The important bit is *HOW* they go about accomplishing that cause.  The athlete (in theory) does so in an honorable fashion without harming his opponent, the soldier does it in an honorable fashion while harming his opponent, the politician does it in dishonorable fashion whilst not harming his opponent, and the terrorist does it in a dishonorable fashion while harming his opponent.

      > Red does NOT avoid civilian casualties, this is a blatant misrepresentation.

        Reading comprehension fail.  I said she makes a point of avoiding **pointless** civilian casualties.  If civilians happen to be in the area of a military operation, they're going to be collateral damage.  You *DID* read my part about human shields being immoral, yes?

      > She executes several system-wipes - bigger genocides than any in real human history 

        Mass death by collateral damage is not a genocide.  No race or species is wiped out.  There is a distribution of various species well represented throughout the Compact.  
        Please stop misusing simple terms.

      > and there are multiple graphic descriptions of her tearing apart non-coms as they try to flee and reveling in it

        Again, ones who are part of the military operation.  Also, she is a *warship*, as she points out repeatedly.  She enjoys defeating her opponents.  But if you want to prove your case, by all means, link to a section where she goes out and kills civilians willy-nilly and cackles about it, showing no remorse or not using it as part of a greater plan to stop the military's advance.  The only instance that comes close are the various mining operations set up in former Confederate space--mining operations which go toward supplying the construction of warships.

      > I am citing real world history and actual events

        You are citing events and infusing them with your *extremely* biased interpretation.  My patriotism is just fine, but again, thanks for trying to spin it as something weak or bad.  The fact that you're doing in this reply the *exact same thing* I called you out on in your original post is rather remarkable.

      > The genocide of native americans happened. 

        Genocide is intentional.  Conflicts between the colonies and NUMEROUS tribes which also fought each other doesn't really qualify as 'genocide'.  The only way it's close is if you scale back the window to count centuries, and then lump vastly disparate groups into two seperate sides and *then* assume ill intent by one to cause the elimination of the other.  At one point there were higher-ups in the Army that specifically wanted to eradicate certain Plains tribes, as said tribes were of the 'raiding' variety.  That was intentional genocide, motivated by racism, and was obviously bad, but assuming that was typical of the entire nation and its people is folly.

      > The trail of tears happened. 

        Yep.  This one is a legitimate thing, because some politicians were greedy for land.  The fact that it was done even to allied Tribes was particularly shitty.  Is this the fault of the nation as a whole, or a thing that later generations should feel guilty about?

      > The slave trade happened.

        You mean the one that had been going on for hundreds of years in Africa and Asia prior, or are you focusing on the one particular part of a particular trade that was equal parts guilt in the native lands, the European shipping industry, and the American colonies?  Because I'm sure you're *not* wanting to go into detail as to the slave trade that happened during and after in the lands to the other direction.

      > Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Dresden happened.

        All military goals in a situation a step away from total war.  The former two were calculated attacks to stop what was perceived to be a better option than millions of deaths (purple hearts still given out today were MADE back in WWII in anticipation of the massive casualties the US military was expecting if they invaded the mainland).  Atrocities of all sorts were committed by all sides, but you seem to have a particular hate-on for only one nation.  I wonder why.

      > CIA interference in banana republics and the Iraq war and Vietnam ALL HAPPENED.

        Yes, and KGB interference in socialist 'revolutions' and Russian and Chinese interference in Vietnam and Korea also ALL HAPPENED.  Good for you.
        BTW:  Equating the actions of an agency that keeps its motives and methods separate and secret from the nation's populace at large is hardly the fault of that nation or its populace.  Especially when it has actively acted against the nation that it is supposed to serve.  They had an important purpose back when the Cold War was raging, but they should have been divided up and portioned off to other agencies after.

      > the Compact are simply The Bad Guys and killing their civilians is justified because they are racists. If that were the case you should have a very different attitude toward the US.

        Why would I have that attitude?  First, I've been arguing that she doesn't kill random civvies for no reason.  Second, the US fought against itself to stop that very thing, and ended it at the cost of their own blood, and later with laws--something the Compact will *NEVER* do.

      > that one moment you can be justifying terrorism as just another means to an end, and the next complaining that I'm criticizing Good Guy America too hard by citing historical events. 

        Now **YOU** are pulling out the Strawmen.  I've shown how it isn't terrorism, but *you* claim that I'm the one justifying terrorism--How about you *show* how it's actually terrorism first, hey?  Because you haven't yet.
        In addition, I didn't say you were criticizing them too hard, I simply called you out on your obvious bias.  At least own it rather than trying to refute arguments nobody has made.

      > By your logic an Afgani terrorist would be perfectly justified in blowing up whole US cities because they contained manufacturing centers used by the US military.

        This sentence shows you have no clue what a terrorist is, nor how civilized warfare is conducted.  Go look up what makes the difference between a soldier and a terrorist, because apparently you don't grasp that little detail.

      > You seem to be arguing that AI are a huge threat

        I didn't say they are all a huge threat.  I said how they can be a *terror* even when done right.

      > militarized AI is most likely an existential threat and should be resisted by all possible means. This is one reason I think an Empire like the Compact could be a reasonable best-case scenario for organic life.

        Yeah, and to me, that seems like an organic/synthetic form of racism, as shown terribly in the Mass Effect series, a series which has *actual examples* of organics and synthetics getting along while beating the drum that one can only exist at the cost of the other.  This series has a good example too, in the form of Red and humanity.  The short version is, once the Compact is done and no un-invited aliens enter Confederate space, Red will no longer be killing anyone.  She has a VERY specific defined goal, and so long as that isn't threatened, she isn't a threat.

      > If the two options are Compact conquers the galaxy and rogue AI destroys all organic life, I pick the former.

       But, see, you've already put yourself in a false dichotomy.  Functionally, you have strawmanned *yourself* by assuming the argument has only two answers.

      > My point was to show it's more nuanced than simple "villain hero" dynamics the story invites on its surface.

        Then why is your attitude on AI so (pardon the pun) incredibly binary?  Why does nuance not apply to your example?

        > There is lots of rancor. You brought it with you.

        Um, not engaging with the particular arguments here, but no - the tone of the OP and his reply is completely different to yours. OP has been reliably addressing the content of the arguments; your posts are full of personal implication, which makes then much harder to engage with.

        I expect you know that, but in the unlikely case that the 'you brought the rancor' comment was ingenuous, I figured I'd let you know.

  I get annoyed by stories that are blatantly trying to hit (tribal) anger buttons, and the portrayal of AI and aliens as humans in suits doesn't help. It's well written mechanically, but to me just came off as a low effort project with little character development or overarching story, and emotional investment coming from trying to make the audience mad rather than any investment in the characters. I got through the first book, but was pretty "meh" about it after the point where Red was repaired. After that the only good part was worldbuilding, and that wasn't enough to get me to read the sequel.





  The fact that it' published on SB should explain the readership.





  I should point out that the Compact is basically a fascist class system, they are pretty bad.

    The rubber forehead alien thing irked me too (especially when they were classifying extraterrestrial species using Terran taxonomic terms).

    Another complaint:  I can't remember a single human character that hasn't been white and Anglo-Saxon, other than Captain Sudoki in the prologue.  Nearly every cultural reference has been from Western Europe or the US.  The whole population of the Earth worked together to build three warships... and they all get names from Greek mythology.

    With Kursk, we're being exposed to some more variety of names from different human cultures, but those were chosen by Red One; does no one else remember that there were cultures on Earth that didn't speak English?

    One of the biggest advantages written fiction has over visual storytelling (like TV or movies) is that you can depict anything that can be imagined.  You're not limited to having bipedal, four-limbed, sexually reproducing beings with bilateral symmetry.  And you're certainly not limited to drawing from one culture of humans.  That the author has so chosen to limit himself (except for the Naiads; they're cool) is disappointing.
