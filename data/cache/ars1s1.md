  Anyone else surprised by how straightforward the angel was? You'd usually expect some mystical mumbo jumbo and talking in circles, but nope, this one actually answered in full sentences and was coherent.
  ```

  - u/NZPIEFACE:
    ```
    Yeah well, they already had a massive legal document to fuck em over.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Yeah, if I had any criticism of this amazing ~~fanfic~~ rationalist fiction it would be that the tone and speaking style (even down to the slang used) of most characters when they speak is fairly similar. It helps deliver rational dialogue however when people speak plainly, so I appreciate it for that, and maybe it's something unavoidable with rational fictions in general, but it's more noticeable here, at least for me. I still very much enjoy it though!
    ```

    - u/-Fender-:
      ```
      What struck me was how Quatach Ich used the same types of sentences and expressions as Raynie.

      Also, I laughed when the angel said "Heavens no!" That's basically the equivalent of citizens of the United States using "America no!" as a common expression.

        To be fair, the angel probably has some divine ability to just know the language and dialect of whoever they're talking to. When I hear "heavens, no" I just hear a generic curse and don't actually think about heaven. It's just part of the language.

        QI is a different story.

        You’re right I meant to say rationalist fiction, been reading a bit too much of both recently

  > Zach sent Zorian an almost imperceptible frown. He clearly didn’t understand why Zorian was so certain, but didn’t want to call him on it.

  >Zorian didn’t blame him. He had long had his suspicions, but it was only when he saw the true form of Zach’s angelic contract that he became completely certain…


  I wonder what Zorian saw in the contract that made him so certain RR wasn't Veyers. Is it because Jornak is a lawyer and it's a contract? I just don't see a connection other than that...
  ```

  - u/therealflinchy:
    ```
    That was my guess, jornak could actually understand the contract
    ```

    - u/Fearless_Chair:
      ```
      As I understood it Zach never even saw the contract, nor did he have any access to it. So if they never had the contract to begin with, what would there be for Jornak to understand? Nor did I get impression that the contract was somehow imprinted into the marker, and it's not like they could summon an angel to show it to them while inside the loop. So all Zach really had to go on would be the summarised version given to him in the dream, which didn't seem like something that would require a lawyer.
      ```

  - u/TristanTheViking:
    ```
    "Subsection 43, clause 11B: Also don't interact too much with any lawyers, because they invariably turn evil once discovering the time loop."
    ```

    - u/Tommy2255:
      ```
      That's how he escaped the time loop! Soul magic can't detect someone who doesn't have a soul. As far as the gate guard was concerned, he didn't even count.
      ```

    - u/archpawn:
      ```
      "Source: Am evil."
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    When the Angels have set up a Contract, their opponents must logically be demon lawyers. 

    Man, I'm getting some heavy Pact vibes here.
    ```

  - u/I-want-pulao:
    ```
    Well, we need some cliffhangers! Can't have everything solved just now. We'll get the contract next chapter.
    ```

    - u/exceptioncause:
      ```
      Next chapters! The contract is long, it can't fit single chapter.
      ```

  - u/hallo_friendos:
    ```
    I'm guessing there was a clause saying Zach wasn't allowed to soulkill anyone while in the time loop. This would make it much more difficult, if not impossible, for Veyers to end up soulkilled if he was Red Robe.
    ```

- u/I-want-pulao:
  ```
  Well. Angels aren't as big of dicks as we expected. Still dicks though. If they say there's a way out, then there's gotta be a way out somehow. 

  RR revelation - well. Made the most sense, we knew this was the most likely outcome since Zach exited the loop.

  One final battle eh.... The stakes just keep getting higher and higher. I'm loving it.
  ```

  - u/Chrono_Nexus:
    ```
    I'm fairly certain that the way out is to be "dead" at the deadline. It might seem too simple, but if Zach is inside a black room when the contract checks for death, he might be able to avoid it.
    ```

    - u/turtleswamp:
      ```
      Seems reasonable.

      The angel did imply it could be done, and did let slip both that the angels lack information on what happened inside the time loop, and that the time loop is similar to a black room in that both isolate the contents from the universe (something Z&Z already knew but the angel provided conformation, and if they hadn't known they would now). The missing piece is whether the mechnism that would kill Zack is built into the blessing/contract itself or is something that uses the blessing/contract as a marker and has to search creation for the marker to act on it. 

      &#x200B;

      That's enough missing information the angel didn't tell them how to evade the auto-kill, but also provided the black room trick would work, not necessarily a piece of information they need to be sure of in order to try.
      ```

      - u/Fearless_Chair:
        ```
        I'd assume the kill mechanism is built-in. It might even make him attempt to commit suicide if he isn't dead after the mechanism activates, just as an extra fail-safe in case he survives it somehow. I can't imagine a black room to be the solution.

        &#x200B;

        I think they have to either find a loophole so that the contract is technically fulfilled or make the contract/marker be inactive at the time of the deadline. I'm not sure how they would accomplish either, but just spitballing here: They could just kill Zach near the end and let him be absorbed into the giant soulbattery, then extract his soul and put it into one of Zorian's golem bodies after the deadline. This way he would be "dead" at the deadline anyway, probably voiding the contract. This is probably not an easy thing to do, but it might be possible.

        &#x200B;

        But tbh I think the real solution (if there is one) might be simpler than that.
        ```

        - u/CreationBlues:
          ```
          If the black room counts as the "universe," then is zach is the only one in it then the contract is technically fulfilled. Either the outside world can't activate it or the marker looks and can't find anyone that would violite the contract.
          ```

  - u/p3t3r133:
    ```
    The only other person we know of with an angelic contract is IQ. Hes not exactly alive. I wonder if he became a lich to get out of his contract and keep his mana reserve. Not saying Zach is going to become a lich, but maybe temporarily dead. 

    Or he just dies in the final battle, but they are able to resuscitate him.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Tbf, they didn't make the contract it seems. Only the gods can make those, and the angels just picked one to give to Zach.
    ```

    - u/I-want-pulao:
      ```
      Still can't believe dream agreement is a valid method of consent in this universe......

      &#x200B;

      &#x200B;
      ```

      - u/braiam:
        ```
        Well, the ethics committee agreed to it, so what is the issue?
        ```

        - u/VivaLaPandaReddit:
          ```
          If it passes ARB review it's all good. Just make sure you take the official training classes.
          ```

        - u/TrebarTilonai:
          ```
          I'm... not sure they did, actually. The angel implied they were running some sketchy behavior. "Our current interference is already overstepping certain boundaries that we would rather not cross. It would have been best for everybody if nobody had realized our involvement." There's a lot of that in the conversation.  The whole thing seemed to boil down to "If you successfully complete the quest, we will look the other way but if anyone finds out we screwed up, we're going to wipe everybody out to cover our tracks"
          ```

    - u/Ardvarkeating101:
      ```
      No, they said they had to run it by the ethics committee, so it's likely they have a divine contract printer artifact that they insert the contract into and that makes it with divine magic.
      ```

      - u/abnotwhmoanny:
        ```
        Yeah, they said they couldn't change it or destroy it, not that they didn't make the terms in the first place. For that matter an old contract laying around that was that specifically tailored to that situation would be pretty crazy, even for the gods.
        ```

        - u/Tommy2255:
          ```
          Well, we don't really know how "gone" the gods are exactly, we just know that they haven't been talking to mortals for a while. They could still be around writing contracts.

          Although my personal theory is that the "real world" is also a simulation just like the loop was, just slightly larger to contain the angels as well. We don't hear from the gods because the universe is in safe mode. I don't really have enough evidence to back this up, but there have been few if any other theories about where the gods are. If that's the case, there could be interference from whichever god is hosting the simulation, just as we saw in the time loop.
          ```

          - u/abnotwhmoanny:
            ```
            Well, what do you mean by "simulation" exactly? The loop was certainly a reproduction, but it wasn't fake in any way. Every atom in it was real and every creature in it was a full fleshy living thinking creature. Technically every loop ending was a catastrophe of incomparable proportions.  


            Are you saying the gods still exist in a "real world" and that the world the main characters live in is a reproduction. Or are you saying that the world of the characters is not physically real?
            ```

    - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
      ```
      The angels could have written the terms of the contract and then used something left by the gods to create it.
      ```

  - u/Sonderjye:
    ```
    I actually think they were fairly reasonable. Zach screwed up his agreement and enabled a copy (it was established that the time loop people weren't considered independent people until after more than 1 month) to murder it's original. They are willing to hunt him down if he finds a way to cheat on the deal and are willing to give him some leniency if he does what they want.
    ```

  - u/kaukamieli:
    ```
    They never said there is a way out. They even agreed when Zach said he has to do an impossible task.

    They just said Zach is clear _if_ he manages to dodge the judgement.
    ```

    - u/I-want-pulao:
      ```
      They said next to impossible, so not impossible exactly. And their hands are tied and they work in mysterious ways, so I'm a glass half full kinda guy here.
      ```

      - u/kaukamieli:
        ```
        I mean, sure, they'll get it done. This story doesn't feel like a lot of good guys would be dying.

        I'm just saying they never said there is a way out.
        ```

        - u/I-want-pulao:
          ```
          Personally I think one of Alanic or Xvim is gonna die. My money's on Alanic.
          ```

        - u/abnotwhmoanny:
          ```
          I mean, less than ten chapters ago a whole boat load of good guys died. Like, they were real and now they're dead. From a storytelling perspective the characters are still around, so it amounts to the same thing as them not being dead, but they definitely were good guys and they definitely were dying.
          ```

    - u/Ozryela:
      ```
      The angel said: "The only thing I can promise you is that if you find the way to remove or evade the contract in some fashion, we will not seek to punish you for it."

      Note the phrasing. 'find the way' not 'find a way'. So yes, the angel said there is a way out.

  The worldbuilding implications are great in this chapter. The Gods were just bored programmers. The angels are the eldritch monstrosities that the abrahamic religions depicted them as. 

  Good to see the reveal of Jornak. Everyone's theories can be laid to rest now (or can they?) 

  I like how they were given an S-TIER SUMMON for the final battle—really hits that final fantasy sweet spot for me.

  Does anyone remember who Oganj is?

  - u/I-want-pulao:
    ```
    The dragon Zach tried to kill on his lonesome all those restarts. Also, that was the news that finally made Zorian tell Kael and Taiven and Kirielle about it, and that allowed Spear of Resolve to find everything out... Honestly, nobody103 does a great job with conservation of characters :D

    Yeah, it was pretty obvious it was Jornak once Zach exited the loop and everyone else (Silverlake and Zorian) came out as their pre-loop selves.

        Hahah maybe Fortov is just a dick? OR Zorian, as much growing up he did, could never really  forgive and forget Fortov.

            My favourite! I mean it can still happen.... But RR certainly spoke from the heart and Fortov has no bone to pick with the academy or anyone really (apart from Daimen and Ibery I guess), he's just too lazy.

            I hope the way Daimen!RR stopped after we met Daimen, we can stop the Fortov!RR after we've met RR.

            - u/Ardvarkeating101:
              ```
              It’ll stop when we meet Fortov!

                ```

                ```

  - u/archaeonaga:
    ```
    >(or can they?)

    Heh. Worth pointing out that RR doesn’t reveal his identity until after Zorian says the name, and if he wore one fake face, what would stop him from wearing a second? 

    And unless RR reveals that Zach had already solved the invasion and knew the way out of the loop when they first interacted in the loop, how did RR get into the loop if Zach literally never knew how the loop worked? How does Zach give him a temporary marker? How does Jornak even have time to learn enough to get to the gate and meet Panaxeth? These things are a problem no matter who RR is, of course. 

    All that said, Zorian openly doubts it’s anyone other than Jornak, and it’s not really clear why RR would pretend to be someone else at this point. Maybe Zorian!RR would want to as part of some bizarre contract-avoidance scheme (he plans on occupying the body of whichever Zorian wins), but that’s more a little nutty. 

    I suppose we’ll find out when we see how this conversation ends. It would be pretty funny if this was Yet Another Fake Reveal though!
    ```

    - u/therealflinchy:
      ```
      Probably because who it is, is fairly irrelevant, more what they're going to do.
      ```

      - u/archaeonaga:
        ```
        When you spend over half of a novel treating the villain’s real identity as a central mystery to the plot, with thousands of words spent on the investigation, who it is ought to feel relevant. 

        The fact that things are playing out just as Zorian expected is typical of rationalist fiction, a genre that more or less has its roots in “all according to keikaku.” And, admittedly, what nobody103 does particularly well is setting up difficult problems for Zorian to solve, which is definitely the case here. As I’ve said elsewhere, the worst you can say about the underwhelming RR identity is that it’s inelegant from a mystery standpoint, and even that’s a matter of taste.
        ```

        - u/therealflinchy:
          ```
          Yeah, I'm not upset, it was a reveal that was gonna go either way, horribly cliche and campy (royalty), or very rationally and logically like this lol

- u/Mingablo:
  ```
  If the angel said that they would kill anyone who knew about the time loop or made it out during the scorched earth response, assuming that Panaxeth was released, does that mean that they'll kill silverlake, QI, and Jornak as well. The angels sound like they know what they're doing so even if the primordial offers them its protection, which it probably wouldn't want to do anyway, wouldn't they die. This whole situation looks like a loose-loose for those 3. If ZZ stop Panaxeth then they have lost. If Panaxeth gets out then the angels kill them. RR might get a very large portion of the world destroyed but I doubt even he would count that as a win. There's no reason for them to believe ZZ if they tell them what the angel said but that sort of thing sounds to me like a narrative patch job.
  ```

  - u/Caliburn0:
    ```
    I mean, the antagonist don't know that the angels are after them, and they wouldn't have been either, if Zach and Zorian didn't give the Angels a detailed report of what happened in the time-loop. And since RR, Silverlake, and QI has no way of knowing Z&Z contacted the angels...
    ```

    - u/Watchful1:
      ```
      And it's not like RR and Silverlake have a choice. They made the contract with Panaxeth to release him so they die anyway if they don't.
      ```

- u/sambelulek:
  ```
  "Keh-khe-khe, you thought that threat would stifle us?" 

  Zorian let out a pained laugh hearing what's Jornak had been said. If only he knew how irrelevant that plan was. He then turned his sight toward Quatach Ichl who hasn't let out a sound so far. 

  "Props to you, Sir Lich, your decision to raze the church turn out to be correct. Not only the angels will involve themselves, they also already had plan to descend. As for your expectation that they just leave after disposing the primordial? That, I found, to be woefully misguided."

  If Quatach Ichl was surprised to be suddenly addressed, he did not show it. The fact that he did not readily respond actually helped Zorian prepare a wedge he's about to drive in.

  "Tell me, Mr Merenptah, did I need to tell the angels anything about my scheme, your scheme, and these two clowns' schemes to know what they're going to do? Nay! The angle saw through me, Mr Merenptah, right at the moment our eyes met. Not a single word I need to utter before they reached their decision. It would be wise for you to retreat right now rather than later. The moment the Primordial get released, there'll be no war breaking out for you to take advantage of."

  Zorian was never a man with flair for acting, but knowing what will happen helped him let lies went through his teeth. True that Zorian had told celestial tree trunks what and what will happen from his perspective, but it didn't help him to his cause. The angels cannot bend their contract after all. However, since he knew what about to go down, that inflexibility should not help their enemies either.
  ```

- u/I-want-pulao:
  ```
  If there's a way out for Zach, that means there might be a way out for Silverlake (RR is just a dick, he wants what he wants, Silverlake's an opportunist). I wonder if they can get her trust that way - however, I'm sure the loophole would involve some sort of soul magic and I highly doubt SL would allow ZnZ easy access to her soul.
  ```

  - u/XellosPY:
    ```
    I'm kinda surprised Zorian didn't think about asking the Angels about that. If they can get the bad guys out of their deal with the Primordial, there's a chance they can turn them or at least make them neutral. RR probably would most likely still be an enemy, but Silverlake will probably just fuck off and do her own thing if she got that deal
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Maybe they could just pull the same thing as in the timeloop. Break open the cage and have that fulfill Silverlake's contract, but then immediately put it back to fulfill Zach's contract. And then finally just wipe out everyone's memories of the timeloop, but package in a way that they still keep all of the knowledge of everything else.

        ```

      - u/None:

        Considering that the way they opened the cage in the time loop didn't set something off, it should still work.

            The angels aren't the ones who sense the cage breaking and respond to it. It's the cage itself. Considering they've been broken at least a few hundred times, it'll be ok to break it again as long as the primordial isn't technically in the world.

                Sorry, I meant it was the core of the world. Either way, the triggers are in this world, since if they were in another dimension, the real world would already be in flames since the cage in the time loop and the real world are the same thing and the primordal has nearly broken out hundreds of times.

                    ```
                    Yes, but it seems like the time loop is extremely dedicated to getting things functionally accurate. The primordal cage is still connected to the time loop despite there being no reason for it to be there and the angels didn't specifically put it there since they have no idea how to use the SG.
                    ```

          Key phrase being in the time loop. It wasn't a true escape.
          ```

          - u/None:
            ```
            The time loop was a perfect recreation. It would have the same contingencies as the real world. The only reason the time loop ends when the primordal is out is because it'd be a waste of resources. Functionally the scorched earth policy has the same trigger as the reset.

                One of the things about the loop is that it restarted if the primordal ever got. There's no reason for this to be a condition unless activating the contingencies was too expensive in divine power to recreate constantly. As a result, the restart is like a simulation to functionally recreate the results of the contingencies without wasting divine energy. When Z&Z broke open the cage, they placed it in layers of pocket dimensions in order not to trigger the reset. Functionally, those layers could be used to prevent the contingencies from tripping.

              If what you say is true, it is desirable to release Px into the time loop and just allow it to collapse onto itself. I suggested something like that could happen on https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ars1s1/rt_hf_mother_of_learning_chapter_96_contract/egphu98/

                  Yeah, but the angels wouldn't have to go out of its way to prevent it from happening at all, unless they don't know a iota of how the SG works.
                  ```

  - u/shinghand:
    ```
    I just thought of a loophole that involves mindwiping.

    Zorian asked the angel about what constitutes "knowing about the time loop". He also confirmed that Zach won't kill him if Zach doesn't know that Zorian is a master mind mage.

    Maybe Zorian will make Zach forget that Zorian is a mind mage, and Zach will erase Zorian's knowledge of the time loop (according to the contract). Once it's safe, Zorian can remove any memory wipes.
    ```

- u/TheBobulus:
  ```
  Facts we know:

  * Some parts of the contract are enforced by Zach's perceptions. If he doesn't know who is fucking with his memories, he won't go after them.
  * Black rooms / time loops prevent the divine from peeking in.
  * The contract, whether Zach dies or not, ends at the end of the month.

  &#x200B;

  So here's my guess how Zorian is going to 'cheat' the contract: After they prevent the summoning (fulfilling the bits of the contract the Angels seem to 'care' about), they go down into the Black Room underneath town.  Inside, they have a month of free time while a small amount of time (I think it was a day?) passes outside. Crucially, have this day span the end of the contract. Inside, Zorian erases Zach's knowledge of who knows about the time loop, his knowledge of Zorian knowing mind magic, and his memory of being tampered with.

  Basically, my thinking is the trigger for the 'kill Zach' clause can only come from two sources: the Angels or Zach himself. If you block both at the same time, then the contract is done with, and once you emerge from the Black Room, Zach is fine. For extra insurance, Zorian lies to Zach and tells him that it was going into the Black Room that solved the problem, so that he doesn't even suspect that any memory altering took place.

  Of course, all this depends on them actually preventing the summoning, but they were already planning for that, so the stakes are still the same.

  Incidentally, the fact that the contract that Silverlake is under works even if the summoning fails (and thus she's in a different dimension that the contract holder) suggests she's also self-triggering. Maybe you could convince her to switch sides with that knowledge?
  ```

  - u/Crotchfirefly:

    Not sure what nobody's take on romance in this story is but I saw Raynie as the likely candidate once outside of the time loop.

Plus, when Zorian saw that he was becoming close to Raynie he decided he was going to stop doing so with her while he could abuse the time loop and I believe he ended the relationship while thinking that he wished he could help her situation. So I'm half-expecting some developments in regards to that though it would be kind of silly considering the impending doom hanging over their heads.

    - u/hallo_friendos:

      I doubt Zorian is going to purposely seek out romance, even if he does have time for it, just because he knows how badly it could complicate matters. And Raynie's trying her hardest to remain unentangled too. Zach, on the other hand... well, who knows.

        If some romance plot line is included, which I think probably won't be, it wouldn't really be Zorian purposely looking for it. Whether it is Raynie, Taiven, or anyone else, if he runs into them he has to treat them in regards to the relationship he wants to have with them. 


        This is now real life with no loops so if he is interested in someone, he can't just completely spurn any interaction with them or be a dick to them for practicality's sake since he is now playing for keeps. Not to say he will be going up to them carrying flowers but if someone approaches him and asks to meet or anything else, he will have to consider whether he wants to ruin the relationship by rejecting.

        I think it's unfair to Zorian to say he only became a good person because of the soul blending. He risked his life to save Zach's in the very first loop. He was surly sure, and he definitely had the potential to go down a bad path, but he wasn't a bad person. I think the soul bond had very little influence on his personality and it was more Zach's commentary on him that forced himself to reevaluate after he realized how others saw him.

            A -> B, and C -> B does not mean B -> C. If you find Qi to be bad, and psychopath to be bad then that does not mean Qi is a psychopath. Evidence of Qi being bad is not evidence of him being a psychopath.  



            Qi may be harsh, may be vicious, may have outdated sentimentalities, but he has shown traits like caring about his people that make psychopath not quite what he is.

  Welp! 

  I did a lot of RR theory reading when I was developing my own wrong idea; I can say pretty confidently that few people had Jornak as their first guess. I’m at least joined by many other people in being super duper wrong.

  For good reason, imo. Van Dine and Knox alike would be aghast at this as the solution to a mystery—the culprit wasn’t introduced until well into the second act, breaking what’s probably the cardinal rule of mystery writing. MoL isn’t a mystery, but those rules exist for a good reason: a story that hides the identity of a character should make that feel consequential. 

  Jornak just doesn’t feel like a big deal. The fact that he’s RR doesn’t meaningfully change the stakes of the story or have an impact on the protagonists. In fact, if we had known all along that Jornak was RR (say, he didn’t bother putting up his hood in Chapter 26, and Zorian recognized him when they investigated Veyers later), it wouldn’t have made much of a difference to the plot. 

  None of which is meant as a damning critique of MoL, I should add. It’s just a bit underwhelming after all the debate and consideration, it’s the second person Z&Z would’ve investigated if Silverlake hadn’t warned Jornak that they had discovered Veyers in the loop.

  But now there are no mysteries, and I’m pretty sure all the outstanding issues have been addressed. All that remains to be seen is how our heroes will be victorious, and on that score, I remain very much invested and excited, especially because all the other twists this chapter (the angel! the dragon!) are so juicy. It’s shaping up to be an exciting ending.
  ```

  - u/tjhance:

    I think it's interesting to think about the challenges of writing a solid mystery setup-reveal in a rational story of this nature.

    Zorian is very intelligent. He always makes the obvious logical leaps. Furthermore, the story is entirely from Zorian's POV. If we (the readers) have the information to deduce who RR is, then Zorian does too, and he'll probably figure it out. In this case, there were several plausible candidates (Veyers, Jornak, Sudomir) but without the full picture it was impossible to guess who, especially without knowing what sort of person Jornak would become when exposed to the time loop.*

    What's the solution to this? How does one make a mystery in a rational story than the protagonist doesn't crack open as soon as the readers have everything they need? (As I'm trying to write my own story with smart protagonists and mystery elements, this something I have to think about.)

    One solution is to make the solution solvable using Doylist reasoning and Themes. If you think about it, all the plausible solutions fell into two camps. Watsonian-reasonable answers (Veyers, Jornak, Sudomir) and Doylist-reasonable thematic answers (Zach simulacrum, Fortov, Daimen (he was a popular guess before he showed up in-story, I think?)). Zorian had basically no way of guessing any of those latter possibilities, especially since most of them required some apparent rule of the story to be broken (which was definitely possible, since Zorian was learning new things about the nature of the time-loop and recontextualizing things all the time) but they were still possible for the audience to guess.

    (I'm sure reasonable people will disagree on the extent to which the latter type of mystery has a place in rational fic.)

    Anyway, I think since it went the less-thematic route, it feels less narratively satisfying. To be fair, it *does* work very well on the logical level.
    "RR has some relation to Veyers but is not Veyers, and also Veyers interacts with Zach near the beginning and would notice Jornak acting oddly" seems so obvious in retrospect that you almost feel dumb. This is a key ingredient of a great mystery reveal, yet somehow it still lacks a punch. (Although, again, some people might argue that it's rational to feel obvious and anti-climactic.)
    So it's not obvious what the author should have differently to give it more punch. Presumably, he was planning RR=Jornak from the beginning and he misfired in the setup, either by not anticipating the degree of importance that the fandom would place on the RR mystery, or by not making Jornak stand out enough.

    (\*) TBH, "The Jornak that Zorian had known was a nervous, risk-averse man [...] This was just one more proof that the time loop was capable of radically changing a person. For better or for worse." is a bit of a cop-out. A *little* bit of foreshadowing of what sort of man Jornak could have become would be nice.

    [2 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a7vk5w/mother_of_learning_who_is_red_robe/ec63iru) I felt it was more and more popular that Jornak was RR. So it's been coming for a while.. You're right that it breaks the classic rules, but plays on that trope that someone we know IS the villain. And as time went on, we learnt about Zach's inheritance, and as we learnt more about the society of Altazia... Jornak's inclusion starts making more sense. Plus, Veyers was set up from the very beginning so it was I think that counts a little!

    Well, it first shows the good nature of Zach. Zach's inheritance was stolen too, but he didn't use this opportunity to destroy the city and the government. Jornak just shows you what is possible.

    I dunno, I still want to know what Ibery's deal is, lol. And also the headmaster. Plus, Alanic's background. But yeah, the main issue was RR. And as ZnZ became so strong, RR was just not strong enough to matter. He needed Silverlake's information to understand how exactly he's fucked, and QI to back him up. So Jornak hasn't been the issue for a while now. It's the combination of what SL, QI, and RR will do that's the key.

  I was disappointed that the chapter ended so abruptly. It does not seem like that conversation was over, and yet I suspect the next chapter will not begin with the conversation continuing.

  Zach and Zorian still need to bring up a couple points. One is to determine just how insane and/or bloodthirsty Jornak really is. Is he bluffing about triggering the wraith bombs and assassinating people around the world if Zach and Zorian continue fighting before the end of the month? If Jornak really wants to improve the world (rather than just lying to advance his selfish desires), then that much destruction does not seem reasonable. Which would prove Jornak either insane or lying about his goals. Or bluffing if he would not really do it.

  Which leads to the additional point that they needed to bring up. QI and Silverlake seem to think that releasing Pan will not be such a terrible thing for the world, and they likely have influenced Jornak's views on that subject. But Zach and Zorian know that releasing Pan would result in some "scorched Earth" countermeasures which are likely to be unacceptable even by QI's standards.

  Even if Zach and Zorian cannot convince them of how bad it would be, they could at least persuade them that *they* believe it would be that bad, in fact worse than what Jornak is threatening. In which case there is little reason for them to accept Jornak's deal (unless they are very confident they can win the final battle, which I do not think they are as things currently stand). Which could at least allow them to negotiate something more in favor of Zach and Zorian.

    Zorian just needs to mention that an angel promised to kill him in passing if the primordial is released. Once SL and RR learn that they'll both die anyways if angels become involved simply as a method for them to limit the effects of the time loop on the real world, they might not be so eager to go on with the plan. But somehow I doubt that this is where u/nobody103 planned to lead the conversation.

        Depends on the author, and depends on his mood at the time. Up to him to consider it however he wishes, really. In the past, a "ping" like this made him realize a plothole, which he then tried to correct in a later chapter. (Specifically, it was in the first restart that Z&Z interacted with Daimen, before they found the Bakora Gate. Z&Z went in a time dilation chamber, which meant that their simulacrums disappeared, and they theoretically had lost their method of travel to Koth. In a later chapter, after it was brought to his attention, the author decided to include a paragraph about how Zorian had taught Daimen the Gate spell beforehand.)

        If Zorian *doesn't* bring up that tidbit of his conversation with an angel (and I'd be surprised if RR and Quatach's agents didn't already know that they went to a temple to communicate with an angel), then I'd be curious to know why. Whatever the author does with this comment of mine is entirely up to him.
        ```

    - u/morgf:
      ```
      Good point. Zach and Zorian can argue for not one but two drawbacks to Jornak and Silverlake if Pan is released.

      One is the altruistic point that the world will be basically destroyed by the countermeasures if Pan is released. This may work better on QI, maybe on Jornak (depends on whether he is lying about wanting to make the world better), probably not much for Silverlake if she thinks she can hide in a bunker and survive by herself.

      Second is that the angels will be free to act if Pan is released and will almost certainly kill Jornak, Silverlake, and QI for releasing Pan or for knowing about the time loop. That, of course, puts Jornak and Silverlake in a tough spot, since they have a soul contract to die if Pan is *not* released. But maybe they can be persuaded that their chances of survival are better if they work with Zach and Zorian to try to find a loophole in their contract.

      Either way, I think QI should be the easiest to convince. Maybe the thing to do is for Zach and Zorian to approach QI alone and turn him, and then get QI to try to persuade Jornak and Silverlake.
      ```

- u/AKAAkira:
  ```
  It seems worth pointing out that Oganj, that dragon mage Zach wasted dozens of restarts to kill way back, was said to have a group. MoL's worldbuilding material noted that dragons are highly solitary creatures, which contributes to the reasons why dragon magic is difficult to pass from dragon to dragon.

  If Oganj has a group, that seems to mean one of two things: one, he's an exception who has other dragons at his beck and call, or two, he has some assortment of underlings whether animal, monster or human that serve him. None of the previous chapters alluded to either being the case, I think, but maybe Zach would know more and will explain next chapter.
  ```

- u/Xtraordinaire:
  ```
  So the chapter casually answered my biggest question, that was, **if Red Robe had been looping for years, why was he such a shitty mage?** In other words, why was Zorian able to make it alive past book one? 

  The likely answer was that RR prioritized something, elsewhere. (We could say he was lazy, but, really, not really) 

  But what? Well, we know now. While Z&Z honed their personal skills, ignoring politics, albeit, for different reasons, RR did the opposite of that. He somewhat neglected personal growth as a mage to devote more time figuring out continental politics and what strings must be cut to start a new great war.
  ```

  - u/nytelios:
    ```
    I have a new question from this chapter. If he is Jornak and is such a shitty mage (not that he really is, but he comes across as weaker than Z&Z), how did he get the imperial dagger to soulkill all those people? I can see him collaborating with QI, but even QI+Z&Z had a hard time.
    ```

    - u/Xtraordinaire:
      ```
      My answer is bribery, extortion, corruption. The government is corrupt as fuck (see: Tesen), and subverted (see: damned cultists in the government, Sudomir the fucking mayor).
      ```

      - u/nytelios:
        ```
        I think that's a weaker explanation because no matter how corrupt it is, the royal family is demonstrably Smaug-like in hoarding their treasury. They hounded Z&Z just for trying, and I think QI+Z&Z would've been capable of that route themselves if it was an option.
        ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    Of course Red Robe is a shitty mage. Zorian and Zach loop for years on their own, having to fight against all kinds of necromancers and monsters singlehandedly. Meanwhile Red Robe can just drag QI around with him to do the fighting and sit back until the enemy is defeated, just like how he beat up Zach during one of the early time loop parties. 

    But yeah, not having to train his combat skills would give him plenty of time to research ways to exploit the time loop. Still though, that's a somewhat empty threat. Red Robe only knows how to trigger a war under the controlled conditions of the time loop, and most likely without significant interference from other time loopers. Outside of the time loop with Zach and Zorian causing chaos it's entirely possible to make things go differently.
    ```

- u/sicutumbo:
  ```
  So... QI knows about the time loop. And is aware that he will have to fight against probable-archmages, and won't allow the ground to be prepared ahead of time. Z&Z vs. RR and Silverlake in a more or less straight fight is such a sure thing that I'm not even going to bother placing odds on Z&Z losing, but QI changes things substantially. That angel will probably be necessary against whatever things QI will prepare, especially since Silverlake has up to date information on Z&Z's abilities and normal countermeasures against QI.

  Jornak's goals and blackmail are contradictory. On one hand, he says that he wants to prevent another Splinter War. On the other hand, his blackmail is to start a continental war. What's really his motive?

  Also, would Jornak know or suspect the scorched earth policy of the "Highest Ones"? If so, I think he should have placated and helped Zach stop the invasion in the time loop, otherwise there wouldn't be much of a world left after the primordial leaves and the scorched earth policies are activated.

      After I reread the section again, your interpretation makes more sense. 

      I'm not sure if contributions towards starting a war would make it easier for him to start reforms, though, seeing how doing necromancy-related things tends to make everyone hostile to you (assuming that the wraith bombs can be pinned onto Jornak).

    He is lying through his l teeth, either to our protagonists or to himself, he just wants power, he was wronged and robbed. He thinks the world owes him a favor and if it isn't willing to give it to him, he is willing to take it kicking and screaming. 

    That is the impression I'm getting at least, and honestly, Zorian isn't at as much a disadvantage as he may think at the moment, he just needs to do the one thing that his time in the loop has perfect prepared him for, *organise the Aranea*, if Zorian can pull this off, he basically just wins, it doesn't matter how many heavy hitters and powerhouses the other guys have, an army computerised of an entire race of mind reading and controlling psychics with skill at predicting the future? It doesn't get much more unbeatable than that.
    ```

    - u/heckek:
      ```
      I can definitely see that. One thing I do want to find out is why Jornak wants power. I suspect that it is related to the time loop warping his perspective of what he deserves, and is probably why the angels have a "good ethical guidelines" criteria when they selected their candidate.

      I don't know if the Aranea will be that effective. They were wiped out by Jornak while the time loop was still in effect. Granted, they were caught by surprise, so they may be effective this time around.
      I'm sure Jornak has anti-divination wards as well as a mind blank spell that makes him impervious to the Aranea, as well as anybody else he casts it on. I wouldn't be surprised if he enforces a "everybody has to cast Mind Blank on himself" policy. Who knows, maybe he even has a wraith bomb planted near their nest. Wraiths don't have minds, do they?

      However, I doubt that the vast majority of the invading army will have great mind protection due to Mind Blank's tendency to cause mental issues. So as long as the Aranea stay alive until the invasion, they will contribute greatly.
      ```

      - u/I-want-pulao:
        ```
        Yeah, and average mages can't cast mindblank either - back when QI was first introduced in person (ch 80) his having a mind blank on told Zorian immediately:

        >Mind blank was not an easy spell to cast, and being under its effects immediately placed the man in the upper tier selection of mages.
        ```

        - u/domoincarn8:
          ```
          To kill your entire army of Aranea, I don't even need mages. I just need trolls with their minds shielded (no blanked, just shielded).

          The Aranea are a one trick pony, right now.
          ```

      - u/signspace13:
        ```
        Also remember I'm not just talking Cyoria's Aranea, I'm talking all of them, or at least all of them in Eldemar, and it was heavily foreshadowed that Zorian, Daimen and the Aranea worked out a way through mind blank, so it isn't a perfect defense, and there are consequences to using Mind blank for an extended period, a month likely exceeds that safe period, so at least some of the higher ups will be vulnerable some of the time, not to mention how vulnerable QI is to a surprise attack, from a lot of mind mages, if just one of them gets a hold on him in he hopes out automatically, which would give them the crown, a significant advantage for the final battle.

      It's a mistake I've caught myself making at times, to base an argument on the things that would convince me rather than things that would convince my debate partner.

  - u/morgf:
    ```
    I think they missed a big chance to ask for help with getting around the primordial's contract with Silverlake and RR. If they could offer Silverlake survival without releasing the primordial then she would almost certainly join them. RR would be a question mark (at the time they contacted the angel) but still worth a shot.

    Maybe the primordial contract is similar enough to the angel contract that no real help could be given, but maybe not. It was certainly worth asking.

  So, new questions about this:

  - In what way would the 'scorched earth' method affect the angels that they would intervene without the highest ones permissions?
  - It seems that the time loop is kinda an event horizon, no information can ever escape, not even to the spiritual world. Given that, and that the cage was connected to the time loop and the real world, how would the triggers react if Px was released in the time loop? I mean, we could release it there and then destroy it/let it expire and it wouldn't affect the real world.
  - If the above is possible without triggering, would other conditions analogous to Px being out of the cage (ie. mana levels dropping drastically, the Cyoria dungeon/hole disappearing) but not on the real world activate?
  - "Oganj and his group" does he means other dragons?
  - How the heck did Jornak figure out that Zack was under a contract if a) he didn't even know, b) it seems to require a adept divine mage to even try to pry into the contract/blessing thing, much less reading it? (btw, the angel saying the "figured it out" should ring several alarms about the abilities of Jornak)
  ```

  - u/sambelulek:
    ```
    Angels could be duty-bound to preserve the world. You suspect people provide something to the angels, forbidding them to kill people willy nilly. But perhaps, it's just two duties of equal priority. Most Highest must decide which to accomplish, preserve the world or keep out the Prim.
    ```

  - u/Ardvarkeating101:
    ```
    > In what way would the 'scorched earth' method affect the angels that they would intervene without the highest ones permissions?

    Maybe the primordial is partially spiritual as well, so they just "destroy" any part of the spiritual realms it occupies once it gets out, including parts that have angels or other spirits in it.
    ```

- u/ththth12:
  ```
  That angel gave them clear hints how to save Zack. 
  -The contract will dissolve at the end of the month. 
  -They will not attack them even if Zack evades the contract. 
  -Zorian confirmed that it all depends Zack' perception, and not how things really are. 

  So, all the need is that Zorian wipes or changes Zack's memories, or everyone in known will fake their deaths. As long as Zack honestly believes that they are dead/mindwiped, then everything will be solved.
  ```

  - u/burnerpower:
    ```
    Yeah the contract dissolving is a big win, that means they can just temporarily mess with Zach's memories until the contract dissolves. Doing it without post mind wipe Zach realizing it has happened will be the tricky part.
    ```

- u/XellosPY:
  ```
  Is the RedRobe team screwed no matter what now? If they don't liberate the Primordial they fail their contract, If they set it free but the angels beat it they are just going to kill them all because they know about the time loop, and if the angels can't seal it back then the Primordial is going to wreck the world anyways.
  ```

  - u/Ardvarkeating101:

      The angels said that the Primordial being released isn't a world-ending event, but that the gods' failsafes would be _much worse_. RR presumably doesn't know that part. The whole plot at this point is coming to a mutually-assured-destruction pileup on all sides.
      ```

- u/Laser68:
  ```
  Loving how consistently well the characters are written. We finally meet angels and they have an agenda, which they are using reasonable means to try and achieve. No character is evil for no reason, no character has purely altruistic motives. Gotta admit though, that initial method of initiating the contract is sketchy as hell. 

  Bit of a curiosity, angels are surprisingly bad judges of character. Zorian in a lot of ways is a perfect fit. It is interesting that they seem to only accept an underdog hero as an acceptable archetype.
  ```

  - u/zolnir:
    ```
    No, the angels are perfectly good judges of characters. It's the same logic as why you don't hire someone completely unqualified to do a certain job, even if everyone technically has the potential to get good into their job eventually.
    ```

  - u/burnerpower:
    ```
    The angel's foresight seems limited. It's not really possible to predict that Zorian would go through such a drastic change in personality in the time loop especially considering his strange entry method. Besides from a potential perspective he kind of sucks. Even with a divine blessing he'd have merely above average Mana reserves and still be lower than Zach. On top of that Zach was restricted on the type of mind magic he could learn, if it was Zorian who was the main looper it would be absolutely crippling. Zorian is also extremely paranoid, he would have never agreed to any shadey dream deal. I think the angel's assessment of preloop Zorian is pretty accurate.
    ```

    - u/jaghataikhan:
      ```
      This completely shoots down my former theory of Zorian s freakishly unlikely inclusion into the time loop (akin to a botched copy paste operation jail breaking the encryption on a file by chance) being an angelic intervention to.offset zachs being derailed :/
      ```

    - u/Laser68:
      ```
      Except the deal was given in a semi-lucid scenario, which could get almost anyone to agree. The mind magic being restricted part though is entirely valid, but its also not the reasons the Angel used as a counter argument. In terms of mana reserves, zorian with above average reserves would be scary. Remember the main barrier to him learning new things as he can only try things so many times due to his low reserves. Zach was good, but Zorians rate of learning was nothing if not fantastic give his base reserves.
      ```

      - u/burnerpower:
        ```
        I don't think he would have accepted the deal in a dream because of the way he reacted to the idea in this chapter. He thought it was ludicrous and even his pre loop self would never consider it. It is true that we don't know for sure what pre loop Zorian would do but even the angel agreed it was foolish to accept. You are right that Zorian learns fast but that's not terribly important with effectively infinite time. While Zorian is better at the subtle stuff the angels weren't looking for subtle, they were looking for power and Zach fits the bill.
        ```

- u/playercharlie:
  ```
  From a purely "I want to survive the month" point of view, why would ZZ accept the terms of Jornak, and leave Team RR alone?? Someone else starting a Splinter War does not trigger any of the conditons in the contract with the angels. Also, if Team RR starts a Splinter war, the various countries would start amassing their resources towards the war, and which would make it more difficult for Team RR to work towards releasing Panaxeth, as ZZ can just go to the authorities at that point to reveal the invasion plot. 

  Also, if RR can start the Splinter Wars without releasing Panaxeth, and in a much easier fashion as it has been implied, QI could just use that path to satisfy his goals. QI wouldn't need to then release Panaxeth - only RR and Silverlake would need to. Starting a Splinter war would fragment Team RR.

  Thus, any moves by RR to start a Splinter War will only make his position weaker (as he is less likely to be able to release Panaxeth). The only thing RR is counting on is the reluctance of ZZ to let so many people die. I love how this conversation is even more Do or Die for RR than it is for ZZ - probably why RR requested for it in the first place. 

  Apologies if I have forgotten any basic facts - it is early morning here :)

    > From a purely "I want to survive the month" point of view, why would ZZ accept the terms of Jornak, and leave Team RR alone??

    Zach would die if team RR survives:

    > "We cannot absolve you of fulfilling your part of the bargain,"the angel stubbornly said. "It simply is not within our power to do so. The only thing I can promise you is that if you find the way to remove or evade the contract in some fashion, we will not seek to punish you for it."

    They can probably avoid the terms of the contract in regards to Zorian in a few ways, but if team RR survives to the end of the month, Zach will die even if the primordial isn't released, because he has no good way of erasing their memories of the time loop like he might have with Zorian.

    Actually, they just plain can't kill team RR right now. QI is a Lich, and killing his physical body merely returns his soul to his phylactery. So Zach would all but certainly die even if they managed to completely annihilate team RR before they could trigger their contingencies. Zorian would come out ahead, but it wouldn't be in character. Zach has little reason to not accept since a straight fight is his specialty, and it's the only realistic path he survives through.

    RR also has the pseudo nuclear option of placing a description of the time loop in a newspaper if Zach doesn't agree.

    - u/playercharlie:
      ```
      >Zach would die if Team RR survives

      Exactly, which is why they shouldn't accept the terms of Team RR to leave them alone. It is asking for a lot from a final fight, to kill all of Team RR.

      I see what you are saying as well. That accepting Jornak's terms is the only way of ensuring there is a final fight. My thought process was that the final fight will happen one way or the other, regardless of whether they hound Team RR through the month or not.

      >RR also has the pseudo nuclear option of placing a description of the time loop in a newspaper if Zach doesn't agree.

      Honestly, Jornak as RR is boring to me. It’s a character who wasn’t introduced until long after RR left the loop and I’m not sure it was possible to figure out prior to this chapter. At the same time, it’s also exactly the first person you’d check after Veyers, so not exactly the sneakiest solution, either.

  I'll have to re-read the chapter about Jornak, but the impression I had that he was a NoM (not a mage, a regular citizen). Or a substandard mage at all. I think by the time Zorian performed a mind reading on him, he was qualified enough to identify his traits/status for pre-loop. 

  Anyways, some random conclusions/thoughts after reading the chapter:

  given enough resources/time even monkey can become archmage/mindmage/whatever. (Jornak as very bland person prior loop. If he had any decent talent, he would be most likely working as a mage already instead of being lawyer).

  The Red Robe stolen from cultists can be explained, however getting crown as newbies from QI for initial temporary mark, getting QI to modify temporary market, getting access to royal vault for dagger - those details are very thin. The knowledge about SG (the artifacts, soul markers) and how they knew that QI had the crown of the king to even include others in looping - it does not seem to be that Jornak was privy of this information and Zach knew pretty much nothing besides the bars. If Zach had visited SG , he could have  learned something from controller, but it is still very far fetched. (I think it was Zorian who entered SG  by feeling/using soul markers, Zach was oblivious to them). A very catch-22 issue in general. I just can imagine any plausible scenario how this situation where Zach granted a temporary marker to Jornak might have happened reasonably. 

  There might be an  explanation for QI holding his end of the deal all the time. It is part of divine blessing he has. As a whim or not, the god who placed the blessing/contract on him mandated that he never breaks any deals (or there he will die/lose the divine blessing/whatever). There might be some clause about others approaching/offering a deal (it cannot refuse a reasonable deal). E.g., if the undead vampire management asks him to be a general and they promise to take care of his subordinates or what not, he has to accept due to divine blessing (has was offered reasonable deal with reasonable compensation). So Jornak with Zach randomly asked QI to borrow a crown for 5 minutes (and provide a relevant payment - very little for such request) and QI just had to agree  due to his divine contract/blessing. 

  It is also very likely that contract Pan had signed with SL and RR is of different nature than Zach. Zach agreed to it in the sleep and then he was shoved into SG with very little information about SG. 
  Pan is enforcing his contract some other way (not divine magic), but it is complicated enough that SL can untangle it during the month until it expires.

  The more I think about it, I think the Jornak=RR reveal might be more Thematic (TM) and less inelegant than I gave it credit for originally.

  > I'm guessing Veyers introduced you to Zach, and you hit it off with each other since you have both been cheated out of your inheritance and empathized with each other because of it

  This is the emotional core of it, I think. In Chapter 75, when Jornak was first introduced, we learn his story. He had his inheritance stolen from him and he empathized with Veyers. So, duh, Zach meets Jornak, they "hit it off" as Zorian says, because Jornak empathizes in exactly the same way. We know Zach had been talking to lawyers about what to do with his situation, so it's not unreasonable that he'd come across Jornak.

  (It would be really neat to get an interlude where we see them meet, start looping together and eventually turn against each other...)

  > Have you two ever tried to look into what our country has been doing these past few years?" Red Robe said, looking at Zorian. "I just wanted to figure out how to ensure justice for me and Zach at first. However, I couldn't stop myself from looking… and the more I looked, the more awful things I found. The prosperity we enjoy right now is all built atop of mountain of lies, theft, unspeakable corruption and even straight up murder. Even if I got justice for myself and Zach, it's all just a drop in the bucket.

  At one point, Zorian even suspects Zach as the enemy on account of Zach having reason to hate the Establishment because they stood by and did nothing while Zach was robbed by everything. Jornak is actually Zach's character foil here. Zach didn't fall like Zorian suspected, but Jornak did.

      Fighting Quatach-Ichl and Oganj, with Red Robe (Jornak), & Silverlake as support, seems beyond their abilities without something to tip the balance in their favor.

  I hoped that contract would clear something. It didn’t. We still don’t know it’s full text, but we got some angelic summary that I assume is more or less true. I’m very confused about what is angels goal. 

  Implied goal is “to stop anybody but Zach to know about time loop”. 

  Implied method is “Zach will die, if anybody know about time loop at the end of the month”.

  So, from angels perspective:

  What is stopping Zach from telling everybody about time-loop on the first day of new month ? 

  Why is Zach self-policing on the pain of death more likely to succeed that just banning Zach from talking  about time loop when he is back from it ?  Or all the time ? You can argue that this would  limit his options, but they don’t have problem with banning mind and soul magic, a much bigger obstruction.

  So, what angels goal here ? No idea. But it doesn’t seem to be stated goal. 

  &#x200B;

  Additional observation (may or may not be related to above):

  Angels can clearly lie (or say things that are not technically true, or be imprecise to the point that they are saying something really misleading), as :

  “He cannot let anyone know about existence of the time loop or he’ll die at the end of the month. “

  Is not like this obligation was described before, this imply that Zach will die if anybody “knows about existence of time loop” regardless of when that occur. So Zach fate would be sealed as soon as he told about time loop to first person in the time loop. And this seems to hold true in any reasonable definition of “knows about existence of time loop” that still would kill Zach if anybody knows about time loop at the end of the month.

  I don't buy Jornak as RR. This:
  >"I guess you also know who I really am?" he asked, tilting his head to the side with a self-indulgent smile.

  doesn't seem like the reaction of someone whose obsessively kept secret has been found out. In Bayes terms someone who isn't Jornak is certain to let his enemies keep thinking he is, so the likelihood ratio is *at best* 1:1, so this can't be evidence for Jornak=RR. 'Liar who wants to conceal his identity admits his identity' is just awful evidence.

  My prior for J=RR wasn't very high, and this chapter shifts it downwards if anything, I think you need to assign *some* probability to Jornak not admitting it so casually after all the lengths he has gone so far. All the people acting like this chapter settles the matter, how do you assign a much higher conditional probability to Jornak telling the truth than any other RR candidate lying?

  Thoughts:

  * If ZZ accept the offer, the next chapter might timeskip to just before the final battle. Imagine a Zorian + Princess vs RR + Oganj all-out fight. 
  * The RR reveal doesn't feel very satisfying. RR let Zorian say who he thought he was instead of revealing his identify himself, so could just be lying, and they never verify his identity. I'd still put 10% on RR = Fortov. 
  * If ZZ accept the offer, couldn't RR and crew could just trigger the release before the summer festival, as the cult did in one of the restarts? I guess ZZ will know this and monitor potential ritual locations closely. 
  * Not telling Damien seems silly. Tons of people know about the time loop and they need all the help they can get. Either they find a way around the angelic contract that allows Zach and loop-aware-humans to survive or they don't.
  * I wonder if there's a future where ZZ + RR + crew team up to beat all their contracts and the final battle is against Panxeth + the angels instead of each other. Zorian reverse engineers the angel summoning cube which is probably divine spell formula (with QI's help) and instead uses it to attack or imprison the angels. 

  &#x200B;
  ```

  - u/burnerpower:
    ```
    I agree the Red Robe reveal wasn't very satisfying from a literary perspective but from a rational perspective that is kind of how it had to be. RR had to fit a set of pretty strict criteria even before we knew about his Veyers connection. He had to be someone Zach could reasonably meet and grow to trust in the loop. He had to be connected to the Cult of the Dragon Below. He couldn't be someone Zorian would reasonably meet or else it would be obvious Zorian was an extra looper. Later it had to also be someone connected to Veyers. Under those conditions in the story up to this point only Veyers or Jornak could possibly be the answer and Veyers was ruled out by being soul killed.

    ```

- u/nytelios:
  ```
  The most obvious solution to escaping the "knowledge of the time-loop" clause in Zach's contract is >!cleanly mind wiping Zach's awareness that other people know about the time loop, because Zorian figured it's Zach's *perception* that matters. However, this doesn't mean that this loophole wouldn't be arbitrated by the angels, since there's also a clause that rulers cannot be killed. Also, it'd be sad to see Zach lose all his memories of interacting with Zorian throughout the time loop.!<

  Jornak's motive reveal was a great twist (insomuch as we can trust that's the truth). The committing evil for what one perceives to be utilitarian good reminded me of Ozymandias in Watchmen. Now that it's brought up, Z&Z have always been working on a relatively small scale, from the pettiest point of personal gains to the larger resolution of the Cyoria crisis. I doubt they're the type to be swayed by optimistic evil, but I'm curious how this conflict of ideals will be settled.

  Hope they've already started preparations on new plans because Silverlake is genuinely their biggest weakness. Almost all of their plans and abilities in the time loop were leaked to SL. Now RR's side has an overwhelming advantage in information, and information wins wars (>!assuming SL is not a triple agent and there is a chance given how inscrutable she's been!<). Not sure what Alanic's got for counteracting the wraith bombs, but since they knew about that plan already, that seems to be the priority as the biggest threat. Assassination of major people (rulers of nations) might be a serious danger to Zach's life. Oganj might seem like the big bad saved for last, but he's small fry in the grand scheme.
  ```

  - u/MaleficentStatement:

    >Assassination of major people (rulers of nations) might be a serious danger to Zach's life.

    Are you referring to the  contract? The rule only applies to Zach killing rulers. If RR kills them Zach is fine. 

    >**He (Zach) cannot kill a ruler of any nation, or otherwise directly cause a nation to collapse into anarchy or he'll die at the end of the month.**

    &#x200B;
    ```

    - u/nytelios:
      ```
      Ah, ignore that; it's not a danger to Zach but still sitting behind the wraith bombs in threat level. If it does happen, I wonder how effective it would be to shift the blame onto the Ulquaan Ibasa invaders who are going to blatantly attack Cyoria. There probably wouldn't be as much political paranoia of who perpetrated the murders, but autocracies and oligarchies are notoriously volatile when power changes hands.
      ```

  - u/Watchful1:
    ```
    > cleanly mind wiping Zach's awareness that other people know about the time loop

    Actually no. It would be simpler to alter Zach's memories to think that all those people are dead. Then they can just show up again after the contract is over and there aren't any problems.

    Here's my bet. Alanic and Xvim die. Silverlake and Jornak die. Not really sure what they do with QI, but let's say he dies as well. The only person remaining is Zorian. At the very last, something in the contract makes Zach break down and he attacks Zorian rather than just dying. Zorian uses mind magic on him, makes Zach think he won and killed him, then shows up again after the contract ends.
    ```

    - u/nytelios:
      ```
      It's pretty much impossible to make him think they're dead, when there's a very high chance they'll all be fighting together before the end of the month. Not much time for detailed mind editing, whereas it's more feasible to edit out the awareness beforehand so they can still work together. It'd be a major hit to coordination though.

      Isn't that really just betting on the author pulling out a let's-kill-everybody-inconvenient deus ex machina so the ending can be tied off in a neat little package? If I were Z or Z, I don't think I'd rely on those astronomically low odds to pull through...
      ```

- u/matex_xizor:
  ```
  Yes! I guessed Red Robe's identity right!

  So the time loop wasn't a divine contingency, it was the Angels' attempt to stop the contingency from triggering.

  At least Zach's situation looks slighty better now, since he doesn't have to go against the Angels.

  I wonder how the "don't kill the ruler of any nation"/ "don't cause anarchy" rule will come into play. 

  So what was Zach's goal inside the time loop? Stopping invasion by itself would be poinless, since it is not real. Learning how to stop the invasion would also be impossible, because in the real world it will play out diffirently because of Demons.
