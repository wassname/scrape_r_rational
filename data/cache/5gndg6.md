  Ahhhhh. And there, my concern from last week's chapter is addressed. One of the other kids stumbling across a morse code book and pointing out that the owl in said book had morse code around it too, prompting Emma to go and look at the other owls she saw, is much more plausible than how it was initially presented. I am mollified :)

  They have been to careless in choosing where they talk .Now sister krone knows who they are and that will have  conseuences, although this can be potentially usefull because if krone tries to overthrow mama that could be a good distraction to proceed with their plans , but it also could make the demons more focussed on this farm, which probably had less security measures since mama had a perfect historial of keping kids from trying to escape

  Am I the only one who has strong r!Animorphs flashbacks reading this?

  Also, I feel this episode is a lot more nuanced, and realistic than the previous ones. The kids make mistakes, get emotional, etc. On the other hand, the pace of the story is slowing down way too much.
