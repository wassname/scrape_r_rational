  I'm starting to get AI-in-a-box vibes from the Bard. Black inspires the same sort of feeling except that he's less of a threat because he makes it very obvious that he's hostile to being in the box and that every move he makes is about redecorating the box to be more to his liking and/or burning down the box.

  Bard, however, keeps popping up in places and doing things that an ordinary role player in the story has no business being/doing - like the guy who shows up at a house party, introduces himself as a friend of a friend and then you keep finding him walking upstairs or out into the garage, but he insists someone told him it was okay. 

  Not openly hostile in and of itself, but speaks to a motive that's not exactly above-board. Or maybe the proper metaphor is a story-teller who's realized she doesn't have to tell the story exactly as its written. Or a journalist whose realized they can twist the facts to fit their narrative.

  It feels like she's operating in a blindspot of the Gods Above and Below - maintaining the cover/Role of the Bard who monitors the narrative and pushes heroes/villains in the right direction, but actually pushing them to some other, possibly cataclysmic end. I feel like when the Bard's endgame is revealed it'll make both Akua's Folly and Malicia's gambit to sieze it look like child's play.

  Wait, fuck, that means that the Bard *predates* the Dead King? Was she attempting to make him take up a mantle from the heavens? Maybe he did, and maybe him being a powerful sorcerer allowed him to notice that his choices were being ripped from him, and in a fit of revenge and rage, he became the opposite of what Bard wanted him to be, the first of Bard's mistakes...

  Or maybe that was part of her plan all along...
  ```

  - u/TideofKhatanga:
    ```
    Probably part of the plan. Every story needs a villain. And what better villain than one that is way too powerful to die but is plot-bound to never be an actual threat to the status quo? A sort of Sauron-in-a-jar whose mere existence binds the rest of the world as Good just for balance.

    That kind of bullshit has Bard written all over it. Nope out of that story right now, Cat, because nothing good will come out of it.

    Edit: eyebleeding typo
    ```

    - u/IDKWhoitis:
      ```
      I mean Catherine has been known to break Cycles. So in the long run this may end up actually killing Bard. If cat finds a way to make the dead King not the dead King then maybe a metaphysical Balancing could happen, which will also Kill The Bard.
      ```

    - u/cyberdsaiyan:
      ```
      The theory of Triamegistus rejecting The Above because they took away his choice also makes it much more likely that he hates everything that the Above stands for and thus, is the ultimate static villain.
      ```

      - u/Empiricist_or_not:
        ```
        Note the story three beat about choice from   Masego regarding his father, the joke between Thief and Archer, then the whole discussion with Hakram about following a sovereign who will impose their choice.  I'm betting we will se something big about Choice when we get to Keter.
        ```

  - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
    ```
    Could be that the Bard and the Dead King originated at the same time. That would seem typical of the symmetry shown in the Story: Evil can't have some big bad thousand year old lich without some counterweight from Good.
    ```

    - u/cyberdsaiyan:
      ```
      Might be the opposite, Good might have been winning a bit too much in those times thanks to Bardic interventions, and so the Big Bad was created to balance it out. Triumphant might have been another such phenomenon when the Good won too much.
      ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    We don't know that. This could have been the Bard's first body, before she became an it. Some friend, relative, or lover of Trismegistus, who became the heroic foil to the Dead King as a result of his Fall.
    ```

    - u/cyberdsaiyan:
      ```
      She already has the lute and unlimited alcohol that Catherine recognized, so I daresay she's already come into her name.
      ```

- u/over_who:
  ```
  So the devil is cunning, and the bard is more dangerous than we knew. How did they manage this, I wonder. Also I like how it runs all their assumptions about what happened.
  ```

- u/Sarkavonsy:
  ```
  My theory gains weight!

  The bard is either a god, or a creation of the gods above and below, meant to keep the story going forever. Whenever *either* side is truly losing, she's there to rebalance the scales. She isn't a hero, she's just recently been acting like one because the Black Knight's new kind of villainy is a genuine threat to the conflict between good and evil.
  ```

  - u/Rheklr:
    ```
    So she's the in-game dungeon master?
    ```

  - u/WalterTFD:
    ```
    I still think she is a Named, just a very old and mighty one.  I suspect that the fact that Good always wins may be more due to her efforts than any particular property of the world.
    ```

    - u/xland44:
      ```
      Ooh, that's a very interesting insight/theory
      ```

- u/HallowedThoughts:
  ```
  Well damn. I thought Bard was gonna be on par with the Dead King in terms of threat level, but it seems I've underestimated her. Also, Black's assumption that Bard's existence had been a response to the Dead King was false too, it would seem. Quite the twist here
  ```

- u/WalterTFD:
  ```
  Calling it now, at some point during this thousands of years old echo, Bard is going to look over at Cat and *wink*.
  ```

- u/Ardvarkeating101:
  ```
  Indrani was right!  It was a tragic love story between a woman who would rather die for the gods above than turn, and a man who would rather betray them all than lose his kingdom!

  Send me gold when it turns out WB and DK were in love all along.
  ```

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    Crazy plot twist: Triumphant was a Bard from Wolof that accidentally ascended the throne of the Dread Empire, and had her brains shorted out by the Role of a mad tyrant the same way she had her normal behaviour was overridden when she was stuck in a schemer Role while talking with the Hierarch. Then she kept escalating and making infernal pacts, until she ran into an obstacle she couldn't just throw demons at - the Tyrian sea. It even fits with her final "Why not?", since the story of a madwoman running everything into the ground doesn't have that many ways to go, and a smallest initial impulse would be enough.
    ```

- u/Taborask:
  ```
  does Catherine know about the continuity of consciousness? she cut Black off before he could tell her much about it
  ```

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    She knows at least about her being able to change faces, though I find it strange that the attributes like the lute and the flask persist even though those objects were bound to evolve with the progress of technology on Calernia, slow as it is.
    ```

    - u/HeWhoBringsDust:
      ```
      Names are bound to stories, and are shaped by the culture they originated from. However, Bard has been around since forever, and I think it might be *because* of her meddling that she keeps some aspects. If the first Bard had a lute and flask, then the second one might also get one and so on and so forth until the lute and flask become a part of the archetype.
      ```

    - u/stevedoesIP:
      ```
      I mean I don't know how much better flask technology can really get.

      "This baby's got 10,000 horsepower and laser sighting!"
      ```

      - u/Zayits:
        ```
        A copper flask is an outlier in the period where copper is considered fitting to be included in a king's garments; a less demonstrably expensive option would be a wineskin or a clay jug.
        ```

- u/serge_cell:
  ```
  >Among those present in the great crypt where the entombment took place was the young man I was fairly sure became the Dead King. Not because of anything he did, but because of who was talking to him. The face I didn’t recognize, I’d admit. But the shoddy lute and the flask? Those I’d recognize anywhere.

  Dead King could have been created by Bard.

  My theory that "Good" Gods are just faction of Evil Gods is getting some support.
  ```

- u/CeruleanTresses:
  ```
  Hakram remains the MVP of this story.
