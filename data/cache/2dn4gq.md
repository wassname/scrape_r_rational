  An excerpt that may sell you on the novel:

  >“So 20 years helping people with their rental cars, 40 hours a week at $10 an hour would be $400,000.”
  >
  >“$400,000! Without stealing anything?”
  >
  >“Without stealing anything. So, we’ll say the cost of getting caught would be the $400,000 you would give up in income.
  >
  >“Now, let’s say that you got away with the money 95% of the time. But there is still a 5% chance that you will end up in jail for 20 years.”
  >
  >“But NO ONE CAN — ”
  >
  >“Catch the mighty Lifto. Yes of course. But humor me. Stay with the numbers for just a moment longer. So 95% times a $10,000 benefit is $9,500. This is the incremental benefit to you of robbing a bank. That is, if our hypothetical Lifto were to rob an infinite number of banks.”
  >
  >“An INFINITE amount of money.”
  >
  >“Yes. Very good,” (and very loud, thinks Edwin). “That would be an infinite amount of money.”
  >
  >“So I go rob banks now. Thank you.”
  >
  >“Wait, wait, we haven’t factored in the cost yet.”
  >
  >“Lifto don’t like costs.”
  >
  >“Neither do I, Lifto.”
  >
  >“Costs suck.”
  >
  >“Yes, they do. But we know that already. The only question left to us is how much do they actually ‘suck’ as you say. So, there is a 5% chance that you will get caught — I’m sorry, sorry, that the hypothetical Lifto will get caught — times negative $400,000 is negative $20,000. So, over time, each time you rob a bank it costs you $20,000 dollars.
  >
  >“But there’s an infinite number of banks,” says Lifto with dreams of filthy lucre glittering in his eyes.
  >
  >“Yes, yes, so we add the costs and the benefits to learn what the true value of robbing a bank is to you and we see that, over time, it costs you -$10,500 each time you rob a bank.”
  >
  >“What!”
  >
  >“The numbers do not lie, Lifto.
