  > Chapter 124: Fight Club

  'Ahh, 'fight club', and the number one rule of fight club is to not talk about fight club and with all these new allies about to meet up at the house this is going to be a cheeky reference to secrecy and what can and can't be told to various parties'

  **Amarylis proceeds to beat the ever-living-shit out of Juniper* 

  ...well, I can't say I wasn't forewarned


  > “The world threw everything it had at him. He fought with a fervor that I doubt most men could ever have hoped to match. He had advantages, we all did, I would never dispute that, but he was put through the wringer until the very end, when there was practically nothing left of him.”

  For me, taking believable characters and seeing how they're genuinely effected and changed by situations no normal person has to deal with is part of what I want out of rational fiction. I look at how a flawed but in all likelihood mostly decent person like Arthur could, after being put through a seriously fucked up, emotionally taxing marathon of physical and psychological hardship, turn into the sort of person Uther was and I recognise that most people would have fared no better. 

  I feel like those that are looking at Joon (including pre-Aerb Joon) and Arthur/Uther in terms of Black and White are missing out on the sort of subtle character concepts and arcs that can be uniquely explored by throwing people into truly unusual fantastical situations. Going Uther = Evil, Joon = Asshole is such a great disservice to their characters and a missed opportunity to experience how a believable character can *realistically* be effected by some experiences truly out of the possibility space for any human being that has ever existed. (Also, Amarylis has just admitted that Joon is not that bad and she's very likely smarter and more rational than you :P ) 

  > Fenn 

  This story really has done a wonderful job of handling the aftermath of Fenn's death. Trying to have a genuine depiction of the characters reacting to her passing, which likely includes having the event cast a shadow over everything for a not insignificant period of time, *while* not boring the reader or rehashing the same beats again and again sounded like a precarious balance to strike but to my delight I think WTC has handled it superbly. 


  > 'Is one of my party members a DMPC? Could they be? Yes, obviously they could be, but were they?'

  I'd like to pre-emptively argue against the inevitable 'Amarlyis is a DMPC' theory. Yes, as was stated in chapter 124, she is often 'the groups compass', and she certainly functions in some respects to keep the group on course like Vervain apparently did. She also has taken up huge amounts of screen time to delve into her character, all of which would be retroactively pointless if she's been a DMPC all along. We also have a chapter narrated from the POV of End Story Juniper based on information given to him by Amarylis (the chapter where her soul is compromised) and for Amarylis to have been a DMPC without End Story Juniper mentioning the fact would mean that even at the stories end Juniper doesn't know that she's a DMPC (which would mean neither do we which means the whole thing would be mostly pointless) or that the chapter was delivered to us in bad faith by End Story Juniper which would be a cheap trick that I think the author is above.

  I know the sub, understandably, likes to discuss the theoretically possible, not just the probable, but if anyone ACTUALLY thinks it's more likely than not that Amarylis is a DMPC then I would be happy to bet with them.

    Frankly, it doesn't really matter who is a DMPC. All of Joon's party can very well all be DMPCs. They're all actors on a stage, as Joon's dreams hinted.

    Joon has a closer relationship with his party than other characters of the plot, allowing them to bring out their subtle personality traits and likes/dislikes to flesh them out. Yet if things were different, e.g. Juniper saved the first girl in Chapter 1, she would be the Amarylis character in a different-yet-similar story.

      ```

      - u/Rice_22:
        ```
        Yes. Even Juniper himself hypothesized that he was always going to be railroaded into meeting Amarylis to the point that reality will bend to ensure that happen, that the first girl of significance he knows will always be her.

        Given the DM's supernatural and reality bending powers, does he really need a DMPC to nudge things along? Or rather, every single person on Aerb may very well be subject to the DM's puppetry. They're all NPCs, after all.
        ```

        - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
          ```
          I doubt he *needs* a DMPC, but I could see him wanting one anyway.

          - u/ICB_AkwardSituation:
            ```
            Personally I think it's unlikely that any of the current party members are DMPC's. Vervain was introduced to Arthur as a DMPC because instead of going off on a wild adventure and honing his abilities with his knack, he went off and acted for a bit until the DM had enough of that and decided to get the ball rolling. 

            Joon was in danger from the moment he landed on Aerb, and from the start he has been working to improve himself and change the world around him. While the DM may have nudged things here and there to keep the plot going the direction he wants it, the introduction of a DMPC when one isn't needed seems heavy handed.

            If a DMPC was introduced, or someone was found out to be a DMPC I'd be rather surprised if it was any of the party members. 

            Beyond that I think that Arthur and Joon are both occupying very different narratives from each other. Arthur was transported to a world that he had to save from the brink of destruction multiple times. Joon was transported into a craptastic but relatively stable world. Arthur was the set up for Joons story. Arthur had a knack that was probably different from Joon's in some way. 

            I think a distinction that could be relevant is that Arthur had Knights, where Joon has companions. Uther, as he is portrayed, was the leader of the bunch (You know him well). Whereas with Joon, it's more of a loose, group dynamic. 

            Beyond that Joon has a much better understanding of the world. It's built from his homebrews, not Arthur's. Uther would have known he was in a game from things he recognized, beyond that I personally don't think that the DM /ever/ interacted directly with Uther. His obsession with drawing (girl) from earth and rape of Bethel show that.

              ```
              On a meta level, none of the party members are DMPCs, because they're actually NPCs and Joon is the DMPC.

                I know, right? How are people even speculating about this when everything points to Juniper being the DM himself?

              ```
              i think uther marking vervain as a DMPC strongly hints that there was some uther/DM interaction.

              (i wonder if vervain appeared as the juniper spin-off at first, similar to the maddie/raven spin.)
              ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Right. 

      Plus, other than Uther having apparently killed Vevain(sp) for being a presumed DMPC, is there any particular indication that having one in the party would be a problem?
      ```

      - u/Gr_Cheese:
        ```
        This is a good point, Arthur was trapped within a narrative. Or at least thought of himself as trapped within a narrative. The DM, in such a circumstance, must be understood as the trapper, and therefore the enemy. So killing the DMPC *can* make sense.

        Juniper, on the other hand, is not 'trapped', so much as he has been shown a path and offered a reward. Unless that reward turns out to be a carrot on a stick, the DM is not an enemy so much as a potential inconvenience. Or a potential benefit, since without the DM Juniper would be powerless and in way the fuck over his head.

        And even trying to identify the DMPC is an exercise in futility, as given what we know of the DM's ability to retroactively rewrite reality, literally anyone could be a DMPC at any time -- and that is assuming that the DM's power has limits, which Juniper does not seem to think is the case.

        Until the DM is proven to be limited in some way, it's in Juniper's best interest to 1) Play along and be entertaining, and 2) 'Convince' the DM that it is in his best interest to follow through with his promise of DMhood to Juniper. 

        So really, Juniper getting in the way of the DM is just self-sabotaging. Everything and anything can be fixed (retroactively) after Juniper becomes DM.

    Eh, I think assholes can be nuanced but pre-Aerb Joon was definitely an asshole and a bad friend even without going through what Uther had gone through in Aerb (maybe understandably since he was an inexperienced teenager and teens do dumb shit like that all the time but still true). Also, Amaryllis doesn't have the cultural background to understand why Joon's relationship with Maddy was wrong.

    Maybe it's just different perspectives on things, but from what I've seen some people deal with stress on their own and others take it out on everyone around them. The stressors still don't excuse that behavior since you can just choose not to be an asshole. Plenty of people go through sheer hell in real life worse than anything even Uther had to go through and are still nice to other people. Unfortunately some people don't have the self-control to do that even by the time they're in their 60s.
    ```

    - u/LordGoldenroot:
      ```
      I don't think many people are arguing that pre-Aerb Joon was an asshole. The issue is that despite all of Junipers growth both before and after his transport to Aerb there seems to be a lot of people on the thread who seem determined to characterize Joon solely as an asshole despite all that has happened since then.

    I viewed that chapter as narrated from the POV of Juniper after Fallatehr's death, but within that time skip period that followed after.

    Taken literally, this is the only line I found as evidence of your theory:

    >Here, I mean ‘might not have actually happened’ in the sense that this is a recreation of sorts, me working backwards from information that I didn’t have at the end of the last chapter, and won’t have at the end of this one. - WtC Ch. 73

    And I don't think that alone is strong enough to make a case for the narrator being End Story Juniper, which would allow us to extrapolate all sorts of plot information, when it could simply be Juniper after the Fallatehr incident has closure as narrator.
    ```

    - u/icesharkk:
      ```
      this is the most logical conclusion after chapter 73. we can't come to a bad conclusion from it but if you assume that its end of story juniper then you can come to the conclusion that juniper survives the story.

    I reckon Grak is the most likely candidate. DMPC's are supposed to be exert a subtler influence and not be at the fore of the decision making process when it comes to who wants to do what, and that fits Grak better than all the other members.

    - u/None:

      OTOH, Grak has a real character arc and ongoing questline, which seems to run counter to the DMPC logic.

      I dunno. Solace hasn't done much influencing besides politely reminding the group that maybe they need to help her preserve the last existing remnant of an entire culture at some point. If she was always nagging Joon to go after Uther or Fel Seed or the Empire of Common Cause, it could be suspicious, but "non-human druid that needs help saving The Last XXX Of Its Species" feels very much like a sidequest NPC, not a GMPC.
      ```

      - u/Nimelennar:

        I don't know.  The whole "you can bring one of the party back from the dead easily, but *only* this one character," and "you can see inside the souls of your companions to see their priorities, but not *this* companion," both ring as suspicious to me.

        Also, if I wanted my characters to explore the length and breadth of the world I'd created, "Find a new home for the last XXX of its species" is exactly the kind of quest I'd assign.  Not to mention that it should be a fairly low-level quest, so it's the kind of thing a DMPC would be pressuring them to do *now* (as opposed to going after Uther or Fel Seed or the Empire).

    We should broaden this to 'Vervain was a DMPC', and even 'there are DMPC's on Aerb'. I think this is not unlikely that Arthur was simply mistaken, given his obsession with the n-word.

    And I don't think the Dice Guy needs something as crude as a DMPC. If DMPCs are mostly a tool to patch a glaring hole in a party composition (i.e. Joon played a cleric when no one wanted), on Aerb that's really not an issue. 

    Maybe if the end goal of Aerb is to manipulate/rehab Joon, maybe. But... Why? It's crude and risks compromising the goal.

      Poorly worded by me. In chapter 73 we get a 'Amarylis' POV except part way through Joon breaks the 4th wall and tells us that his narration is based on information given to him by Amarylis after the fact. The entire point of an Amarylis POV chapter, even second hand, still falls apart if she is a DMPC though as it would be mostly fabricated.

  Chapter 124 is now one of my absolute favorite chapters. It's an emotional/strategic heart-to-heart with my favorite character. I love seeing her whirlwind of competence in action, and seeing past that to her emotional human core that cares about her friends and feels the weight of her mistakes is something I love even more. One of the strongest moments of the early game was when Joon and Fenn burst into the Gold Mage's place to save her, and the moment she laid eyes on them, her loyalty went up a level. I could hear her thinking "they came back for me" after probably writing off the rest of her life as fucked because it wasn't feasible to save her. After she abandoned Joon to his death right after they met. 

  God this story is good, and has only been making large strides in the right directions lately.

- u/rumblestiltsken:
  ```
  I don't think it is more than metaphor, necessarily, but the start of this block was very heavy on mirroring, to the point that each character seemed like an aspect of Joon post Arthur dying.

  Grak as his self loathing and suicidality, Amaryllis as his disconnected, analytic nature, Bethel as his rage and grief at Arthur leaving. Not sure about solace and Valencia, maybe Valencia is his out of control decision making?

  I mean, he explicitly says that he favours stories with anthropomorphised character growth, and then the chapter where Amaryllis beats him up is called fight club, a movie where the mc beats himself up. Tons of other snippets, like Joon saying he could imagine cutting fingers off when he was grieving etc.

  If it wasn't so trite (and apparently denied), it would make me lean back towards the dmpc being Arthur and Joon.

        ah yes, perhaps anhedonia is a better aspect for her.

          ```
          Yeah, unlike the systematised magiscience of the rest of aerb, the locus is literally made of "anything you believe in is possible" magic. It's illness seems more like building futility.

          I think Valencia is about emptiness, but maybe also about neediness, making bad decisions, and poor impulse control. Her not particularly ill intentioned but terribly destructive manipulations of Joon and Fenn seem similar to the Maddie situation.

            Didn't think of that parallel before but actually really works. And its potentially relevant that the two were introduced at the same time in the plot. 

            There's also selfishness vs. ethics. She's trying to be ethical via what shes absorbed from Harry Potter. But constantly pushed towards bad actions by absorbing the minds of demons and devils along with fear of abandonment. (For earth Joon its short term self interest, having a relationship with Maddie even though he knew it was a bad idea.)

    Oh, that reminds me of something I noticed in the chapter. How did somebody on the Other Side know Uther's name, in order for the amulet to teleport him there?

    It depends on how the entad defines that (e.g. full name vs. first name vs. nickname, intent required, degree of phonetic similarity), but under some of those interpretations it seems very unlikely that it would be a totally random event.

    In such a scenario, how did they find out about Uther, and how much are they saying his name now that he's worried about ending up back there?

  So... Fel Seed sounds partially Zerg Overmind/Tyranid, partially Panacea on crack. Also vaguely Southern Reach-ish. Overall, my verdict is: that's a bad place; I recommend not going there. 

  I love libraries; I hope they end up travelling to the infinite library. This library outside of the world where you can fight things that will end existence as we know it... gotta say, I'm feeling some Library at Mount Char here, and that book was awesome.  

  Overall, these chapters have been good so far; I look forward to seeing where things go. As far as DMPCs in the present party go, I feel like what we're going to get at the end is something like...

  The Real DMPC Was Inside You All Along.

      The subject of the Southern Reach Trilogy by Jeff Vandermeer. Also, a movie that came out this year (Annihilation). 

      I read the books and then watched the movie; on the whole, I recommend the movie, but the books were fairly disappointing. Some good prose, but ultimately not worth a recommendation.  

      Basically, the books were [Mystery Boxes](https://qntm.org/mystery) throughout and there were no good answers to the central mysteries at any time. They had all the failings of mystery box works, and because the mystery was kept central to the books plot and not diluted with great characters or more sensible plot elements or whatever there's not really a lot to recommend. 

      The movie was not that *much* better at providing answers but the ending was more satisfactory and it also dragged out for significantly less time, and the visual effects, acting, etc were all pretty good, and a number of the characters were better realized even if they were very quickly sketched in because of the limitations of the cinematic format.
      ```

      - u/gryfft:
        ```
        I enjoyed the trilogy and didn't really feel it was *too* mystery-boxy; its greatest failing in my opinion is that it was a trilogy when it would have been more effective as a single volume. The gripping parts where the characters >!recognize and take measures against the hypnosis responsible for a good deal of the reality distortion they experience!< or, later on, >!face down and come to terms with the truly alien thing that has infected our reality, and realize that the intensely irrational policies of the Southern Reach organization stem from the fact that Area X has *infected* the hierarchy of the organization itself!< are altogether diluted by, frankly, a bunch of filler and red herrings. I don't think anything *really* interesting ever came of the S&SB plotlines, which was really a missed opportunity. (Not that it would have been better if their sleuthing had Gotten To The Bottom Of It All, but I compare that wandering plotline unfavorably to, say, [Cordyceps: Too Clever For Their Own Good](https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868), which is a great example of characters *trying* to Get To The Bottom Of It All >!with horrifying consequences!<.

  Other people and I have already mentioned this, but I'm going to mention this again, since further evidence has piled up in its favour:

  It is very plausible that Amaryllis is Dahlia who was repeatedly wound back to a young age using some entad/magic.

  Previous evidence includes that Amaryllis and Dahlia look extremely similar, to the point that people who knew Dahlia confused Amaryllis with her. Also, this a parsimonious explanation of things which might otherwise look like plotholes: 1. Anglecynn princes still have strong family resemblance after 10+ generations. 2. Anglecynn hasn't lost its entads to various royal bastards over the last 500 years. (Plus there are species long-lived enough to be able to kidnap a royal bastard and keep them in stasis for a couple hundred years [entads with similar effects are confirmed to exist, they are need for the creation of revision mages]). Both these observation could be explained by the Anglecynn princes repeatedly marrying a rewound Dahlia to 'refresh' their bloodlines claim on the various entads (and this also provides the motivation for Anglecynn to put in the resources to make this plan work).

  Things that provide further evidence this update: Dahlia was primarily lesbian, as is Amaryllis. Dahlia dated Pallida, Amaryllis seems to like Pallida. Dahlia lived to an old age (easier to have a chance to fake her death, as opposed to falling in battle which is hard to fake and happened to several of Uthers companions).

  While writing this I decided to go back and check which entads Amaryillis has access to too check if she has the inheritance profile you'd expect from Dahlia, and more importantly make sure that Amaryillis doesn't have access to anything that Dahlia wouldn't have had access too:

  From:

  >“Whatever happened between Uther and Zona, she gave him two sons and a daughter, all in fairly quick succession,” said Amaryllis. “This was during the period when the First Empire had been founded but not all of the eventual member polities had joined. A year after Dahlia was born, the ice wizards invaded, and Zona was kidnapped."

  I take that the birth order was the two sons, then Dahlia.

  From Amaryllis' character description:

  >"Amaryllis is the most direct descendant of Uther Penndraig, the Lost King, which gives her special claim-in-fact to a fair number of his estates and heirlooms bound along cognatic or enatic primogeniture, ultimogeniture, and gavelkind rules."

  These are as follows:

  Cognatic primogeniture: Cognatic descent means tracing both male and female line, primogeniture means preferring the eldest, ie. the order goes eldest son, second son, Dahlia. So Dahlia would inherit this if Uther managed to outlive both his sons (very plausible).

  Enatic primogeniture: Enatic means related via female line, so I assume this system means eldest daughter inherits, that's Dahlia.

  Ultimogeniture: This is inheritance by the youngest child, that's Dahlia.

  Gavelkind: This one is complicated since their are [several systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavelkind) with that name, however it stands to reason that Dahlia would do well under all rule sets (The exception being English Gavelkind and Uther writing an extremely spiteful will). The Welsh and Irish rules tend to split up the inheritance making it more difficult to control a large chunk after 10 generations.

  Also, Amaryllis lacks access to male-preference primogeniture which her family ought to have been able to acquire and pass on to her as an only child, though might simply be the case that there are no entads which use that system.
  ```

  - u/LordGoldenroot:
    ```
    While I like your theory, there is one major issue and several minor ones. The major one is that revision magic normally kills you if you are reverted past a certain point, and while there are some rare entads or items that can cancel that out, there is little chance she would not have accidentally become a revision mage at some point if those were used. For some minor ones: people would have almost certainly noticed if the same person showed up like that for centuries, and if she was someone that important anglecyn would almost certainly not have acted the way they did with regards to her and would have tried much harder to protect her, especially with how people in their government kept on trying to jill her and this seemed to be a semi-open secret.
    ```

    - u/WarningInsanityBelow:
      ```
      I don't think revision magic is what would be being used to set Dahlia back, another problem besides killing her and turning her into a revision mage is that it would only go up until the most recent time Dahlia had teleported. It would have to be some other magic /entad.

      The fact that Anglecynn doesn't try harder to protect Amaryillis is evidence against Amaryillis being Dahlia, but not very strong one since there are plausibly reasons for this being the case. One is that simply not many parts of Anglecynn know that Amaryllis is Dahlia (too better keep the secret), another is that the organization winding Dahlia back might have been deliberately set up to be very hands off (plausible that previous incarnations of Dahlia would do this if she had a hand in setting it up), another is that if Dahlia dies it is not a huge set back since there would still be people who count as Uthers grandchild and could be used to continue the project.

      Assuming Dahlia skips a generation every time, with her family's slow birth rate that would mean she'd show up at the court every ~80 years or so, that's long enough that humans who knew her previous incarnation would have only known her as an old woman, and would think that Dahlia shows a strong family resemblance rather than being the same person. The only problem would be if Dahlia had regular contact to a member of a long lived race across incarnations, but those seem to be at least somewhat rare.

    It sounds like Vervain was used by the DM to keep Uther on the rails without Uther's knowledge. And considering that Juniper was actively hostile to the DM when they met, it would totally make sense for the DM to also have a secret agent doing his bidding.

    ```
    Fel Seed, from Juniper's brief description, seems to be capable of:

    * Making arbitrary alterations to any biomatter he touches.

    * Creating biomatter *ex nihilo*.

    His other abilities are derived from these two. His body is faster/stronger/sturdier than humans' because he designed it himself, using some impressive biological materials. For the same reason he is completely immune to various threats, such as poisons or mind control. He also created hundreds of thousands of obedient biological monstrosities, with much the same abilities. And then because he doesn't have an upper limit on the biomass he is able to control, he went and filled the entire ~65,000-meters-wide sphere he is confined to with himself.

    So you'd need to instantly annihilate ~1,200,000 km^3 of matter to kill him.

    Fortunately, Shia Labeof scales to any threat! So Fel Seed dies.

    ___

    To put it another way, Fel Seed doesn't have any conceptual immunities: he isn't "impossible" to kill, it's just a bit hard to do so. Shia Labeof's power *is* conceptual, however, as he develops new powers until he kills his targets, and in the general case conceptual >> not-conceptual, which means Fel Seed would lose.

    That's all assuming we know everything relevant about both Shia Labeof and Fel Seed, of course, which is unlikely. In particular, Amaryllis keeps using the word "impossible" when referring to their ability to kill Fel Seed, which makes me think there's something else at play here, given her distaste for overstating threats. And of course it's possible that Shia's power has an upper limit.

    Oops, did I say Shia's full name thre
    ```

    - u/xachariah:
      ```
      Except that we don't know if Shia has an upper limit.  He can be supernatural/conceptual and still have limitations.

      All we know is that Shia can kill hundreds and has killed thousands.  Hell, they did try to use it as a terrorist weapon and it still only killed ~hundreds at a time.  That's fairly low end.  

      There's a big difference between 'scales limitlessly' and 'scales enough to massacre a battalion of people'.
      ```

      - u/Noumero:
        ```
        There's another potential issue: the assumption that Fel Seed is singular.

        Suppose Fel Seed's current primary flesh-puppet says "Shia Labeof" thrice. Does Shia kill Fel Seed's entire exclusion zone, or *only that individual puppet*? There's nothing stopping Fel Seed from going all Doris Finch, and if each instance of him counts as a separate individual...

        The same is true for employing cognitohazards against him. It will compromise a number of his instances, but then his autonomous self-monitoring systems will kill them upon noticing their abnormal behaviour, and his dead-man's switches will create a new batch of Fel Seeds from backups.

        (Or, at least, that's how I would have set it up if I were him.)

        Dropping the Void Beast on him is still a foolproof plan that can't possibly go wrong, though, u/blueeyedlion.

  So... does Fel Seed's magic count parts of his flesh that aren't physically connected to the 'whole' when it comes to the regeneration thing?

  However, that would imply some sort of super stretched-out flesh monster, and the 'blink-fast' description seems further evidence that Fel Seed himself is a dude, and the other flesh is unconnected from his body, but he still retains a degree of control over it, given 'flesh-monster.'

  So, what's the trouble with taking over hell? You can literally assassinate leaders and find all their plans in advance, plus you can get strategy advice (possibly rigged, mind you) of demons with literally thousands of years experience fighting demons. They're already fighting against each other, just keep it focused on scapegoat demons and they'll do half the work for you.

  Meanwhile, infernoscopes are cheap and easy to acquire, so you could potentially delegate scouting to do it en masse (you'd have to keep it secret from the demons, but demons don't have many friends - I suspect only cultists and people who've killed people to hide secrets often enough that demons are a preferable alternative somehow), and you could free specific hell-prisoners and (preferably with people about to die of sickness, since you don't have much to hold over people after they're dead) potentially send them instructions for a coordinated human rebellion.

  Coordinated rebellion would have to be timed right, since it would encourage demons to unite against the "oh shit, our food source is trying to kill us", but really, any sort of centralised demon army seems like an easy target, and the rebellions mere *existence* will starve the demons of food.

  I mean, it's not "insta-win", sure, but only 25%? How?

  Also, ask Raven what tactic let the demons win that 75%, if she knows. It just seems weird. Like, maybe it's a numbers-game, but if they don't have a specific way of getting onto Aerb and taking out Valencia, then sooner or later (with her IIRC exponential maw-growth) she'll just eat them all.

  Point is, " let's wipe out all the demons" is the most popular thing ever, and anyone who believes they could die would support it by default (if they know about it). Why such low chances?
  ```

  - u/HeckDang:

    Valencia is the core pillar holding up the entire operation, so all the infernals have to do is knock out that pillar somehow to win. 

    I suspect it would involve betrayal by her, considering how young and malleable she is, but it would only take, say, one non-anima being controlled by a particularly competent infernal to stop her in a more conventional way, for example.

    The informational side of things is the tricky part, so long as the infernals have some way of knowing that Valencia is their target then there might be all manner of different ways of taking her out. The longer Valencia gets to act in secret the better topside's chances are of winning.

      Yea, well, I'm guessing that won't be *much* longer. Once the Imperial office got note of her, it's only a matter of time until someone in the know dies without their soul being recovered, and then the demons might get it from that poor soul.

    1. we know that there's about a trillion people in the hells.

    2. we don't know how many trillions of devils there are, but we do know that people are a scarce and valuable resource in hell, with only high ranking, millennia old devils being able to own one.

    3. Valencia started off gaining dozens of tendrils per level, then hundreds per level, then thousands per level. She now has tens of thousands of tendrils, and is likely to have millions by level 20, if this rate of progression stays steady.

    4. There's a limit to how many demons she can devour before she needs to recover , and we can guess that she's mostly eating the weaker, younger demons near the surface hells. 

    5. Even one demon breaking out of the hells is a major event that requires specialized teams to handle.


    Working from that, let's say that a high powered Valencia can devour five million demons a day, and that there are only five trillion demons in the invasion force. 

    She would need to work non stop for over a thousand years to make a noticeable dent in their numbers, and it would take nearly three thousand years to wipe out the initial invasion force. However, we also don't know how demons reproduce , or the full capabilities of the ruling demons in the lowest hells.

     A 25% chance of victory seems optimistic.

    She has one adjective, no emotional depth, very little exposition, and is being set-up for a confrontation that will damage the group.

    I can see the argument for that, given that Aerith in FF7 could be described as a DMPC: “Girlfriend-NPC that dies to move the plot forward, but also provided levity while she was alive—and accepted death with open arms—precisely because she wasn’t taking being alive seriously in the same way everyone else was, because she was just a temporary manifestation of a higher-dimensional being (the lifestream; the DM.)”

    Also in the sense that a PC that dies 2/3rds of the way through a campaign is somewhat of a problem for their player, in terms of that player now having to build a replacement character that will start out with no rapport to a meshed team. —unless, of course, that player is the DM, because the DM doesn’t *need* to replace the DMPC with another. They can just stop having a DMPC.

  It's a great setting, especially because of the other side being habitable. I think it would be used more in fiction if it wasn't pretty much impossible for it to work in the real world because of engineering issues. But having it set inside a sim where you don't have to worry about material strength or making it thick enough for gravity to work means it can work perfectly.

      This work *generally* uses male or female pronouns for dwarves, partly because it's a bit jarring/confusing to break out a third gender, partly because it's an absolute pain to write, and partly because Groglir is an ergative-absolutive language instead of a nominative-accusative language (meaning that it's even easier to screw up).

    From the Library's perspective (or more accurately, from the perspective of nominal authors of the books in the library), anyone who goes into the Library vanishes, never to be seen nor heard from again, which is obviously not the case, since people *do* exit the Library.

    However, the Library resets when people go *in*, even though it's already accounts for those people by pretending that they vanished forever. So Amaryllis is asking why the Library would reset, since in theory it doesn't need to change the future that it's portraying, which already accounts for that disappearance.

    - u/adgnatum:

    Not necessarily. It's more likely that the entity has to tailor each message to the intended recipient's current mental state in order to successfully basilisk-hack them. As a consequences, the messages wouldn't work for anyone else, or even for that same recipient, but a day later.

It's probably not generally superintelligent or literally omniscient, otherwise it would have suborned Raven and the other librarians when they read its followers' books, but it could still be very smart and knowledgeable.

        What I'm confused about is that part where it could directly communicate with its followers immediately after infecting them. How? Do its memagents conduct some sort of "ritual" upon entering human mind, which creates an extraplanar telepathic link? Or is there some kind of general "psychic network", and the infectees get plugged into it? Or does it just load a copy of itself into every infected human, with no "direct communication" necessary?

        None of these ideas sound all that convincing. Maybe all this talk about "dangerous moving images" is just fluff with no predicative power, and it actually works on bullshit magic.

     Maybe not the DMPC himself in his role as a character, but the DMPC is still the DM, and the DM is behind all of this. Uther went through decades of constant life-and-death battles that continually escalated and frequently involved harsh sacrifices borne by himself and his loved ones. And then he finds out that his oldest friend and mentor, the person who has been with him  since his very first adventure, is the actually the cosmic entity that's spent years trapping him in this narrative cycle? It's absolutely understandable that Uther would feel a soul-crushing betrayal... and if you wanted to break the cycle, wouldn't it make sense to kill the entity responsible for keeping you trapped in it?

    &#x200B;
    ```

    - u/eroticas:
      ```
      Well no... If you *really* didn't wanna play, you'd just... stop moving or keep killing yourself. Killing the dmpc accomplishes zero and has important drawbacks. 

      1) you're still trapped 2) the dm can just grab a new character, take over another existing party member 3) what if you're wrong 4) everyone who is stuck in the simulation with you but doesn't agree with you is now upset 5) the character might still be their own person *despite* also being a dmpc (the dm just created a real person and minor manipulated them to make the necessary decisions)

      If you're going with the strategy of giving the game an honest play through, which is what Joon and Arther are basically doing, this doesn't really make sense.
      ```

      - u/AurelianoTampa:
        ```
        >you're still trapped

        Uncertain if that's going to be the outcome or not. What Uther did know is that for decades the narrative cycle continued... and  Vervain was there the entire time, urging him on. Knowing Vervain is the DM (or a character controlled by the DM) could mean that taking the DM out of the game makes the game stop.

        I don't mean Aerb gets destroyed - I mean all the big nasty monsters that the DM keeps throwing at the world stop showing up.

        >2) the dm can just grab a new character, take over another existing party member

        Sure, that's a potential problem... but Uther didn't know how the DM's powers work. Maybe he could grab others, maybe Vervain was custom-made by him. What he knew for sure is that the DM was there, right next to him, and very stab-able.

        >3) what if you're wrong

        It sounds like Uther was getting to the point where he knew eventually he couldn't go on (emotionally). Before he got to that point, wouldn't it make sense to exhaust his options, however unlikely they might seem? If killing Vervain stopped the cycle, Uther could wipe up the remaining horrors in his own time and finally relax a bit and tend to his mental health.

        >4) everyone who is stuck in the simulation with you but doesn't agree with you is now upset

        Yep, and that's exactly what happened! Uther rolled the dice, and it didn't work out for him. I imagine he still felt it was a gamble he had to take as he got increasingly more desperate to stop the cycle.

        >5) the character might still be their own person *despite* also being a dmpc (the dm just created a real person and minor manipulated them to make the necessary decisions)

        And again, it's quite possible that that could have been the case. Which would hasten Uther's mental checkout... but not killing Vervain wouldn't have stopped it anyway. By the time you're contemplating the murder of a companion who's been with you for decades, your mental health obviously isn't in a great state.

        >If you're going with the strategy of giving the game an honest play  through, which is what Joon and Arther are basically doing, this doesn't  really make sense.

        That's the thing though; Uther did give it an honest playthrough, but it wore him down to an emotionally exhausted wreck. And then the hits just kept on coming. He didn't want Aerb to be destroyed if he just stopped playing, but he also knew eventually he wouldn't be able to keep playing at all. So he tried to get the DM to stop throwing catastrophes at the world... and failed to do so. So when Uther checked out and left later, the world was screwed for years to come... exactly like he feared it would be.

        That's my take on it, anyway :)
