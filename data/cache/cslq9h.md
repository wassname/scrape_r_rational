If you're new to Pyrebound, it's a fantasy serial (first installment is [here](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/)) about a young man struggling to make ends meet in a brutal world whose civilization has developed to endure a recurring four-day cycle of magical catastrophes.  Much of the world is modeled on the ancient Near East, and it's quite a complex one.

If you're *not* new to Pyrebound, thanks for following Ram so far, and for all the feedback, support, votes, etc.  You guys are great.

  This is not an important ask, but it would be nice to have links at the top to the previous/next chapters. You already have them at the bottom
