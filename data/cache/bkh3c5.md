  Knowing that it was a solvable mystery may have made it too easy to solve. I figured it out the minute people got sick. Generally I don't have a strong track record on such predictions.

  \--It occurs to me that, if you had an AI-containing supercomputer or a cold-sleep chamber or anything else that you had a strong need to stay untouched for a vast length of time, a secret inner chamber in such a place might be an *excellent* hiding spot.  Or rather, I could imagine myself thinking 'Isn't it even more likely that any really important things would have been hidden in the middle of all this, rather than elsewhere?' and wanting to send in people in lead-lined suits to check...  (For which matter, presumably no evidence that there aren't such secret plans for these facilities in reality?  Which now is better, low-security that no one knows about or high-security that everyone knows about, but without knowledge that there's something there...)

  Pondering pictures.  A skull, of course, for humans is most evocative.  If resolution could be maintained, a graphic multi-panel representation of causes and observable symptoms...  hm.

  This was apparently not the twist, but can anyone explain to me why the hell everyone is ponies?

    It's a My Little Pony fanfic site.

  It was obvious from the start.
  Every detail just confirmed it more.

  But it's great anyway.

    Honestly, having run into those before, just being told that the mystery is solvable ruined it from paragraph 5.

    Dammit, I should have read the story before your comment!

  How long is it?
  ```

  - u/erwgv3g34:
    ```
    5,659 words long. It's a one-shot; a short story.
    ```

  My hypothesis without spoilers and reading about halfway: it's an old radioactive dump site and they're trying to make it look as scary as possible to keep people away. I figure this because I've seen similar ideas in a youtube video about keeping vastly different future cultures away from our long-lasting radioactive waste.

  Edit: Yup. Got it at "looking scary is the first line of defense for a lot of old tombs". I'm pretty sure the story was inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOEqzt36JEM) or one of its sources.
