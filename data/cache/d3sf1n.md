  Thank you to everyone that has listened to chapters as they were released. Please like and comment on the video to boost its YouTube rankings,

  I am paying my editor to edit each chapter released thanks to the wonderful people supporting the project on [Patreon.com](https://Patreon.com). I am running at a bit of a loss each week so if there is anyone who wants to support the editing process and keep these chapters coming out as fast as possible then please head over to Patreon and take a look.

  Every chapter is also available in podcast form from all major podcast apps.

  Thanks again for all your love and support

  Jack

    When do you think the audiobook version will be completed approximately? I don't like starting incomplete things. Been waiting on Mother of Learning to wrap for ages so I can read it, but I can wait a bit longer for the audiobook version potentially.

      It could take a while. Its a chapter a every at the moment. If I suddenly got a massive amount support on Patreon I may be able to do it a lot faster but cant afford the editing to do it much quicker.

        *a chapter every week

    On his patreon  he said the final update will be in November, but I wont be surprised if delays pushed it back to December / Christmas.

  Honest question that you will most likely find rude, but do you have nobody103â€™s permission to use his content? Also would the profits from YouTube & other websites be going straight to him? (Ofc whatever Patreon sponsors wish to give  should be going to you for content creation)
  ```

  - u/JackVoraces:
    ```
    We discussed this in length before I started recording so yes there is permission. There are no adds on the video so no money being made. If I'm able to put adds on later then I would discuss it with the author.
    ```

      ```
      It might be best to add this to the video description, as more people in the future are bound to ask this - no point in replying to each and every person!

    ```
    To quote the audiobook creator's response to a similar inquiry on an earlier post:

    > I contacted the author and we discussed the production of a free podcast of me narrating Mother of Learning. He agreed and we have progressed from there.
    ```
