## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  I have a pinched nerve in my C6/7 area of my spine and light tears in both of my rotator cuffs from falling while rock climbing in January. I haven't been able to climb since and have been restricted in working out. I'm finally getting an appointment with a physical therapist because my new jobs insurance is finally kicking in but I'm just really frustrated.

  I miss my climbing friends and haven't seen them in several months. I miss making progress in something I enjoyed and I feel way less healthy than I was a few months ago, despite the fact that I have been doing cardio 6 days a week and lower body workouts 3 days a week. 

  Anyone else just need to vent about terrible shit in their lives? I'll commiserate with you.

    I've been in a job for more than a year now where I'm well underpaid - and by that I don't mean I'm underappreciated, I mean that average salaries for equivalent graduates are more than double my own. The only reason I've stuck around is because of promises of a forthcoming takeover which would result in big pay bumps and equity payments. 

    It's now looking increasingly likely that that takeover is not going to happen, at least anytime soon, meaning I've basically wasted the last 6 months. Plus, I do actually like the job and don't look forward to moving on, but there's no way I can carry on with this kind of pay. Just a bit shit all round

    I'm handing my masters' dissertation in soon, and I'll have to wait over two months to get my results (don't ask). I'm going to be massively stressing the whole time because if I get a bad grade on this I might not be able to get the job I want when I graduate this summer (I have an offer conditional on getting a certain grade). There's still a load of exams until then as well, so I'll need to be revising a lot and generally get very involved with course material, some of which overlaps with my dissertation. I don't think I'll be able to fully relax until mid-June.

      I have no idea if this applies to dissertations, but when I handed in a final paper for one of my classes, I asked my professor if he could grade it first out of everyone in the class so I could get my grade back sooner. I don't remember why I needed to know right away if I passed this one class, but he was willing to let me know sooner than usual. Maybe if you explained to your professor how much anxiety waiting for your results will be, they might be willing to let you know sooner.

  I recently found a mature hierarchical task network (HTN) library in [SHOP3](https://github.com/shop-planner/shop3). I think it might let me finally make (atleas as a proof of concept of) a game idea I have had for a while. It's loosely based off of the Azkaban scene in HPMOR in specific (and in general on the rational trope of "alternate voices arguing in your head" or "thinking from someone else's perspective").

  Primarily a planner can be used to simulate a perspective on a problem domain. Each planner can assign different costs to different plan structures, and order considerations of alternatives in different ways. And then through game play upgrade mechanics one can influence how a "voice" thinks, and what it provides you. Some of the things it provides you can be purely game mechanical of course, but the cool part is that others can be the emergent through the result of the planning system on the state of the simulation.

  For example the "Slytherin" voice of personal gain. Do you upgrade it towards economic value, cunning and efficiency or towards brutality, fear, and evil? Perhaps you make a clone of it and do both? Perhaps only certain actions can be taken if this voice thinks of it? Perhaps only it can discover economic hacks? Perhaps it can make fear based actions available to other planners?

  The main difficulty is the detail of the simulation required for the planners to demonstrate emergent behavior. However it would make an interesting mix of puzzle and simulation, the planners would come up with similar viewpoints even though in the face of a continuous system. It could also be used to simulate adversaries, by giving them more powerful actions, and the player more viewpoints.

  My French visa arrived on Monday!!! I've booked my flights! I'll be in Paris from the 25th of May till the 25th of November! THIS IS NOT A DRILL!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  Now I need to find a houseshare. I've never done houseshare before: only with partners. So... does anyone have tips? Especially because I'm probably going to have to commit to something without seeing it (I've got 2.5 weeks of airbnb booked). I'm a 31 year old woman and I'll be studying while I'm there, but I go to bed early and wake up early (it's 6am right now and I woke up 20 minutes ago). 

  I signed up for a French houseshare ads website and I noticed a lot of women in their 50s/60s are renting out rooms: is this the sort of thing that'd be a good fit for me, or do the sorts of women who rent out rooms tend to have personalities that make living with them suboptimal? 

  I do have a friend from uni who lives in Paris, and a penpal from a language learning app who lives there too, so if I'm serious about a place I might be able to convince one of them to inspect it on my behalf to make sure it's not full of cockroaches: do you recommend that? 

  Any and all tips would be greatly appreciated.

    >friend from uni who lives in Paris

    Any reason why you can't stay with that friend or ask the friend if s/he knows anyone trustworthy looking for a roommate?

    >inspect it on my behalf to make sure it's not full of cockroaches: do you recommend that?

    Absolutely, if you can get someone to manually inspect the place, that's very good.

    >Especially because I'm probably going to have to commit to something without seeing it (I've got 2.5 weeks of airbnb booked)

    I'm confused. If you have a place to live in Paris for 2.5 weeks, why do you need to commit to a houseshare without looking at the place? Plenty of places allow you to move in very shortly after inspection. When I was looking for an apartment in Baltimore, I could have moved in within a few days after an inspection. Just pick a bunch of houses you are interested in moving into, book appointments, and go all over Paris while you are staying at your AirBnb.

    >tips

    Ask about your housemate's schedule. If you are a morning person, then you might be most comfortable with a night owl so that there's minimal interaction when you need to use a bathroom or eating. Then again, you might want someone with a similar schedule so that the two of you are sleeping at roughly the same times for minimal noise/interruptions at night. It varies, but ask about their daily schedule.

      > Any reason why you can't stay with that friend or ask the friend if s/he knows anyone trustworthy looking for a roommate?

      That's the first thing I did, he doesn't know anyone, alas!

      >  why do you need to commit to a houseshare without looking at the place

      ... because I've never been in a houseshare before, and I'm also a real Type A obsessive planner, and the thought of going to Paris for 6 months with "only" 2.5 weeks of accommodation booked gives me major anxiety, even though I know worst case scenario I can afford a last minute hotel / hostel / airbnb fee. But I think you are probably right, especially since the vast majority of "house share" ads I'm seeing are available either immediately or within a week or two. 

      > Just pick a bunch of houses you are interested in moving into, book appointments, and go all over Paris while you are staying at your AirBnb.

      I appreciate that, I will only commit to something in advance if it's "perfect" (and be ready to forfeit any deposit if it turns out to be full of cockroaches). 

      > Then again, you might want someone with a similar schedule so that the two of you are sleeping at roughly the same times for minimal noise/interruptions at night.

      Yeah I have real trouble sleeping if there's noise so I think I'd want to find another morning person, which is why I was thinking that maybe a single woman in her 50s or 60s might be a really good option for me.

  I'm following a most excellent quest, [Dragon Ball: After The End](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dragon-ball-after-the-end.30940/), and was hoping to pick /r/rational's brains for some ideas on the latest challenge (with the author's permission!)

  Avoiding spoilers, the players have finally gotten started on a long-planned research project to recreate the lost art of the Perfect Multiform - a technique which splits the user into multiple identical bodies as strong as the original, far superior to the currently-known Multiform which splits the user's strength as well. The challenge is in deciding how to achieve this.

  >Premise 1: Multiform, as a technique, functions by using one's energy to split into multiple physical forms, all of which draw from the same energy pool when determining their own. Naturally, this splits one's energy pool into equal parts (historically, two to four).

  >Premise 2: It is a matter of historical record that achieving a four-way ["perfect"] multiform with each clone being at the full power of the original is possible. Furthermore, this historical instance appeared to be without serious intrinsic drawbacks, although it was certainly far less decisive than one might expect.

  >Premise 3: It is not theoretically impossible to outright demand that one's energy duplicate itself, although practically speaking it has never been done, and it would likely involve a significant up-front expenditure of energy.

  >Premise 4: Similarly, there exist plentiful techniques to boost one's energy level beyond its default maximum, and thus the clones resulting from a multiform could artificially boost their energy levels to, "base," at the cost of significant ongoing strain.

  The default options are:

  * To simply split the user's Ki reserves and avoid losing potency, which would leave each body with 1/4 of the stamina.

  * To investigate stretching out the clones' ki with techniques that boost the user's strength for brief periods, which would leave them at "full" strength - but such techniques invariably cause great strain on the body, drastically reducing the time the clone survives for.

  There was some discussion around making use of the [Banach-Tarski Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach%E2%80%93Tarski_paradox), but after investigation the author ruled that this was not compatible with their model of ki.
  The author has outright invited the players to try and game this system if we can, but we're stumped. Admittedly it might just be that no better solution exists, but does anyone here have any ideas? To again quote the author:
  > The moving part in question [given the above premises, which are assumed to be true given the information available to the thread] is that multiform intrinsically involves splitting off new physical forms from an existing ki source. Is there some other way you can think of to game that system?

  EDIT: I reposted this in the [Saturday Thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ba5797/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ek9hvj2/), because on reflection it fits better there.
  ```

  - u/Sonderjye:
    ```
    What's the strain that are being put on you when combining an energy boosting technique and using a regular multiform to make full powered copies? Mental strain? If so does there exist mental boosting techniques?

    From what I remember from DB then one powerful attack is more impactful than multiple weak attacks so it seems suboptimal to split into multiple forms and use the energy booster rather than just using the energy booster.

    An important detail I find is whether any laws on conservation of energy is in play or whether that isn't the case. If internal energy is regenerating I wonder what's stopping you from storing energy either in internal or external storage parts. If you could absorb energy to quadruple your current mojo and then split immediately there should only be a short moment of intense strain rather than the strain of multiple copies.

    I personally find the idea of boosting techniques interesting. Are they summoning energy from somewhere or how does that work?
    ```

    - u/Flashbunny:
      ```
      So, I can recall 4 boosting techniques that we know of:

      * The Kaio-Ken, which boosts the user's strength (or "Power Level") by using your life force - this passively damages the user as time goes on, and is more and more self-destructive the stronger a user gets.
      * A technique which burns through a user's reserves to "use up" the ki faster, which in practice means a few minutes of a 10x increase or so, from memory, before the user is exhausted.
      * Willpower Pushes - this is the nod to Dragon Ball's "yelling to get stronger", where through sheer force of will the user temporarily raises their Power Level (mechanically in the quest, a Willpower check that recurs at a higher difficulty as time passes.
      * A passive % boost to Power Level maintained indefinitely by "refining" the user's ki - this is of course something already in use.

      You are correct that multiple weak combatants are generally inferior to a single stronger combatant - hence why Multiform is considered relatively useless in real combat. Perfect Multiform would not be so, as the user would not get weaker. The goal here is to create a technique that clones the user without losing strength, and then have every clone use any energy boosters.

      Storing energy for later use is a hypothesised workaround the thread hopes to eventually get around to, and is probably going to be the default solution - we're just trying to figure out whether or not there's a better way to approach this, by tweaking the technique.
      ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        If you have access to Hyperbolic Time Chambers, storing energy may be doable if you could reverse the direction of time dilation and fire high-energy attacks at something inside it which will reflect them. When you turn off the time dilation, you can reabsorb the energy.
        ```

      - u/RetardedWabbit:
        ```
        It seems like the real goal of Perfect Multiform is to give each clone a copy of your power level cap instead of splitting or sharing it among them. I guess you could flat out DNA clone yourself since DNA(or something) holds power, as we saw from Cell, then pass it off as a multiform clone?

        I don't know where that cap comes from, maybe you need to attach a separate copy of your soul to each clone? You could also pull this off if you could temporarily increase your cap 2x then split the cap with a clone if that makes the temporary boost permanent.

        Improving the plain multiform:
        Destructive power boosting; do a shared power split then have clones use boosting techniques if they don't hurt the whole to boost the shared power pool. Having clones entirely devoted to willpower pushes and ki refinement should work, kaio-ken probably hurts the shared soul? You can put clones into time dilation to magnify this if it works, they meditate/burn themselves out faster relative to the other clones.
        ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    So far, I only have one idea that seem like it could work for recreating Perfect Multiform.

    Make it so that all four clones are somehow still connected to each other metaphysically where everyone draws on the same ki pool instead of splitting the pool. This means that every clone has access to the full reservoir and therefore remain at full-power. The obvious drawback is that the user's ki will be expended four times faster than normal if all four clones are attacking at once. It's just having the user be in four places at once instead of being four people.

    Well I am strudleing to think of anything that wouldn't also allow to produse unimited ki.

    What produces ki in the quest? Is it the physical strength of a fighter or their soul. Maybe to solution is proform the technique with your soul body + normal body. 

    > splitting off new physical forms from an existing ki source

    That seams to hint that you don't have to use your own. Maybe it is like the spirit bomb where you gather power from the world and use that to fuel the technique. 

    Prehaps the trick is to get really good at moveing the ki the the multiform body that needs it most. So most of the ki goes to a body right when it attacks or blocks and then is divded back out. That way you could block and fire attacks at fullpower while also haveing the benifit of being in multipule places at once. The main problem with this is you have to time your attacks so the don't happen at exatly the same time.

      This is an excellent idea - unfortunately, the PC's Power Level far outstrips that of the planet around them (though not all of their contemporaries.)

    >Tips for traveling abroad would be helpful too.

    So assuming you're american, rather than European:

    1. Do your level best to minimize your luggage. If you've traveled by air before you likely already know how to do this, but if you haven't, you typically find yourself using only a fraction of the stuff that you bring.  
    2. If you miss a plane that would force you to stay in an airport overnight because of something that's the airline's fault, you can (usually) get something out of the airline representative, like a free or heavily subsidized night at a hotel, or in-airport food credits, or whatever.  
    3. There's a high likelihood of getting sick, no matter how hygenic you are. Long distance air travel really screws with your immune system. You'll still be able to enjoy your vacation, but be prepared to need cough syrup.  
    4. Remember to get a plug adapter! The brits have their own special kind of outlet. You can buy one at an airport, but it will be crappy and overpriced.

  From *Overcoming Bias* recently:

  > The first farmers paid a heavy price for their way of life. Though they still hunted and gathered wild foods, their crops and livestock had circumscribed their movements and they were eating an increasingly narrow spectrum of foods and suffering a range of previously uncommon afflictions.

  I’m curious whether we have a good scientific consensus on what a pre-agricultural human diet would look like.

  Does anyone here know: is there any scientific study of what exactly the human diet of the Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness consisted of? Presumably this would be “the set of foods that humans could manage to forage from the plains and/or treetops of Africa without yet having reliable access to cooking fire, but probably having constant access to grinding things between rocks”, and probably had a lot in common with the diet of chimpanzees, with the key difference that there are things chimps can chew open with their powerful jaws that we can’t (but a lot of that is balanced by grinding things between rocks.)

  It’d be interesting to try it as a fad diet, to say the least. (Though it probably contains a good number of plant+animal species that only exist in sub-Saharan Africa, so maybe this research would be best conducted at the University of Cape Town.)

  I also imagine a good deal of the diet’s effect would come down to the sheer variety of things eaten; the fact that many of the foods are eaten only periodically due to second-order population boom/bust effects as many other animals compete to eat those same things; and the fact that many of the foods are eaten only within tight seasonal bounds (e.g. flowers in bloom; birds from elsewhere caught mid-migration.)

    Your question could have been phrased better. Homo Sapiens probably always had fire, the consensus is that it was habitually used 300 000 years ago, ergo around 100 thousand years before homo sapiens 'existed'.

    Fish, seafood, roots, meats, nuts, fruits and vegetables. Basically, they ate things that people can eat and aren't man made / selectively bred like most animals, plants, and fruits we eat today..

    Fish is often overlooked, they probably ate more fish than other meats, because fishing is easier than hunting. 

    > Does anyone here know: is there any scientific study of what exactly the human diet of the Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness consisted of? 

    This is a common misconception, areas like archaeology, anthropology, history, geography don't generally have "studies". They publish things, hypothesis and theories based on findings, but they can't do control tests or run experiments, most of their best evidence would be considered 'anecdotal' by statisticians. 

    &#x200B;

    What they do is come up with a most likely range of possible values, based on findings and the evidence they have available. Then experts come to a consensus on what ranges are most likely to be true, and that becomes the accepted data until more evidence surfaces and they can refine it even more.

    &#x200B;

    It is particularly annoying because some people can just deny their evidence, say it's all circumstantial and anecdotal, to pass on their own agendas, and refuse to believe things that we are basically sure are true because the evidence is 'anecdotal'.

  For the first time in a very long time, today I found myself /wanting/ a thing. Usually, I'm quite content with what I have, and classically stoic about what I can't; after all, my life is much better than, say, a 16th-century French peasant's. But my browsing has just brought me to the two rodent Venetian masks shown at https://www.flickr.com/photos/flatworldsedge/5255475917/sizes/l and at https://www.flickr.com/photos/flatworldsedge/5123591774/sizes/l/ , and I can't stop my thoughts from turning back to them again and again.

  Those pictures are eight years old, and those particular masks aren't listed on the store's website ( http://www.cadelsolmascherevenezia.com/en/masks/27 ); and I have neither access to a 3D printer nor the skills to turn those jpegs into a 3d-printable file; nor the social network to get in touch with anyone who could do anything of the sort.

  And yet, I want.

  It's been long enough since I wanted something I don't have that it feels like a new emotion to me, and I suspect I'm wallowing more in the experience-of-wanting than I actually want a mask. But hey, there are lots of worse things that could happen to me than that, so I figure it's still a win. :)

  What are some good, relatively small, subreddits to subscribe to? I am only subbed to 3 at the moment and quickly exhaust all their content when I log on.

    Looking in my list: 

    I have my home city sub, sometimes people make nice connections there. Some hobby related stuff: /r/printsf, /r/boardgames, /r/magictcg, /r/space. 

    The expert discussion ones: /r/askahistorian, /r/askscience. The feedstyle ones: /r/goodlongposts /r/threadkillers, /r/bestof and since that one is pretty overrun with bad stuff nowadays. For the people who crave reddit experience with deep discussions and articles  /r/truereddit and for those who find that too mainstream /r/truetruereddit. 

    Now we have circled all the way back to /r/rational, slatestarcodex gets linked often in those last ones.

      Before all of your subreddits, you have /u/ which means you are linking to a user with these names. You need /r/ before the names to link to the subreddits.

      Your first link goes to an empty subreddit - did you perhaps get the name a little wrong? I'd be interested to see such a list.

    ```
    One of my favourite parts of reddit is discussion threads around a piece of media that I enjoy, like TV shows/movies/webserial/webcomic. I recommend you look for something you enjoy, and see if there's a community built around it. 

    Some that I like are r/brakebills, /r/gunnerkrigg, r/blackmirror, r/TrueFilm, and the odd thread on r/anime or r/movies.
