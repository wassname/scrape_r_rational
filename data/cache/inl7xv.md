## Rationalfiction.io down?

### Post:

It appears that rationalfiction.io (listed in the wiki) is down. Anyone know who was running it?

  Try using [rationalreads](http://rationalreads.com/). It's not being maintained too much now, but it still links to most of the older rational fiction posted to this subreddit.

  I used to have admin access due to posting the most works to the site.

    No, it wasn't really active. It does fit a need, that of a durable location to collate all the recs and anti-recs. (There was talk of setting up a bot for a similar purpose but it was overshadowed by drama.)

  It seems like the site was replaced by https://fictionhub.io.
