  Apologies for the delay, it's partly been story related, partly mental stuff, and partly things going on in my life. Hopefully next chapters will be out a little bit faster.

  [I wrote an FAQ](https://www.patreon.com/posts/worth-candle-faq-26938299), if you're into questions and answers. It might get added to over time, whenever I have a question that gets asked enough times that I want a stock answer for it.

  Thanks for reading!

  Hey there, I've been rereading the story recently and wrote down a couple of possible mistakes that I've found. I apologize if they're things you've already been told about or that aren't actually mistakes:

  - During one of the flashbacks, Reimer mentions Tiff wasn't there for the Long Stairs campaign which she finds regrettable (ch35). We are also told that said campaign was ran twice, once before and once after Arthur's death (ch105). However, at another flashback, with Arthur still alive, we have Tiff referencing the Long Stairs campaign to Maddie, as if she'd been a part of it (ch139).
  - At the final fight against Larkspur, Joon got a Virtue called Mercy, that supposedly gave him CHA +1. However, not only did he not get that point on his stats, but said virtue was never mentioned again (ch 50). 
  - On chapter 106, Juniper says "We had no idea what Tree Magic, Library Magic, or Spirit actually did, which was part of the logic for why I had taken them (besides Spirit, which I had started with)", implying he didn't start with Library Magic, which he did. 
  - When Juniper first asks about dwarven language, Grak says Groglir is the common tongue of dwarves and that the language of his clan wouldn't suit Juniper (ch 50). Perhaps I misunderstood, but my interpretation was that these were two distinct things (Groglir and his clan's language). Yet later, when relating Grak's early life it's said that  "Groglir was the only language he ever heard spoken" (ch 106). 
  - Juniper says Library Magic has KNO as primary and INS as secondary (ch 129), but at chapter 138 he appears to have it at level 30 even though his INS is 5. 
  - At one point, Juniper mentions Uther had destroyed the secret to creating doppelgängers (ch 72). Later on, when Juniper uses the word, Raven asks what's a doppelgänger, which seems strange for someone who supposedly knew about all of Uther's adventures (ch 144). 
  - On chapters 144 and 151, the capital city of Anglecynn is called Caeldwich, on every other instance it is called Caledwich. 
  - Reimer says skills give a virtue at either level 10 or 20 (ch 144), but neither Gem or Bone Magic have any virtues listed, despite having been above 20 for a while.

    * Long Stairs reference is fine, it's Tiff (former newbie) describing something to Maddie (current newbie), probably picked up in the course of hearing people talk about an old campaign.
    * Virtues don't show up on the character sheet (or rather, they do for Juniper, but they're not listed for the reader). Same goes for the Conscientious virtue in ch 38, which is still providing a +5 bonus to Romance and Flattery to this very day. Like Ruthless, Mercy can be rescinded, and like some other stat changes, doesn't lower or raise the caps, just alters the behind-the-scenes rolls. Stats get reduced to 0 by Afflictions in ch 10 but don't lower the caps or afflict additional afflictions for being overcapped; same applies to virtues.
    * Changed the line in 106 to:  
    > We had no idea what Tree Magic, Library Magic, or Spirit actually did, which was part of the logic for why I had included them in the build, but it made unlocking them difficult if not impossible until they presented themselves to us in some way.

    * Groglir and the unnamed variant that Grak primarily speaks are [mutually intelligible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_intelligibility) and you basically can't learn one without learning the other. ch 106 is just being somewhat imprecise; a more precise version would be "Groglir and its variants", but I'm not going to change it, because people say "Groglir" meaning everything under the broad umbrella of mutually intelligible languages, and the "common tongue" which is standardized for enhanced mutual intelligibility. There's this line from ch 134, from Grak's POV, which speaks to that:  
    > “No,” said Grak, shifting uncomfortably at the suggestion. “General information. Things that people might talk about up there.” He was self-conscious about his dialect, a cadet branch of the many-pronged Groglir family tree.  

    * The character sheet gives "flat" stats, but his Essentialism virtue allows him to shift two points around at will. For him to have Library Magic higher than 25 just requires him to be shifting one of his stats over. I *think* it's consistent with that.
    * On Aerb, they're called changelings, but Juniper uses the more D&D standard doppelganger. The only place this was contradicted was in ch 74, when it was used by Fenn (maybe fine because she picked it up from him), but I changed it to changeling for the sake of consistency. Raven knows all about changelings, and in fact, one of Uther's other Knights, Forty-Two, was one (ch 29 and ch 113), she just doesn't know them by the name that Juniper uses.
    * Fixed the spelling. It's one of those that probably transposed itself in my head at some point, because if you'd asked me, I would have said "Caeldwich" for sure.
    * Bone Magic is special, and gets different kinds of bonuses that are structured as spells rather than virtues. Gem Magic has been missing a virtue for a long, long time, and I still need to retcon one in, but I'll put that off for another day. It was originally going to be something kind of garbage at lvl 10 related to assessing the characteristics of gems after sufficient use.

        There is no real hard and fast distinction between a dialect and a language, it's purely political. That's why many Chinese languages are considered dialects despite being completely different in structure and vocabulary whereas Norwegian and Danish are two different languages despite being more or less mutually intelligible.

          Utter fucking bullshit. Danish is completely impossible to understand by anyone who has not actively learned to speak it. Source: am Dutch, speak some Swedish and Norwegian, but not even a sliver of Danish. It's pretty doable to read, but absolutely impossible to understand in spoken language.

            And I speak pretty good french but there are a lot of French accents that are completely unintelligible to me, but a native speaker would be able to parse if they slow down. Similarly Danish and norwegian are almost identical grammatically, it's just that their pronunciations have diverged quite a bit. Native speakers can understand each other by going slowly and/or just getting used to the heavy accents. They are as similar as many dialects are.

    Bone magic got a level 30 virtue that lets him use unicorn magic by burning their bones, but you're right about it not getting a level 10 virtue.

    Also, I think the virtue give effective skill, not actual attributes. So Mercy can give him the charisma of someone one point higher than his current level, but that doesn't alter the ability caps. Griefstricken gave him some serious negatives, but his skills didn't decay because they were suddenly over their caps.

        You know, I was wondering whether anyone was going to be cynical enough to say "oh, well of course they 'banned it', this is just like greenwashing, *obviously* there are still zombie-made goods, they're just funneled through shell companies and have different branding, it's same shit, different day, and the ban is mostly in place to let the politicians look like they've done something and the allow the people to feel morally superior while still getting their cheap goods, do you think certification boards aren't subject to regulatory capture" and so on.

          It's funny, I had the opposite reaction, "Of course the guy was going to bankrupt, he put a big fat target on his own back and has a supply chain that is extremely easy to disrupt (just put a wall around his exclusion zone and, if you're feeling ruthless, burn his crops down)".

          Also, I'd expect the good Captain to react to the boycott by eventually promising to give his zombies their free will and pay them for their labor. They would likely accept fairly low wages, given that they probably don't need to eat or sleep and their expenditures would be on status and entertainment consumption, and he could probably argue that people in his domain would rather get some extra years after death even if their elongated lifetime came at the cost of unskilled labor.

          It would be less of a black-and-white problem, because people would still have cause to worry that zombies are being exploited and their "consent" is an illusion given that Captain Blue still has a metaphorical gun to their head 24/7, but everyone in the supply chain would have cause to downplay these concerns and minimize the effectiveness of regulatory oversight over Blue-in-the-Bottle Industries.

  I'll be honest, I was 100% expecting Amaryllis to either die or get Harolded, which I was not looking forward to. Mind-control is always a special kind of creepy and uncomfortable to me, so I'm glad we didn't get a repeat of the soul mage episode like I was worried about.

  On a completely unrelated note, these chapters (and the last one especially) really brought home just how broken June is now, and I'm not really sure what things will be like going forward. He's just leapfrogged so far ahead in power that everyone else is more liability than asset in most circumstances, and the few things that can legitimately threaten him have to be both really strong and really weird.

  The obvious route to solving that problem is just for him to get excluded, but that would strike me as really unsatisfying. I mean, it'd be one thing if he sacrificed his power for some purpose or lost it in some fight, but the nature of exclusions is so arbitrary that it feels like the fun police showing up to take your toys away. It would also cast a bit of a shadow on every future increase in power, knowing that if June get's *too* strong he'll get punished for it.

  The other possible route forward I can think of is that this is the start of the end game. This is the part where June starts doing the truly impossible shit, like ending the hells and killing Fell Seed, and it won't be long until we get another conversation with the DM. I'm sort of hoping that this is the case, because it would mean that we start getting some answers to a lot of the questions that have been lurking in the background.
  ```

  - u/Memes_Of_Production:
    ```
    Personally, I think exclusions are done - there won't be another one while Joon is on Aerb. They happened by DM fiat to keep Aerb functioning for Joon's campaign to start, but his goal is to become all powerful and save the world. As such he is the "new exclusionary principle", it's up to him to fix these issues.
    ```

    - u/JonRain:
      ```
      I was thinking the same. Obviously Joon is meant to become broken in terms of power or else he won't be able to do the things he destined to do. I was actually thinking while reading these chapters that I imagine from what we know of the DM that he really does allow the world and people develop naturally and he's not just going to revise history or an event to fit his goals instead he will go ground level and fix things. So for the most part the beings of his world have free will but when one of them unintentionally figures out a broken mechanic of his system and it would seriously affect his plot to an extreme degree and he can't figure out a natural way to rebalance the system he excludes them. Honestly I'm surprised Joon thinks of the exclusionary principle as a natural phenomenon that might happen to him when it definitely comes off as a tool the DM uses when he realizes one of his characters is about to takeover/destroy/unify and bring peace to the world prior to Joon arriving. So yeah he definitely should worry about the threats ramping up but exclusion not so much unless it really is some natural mechanic that the DM set up and doesn't directly control.

        Even *thinking* "I'm too special to get excluded" is a great way to get yourself excluded, narratively speaking.

      Arthur got things like ice magic excluded, I assumed it was when he was playing. Of course he was playing a balanced game he couldn't lose, but it does show how the DM might do it.

      - u/Memes_Of_Production:
        ```
        Its fair to mention but I dont think Arthur and Joon are playing the same game - I would be shocked if Arthur was ever told by the DM that he could become God. Arthur's campaign seemed to be all about setting the stage, while Joon's seems to be the real test. But of course, part of the logic there is ~*narrative*~
        ```

  - u/Serious_Feedback:
    ```
    > The obvious route to solving that problem is just for him to get excluded, but that would strike me as really unsatisfying. 

    There could be a narrative path where June gets excluded, gets an achievement for being excluded, then goes and kills the god of exclusion or somesuch to get himself un-excluded and proceed to become a god.

    I'm not convinced she wasn't. Remember, she blacked out briefly, flying through the air. Harold could have done something to her during that time. To me, at least, she felt a bit odd later in the chapter. Either Alex's writing quality dropped, or something bad happened, and I'm pretty damn confident about his writing quality.

      Him being force unconscious seems like not a big deal if he ever gets a few days of time afterwards to prepare (most of the time can be in the time chamber). Have Kenner's Eye, boost still magic again, boost soul magic, substitute around for skills you want (probably fewer of the combat skills and more magics), and scrape a bunch of backup souls for stats to get everything to level 100, including woodworking. Most of this (other than getting Kenner's eye) can be done in the time chamber.

    Yeah, I'm not sure if the characters meant it was weak because they had privileged information (Valencia) or weak in general.

    But yeah, if the world really was that apathetic to the existence of provable hells, I would probably join a doomsday cult too. I would totally be onboard with the Second Empire as well if they had anything that looked like a plan to end hells.

    (although I think the story is exaggerating how apathetic people can be to truly horrifying things; like, yes, people drive cars and that's insane, and they don't always wear seatbelts, and they drive around with their *kids* instead of always using the train, and we have working automated driving technology and we've barely started using it even the though opportunity cost in human lives is huge, and what was I arguing for again?)

      - u/CouteauBleu:

        Okay, yeah, I'm a little over-anxious about cars.

        That said:

        - You're counting the chance of dying when driving. The site puts the lifetime odds of dying in a car accident, period, as 1 in 103, which is still pretty bad. (though a selfish rational actor would care more about the odds of dying than the odds of killing a random pedestrian)

        - Glancing at that wikipedia page, and from prior exposure to the subject, my hunch is that robot cars are already as safe or safer than human-driven cars. Realistically, legalizing them on a wide scale would be extremely unlikely to cause accident spikes, and would probably decrease accidents pretty fast, especially with network effects (autonomous cars can coordinate with each other to avoid accidents), the fact that any accidents involving autonomous car are still extremely likely to be due to the human factor (eg, a robot car might hit a human-driven car because the robot didn't anticipate the human being reckless, but a robot car will basically never hit another robot car, so robot cars would get safer the more robot cars there is), and the fact that large amounts of field driving data would help refine driving algorithms much faster.

        I think the biggest block is that people are visualizing human-error accident as a known quantity where blame can be assigned, whereas self-driving cars feel like a new danger where *anything* could happen. That said, I think Emmanuel Macron recently mentioned the urgency of getting safe self-driving cars on the road, so maybe we'll see things moving here.

        But yeah, fine, I guess humans aren't that terrible at avoiding obviously horrifying things.

    Eeeehhhhhhh 

    I mean sure if those were the only two options, then maybe that would make sense. 

    But this is the problem with fanatics - they tend to turn the world into a black and white dichotomy, where you need to choose between the One True Action and the Wrong Action, and it's perfectly clear which is which. 

    On Aerb, it's entirely possible to conceive of a future where all those souls in the hells are saved, even without Joon's PC shenanigans - I imagine some combination of high powered revision magic and soul magic would be able to wipe out the millennia of torture that they've experienced, and unwind their experiences back to the point just before they died. 

    It's just going to take time and effort. And it needs for the world to not end first.

    Which means that saying "eh fuck it, this world is objectively irrecoverable, time to burn it all down" is not necessarily the right thing to do.
    ```

    - u/CaptainMcSmash:
      ```
      It's true that in a setting as fantastical as this, magic is very plausibly a solution to the hells but given that Uther himself nor the world at large for the last 500 years managed to do this, the plausibility is low. Without privileged information, you'd rightly assume the task to be nigh impossible or something that won't be discovered for hundreds or thousands of additional years.

      And as for undoing their pain. That's just missing the point. If I stab you in the hand, the pain you experience is real to you in the moment and no argument of I'll make you forget this ever happened after will lessen that pain or console you during the fact.

    The existence of the Hells and other stuff in Aerb is really strong evidence for Intelligent Design in setting. It is also extremely strong evidence that the Designer is a sadistic evil monster. Any method of ending the world is necessarily untested. You have no guarantee that your method of triggering the apocalypse will actually end the world, will destroy the hells, will not result with the Designer resetting things or will not result in the Designer creating worse horrors.

      Yeah but that's because we're reading about Joon and know he's the next Uther, we know he'll fix all these problems, but from Ellio's perspective, there is no solution and there never has been. If he had known that there was a hero coming to fix everything, he wouldn't have decided to destroy everything. From what information everyone else in the world has, the correct choice should be destroy it all.

  Some of my random thoughts on these chapters:

  When Joon is "making the rounds," I specifically got flashbacks to playing Dragon Age when you are at camp and you check in with all your party characters to see what they have to say.  Really enjoyed the nostalgia from that.

  Val mentions she was useless for most of this arc, but I thought her social reads on Finch were helpful.  Also, later on it was nice to see she was wrong about the woman who was working with Harold.  I had a bad premonition when she told Joon to kill her immediately and he ignored her.  I wasn't sure if that was kind of a reminder to readers that Val wasn't foolproof.

  I really enjoy the reactions of strangers to Juniper's party.  Finch's reaction to Raven was very entertaining.

  I kind of enjoyed the anti-climactic ending.  It makes sense in the context that Juniper kind of stumbled into this OP combination with 100 Still.  And I think it also makes sense that he gets to stomp a fight after getting this level up like he mentioned in the flashback before the environment actually scales to his ability.

  This seems like a good point to really ramp his skills with Soul Scaphism.  I assume he will run into some limits so it doesn't actually get 100 in everything, but I don't see how he can get to the level of Fel Seed by some other method.

    The whole Loyalty system reads to me like a send-off of older bioware-ish RPG's. You know, the ones where if you sucked up to a character enough, you'd get a special quest or a perk or something? Seeing Joon trying to reconcile what seems to be people with an actual number is amusing. And also an existential nightmare. 

    Valencia gently calling Joon out for "doing the rounds" just adds to the meta chaos of this serial. I mean it's a common enough narrative beat, even in normal books. 

    But I got the same sense of nostalgia of wandering around the camp/ship and talking to everyone in private, just as you did.

    Honestly, I thought it was a hint that she had an August Prince type entad. Everyone seemed very obviously unable to act aggressively against her despite direct commands to kill her, and warnings that she was under an "exotic effect".

  Point of order: I had to laught at this.

  >Pallida, Raven, and Grak were all fine; I had soul-linked them

  !

  >and I’d seen him survive a grenade that he should never have been able to survive.

  When I saw this line I briefly entertained the idea that Finch might be the DMPC. Perhaps indirectly, which would explain the anomaly Valencia saw while reading him.

  But now that he's given Juniper an answer... maybe he is in multiple places at once, and he was learning more at the exact moment Valencia was inspecting him.

  I imagine Juniper used Spirit against Ellio to ensure no connection to Harold. Would Spirit be sufficient to ensure he was forthcoming also? (Not that the moral consideration Amaryllis has is any different; it's still crossing that moral boundary.)

  EDIT:

  If the source of Harold is an entad, they *really* should not take it inside Bethel. I am not even sure what the consequences are. Do they fight for control? Does Bethel get still more terrifying powers?

  I wonder what people's thoughts are on June's propensity to allow his cornered enemies to talk with their fingers on the nuclear button (or an imagined one). It might just be a happy conceit to want to believe that rational, sentient agents rarely have actual ideological disagreements, diametrically opposed. That line of thought would run that these disagreements are ones founded in ignorance and that more context would sway the listener one side or another.

  My instinct runs towards agreement with June in letting these people talk to and at him. It may not be the strictly speaking rational or optimal move, but to see his antagonists as agents of their own might - emotionally? - require giving them a say. There's a worry that killing them simply because they might be able to strike at you from some unimaginable vector dehumanizes them and you both. Earlier in the narrative, June has expressed concerns about his views on the game-world sliding into solipsism already. 

  Although, there is that last wrinkle that perhaps you are not talking to a human agent at all but a flesh puppet whose soul has been hollowed out and replaced by Harold (although I know that isn't the actual mechanic by which he subverts these people, as a description it's close enough for Uniquities work).
  ```

  - u/dabmg10:
    ```
    On the fact letting enemies talk it could also play into the DnD angle as simply going for the fight would talk away one aspect of the role-playing and could thusly be punished by the Dungeon Master. Just killing people is not the best angle of attack as information would be lost then. There is also the fact everyone is telling him not to talk to people seem slike a big clue to having to talk to them. Its also a good sign for June that he is treating the people as people and keeping that in mind such immediate violence can become a slippery moral slope, as such action become normalized. That's not to say that he hasn't attacked people such as the prince after mary early on in the story. The act of nonchalantly defeating an enemy ala Indian Jones may seem cool but realistically very disturbing behaviour in a person.
    Part of Junes charm is his streak of idealism in this world.
    ```

    - u/ivory12:
      ```
      It's interesting that everyone telling him not to talk to people is reason enough to talk to people. Not that I disagree with you, just that it's ironic. Sometimes I find the story can get a bit bogged down by tedious meta-narrative talk, but other times it raises interesting questions.

      I agree. I like June's idealism and the way he indulges himself a little bit, whether it be by going blade-bound instead of whatever mage is optimal or by choosing to let the villain monologue.

    ignoring val’s flat out command to kill or gag struck me as extremely stupid, especially given all the effort juniper has put into treating his companions with full agency
    ```

  - u/nohat:
    ```
    I really didn't like how he ignored Val's repeated warnings to kill or gag the woman. He just ignored Val, despite her obvious expertise and serious concern. Considering the explosion word was likely to kill all present but him and Finch, its really hard to see this as a good decision, not a lucky break. In general talking is good, particularly when you actually have a quite strong counter argument to their main motivation, but surely you can give the woman a pencil or something. I don't blame Joon much for Ello, since I assume he was angling for a safe chance to touch him.

    I also felt Amaryllis should have easily managed to activate the immobility plate within 6 seconds. And isn't the point of the time chamber that very little time takes place externally? I seem to remember a month running in 45min, which would mean the 6 hours would take  ~22.5 sec. Even if they spent more time speeding up and down surely she spent much longer descending and evacuating. Maybe I'm mis-remembering or the activation time is really long? 

    I'm curious what Joon would be able to do with soul and spirit while touching Harold. Maybe a bad idea to be fair. Harold seems like he might be connected to, or a creation of Fel Seed. The jar of flesh bit just sounds on theme, and there's the World Lord connection. I'd note that the description given of the World Lords doesn't necessarily indicate annihilation of Aerb, just its end. Any group that includes Fel Seed is likely to indicate a wee bit of horrific torture.
    ```

    - u/ivory12:
      ```
      I hope the whole World Lord thing is a taxonomic connection only (as in World Lord is just a word for "apocalyptic threat" as used in Aerb and this one prophecy). The idea that all these big bads are in league with each other undermines their presence as villains, for me as a reader, anyway.
      ```

      - u/nohat:
        ```
        I agree that it seems weird for them to be working together, the claim that if three World Lords are on Aerb at once the world ends seems like a fairly strong implication of connection. Maybe there's some other mechanism that will cause the world end if three of a set of otherwise independent monsters are out at the same time, but that doesn't seem like the most parsimonious explanation.

  I feel like these chapters, while having some individual good elements (like Raven/Padilla), didnt work too well for me, and its hard to pin down. It is always challenging to write a "deliberate" anti-climax in an interesting way, but i think it can be done, while here the elements dont jive too well.

  I think the big issue is that Mary's separation from the group turned out to be pointless. She accomplished little, didnt send knowledge of the temple to joon and co, and just sortof hung around. Which, since the final "message" was in a way *for* her, makes her complete passivity in the arc unsatisying. And her separation means she gets no buildup to that conclusion till the last chapter. I understand the "point" is passivity, but i mean it in a narrative sense - she doesnt get screentime.

  Same with other revelations i think - Finch's "Idea" revelation happens on a backtrop of nonthreatening enemies with little consequences to the arc, and gets only a few sentences of explication and doesnt seem relevant thematically. The threads dont come together too well (need more skill ranks in Spirit Magic!) 

  Still a fun chapter of course, we appreciate the struggle for our collective enjoyment!
  ```

  - u/Green0Photon:
    ```
    Alex is such a good writer, though, that I have to believe that he has something planned in this. Mary might be subverted (went unconscious for a moment, then was a bit OOC). Finch, I feel, might be connected further with Harold. Harold is also an idea, but he's stuck in a phylactery. What if he was supposed to be an avatar, like Finch is. Could the ritual Finch fucked with be the one to summon Harold? Could Harold subvert Finch? Could Finch be Harold in disguise?

    I'm very skeptical that the point really is passivity. With the whole DM thing, it's kinda like we're the DMs. It has to be satisfying narratively, to us. And it's not. The situation is narratively solved; there must be some sort of climax, even if it's not Uther-style and is still a subversion. It doesn't feel right to just be *nothing*. It feels much more that the characters are rationalizing their own passive experiences with narrative logic, wanting to believe it's over. I feel like it has to get worse; the party's been through some real shit, and it's been a bit of time since something last happened personally to one of them. I'm betting on Mary being subverted or messed with mentally, by Harold, at least. There has to be a reason why she was shown by herself, why the chapter was so odd.

    Having done a *whole* rewrite on that last chapter, it has to be intentional. (Sidenote: the chapters before it definitely made more sense and were more cohesive, in comparison to that last strange one.)
    ```

    - u/Memes_Of_Production:

  benevolent world exploders do seem a lot more appealing when there’s a literal, demonstrable hell and one’s grown pessimistic across centuries of failing to destroy it (where one repeatedly hits an insurmountable wall in the form of godly exclusions, rather than a surmountable wall in the form of mortal counter-agents / demons or no wall at all in the form of ignorance). I can see an argument for ending the populations that feed it, even if the hell itself can never end, since the immense suffering of even a small fraction from the source population could quickly outweigh all the happy lives that end in oblivion. Have wanted to read a story with a principled neg-U antagonist for a while now, we’ll see if that’s where this one goes! (haven’t finished all the new chapters yet)

      Not a "more intelligent" advisor. Harold's problem wasn't that he lacked intelligence as such, or even planning ability. Rather, I took it that he was overly focused on plans that contained some clear and specific mechanism for destroying the world, as opposed to increasing the likelihood of world-destruction in general, nonspecific ways. The benefit of a human advisor wouldn't be intelligence in general, but rather simply lacking those particular blind spots.

  Harold doesn't seem like he'd accept just dying in a jar like that. It feels like he'd be able to fly away to ~~fight~~ end the world another day.

  I'm really worried about Amaryllis. She blacked out briefly in the sky, enough that Harold could have affected her. Her brief thoughts about destroying everything seem a bit out of character. Not completely unrealistic, with the whole call of void thing, but still strange. Her entire thing has been building up society, not thoughts about breaking it. It could be that those thoughts were the catalyst for doing so, but it's just strange. Especially with the black out.

  I expected Amaryllis to either need to be rescued from Harold, at first, or later that she'd defeat Harold by herself. It would have been super cool to have her ultimately solve the problem, with her reaching the temple first. Instead, it was just a bit disappointing. It was super weird for Jun and Finch to just appear at the temple so fast. I thought Amaryllis would have cool responsibility and what not, but everything was solved by Jun, easy peazy. The "peace" at the moment feels really uncomfortable and fake. I'm on edge.

  157-159 were amazing and great. But 160 just felt off. Alex is such a good author though, that it *must* be on purpose. There *has* to be something crazy coming soon. (A thinker style reveal/change vs a brute style reveal/change, like Jun's hack.)

  Narratively, it would make perfect sense if Finch's powers come from Harold. What if people tried to summon Harold originally, as this idea of destruction avatar thing? But Finch fucked it up and "killed" himself. Now, his body is now the idea of Finch, instead of the idea of Destruction/Oblivion. Harold, now, is just that thought-form, stuck in a phylactery, instead of the original planned body. This would also be amazing mirroring in the narrative, too. You could also have Finch either betray our cast, or be subverted by Harold. It really does seem like there's a connection there.

  The "you can't kill idea" thing is kinda obvious. I also kinda expected Jun (or maybe Mary) to figure out a way *to* kill an idea, and end up killing both Harold and Finch.

  They're connected. I guarantee it. Something is fishy. Shit is about to go down, even further. This is my prediction.

    >The "you can't kill idea" thing is kinda obvious. I also kinda expected Jun (or maybe Mary) to figure out a way to kill an idea, and end up killing both Harold and Finch.

    Though it's far from the first work of fiction to talk about the ability (or lack thereof) for ideas to be killed, given the clear influence that SCP has had on this story it seems possible that was inspired by this quote from the antimemetics division series:

    "Ideas can be killed," she says, stepping into the airlock.

    "How?"

    "With better ideas."

      I don't really see how that makes sense. If I think of making square wheels but decide that's retarded and come up with circle wheels, it's not like my idea of square wheels has disappeared. It's still occupying space up there. I would've assumed you kill ideas by making people forget them, ala antimemetics.

    I don't know. Harold was apparently bad enough at destroying the world, he was never recorded succeeding at it in the Infinite Library. It could be that he's always so subtle that even when he ends the world, the librarians attribute it to some other cause, but there's no reason the Uniquities wouldn't write at least a few "the Entropy Kraken is about destroy the world, we think it might be Harold" reports for the library to intercept.

    I thought they were connected too (given this arc has had a theme of (anti)memetics). Furthermore, doesn't the Cannibal also seem to be a memetically-linked entity? And we were just fed another mention after its plot thread sort of oddly dropped off the story for quite some time...

  I totally thought that Harold would turn out to have been Arthur the whole time.  With Fell Seed being a world lord, and Arthur disappearing where Fell Seed turned up, the connection is there.

    That makes me wonder, what is the criteria for being a World Lord? 

    I don't think it's just immense power because that would mean there are potentially many of them, and if that's the case, why should having 3 of them appear at the same time cause the end? That doesn't mesh. It sounds like 3 appearing would cause the end because of the way they interact with each other, so there'd only be 3, but what Finch said also made it sound like there's more than that. 

    So yeah, dunno.

      We know Mome Rath has at least 100 in all of his physical stats, as well as a substantial ecology of very dangerous monsters. I wonder if that's the key -- Fel Seed has his store of fleshbeasts and brides and everything, Mome has at least the Rats and Bats. Maybe a World Lord is a category of monster so vast that it contains a world within itself

    - u/serge_cell:
      ```
      If it's a hard rule like 3 Lords = inevitable end then World Lords just a label system (computational substrate which run the world) give to certain entity. It could be assigned according to simple rule like some kind of power threshold or it could be something undecipherable by the agents inside simulation, for example predetermined list of Lords created together with the world.

        Opaque to Aerb's residents, but it does seem like the World Lords are the stronger monsters adapted from Jabberwocky: Mome Rath, the Manxome Foe (Fel Seed), presumably the Jubjub Bird as well.

      Ellio's teenage epiphany:

      > “I realized it all when I was a teenager,” said Ellio, seeming grateful that he would get to talk. “I realized how cold and cruel it all was, how people would delude themselves into thinking that it wasn’t. I was afraid of dying then, afraid of the hells after I saw what was there, and when I looked around me, other people weren’t, they didn’t act like they should have if eternity were on the line. They did stupid, risky things like leaving their house without a bottle and a spike hanging from their hip. They slept without someone watching over them, or worse, alone. They didn’t act like eternal torture was on the line. They acted like it would sort itself out. 

      does remind me a lot of HPEV's similar one when he first realised he couldn't trust adults after his mother told him "not to think about" how something that happened in the newspaper could happen to him. Though I can't find that paragraph in HPMOR right now.

  Thanks for writing! A long wait, but definitely worth it. I loved that the narrative played an important role again, especially in the last chapter. It's one of my favorite things in WtC.

  June will probably have to use soul magic on Grak to fix his brain, since conventional healing magic isn't able to do that. Interesting, since he just altered someone else's soul for his own purposes for the first time...

    Raven you mean. It seems weird that she would reveal it, because they care more about power than doing their job. So she is just giving them clues on how to avoid her in future, and avoiding her will give them more freedom of action.

  It’s pretty clear that Mary was given a solo quest (that she couldn’t see the notification for) to take down the temple.

  But, in combination with the fact that she was the point-of-view character for those chapters, this makes me wonder: can the game, temporarily, consider more than Joon to be ‘players’ in the sense of them being the focal point of the DM changing things around to make for a nice narrative?

  For the periods that Mary is the POV character, will she get sidekicks? Love interests sacrificing themselves for her? Etc.

  And, if so, is it literally the active point-of-view of a given chapter/section of the story we’re reading, *Worth the Candle*, that determines who is under this effect? Could the protagonists find an entad to detect who the story is following, and take advantage of that?
