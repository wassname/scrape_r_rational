  ```
  So I think the LessWrongian Futurist Drinking Game needs to happen during this film.
  ```

  - u/traverseda:
    ```
    I have a mumble server if we want to do a streaming/synctube event like the plounge does.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      You know the Plounge?

      Right then.  At some point we will have to actually come up with a LessWrong Scifi/Futurist Drinking Game, and do this.

      - u/traverseda:
        ```
        Not only do I know the plounge, but I know that you know the plounge.

        You wrote some good posts on /r/hpmor, and you used the shibboleths.

          ```
          I no espeakee this "shibboleth". [](/swagintosh)

            ```
            >A shibboleth is a word or custom whose variations in pronunciation or style can be used to differentiate members of ingroups from those of outgroups. Within the mindset of the ingroup, a connotation or value judgment of correct/incorrect or superior/inferior can be ascribed to the two variants

    ```
    Is this an actual thing? If so, link?
    ```

- u/LordSwedish:
  ```
  Well the terrorist organization looks like the least sympathetic villains of all time. If this movie makes them out as the people who were right I am going to be pissed. 

  Seriously, with the cast and production this movie is getting I think that the direction the story takes is going to be the main factor between me liking and hating this movie.
  ```

  - u/endtime:
    ```
    While not terrorists, the LW/MIRI folks would be strongly opposed to turning this kind of thing on without friendliness proofs.  You wouldn't be?
    ```

    - u/LordSwedish:
      ```
      Well first of all there's a bit of a difference between wanting to make sure that it's safe and being "anti-tech" and shooting lead scientists. Besides, I'm at the point where if researchers were being targeted and research was being lost I would gamble on getting a great scientist uploaded as it is preferable to the singularity never happening during my lifetime.
      ```

      - u/PlacidPlatypus:
        ```
        No singularity is definitely preferable vastly to an unFriendly one, unless you're entirely selfish. In fact, even if you are, signing up for cryonics and taking the time to do it right is almost certainly a better bet than risking an unFriendly superintelligence dismantling the world for spare parts.
        ```

        - u/iemfi:
          ```
          Assuming you don't care about future lives nor human potential I could see  pulling the trigger being a better bet for people currently alive compared to cryonics. Especially if you know the current AI is above average in safety (not pulling the trigger could mean a high chance of an even more poorly designed AI taking its place).
          ```

        - u/LordSwedish:
          ```
          I'm basing the situation off the one in the trailer where I assume that they were fairly sure that they would be able to upload Depps mind completely. An AI based on a humans mind isn't necessarily friendly but it wouldn't kill all humans or run a matrix scenario (as long as it's a sane person who isn't inclined to murder) and if it is in fact a scientist or a similarly rational person then I believe the chances of me getting immortality is high enough for me to gamble with the lives of humanity. Extremely selfish and short-sighted? yes. Does my fear of death give a single shit about that? no.
          ```

- u/alexanderwales:
  ```
  We will have to see whether this is any good. The premise certainly tickles my fancy though.
  ```
