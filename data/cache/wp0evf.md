### Comments:

- u/Dragongeek:
  ```
  What I read this week-ish:

  - [***Godslayers***](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/52503/godslayers) by Trollmore on RR. I enjoyed this one a lot, and this definitely qualifies as a "hidden gem" on RR, in particular because I kept thinking about it days later (and still do). Basically, the premise is that Magic, Gods, and Souls are real, and the so called "Gods" are actually incomprehensible extra-dimensional predators that feed on the souls of their sapient worshipers which causes unimaginable suffering and prevents reincarnation. Therefore, the moral imperative is applied atheism, the "Godslaying". Unfortunately, despite being armed with extremely advanced technology and limited resurrection abilities, the Godslayer organization is hopelessly outgunned so they wage an interstellar guerilla war against divinities: flying to planets, infiltrating society, and then causing the religion and by extension the Gods to crumble under their own weight or eliminate eachother (basically). This really makes me think about ends-means-justification (which I think /r/rational will enjoy), because in order to weaken the Gods, the Godslayers need to perform immoral and occasionally downright evil acts and this clash of alien moralities, society, and greater good is fascinating to read about. Also, I really like the writer's prose and style. 

  - [***Roadkill***](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61856981-roadkill) by Dennis E. Taylor. I read this because I like the author (his *[Bobiverse](https://www.goodreads.com/series/192752-bobiverse)* series is rather unique and I wish there were more of the POV-von Neumann genre) and I had a spare Audible credit. Overall, I'd describe it as fun, light reading, but good. No super heady plot (It's rather similar to *Outland* by the same author which is also fun) but the sci-fi is good enough that it wasn't immersion breaking. The characters also all act reasonably rational (or insomuch as can be expected from fresh high-school graduates). One of my favorite parts about this story is how the author managed to setup a mostly rational "alien infiltrator earth invasion" scenario which is rare when most sci-fi simply dips into "the aliens want our water!" or something equally contrived and stupid. Basically, instead of a whole alien fleet, it's like 40 criminal aliens illegally violating the "prime directive" to exploit a legal loophole that means a species can obtain "custodianship" if it's obvious the species is heading towards extinction. The aliens do this by means of lizardperson-shapeshifter-esque governmental infiltration, obtaining politician collaborators, and using an (also illegal) AI to run botfarms, far-right "news" outlets, and make fake news to push their narratives, cover up events, and generally drive the Earth towards an apocalypse. Some of this, especially how much influence a rather small subset of the human race has and how effective the alien's strategy could be, is rather scary. 

  - [***Apocalypse: Quest System***](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60718014-apocalypse) by Macronomicon. I feel like Macronomicon gets recc'd here often, but it's deserved IMO. I enjoy his style of storytelling immensely, and he consistently manages to write highly intelligent characters facing complex issues competently. In fact, the protagonists are often so smart that they make me feel insecure about my own intelligence...which is only ever so slightly discomforting. Regardless, this book marks the culmination of his "Apocalypse" four-book series and unlike a lot of webfiction, it actually feels like an ending too. Most, if not all, major arcs and plot threads are satisfyingly closed, and this gives me confidence in the author's ability to write good endings to his other projects. Another thing that shouldn't be understated is just how damn funny his works can be at times, which gets somewhat awkward when I'm listening to them as an audiobook (very well done btw) on the train and then need to suppress howling laughter while other people look at me like I'm some sort of psychopath. Macronomicon has mentioned that there's a potential Book 5 in the future, which I wouldn't be opposed to, but it's not something I *need*. 

  - [***Warden of Time***](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/55748/warden-of-time) by shortlemon on RR. Basically, I was bored, browsing RR, and found this. It's magic college timeloop progression fantasy in an industrial-revolution world where the magic is heavily cultivation-inspired. It's about 66k words, but last updated a month ago which makes me feel like it might be dead, but what's there is enjoyable. I hope the author writes more of it.

    I’m reading Godslayer and am through 1.9, and while the story and prose are great, the MC is infuriating.
    ```

    - u/kraryal:
      ```
      Yeah. The worldbuilding is really cool, but she's supposed to be a fully trained commando, special forces, etc. She comes across as a flighty teenager who barely understands what she has. 

      Friend: "Promise not to look at my drawing!"
      MC: "Yes." 

      As soon as the friend leaves the room, she stands up, stares at the drawing, and transmits it to her crew. Okay, fine. But then she continues staring at it and zones out until the friend comes back and freaks. Why? She's already sent it to the crew, they have a copy, it's just stupid.
      ```

      - u/i_dont_know:
        ```
        Or how proud she is of her ignorance. “OK, so I didn’t pay attention in X class, but…”

        Or her attachment to her own body that has already prevented her from being healed from injuries. 

        Or her general disregard for her captain’s orders. 

        Why do these other trained professionals put up with her and give her important tasks?
        ```

    - u/Nnaelo:
      ```
      I was very intrigued by the summary, and very disappointed by the execution. Dropped it once I got to the part where the main character makes the crew play D&D, as her "quirkiness" was too much to handle.
      ```

    - u/jaghataikhan:
      ```
      Fully agreed. Love the quasi-Greek society they're infiltrating and the rest of the crew, and i get how starting with an immature protagonist leaves a ton of room for character development and growth (some of my favorite series like Molester Man use the same trick), but goddamn her lack of discipline and straight up common sense is infuriating lol
      ```

      - u/IICVX:
        ```
        Ya I wouldn't trust the MC of that story with a beer run, much less a commando operation against the gods of an unexplored world. 

        I kept on thinking "there has to be some in-story reason why this person is so incompetent, like some sort of obligatory hero's journey mechanism or something", but my suspension of disbelief failed before that could be explained, if it ever is.
        ```

        - u/jaghataikhan:
          ```
          She's got a "soul McGuffin" that basically gives her some metaphysical abilities the others don't have, but thus far she's basically a huge liability to their mission

    > It's magic college timeloop progression fantasy in an industrial-revolution world where the magic is heavily cultivation-inspired.

    This seems a good bit like *Mother of Learning*, both in premise and setting. How do they compare?
    ```

    - u/sephirothrr:
      ```
      so far from what I've read of Warden of Time it compares pretty poorly - one of the things that made MoL great was the mystery of what was going on, and that we the reader felt a much stronger connection to Zorian

      In contrast, WoT straight up explains the plot in the prologue, and there appears to be even further off-screen meddling in her life(*) to give her a hand up, which all serves to place a big separation between the reader and the narrative

      That said, so far it's pretty decent, so I'll see where it goes

      *: >!It's strongly implied that the meddler is possibly her future self, but from a mystery perspective it's no less unsatisfying!<
      ```

  - u/hoja_nasredin:

    > Apocalypse: Quest System by Macronomicon.

    I may give this one another try. I started reading it, but it was yet another one >!where the MC gets maimed right off the bat,!< which annoys me for some reason (I've mentioned this before).  But if it has something that feels like an actual ending, well...
    ```

    - u/Dragongeek:
      ```
      Well, I think it's a bit of trope inversion: Typically in portal (or progression) fantasy, the protagonist gets maimed early on for the same reason that classic Star Trek killed people in red shirts: to raise the stakes. It's supposed to be something that clues the reader and the character into thinking "oh shit, it's serious now". Then, as soon as the protagonist has learned their lesson, they get some sort of powerup or magical healing that returns the lost limb and everting ends up A-OK for them. 

      Unfortunately, this trope has been overused to death and isn't a particularly good one in the first place. 

      The "inversion" part is that (minor spoilers) >!Jeb *never* manages to fix his leg and his foot remains missing permanently for the entire series. In fact, book 4's epilogue is Jeb shopping for new prosthetic feet since his always break. !<
      ```

- u/Darkpiplumon:
  ```
  I would like to recommend [Industrial strength magic](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/57011/industrial-strength-magic).

  By the author of Wake of the Ravager, it is set in a comic book hero world. Much like Worm (but a lot lighter), it tries to explain how this world has become what it is, explaining the classic tropes we are accustomed to , such as why are recurrent villains not killed, instead of letting people who cause tons of death and property damage alive. 

  But nowadays most superhero tales take that into account, so, from my point of view, what makes this story stellar?
  First of all, the sense of humor. I have found myself pleasantly surprised in this regard, laughing out loud on many occasions, with the humor a big part of the setting but without getting into crack or being too dissonant with the world. I have found most of the jokes many times more fun than some so called "comedies".

  I am not a particular fan of this, but a reasonable amount of the book is dedicated to number crunching. I skip it, but I know some of you like that kind of stuff.

  Onto the negatives, I don't think the early conflict with the main characters childhood friend is carried or resolved very well, but it appears only at the beginning and is pretty forgettable. A friend of the protagonist is dumb of the "can't believe you know how to walk and talk at the same time" variety, and there's something pretty funky with him and how the MC treats him. Maybe something in the future will make everything about him make sense.


  Finally, I recommend a completed quest, [Now you feel like number none](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/now-you-feel-like-number-none-bleach-arrancar-quest.37531/). A million words long quest where you are a low importance Arrancar minion of Aizen's army. If you don't know what those capital A starting words are don't worry, you don't need it (but it is very much recommended). This is my favourite quest of all time, with a deep exploration of the setting and some side characters of Bleach.

  In the early beginning of the quest, we begin to discover (and choose) who the main character is, and once we have left the "Survival at all costs" phase, we can make her change, and change those around her. 

  Highly recommended for the huge amount of Wham chapters, battles that remind me of The Games we Play but if they were less eternal and much more emotional and lyrical, I have more bookmarks on specific chapters and moments on this quest on SV than in the rest of stories combined.

    Got pummeled here for this de-rec last week or the week before, mostly bc I think I was too emotional/flippant with my review. I stand by my hatred of “Tinker Twitch”. 


    I may try and give it another go since it’s been at the top of RR’s lists and it’s getting rec’s here pretty consistently. 🤝
    ```

    - u/megazver:
      ```
      I didn't like it either. The basic writing style is competent enough and most of the jokes work, but the characterization is just a little bit off, the author doesn't quite pull off the slow, staggered revealing of all of his precious worldbuilding and the MC doesn't actually do any interesting problem solving with his powers, despite what a big deal is made of them. (They're the story's title!)

      I think people *want* to like it more than they actually do.

  Can I ask for any recommendations for fictions that deal in detail with trying to establish a self-sufficient colony in an inhospitable environment?


  I am interested in anything from trying to settle in an frozen underwater ocean planet to colonizing a Jovian system to attempts to utilize unknown abandoned technology in an alternate dimension or perhaps something that Seveneves could be like it it dealt in the period between the second and third parts. Anything that has a similar feel really.

  - u/chiruochiba:
    ```
    You might enjoy [Demesne](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40290/demesne) by Shadow Crystal Mage on RR.

    It's set in an extremely inhospitable fantasy world where human life is nearly impossible outside of "Demesnes" created and maintained by wizards (called "Binders"). The story follows a wizard who is a member of a colonization expedition to a new continent (vaguely reminiscent of the colonization of America). The story deals with the day-to-day struggle of building a sustainable human setlement from the roots up, including reinventing the basics of magic-fueled technology and dealing with the average citizens who often aren't happy with living in a "Binderarchy".

    - u/sephirothrr:
      ```
      unfortunately, at least for me, a large part of the work is told through the lens of a misanthropic autist, and I want to read fiction to escape reality, not reinforce it
      ```

      - u/chiruochiba:
        ```
        Oddly enough, the misanthropic personality of the main character is part of what made the fic so engrossing to me; she's far from a typical fantasy heroine. Her personal failings were endearing to me, party because she does so much for everyone who depends on her and never complains about being overworked. She accomplishes so much despite being allergic to polite human interaction, and the interaction with her few close friends was heartwarming to me.

  - u/fljared:
    ```
    I'm going to Anti-Recommend the comic here, as the original was much less polished. Garth Ennis very clearly hates superheros because they're a power fantasy, and instead writes a slightly different but no less wanky story about cool humans who kills super heros, without appearing to realize that making your stand-in a James Bond anti-hero type is not more mature than a superhero. The general air is of a 12-year-old desperate to shit on "childish" things while writing the ultraviolent stuff his parents won't let him watch. 

    Like most stories about Bad Superman, it mostly starts and ends with "If Superheros were assholes, they'd be assholes, man" and then have the Superman do bad things in a more two-dimensional way than the comic characters they're based on, plus or minus a lazy parody of the Justice League/The Avengers.

    That being said, if you find other Garth Ennis works good and think he's a good enough writer to overcome clearly loathing the thing he's making, then it's probably up your alley.

    If you want a story about people having to manipulate Evil Superman, read [The Fifth Defiance](https://thefifthdefiance.com/), which has a major subplot how the most powerful woman is the world is kept from being bored enough to slaughter everyone alive and teleport to a new planet.

  Strong recommendation for the novella Jonathan Livingston Seagull, which against all expectations is... a cultivation novel. An outcast learns secret techniques, ascends through ever higher realms, meets mysterious Great Masters, and pursues spiritual perfection. It's a wonderful story, beautifully written.

      ```
      I'm probably just too stupid, but the author's habit of almost never indicating who was speaking made it hard for me to parse dialogue. Combine this with the tendency to suddenly transitioning to a large quote of a book with no formatting differentiation had me constantly questioning who was saying text in quotes, or if it was even being spoken at all. 

      Also, at one point the author had the character slip into second-person during the middle of a paragraph and the dialogue afterwards implied that it's perfectly normal to think in second-person which was bizarre to me. Am I unusual here, or is this a thing people actually do? Like your internal monologue is in second person as though you were speaking to a different person who can hear all of your thoughts and controls your body? Just seems bizarre to me.

        My internal narrative shifts to 2nd person if I’m annoyed with myself or trying to give myself a pep talk. It’s very normal for people to internally talk to themselves. It’s less common to see it in fiction, especially if it’s not made super clear (with italics and context).

          Sure, I have an internal monologue going 24/7. I just don't address that monologue to someone else, so it seemed odd to me. I suppose the closest I'll is I might internally say something like "What do we need to do?" I suppose it may also be quite odd to use the royal we in my internal monologue, even infrequently.

  Bonus, if that's an easy reading. I don't know why, but Brennus and Perfect run reads very easy, when Worm is harder - but still addictive. The Fifth defiance i dnf'd for now, because got bored of europian non-powered povs. But the powers there can be most unique, and the story under whole apocalypse thing is great.

    Zombie Knight Saga. It's technically closer to cultivation than superpowers, but in practice it turns out to be superpowers mostly. It's good with some really good fights, and the whole zombie thing is played out well.

      Small warning: TZKS is a great webserial but it appears to have been abandoned, and even if it hasn't the author has already taken many, very lenghty and unexplained hiatuses

    Have you read Homestuck? The fanbase made it really hard to enjoy while it was active, but now that it's done I imagine it would be a really fun/interesting read.

  MidJourney can be a great tool for new authors to get decent covers for free or for very cheap. This might be useful to some people: [https://www.midjourney.com/auth/signin/](https://www.midjourney.com/auth/signin/)

  Look up some pictures on google / instagram, they look great and are very easy to make. In fact there's a recent post on this sub for some new fiction which I'm 95% sure the cover is made with it and it looks great.

    Definitely check out [The Dresden Files](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47212.Storm_Front?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=vDfYpCSGWs&rank=1) if you haven't already read them.

    [American Gods](https://www.goodreads.com/series/114135-american-gods) and [Anansi Boys](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2744.Anansi_Boys) by Neil Gaiman are also very good. Each is essentially a standalone novel that shares a setting, but it would probably be better to start with American Gods between the two of them.

      I like gaiman usually.  But was turned off midway though American Gods. 

      Dressed files, at least the book. Looked too stupid to me. I dropped it halfway as well

        The first few books of the Dresden Files are widely considered the weakest in the series, so it might still be worth looking into if you're short on reading material. They were the first books Butcher had ever written, so he was still finding his feet as an author.

          He's just so dull as a protagonist to me. He's supposed to be a very powerful wizard but he's always on the back foot. It feels like his reputation isn't earned and the way he speaks about women is annoying. Does it get any better or is it the same throughout?

    I posted my tentative recommendations a few months ago:

    * If you are not familiar with the *Unknown* school of fantasy, Anthony Boucher's [The Compleat Werewolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Compleat_Werewolf) (1942) would be a good place to start. It was fairly short and introduced a number of themes that would become common in urban fantasy and rational fantasy later.
    * The first novel in Fred Saberhagen's [Dracula series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_works_by_Fred_Saberhagen#The_Dracula_Series) (1975) is a retelling of the Dracula story from Dracula's perspective and "sets the record straight". Subsequent books follow Dracula's adventures in Sherlock Holmes' London and then in modern America/England. I liked the first 4 volumes back in the day, but thought that *Dominion* and the subsequent books were weaker. I am not sure how well the series has held up.
    * I enjoyed the [*Vicky Nelson* books ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanya_Huff_bibliography#Blood_series) when they came out in the 1990s. The problem is that I thought that *Blood Debt*, the 5th book in the series, was the most rational one and you have to read books 1-4, which are less rational, to get there. Still, it may be worth a try.

      Hmm. Loved Saberhagen's Berserker and Book of Swords. Didn't know he wrote a Dracula series. Will check it out.

    ```
    Seanan McGuire writes both the InCryptid books (cryptid biologists/ecologists) and the October Daye books (half-blooded fae investigator with a penchant for getting her own blood all over herself).

    Kate Griffin wrote the Matthew Swift books, aka the Midnight Mayor books. Also wonderful.

    Ben Aaronovitch wrote the Peter Grant books, aka the Rivers of London books. Great books too.
    ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    Last week I recommended The Rivers of London series, which is a comfy low stakes urban fantasy taking place in London with a lot of attention to British Culture and a large amount of dry wit. Rather than putting werewolves and vampires into the setting, the cultural history of London is turned magical.
    ```

  - u/cultureulterior:
    ```
    The 20 Palaces series is quite good (don't start with the "20 palaces" prequel), though quite liberal in tone, which clashes with the "kill sorcerers at any cost" setting
    ```
