## What if we get a message that the whole universe is a simulation? How do we use that information?

  From Accelerando: "He slips his glasses on, takes the universe off hold, and tells it to take him for a long walk while he catches up on the latest on the tensor-mode gravitational waves in the cosmic background radiation (which, it is theorized, may be waste heat generated by irreversible computational processes back during the inflationary epoch; the present-day universe being merely the data left behind by a really huge calculation). And then there's the weirdness beyond M31: According to the more conservative cosmologists, an alien superpower – maybe a collective of Kardashev Type Three galaxy-spanning civilizations – is running a timing channel attack on the computational ultrastructure of space-time itself, trying to break through to whatever's underneath."

  Typically the goals upon finding out everything is a sim is to abuse the system: to attack it to either escape the simulation to underlying reality, or to make the simulation better in whatever way you define that, typically resulting in either victory and the end of the story, or problems  arising followed by conquest of the problems and either return of status quo or the victory as above. See examples: Yudkowsky's That Alien Message, Vinge's The Cookie Monster, Chalker's Well of Souls books, the Matrix movies, the game Star Ocean 3, a lot of [qntm](http://qntm.org)'s stuff, some of Greg Egan's stuff, and a whole host of others I am not thinking of at the moment.

  I'm reminded of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKA4w2O61Xo) by Veritasium.  When trying to figure out how something unknown works or if it is true, you should try to disprove what you believe.  

  Now, what we are given from the letter is that there are 3 things that were programmed to behave weirdly.  Those 3 things are human consciousness depending on a brain, some "logical paradoxes", and quantum uncertainty.  Naturally in order to prove that we are not in a simulation, we should attempt to disprove one or more of these beliefs.  We could create an artificial consciousness or discover what causes the observation effect in quantum measurements.  I'm not sure what logical paradoxes are supposed to exist but they are usually some kind of argument which is not really something that exists per say.  We can't really prove we are in a simulation with these however.  

  I guess convincing evidence that we're in a simulation would have to be some kind of action that violated our commonly known laws of physics, like the moon suddenly appearing on the opposite side of the earth but with no observable physical manipulation.  Maybe having some law of mathematics rewritten to where it no longer makes sense and creates some kind of paradox.  I think the only way to prove that we are in a simulation is to show that the simulation is alterable in some way, otherwise it can also be explained simply by "that's how things work".

  If we just get words in the sky saying "This is a simulation"? That tells us nothing that philosophers haven't already speculated about for a long time. It will confirm one particular theory true, but we've already got quite a lot of literature on what happens if we are in a simulation, so... all we know is that *this* already-formed hypothesis is right and *that* one is wrong, it's only a few bits of information.

  All right, there's a little bit more than that - it tells us that God learned to speak English, that we've been noticed, that the universe doesn't exist solely for the benefit of stars or electrons or even Martian bacteria but for *us*. Which is good to know. Alternatively, it tells us that we're not in a simulation, just the victims of the world's greatest prank.

  But if you're going to tell me I'm in a simulation, I'd appreciate some practical data too, like the API keys.

    If we just get words in the sky saying "This is a simulation" that just tells us someone is having a laugh. Can't we draw words in the sky already? :)

  I've seen that message a few times, but I'm a weak agnostic.  Without proof, I won't give it any credit.

  How can you take advantage of a simulation, other than through the means we've already been attempting to take advantage of the world? After all, even if this world was a simulation, it's been playing by very consistent rules so far. Knowing it's a simulation won't change that. In fact, knowing that it's a simulation would just make me worried, because that would mean we have some rather evil gods on our hands who are apathetic at best.
  ```

  - u/Thelonious_Cube:
    ```
    Knowing it's a simulation might give you some ideas about different ways to exploit things.

    Evil gods - or is it us?

    Is a game designer evil because people suffer and die in his games?  I'm not sure
    ```

    - u/RolandsVaria:
      ```
      What ideas? How do you think you'd try to exploit a simulation that looks just like the world as it is now.

      A game designer is evil if they have sapient life in their games that they don't treat as well as possible. If our world is a simulation, then it is many orders of magnitude more complex than anything a typical game designer could create, and the comparison doesn't really follow.
      ```

      - u/Farmerbob1:
        ```
        I'm not sure I can agree with your assessment of evil.  I can't categorically reject it either, but I would feel more comfortable with apathetic as a likelier reality.  With no ability to interact with the creator of the simulation, we would have no way to assess their attitude.

        For all we know, the creator is an incompetent, and broke something an unfathomable time ago in our simulation.  They've spent the last several billion years of our subjective time learning and trying to fix it, progressively making our lives better...

        In that scenario, I'd say they could be considered something of a hero to us, since they didn't just scratch everything and start over.
