  Speculation on the other magic mentioned:

  Each magic seems to encourage a particular kind of philosophy. Denialism is Kantian virtue ethics, right down to the contrast of duty and inclination. Ritualism is pretty clearly utilitarianism, that's the whole point of the story. There's even a digression on how denialism can be understood as a subset of ritualism based on the presence of an ends - bodily power - just as the argument that virtue ethics can be understood as a subset of utilitarianism with the ends of living a righteous life (or something like that, I can't recall). Both influential ideas in the enlightenment, heading into the industrial revolution.

  So what is Eloism? Competition among equals - is that a reflection of market forces, the Invisible Hand? And elementalism - is that an allegory for the romantic movement? Submitting your will to the sublimity of nature? I really don't have much backing this up, but I'm really curious whether the analogy continues in the rest of the world.

    Both those are being saved for the sequel, and neither is fully fleshed out at this point, in part because I don't have even the bare bones to the sequel's plot fleshed out yet. I *think* that I like competition vs. cooperation as a follow-up theme though.

    (Eloism takes its name from [the Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system).)

  Dammit. I just started some new books, and my next chapter is due soon. Saw this and thought "I'll just read the prologue."

  Now I'm hooked. Great writing, as usual. The two magic systems are intriguing. The characters too. I'll have to resist reading more until next month at least.

  Minor typo at the end of the prologue: "is reasoning" should be "his reasoning."

    As fair warning, this is *super* rough. It was written Nov 2014, Nov 2015, and Nov-Dec 2016, at a pace of roughly 2,000 words per day throughout (edit: that math doesn't work out). There was never any beta reading, nor any editing beyond what I did in the course of rereading sections, so there are whole chapters there that have only had a single pass through my brain at high speed.

      Just letting you know it was very enjoyable and a nice change of pace to experience your writing in novel form

        Spirits exist in three forms: living in the world in spirit form, existing as a magic item which can go beyond the domain of the spirit, and living in the spirit realm. Ulf comes out of the spirit realm and into the physical realm when Sofia is around 10 years old (IIRC, still haven't reread it), which makes him one of the first to appear. Sofia comes into her power more as she gets older (and spends more time with spirits), so they come to her more easily.

        There's this little subplot where she's known to be a spirit caller at five years old and then that get repressed by Hirrush, but I don't think I actually ended up doing too much with that - it was meant as a false-start or false-awakening or something?

        (Ulf is also solitary and taciturn as far as spirits go.)

    Yeah, spirit magic OP. You get spirit magic, you win. On the othet hand, there's no reliable way to get spirit magic. You have to be born with it, and it seems to happen only every few *dozen* generations, if that.
    ```

  - u/stale2000:
    ```
    Not only is spirit magic OP, but the characters are AWARE that it is OP, and treat it as such.

  So I might have missed it in my excitement, but did we ever learn specifically what the outcome of Henry's ritual sacrifice would have been?
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I wanted to get things done today, but no... I read this instead. It was excellent.

  Also, in the beginning of the Epilogue, you say something along the lines of "Hirrish sat down next to Hirrish" where you mean "Henry"
  ```

- u/Kodix:
  ```
  I'm really happy to see you post this. I read the first chapters you released during the NaNoWriMo in (apparently) 2014, and I was eagerly awaiting more. 

  So yay, finally! Also, congratulations on finishing!

  Could you format this in an easier way to read please? It's especially tough on people who are on mobile.

    I compiled the page into [an epub](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxFRUeX-WeahZ2dDMGJPdW9HVDA) earlier for personal reading. The format might be glitchy.

  Hmmmm. There's a couple of places where the wrong character name is used - Rowan's sword kills Ibrahim by placing a cut on *Rowan's* leg, and Hirrush stands beside himself in the epilogue (I thought at first that the latter would eventually reveal one of the two to be a thoughtform...).

  --------------

  [On the magic system](#s "Others in this thread have suggested that the Spirit Caller magic is completely overpowered compared to all others. I... question that. The power of a Spirit Caller is never in the Spirit Caller themselves, but rather in the Spirits. (They seem inclined to treat a Caller well, but that's probably only because the Caller is the only one who can ever make what they want known to others... their only translator, so to speak). And the Spirits are not forced to obey the Caller, as evidenced by the cloth teashop spirit. Moreover, the Spirits clearly want *something* from the material world, as evidenced by the fact that they gather near the Caller in such profusion - some pretending to be just 'passing by'.")

  [Further thoughts on magic](#s "So, when I think of what would have happened if Rowan had had the Spirit Caller magic instead of Sofia - Rowan would have mistreated the Spirits, used and abused them for his own ends. But the Spirits are explicitly *not* human. They trade in intangibles (with Dark Wizards and Oathkeepers), they can see intents, and they can escape to an alternate layer of reality. Moreover, the presence of prophecy - and the fact that a Forsworn Sister, who explicitly gets her abilities from Spirits, could see the future - implies that the Spirits do not exactly have the normal linear relationship with time.")

  [On the nature of prophecy](#s "Prophecy is an interesting twist. It always begs the question - does it predict something that *will* happen, one way or the other, an inviolate fate that can never be altered, or does it imply the presence of some force that will *force* the prophesied Event to happen, one way or the other? Either way, it appears they can turn up unexpectedly - which raises the possibility that at least some of the Spirits are deliberately *steering* civilisation, for one or another reason. (They may even be responsible - via indirect means - for the current poor state of Dark Magic - perhaps they were getting mobbed and decided to reduce their customers to more manageable levels?) But it's interesting that they mediate *all* magic. I wonder what their ultimate aim is - are they perhaps no more than extradimensional tourists, are they trying to artificially increase the number of Spirit Callers, or are there several groups working at cross-purposes?")

  Stayed up all night reading this. I really liked the magic systems, and  am really curious about the spirit world and what the characters are going to be trying to do.

  Also the romance is cute as hell.

  >He dispatched with three of Rowan’s seeds, held

  He being Rowan. Not sure if you're allowed to fix mistakes 

  >Excuse me, said Sofia, but do you have a house spirit here?”

  Missing "" "

  >Hirrush sat down on the bed beside Hirrush, laid back

  Errors do seem to increase up towards the end, suggesting a slow down in proof reading. Curious.

- u/makoConstruct:
  ```
  Hmm. Are spirits an analogy for intuitions? Is the process of turning them into magical items an analogy for sublimation? Essentially... Sophia has control over the mind (world) because she respects the remnants of the old world (spirits) that it was built from. This mirrors the process of maturation a person undergoes as they understand the context and purpose of their instincts and learn to move with them instead of against them.

  Super cool if true. Though I often question the value of veiled analogies... I'd bet we'd have more of an impact on people if we'd just come out and say things. Hard to judge though. The maturation process is slow and mysterious and most of us don't get to watch them unfold from start to finish, very often.

  Finished. Really cool! Needs some proofreading and fleshing out of a few parts, but overall it was a very pleasant and enticing read!

    It is finished, as the [C]omplete tag in the title indicates

  I haven't read this yet, but is it related to [The Dark Lord of Derkholm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Lord_of_Derkholm) (a fun children's de/reconstruction of the fantasy genre by the excellent Diana Wynne Jones)?
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    I wondered that as well: it's such a great hidden gem that almost no one I've met has heard of. It was my book recommendation during [our episode on Prophecies,](http://daystareld.com/podcast/rationally-writing-13/) partially because I liked how little an impact prophecy had in it and partially because I wanted to expose others to its awesomeness.
    ```

      Jones in general I feel lacks the popularity she rightly deserves -- I only encountered her as a result of Ghibli's adaptation of Howl's Moving Castle, but after that quickly made my way through the rest of her works. I always liked her tendency to wrap things up nicely by the end of the book, where all the plot threads come together and characters re-meet (or are revealed). Similar to Gaiman's *Stardust* in that way (who she was good friends with). The sequel to DLoD, *Year of the Griffin*, is a solid read, too! (the Moving Castle series probably being tied for the two Derkholm books, with the Chrestomanci series in second, and Dalemark/Magids third)
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Aye, I enjoyed Year of the Griffin a lot. It was shorter than I would have liked, but seeing more of the world was great. I especially liked the subplot of people with magic wanting to use it to explore other planets :)

      I love everything she writes! She was my favorite author as a kid in high school. Using Yudkowsky's words, her characters are very often at level 2 where they actually have a spark of intelligence and are allowed to react like real people rather than one dimensional caricatures.
