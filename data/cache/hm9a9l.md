## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Nonfiction recommendation, [**A Collection Of Unmitigated Pedantry**](https://acoup.blog/), a historian's look at a pop culture depictions of historical topics. One particularly good series is [an analysis of the Siege Of Gondor](https://acoup.blog/2019/05/10/collections-the-siege-of-gondor/) that talks about how the process of a siege works, the operational concerns of the Gondor campaign, and more. I also enjoyed this [explanation of what the practice of polytheistic religion is actually like](https://acoup.blog/2019/10/25/collections-practical-polytheism-part-i-knowledge/), which will ring all sorts of bells for people who read the Less Wrong sequences. And for a more challenging series, a look at [what Sparta was actually like, what's inaccurate about its modern reputation, and where that reputation came from](https://acoup.blog/2019/08/16/collections-this-isnt-sparta-part-i-spartan-school/). Also of relevance to this community, the author has built an index of the articles by what [would be useful for world-builders](https://acoup.blog/resources-for-world-builders/).

    I'm a History teacher and I'm fairly skeptical of Internet Historians, but I followed the link and it's fantastic.  His teardown of Sparta reads as slightly biased in a few sections, but it's also absolutely wonderful at recontextualizing that era of History.  If I taught an IB / AP class I would have my students read it over a couple of days.

  I'm two books into the Wheel of Time and... does it get better?

  This isn't exactly the place for it, but [I've posted my thoughts elsewhere on the first two books](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/hm4a3c/what_books_did_you_start_or_finish_reading_this/fx42rp5/), and the TL;DR is that I'm not particularly impressed, especially given the popularity of WoT and general praise I've heard directed towards it.

  I'm probably going to read the rest of it, either way, but I'd like to know how to calibrate my expectations.

    It pretty much keeps on keeping on.  If you've read two books, I think you've got the idea at this point.
    ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    It's a conventional fantasy, in that it follows the "farmboy becomes hero and defeats the supreme evil" to a T. If you don't like it by book 2 you probably won't like it later on, because while book 3 has a nice ending the books thereafter keep getting slower and slower paced, and book 10 is a total slog (which is where I gave up). However, it is a very polished and well executed version of the classic fantasy story, where you already know what the ending would be. The fun part is seeing the journey the characters take to get there. Unless you're in the mood for something like that, my guess would be that you won't enjoy it.
    ```

    - u/Nimelennar:
      ```
      I don't mind the "farmboy becomes hero and defeats the supreme evil" story, especially fresh takes on it.  As I stated in the linked comment; that's a good way to start out with a relatable protagonist, introduce the reader to the world, and provide a steady raising of stakes throughout the narrative.

      It's the execution and the journey I'm having problems with; the protagonists (especially Rand) are always on the back foot, and the antagonists aren't compelling or competent.
      ```

      - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
        ```
        I used to love the WoT series. I read it as it was coming out (the latter half at least), and reread it several times during that period. However, what I eventually came to realize was that about half the books/plot don't really serve a purpose in the larger narrative.  

        You could completely remove several major plotlines (each of which took up at least one full book, and parsts of others) and all it would do is help make the story clearer. 

        The series has cool worldbuilding (with a host of interesting cultures, creatures, locations , history etc.) and an interesting system of magic, but that's about all it has going for it. If that's enough for you, great, you'll probably enjoy it. But you if want good characterization, decent writing, lack of unnecessary angst, and plots that make sense, well.....there is a reason that I haven't gone back to it since it finished.
        ```

      - u/Iconochasm:
        ```
        Books 3 and 4 have the protagonists switching into more of a proactive role.
        ```

  - u/vokoko:
    ```
    It's popular for historical reasons, mostly - it got published in a bit of a drought for the genre and proved that this type of extremely long multi-volume series that wasn't episodic in nature could actually sell.

    I think if it was published in 2020 it'd maybe pay back a modest advance at best.
    ```

  - u/Amonwilde:
    ```
    It probably peaks around books 4-6 or so. Good worldbuilding and pretty memorable characters. The plotting doesn't really shine. I actually think the first two books are pretty weak, so the best is still ahead of you. It does get appreciably worse by the end of the Jordan segment, to the point where ther's a whole book you should just skip toward the end, as literally nothing happens. The Sanderson send-off is tolerable, though, if you'll need closure.
    ```

  - u/DeepTundra:
    ```
    I personally found that the length of the books and the size of of setting they try to depict became grindingly difficult halfway through. Like, taking 6 viewpoint characters and separating them, swapping between them between chapters, building up a story and cast around each of them that is as big/complicated as an ordinary ensemble in its own right...kinda just tired me out. Not to say that there aren’t amazing moments in each one of the books, but it sometimes get buried under the weight of everything else.

    And also, as much as I think Sanderson is a good author, the last book was almost entirely gibberish to me. Maybe from being worn down so far by the preceding books, maybe from the way the plot is executed. 

    Overall I think the series has lots of great ideas and characters, but getting access to all that is far from free in terms of mental work.
    ```

  - u/Charlie___:
    ```
    I would say that it does get better. And then worse. And then better again, and then worse again, and then better again.

    There's space for it, after all.

    Book 4 is where the world really starts to open up. If book 1 is the honeymoon phase and book 2 is the "honeymoon is over" phase (and book 3 doesn't fit well in this sequence), then book 4 involves a lot of getting to appreciate your spouse as a person. And then things go sideways for a few books, and eventually start to go sideways-of-sideways.

    Anyhow, I'd say the boring is worth the payoff of the exciting - often these are side-be-side, particularly in books 9-10. And then Brandon Sanderson comes in and more or less cleans everything up in books 12-14.

    The antagonists will never be compelling or competent. The books, despite all the fighting, are not about Rand al'Thor defeating the forces of evil. They're *about* all the backstabbing intrigue and personal growth of the characters that happens along the way of Rand al'Thor defeating the forces of evil.
    ```

    - u/Nimelennar:

      > the backstabbing intrigue and personal growth of the characters

      Excellent!

      When shall I expect this to start?

  An off-the-wall ...not sure whether I'd say "recommendation", but I'd really enjoy seeing /r/rational discuss this work:

  [The Craftsman](https://github.com/sensui/the-craftsman-book/tree/master/originals/1.%20ObjectMentor), a sci-fi serial by Robert C. Martin. (The link goes to the first collection of chapters; further collections can be found by navigating up from there.)

  Yes, [that](http://www.cleancoder.com/products) Robert C. Martin; "Uncle Bob" Martin; the guy people most associate with the popularization of ["agile" software development](https://agilemanifesto.org/), the [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) in OOP programming, etc. Back in the 90s, he wrote extremely campy edutainment fiction.

  These stories, from what I can tell, were originally intended as a sort of cute ongoing bonus (like comics are in the newspaper) for readers of Martin's own *Object Mentor* magazine. But, even after that went defunct, he continued contributing the serialized vignettes for a while to various other magazines: first *Software Development*, and then *Dr. Dobb's Journal*.

  I call the story "edutainment", but I mean that in the same way that HPMoR is "edutainment": it's meant to teach you things, but it's also so heavily *dramatized* (at least, after the first few chapters) that it feels less and less like a thought-experiment or satire, and more like a real attempt at science-fiction by someone who just happens to have a special interest in software engineering that they want to communicate through the work.

  The setting for these stories is also kind of interesting: the protagonist's is a "maintenance software engineer", which doesn't seem that notable until it is gradually revealed that the codebase he's (in part) charged with *maintaining* is that of the generation-ship he and a million other people live within. The maintenance they're doing is to the generation ship's centuries of accrued cruft logic that determines everything from soylent-green allocation to emergency bulkhead release. (Also, much like in Yudkowsky's fictional *Bayesian Conspiriacy*, or in [these well-known programming koans](http://thecodelesscode.com/contents), the protagonist is seemingly an apprentice in some sort of software-engineering trade-guild system.)

  Honestly, it's not that I think this story is very good (or even that it accomplishes very well what it sets out to do: teaching people software-engineering concepts.) But the premise is golden. I'd love to see someone here take "maintaining the codebase of the thousand-year-old ship you and a million other people depend on" and run with it as a real ratfic, intended solely for entertainment value. Maybe even still keeping "the value of software craftsmanship" as a theme, but presented less as a thing to be beaten over the head with, and more as a *hidden power* that you can observe the story's characters winning with, or losing for its lack (like solid statecraft is in *Practical Guide to Evil*.)

    Someone actually did write that. It was about nonbinary computer programmers, and partway through the main character discovers a subculture of people who hew more closely to the binary and enjoy having sex. Or something like that. I don't remember the title though. It was hosted on Archive Of Our Own.

  ```
  I am looking for self insert fanfiction that focuses on the SI having realistic expectations. They just want to survive whether it’s by laying low or by a accumulating power. A lot of self inserts are crack or they go out of their way to ingratiate themselves with the canon characters to have a happy go lucky adventure. Not my cup of tea. Fix-it is fine as long as it’s for personal well being and not because they feel sorry for someone. Worm self inserts have a free pass because they got to play Peggy sue fix it to stop the sword of Damocles IE Scion for killing them in 2 years.
  ```

  - u/chiruochiba:
    ```
    I've been reading a lot of *Naruto* SI fics recently, so I can recommend some of those.

    The *Naruto* universe has an apocalyptic future on a similar scale to Worm, so in my opinion 'fix it' stories in that fandom would also benefit from your free pass. That being said, all of these fics are ones I like because they don't indulge in any of the typical 'fix it' stereotypes:

    These two are set in the past before *Naruto* canon:

    * [Sanitize](https://archiveofourown.org/works/20721824/) - A doctor reincarnates in the Warring Clans era and gradually changes the world by introducing modern medical practices.
    * [The Clan of Samsara](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10564973/1/The-Clan-of-Samsara) - An entire clan composed of people who reincarnated from Earth throughout history.

    The following fics are closer to the canon timeline but only touch on it peripherally. Each SI is a civilian who has to deal, in various ways, with the harsh realities of living in a world dominated by ninja.

    * [Great Lakes & Expectations](https://archiveofourown.org/works/12083631/chapters/27383880)
    * [Plasticity](https://archiveofourown.org/works/16017161/chapters/37377839)
    * [Paradise Found](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13080855/1/)
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I'll have to de-recommend Plasticity. While it *is* true that the main character is mainly focused on surviving in a world full of unstable murderers no matter the price... the fic in general is more of a meandering, demented dance between 'full grimderp' and 'full crack' that broke my SoD within several chapters and only continued to get more absurd with time. It's not *bad* per se, but it's definitely not 'laying low', 'accumulating power', or being 'realistic' in any way. Well, there's something to be said about how 'humor' is a part of real life too, and so 'realistic' in its own way, but, at least for *me*, Plasticity goes way beyond that and into the 'crackfic' category. I liked some of it, and would recommend it in other contexts, but definitely not in this one--while I can't really speak for the OP, I get the feeling they're looking for something more down-to-earth.
      ```

      - u/chiruochiba:
        ```
        In my opinion, "Plasticity" has some important qualities that set it in a different category from crack fics.

        To me, crack fics are ones that frequently disregard realism and internal consistency for the sake of humor. "Plasticity", on the other hand, realisticaly portrays the internal lives of its characters and the consequences of their actions.

        The humor comes from the clash when the main character's futile struggles conflict with the expectations of her captors and sometimes lead to absurd results. While the situation is deadly serious for the people involved, it comes across as humorous to an outside observer. Thus, rather than being a 'crack fic', to me the fic falls into the separate category of 'crack taken seriously'.
        ```

        - u/IICVX:
          ```
          Ya exactly - IMO the difference is that normal crackfics have insane versions of canon (e.g, [Taylor Has a Strange Hobby](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/taylor-has-a-strange-hobby-yandere-taylor.860167/), or [Seventh Horcrux](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/), or [Sasuke and the Power of Lies](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13472966/1/Sasuke-Uchiha-and-the-Power-of-Lies) (the last two are by the same author, what can I say they do a great crackfic)); Plasticity is largely true-to-canon, but the SI gets put in to crackfic-esque situations *because* the canon characters are so insane.
          ```

          - u/AcceptableBook:
            ```
            It doesn't help that the SI is only questionably sane at the beginning of the story and has her sanity go downhill from there

      ```
      All these seem to be female leads. Any recommendations on some good male SIs?
      ```

      - u/chiruochiba:
        ```
        I haven't found any male!SI fics that I'd recommend in the Naruto fandom, but Pangolin on SpaceBattles has written a great *Bleach* SI fic:

        * [Psychopomp](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/psychopomp-bleach-si.747151/) - The main character awakens as a Hollow in Hueco Mundo a millennia before the events of canon. The story follows his personal evolution towards purpose and meaning in an inherently unjust universe.

        - u/dinoseen:

          Do you need Bleach knowledge?
          ```

          - u/chiruochiba:
            ```
            Sort of, yes. You don't need an in-depth understanding of the canon plot or characters, but some aspects of the story make a lot more sense if you have basic familiarity with the backstory and setting.

            When I read it, I only had vague memories of what Hollows and Shinigami were in the anime, so I used the wiki to fill in the blanks whenever the fic touched on something I didn't know.
            ```

      - u/CaramilkThief:
        ```
        I've tried to find good male SIs as well. Here's a few that I enjoyed. They don't all follow OP's premise though.

        * [Going Native] (https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13398050/1/Going-Native) is a great DBZ/DC crossover with a dubious SI who reincarnates into Tarble. It's a well integrated crossover and has some really good galactic politics. 

        * Brockton's Celestial Forge has the SI be a shard, and is from the pov of the bearer of that shard (which comes with the powers of the celestial forge, basically nerfed inspired inventor). It's a good way to avoid the pitfalls of the usual SIs, plus the main character actually has a character. Slow paced but picking up speed.
        ```

        - u/kraryal:
          ```
          Thanks for the recommendation. I'm really enjoying Celestial Forge and it's long enough to go for a while. The main character feels like a real person, and the one time I wanted to call him out for not seeing something obvious he realized it three paragraphs later.

  - u/ThePhrastusBombastus:
    ```
    I read **[Hear the Silence](https://archiveofourown.org/works/15406896)** recently, which is a Naruto SI fanfic that would probably fit.  The SI's goal in life is basically to die of old age with as many friends and family as she can manage to bring with her.  Unfortunately, the story is pre-canon and starts near the beginning of the Second Shinobi World War.  Since the story is set so far in the past, most of the characters are original by necessity, though canon characters are mixed in.  For example, the SI's parents are original, but her >!brother!< is canon.

    The main character is born into a very minor clan, with her mother being the only surviving member at the time of her birth (her father married in).  She doesn't have a kekkai genkai.  However, her clan can >!acclimate to different poisons they come into contact with, which lets them prepare and use poisons more liberally than other shinobi.!<  So she has a few advantages to leverage, but isn't in a particularly special position to start with.

    Unfortunately, Naruto is a story about child soldiers, and this causes a fair amount of trauma for the SI and the other characters.  Dealing with trauma is a major reoccurring theme of the story, in fact.  It can get a bit angsty, to be honest, but if you can get past that it's pretty good.

    The story is quite long at 675k words, and progresses slowly but steadily though the years.  The SI regains cognizance at around one year old, and has thus far made it to the age of >!13 years old!<.

            That's not a thing I can recall happening, and indeed seems very out of character for the Main Character.

  Any good alternate history stories?

   I'm game for anything of quality, but if there's a story of a timeline better than our depressing world that would be swell. Maybe a timeline where there was no transatlantic slave trade, or where there was no scramble for Africa, no colonialism, or where there third world movement actually succeeded.

  A good alternate history novel that I'd recommend would be [Years of Rice and Salt](https://www.amazon.ca/Years-Rice-Salt-Novel/dp/0553580078) by Kim Stanley Robinson, where the main premise is that the black plague killed off 90% of Europeans.

  edit: er, just to be clear, the request and the recommendation are not connected, except by the alternate history theme. I do not think that killing 90% of europeans would lead to a "timeline better than ours", except maybe by chance. Human nature is *human* nature.

    Being the isekai reincarnation of a modern Japanese salaryman, she obviously doesn't go for the whole "blame religious minorities" and "genocide as an industry" thing, leading to a much less horrifying not-Germany in the alternate universe.

    Is our timeline really depressive ? The current outlook is that africa will become the next southeast asia in 20-30 years. That's really cool and will likely end the remnants of racism that still exist. Also bad racist people tend to be old which means they'll die soon enough...

    &#x200B;

    We're just on a particularly bad year which sucks, but try keeping the long term in mind.
    ```

    - u/GlueBoy:
      ```
      It's not just the year. Anti-intellectualism is on a sharp rise, right wing authoritarianism is ascendant in several western countries that should know better, China is murdering/suppressing over a million of its own citizens(and no one is doing shit), corporations are dominating the political discourse to their own stupid, short-sighted ends, and above all else there is climate change, on which only the most milquetoast proposals are actually considered and implemented. 

      You say Africa is going to be the next southeast Asia, I say a good part of it is going to be increasingly uninhabitable in 20-40 years. 50+ degree summers, extreme and unpredictable weather patterns and water scarcity is going to result in tens of millions of displaced persons in Africa, maybe hundreds of millions worldwide. And it's going to be blamed(correctly) on the west. 

      What is this a recipe for? I don't know, but I think the effects are going to be as bad as the causes.
      ```

      - u/fassina2:
        ```
        That's a very pessimistic way of imagining our future. Things are getting better overtime, I know a lot of people don't like hearing this but it's a fact. You can find dozens of books and hundreds of articles on it. Murder rates dropping, war casualties decreasing, reduced death from disease on average, higher quality of life...

        Obviously the correct view is the balanced one rather than blindly optimistic or pessimistic, things are statistically getting better over time but new problems are arising that need solving.

        Here's the thing, you can optimize your content and information consumption in such a way that makes you feel good and happy or in a way that makes you feel bad or sad. 

        Unless you're in a position where you can make a meaningful difference, doing things that make you feel bad is not necessarily a good idea. It may feel important or meaningful likely due to some outdated evo psych heuristic our brain uses but it probably factually isn't.

        Or if you're like me and cares about the truth, just focus on that. Optimize your content consumption in a way that's compatible with it rather than focusing on optimistic or pessimistic sources. 

        PS. I'm almost certain things aren't going to be as bad as you seem to think.

          Agree to disagree. I think a rational study of current trends can only lead to a dire outlook, short, medium, and long term. I didn't even go into the inevitable great depression that's on the horizon, where we can expect around 10% contraction of the world economy this year. Who knows what that will mean for 2021...

          And while you're right that being depressed due to pessimism does no one any favors, the world could use pessimism more than it could use the status quo of willful ignorance and baseless optimism, imo.

  Has anyone here watched Hamilton the musical on Disney+? It came out on Friday, July 3rd, and I'm wondering if anyone here watched it and their opinions on it.
  ```

  - u/D0TheMath:
    ```
    I watched it, and while some parts of it were a bit weak, the best parts were truly powerful and executed masterfully. The music is also really great as I'm sure you heard. It does have a few historical inaccuracies, but none of them are plot-breaking.

    Really, for a time investment of ~2 hours, if you have Disney+ then you should certainly watch it. Cost to reward ratio is very low here.
    ```

  - u/TREB0R:
    ```
    I'd say it's worth watching if you have Disney+. The musical being filmed makes it so that some elements of the play are being lost in translation. Part of what I loved about the musical was the choreography of the background dancers, and when filmed, naturally the cameras will focus more on the main characters and you don't get all that's happening in the background. 

    This might just be me, but the emotional moments just didn't hit like they did the times I saw it live. Again, I think it's just a difference in the medium where if you see a live performance you will will be more engrossed and not be distracted by your phone or anything else. 

    I'm a huge Hamilton fan so I still enjoyed it quite a bit, just if you get a chance in the future, try and see a live performance. It's a great story where Hamilton is both the protagonist and antagonist and his ambition is both his greatest strength and weakness while Aaron Burr is set up as a foil to highlight Hamilton's strengths and flaws.

  [Blessed Time](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/33020/blessed-time) by CoCop

  Blessed Time is a relatively new story on Royalroad and scratches my time-loop itch. It's set in a fairly normal LitRPG fantasy world - with classes, skill levels and such. On their sixteenth birthday, people are given a gift from the gods. This gift is a supernatural (or in low level cases preternatural) ability. Once gifted, they also get access to classes, a status screen and the other LitRPG elements. Some people don't get gifted and there's hints this creates a discriminatory caste system but that's not been developed much so far.

  The central idea is the main character has an ability called Blessed Return, which sends his mind 5 years into the past. The ability then has a 5 year-cool down before it can be used again (so he can redo events multiple times but his 'redo window' only ever moves forward). This is a rare Mythic class gift, making it very powerful and very sought after. When he travels backwards in time, he looses his class but keeps his skills - resulting in progress across loops.

  I'm really enjoying the story. It's written at a fairly fast pace. Normally I'd think it's too fast but it's really needed to make use of it's five year time loops. It jumps along, highlighting important moments before skipping forward months or years. This means we actually get to see the MC take advantage of multiple loops and it's enjoyable seeing how differently they can go. 

  I recommend people give this story a read, if not now (as I said it's new with only 23 chapters), maybe in a couple of months.

    [As the Godking Wills](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28639/as-the-godking-wills) of the same author is even more rationally adjacent story. The premise is  that there is real omnipotent god above the government of theocratic empire, and the leadership should follow every command of the god to the letter, or else... It happens that the god is cruel, immature, not caring and like to issue a lot of commands. And then not issuing commands he is making disasters, just for fun of it.

    I like this story - it falls in to a sibling genre that's sort of like "competence porn"; I like to call it "reasonableness porn". 

    The basic idea is, instead of killing the monsters why don't we talk to them? 

    And the classic example is Ankh-Morpork's approach to warfare: let them in and sell them stuff.

          - u/vokoko:
            ```
            Like most serials, it takes a bit to hit the stride. But yeah, in the beginning the ghosts need to be put to rest and the constructs aren't really sentient beings. And she does try to talk to them all anyway, repeatedly.

            But it becomes much more of thing shortly after the dungeon and from then on.
            ```

            - u/Amonwilde:
              ```
              Thanks, might give it another spin eventually. I do think it fell into the common web serial trap of not introducing any characters or stakes for way too long. The system itself is also pretty incoherent, she gets a (presumably pretty strange) class for doing a little dance within ten seconds of appearing in the world? Her reasoning about moving on to the next dungeon level, rare in that she actually stopped to do some small amount of thinking, was notably bad, and, though I stopped reading shortly after that, I have to assume her poor strategic thinking was handsomely rewarded. I was down for the premise, as far as it went, but that dungeon is chapters and chapters in.

            Author of the Elemental Arena here.  Thanks everyone who has read and is discussing the story here.  It is true the MC is intentionally flawed, but he does have a character arc with growth.  The flaws are not glorified in my writing.  For instance, >!his "white knighting" is a knee jerk emotional reaction that immediately results in him getting his butt kicked, and chastised by other characters he respects and wants to be respected by.  He recognizes his mistake, and makes changes immediately, growing his viewpoint as he learns more about the nuances of the situation.  !<The changes to his brain and thought processes by the Mental stat growth is a recurring theme of the story.

That's one of the problems with webfiction, in a book the beta readers would point this type of thing out and it'd be removed from the root. On webfiction it's very difficult to remove it.

            As of right now, I am working on an edit of every chapter posted so far.  Even before now, I have already made a major edit and update to the most problematic chapter referenced indirectly in i\_choose\_magikarp's feedback.   I would recommend checking the story out in a couple of months once the full updated chapters are posted.

            One of my major goals in posting the story online was to receive feedback on my writing in order to improve and execute my ideas better.  Since I completed the first book last week, it seemed like a good time to take a short break and do some editing in between working on the second book.

            Mainly I will be focusing on improving the prose, removing repetitive sentences and ideas, and tweaking the dialogue to sound more natural.  Additionally, I will be pruning back a few of the problematic scenes, and toning down some of the initial romantic flirting.

            The characters are still flawed, that is intentional to some degree and definitely a matter of taste for the reader, but hopefully my execution will continue to improve.

  Just finished [The snake report](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/14396/the-snake-report) which reignited my yearning for stories where the MC is "**mentaly but not physically human**".

  Any more recommendations for more stories like this?

  Almost anything is fine (translated/manga/anime is fine too, but I probably read/watched most of them already and unfortunately none up to the quality of The snake report) and I am specifically after HUMANS reincarnated/transferred whatever into non-human bodies, (so not like Mud's mission where the MC is not actually human).

  Also ideally one where the MC actually does interact with the human population and is not just stuck in a dungeon the whole time or something. - I don't know what is so appealing to me about just reading the reactions of normal people to intelligent whatevers, and for some reason just the meaningless kindness of something which normally wouldn't do so makes me feel so happy.

   I asked last week, but didn't really get any answers for what I was after so wanted to try again.
  ```

  - u/MoneyLicense:
    ```
    The first thing that came to mind was the light novel Kumo Desu Ga Nani Ka? (So I'm a Spider, So What?). Although, it does take a while to get to the human-creature interaction stage.

    Other than that it's pretty similar to the snake report (or really vice versa) in that protagonists are both human minds in the body of (mutant) animals, in a dangerous dungeon.

      I recently started reading Dune, as one of the sci-fi classics, and was very surprised: it has much more of a a fantasy feel to me. I knew that was going to be part of it but was still surprised. I would recommend it for the world building, but I think age and the permeation of its tropes have hurt it in terms of reader enjoyment.

      Working through "classic" literature has made me deeply suspicious that 99% of people talking about and recommending them haven't read them at all or at least within a decade. It might seem obvious but the historic/classical parts of these stories tend to be very minor parts of them.
      ```

      - u/chiruochiba:

        Speaking for myself, I enjoyed the *Dune* series thoroughly when I first read it, and I've continued to enjoy it every time I've reread it over the years. It's not a matter of nostalgia goggles, not remembering the details, or thinking of the books in a historical context: *Dune* is just as good now as it was ten or twenty years ago.

        It's not hard scifi by any means, which is probably why you think it's closer to fantasy. I enjoy stories across the whole spectrum of the [Mohs Scale of Science Fiction Hardness](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfScienceFictionHardness), so I don't see that aspect of Herbert's setting as a negative.

    Roger Zelazny (prominent new wave scifi author of 60s-90s, known for *Amber* and *Lord of Light*) wrote some pretty good poetry, most of it early, before he moved on to prose.

    Unfortunately, it's not super easy to get your hands on it these days; I just looked for an online source and failed to find anything good.  It was originally published in small, limited-run collections that [go for a lot](https://www.amazon.com/Spin-Miracle-Poetry-Roger-Zelazny/dp/0934438498) used these days.  It was reprinted more recently in the [Zelazny project](https://data.nesfa.org/press/Books/Zelazny-Project.html) omnibus volumes, which are easier to get, but they're expensive.  Maybe you could get them from a library, though.

    If you do manage to get your hands on a source, poems of his I recommend:

     - To Spin Is Miracle Cat
     - Spring Morning: Missive
     - Song
     - Lobachevsky's Eyes (this one appears in his novel *Doorways in the Sand*)
     - To His Morbid Mistress

    *edit* [Here](https://libcat.ru/knigi/fantastika-i-fjentezi/kiberpank/57724-roger-zelazny-to-spin-is-miracle-cat.html)'s a sketchy Russian website with a bunch of them.

    Found a source for the full text of one, so here's a sample:

    -----

    **Song**

    When I learned the other day

    that everything Emily Dickinson wrote

    can be sung to the tune

    of "The Yellow Rose of Texas”

    I was crushed.

    It was true.

    I can no longer read Emily Dickinson

    but Lone Star ghosts flit across the page,

    the Alamo is not forgotten

    and I hear the thundering hoofbeats

    of the great horse Silver.

    .

    I wondered then

    whether every person who pens a poem

    has a tune,

    a secret melody which will destroy him

    if the word gets out.

    A small thought, perhaps,

    not quite as profound as it sounds;

    and those who fool with *vers libre*

    should be safer than most.

    Yet the notion nags.

    There’s an awful lot of music in the world...

    .

    To be trapped by John Cage

    or crushed by Leadbelly

    would be bad enough.

    But I have this nightmare

    of being done in by a hymn.

    If *Rock of Ages* gets me in the end,

    mocked Emily’s diamond eyes

    may sparkle like the dew

    in stillnesses that lie

    between the words and the Word.

    The first book of Dune is great. The second and third are quite bad (Although if you do like them, you should definitely read more Philip K Dick).

    Kind of a lot of ground to cover there, but you could grab some Joe Abercrombie (low fantasy, try *Best Served Cold*, perhaps), or grab the Amber books by Zelazny, which are more digestable and pretty fun. For sci-fi you might try the Murderbot Diaries by Wells or The Martian by Weir.

    Good audiobooks that should appeal from looking through my audible library:

    Murderbot.

    Thessaly series by Jo Walton.

    Baru Cormorant

    N. K. Jemisin the broken earth

    Ann Leckie.. pretty much everything she has ever written.

    Marie Brennan the lady Trent series.

    All of the Brandon Sanderson books in my library have top notch adaptions, but be warned, they are bricks in text form, so the audio books are very, very long. 


    Jacqueline Carey also gets the platinum adaptions, and Santa Olivia is a very fun romp.

    And for some lightweight humor (but humor very on brand for /rational) off to be the wizard by Scott Meyer

    And having said that, it occurs to me that Terry Pratchett is likely very well produced too, but since I read most of him in dead tree format, and the rest as ebooks I cant make promises.

    Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy was originally a radio play, and thus works fantastically well in that format, but I presume you have already read it.

    Brandon Sanderson does magic system exploration well. In most of his books, the magic systems are used to their potential. His writing on earlier works are kinda stilted, but he's gotten better each book.

    For quick punchy reads, try Vlad Taltos and Dresden Files and Alex Verus. Alex verus is perhaps the darkest of the bunch, but each series consist of quick 300ish page books. They also have some nice audiobooks.

    For long reads, you can't go wrong with Steven Erikson, Glen Cook, Robin Hobb, or Janny Wurts.

    I would strongly recommend Max Gladstone's *Craft Sequence* pretty strongly to anyone on this subreddit.

    It's set in an alternate world that vaguely resembles a magitech ealy-mid 20th century. The basic premise is that magic is generally based on belief and life energy, but about a couple hundred years before the "present" people figured out how to quantify and rigorously manipulate it. This left to a huge war that resulted in the new style of magic triumphant, creating a world where magic resembles modern financial and legal instruments, with the major players essentially acting as multinational corporations.

    The first book is about competing teams of necromancer-lawyers competing over which faction gets to resurrect a deceased god that died because it over-leveredged its belief and didn't have enough power to survive an unexpected contractual obligation. 

    In general, the books are thoughtful and imaginative in ways that should appeal to folks that like this subreddit. They tend to examine modern issues through a lens of magic in ways I've not really seen any other author do.

    [Shogun by James Clavell](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52382796-sh-gun?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=4MYseDdSOV&rank=1), about an englishman shipwrecked in Japan in 1600, based on a true story. Truly one of the best "stranger in a strange land" stories every written. Keep in mind that it's only loosely based on real events, and some of it has not held up that well. 

    Anything by [Neal Stephenson](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/545.Neal_Stephenson), still my favourite writer despite flubbing his last 3 books(imo). Easy mode: start with Snow Crash or Diamond Age. Medium: start with Cryptonomicon or the Baroque Cycle(trilogy). Hard mode: start with Anathem(my favourite, but very divisive).
    ```

    - u/NTKV:
      ```
      I read all of Neal's books when I was still in high-school. I loved Snow Crash, Diamond Age and Cryptonomicon. 

      I don't terribly remember the Baroque Cycle, but think I liked it. At that time, Anathem didn't connect with me, but I'm thinking about revisiting it. 

      As for some scattershot recommendations spanning a broad range of Genres with some relatively unknown and other quite popular:

      Book (nonfiction): The Disappearing Spoon: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements by Sam Kean. My all-time favorite book.  

      Book (Fiction): Probably the Discworld series by Terry Pratchett. I'd recommend either starting with the Night Watch series of books or one of his YA standalone novels, Nation, which is a masterpiece. Good Omens is also a good stand-alone novel.   

      Korean Webnovel- [Flow](https://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/flow/list?title_no=101&page=1) by HoneyB. My favorite complete korean webcomic. It has a setting in which everyone gets a wish from a gaurdian god but you have to pay an equivalent price. It's quite well done and I especially like the ending. 

      Finally, as someone is highly involved in rocketry, [Ignition](https://library.sciencemadness.org/library/books/ignition.pdf), is a story of experimental rocket propellant chemistry and is quite a good read. 

      I've watched a few movies recently and found most mediocre, but liked the Apollo 11 documentary, Parasite, Knives Out and 1917.  

      Finally, I would recommend Waltz with Bashir which is an animated war documentary film.
      ```

    That's kinda general. My goto recommendations are [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/), [Ender's Game](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/375802.Ender_s_Game), and [Lilith's Brood/the Xenogenesis Trilogy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60926.Lilith_s_Brood) for books, although I just finished [The Snake Report](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/14396/the-snake-report), and that was really good (the third book has yet to come out). 

    For TV I'd recommend [Hannibal](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2243973/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1), [The Americans](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2149175/), and [Avatar: The Last Airbender](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417299/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1). And for anime [Death Note](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1535/Death_Note), [Puella Magi Madoka Magica](https://myanimelist.net/anime/9756/Mahou_Shoujo_Madoka%E2%98%85Magica) (if you choose to watch this, make sure to stick with it until at least the 3rd episode before deciding to abandon it), and [The Promised Neverland](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37779/Yakusoku_no_Neverland?q=the%20promised%20neverland).

    Edit: also, recently watched the Hamilton musical, and that was amazing (it was recently released on Disney+).

    Edit2: A bit controversial I'm told (not in the culture war way), but I really liked [Sword Art Online](https://myanimelist.net/anime/11757/Sword_Art_Online) too (but *not* the second part, I'd recommend stopping after episode 14, and going no further).

      I'll note that so far [SAO Abridged](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuAOJfsMefuej06Q3n4QrSSC7qYjQ-FlU) has been very sharply written, and especially improves on character arcs and motivation.

        Sword Art Online:

        >!Idk, I think the second part would have made a good story on it's own, but because they reused the characters, it ended up just robbing the original of it's ending.!<

    Books:

    Wuthering Heights (1847), Frankenstein (1818), East of Eden (1952)

    Television and film:

    Groundhog Day (1993), In Bruges (2008), Oz (1997-2003), Agatha Christie's Poirot (1989-2013)

    Games:

    Ticket to Ride, Borderlands 2, Red Remover

    All of these are entry level and good.

  Pretty generic request here: Rational Lit-RPGs. Preferably fantasy based. 

  The wiki lists a bunch of stories, but none of them (except Harry Potter and the Natural 20) are obviously a Lit-RPG.

    Delve. Its on RR.
    ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    I haven't really seen much rational-genre explorations of litrpg, but these skirt the edge.

    * Infinite Realm: Monsters and Legends has a few main characters and a power system that is pretty well understood. Leads to some good worldbuilding. Characters are pretty well done too for the genre, with no character really holding the idiot ball later on (beginning is a bit different, but hey at least the characters learn and evolve past their mistakes).

    * Ar'Kendrythist starts off like Delve but goes on to do its own thing. The characters are well done imo and undergo some good development. Not as much of a rational munchkining as you may want, but for me it has been satisfying.
    ```

- u/SecondTriggerEvent:

  I've been watching anime lately. By default, it's not a particularly rational medium, but the following at least have consistent characterization.  


  Evangelion (Whole load of fantasy science, but covers real psychology. Picks up around the halfway point. Dubs are mediocre.)  
  Steins;Gate (Pop culture, science; will not hold up under scrutiny, but some of the science at least pays lip service to real theories. Picks up around the halfway point. Dub throws in some awkward slang occasionally, but also adapts references, and is high quality.)  


  Madoka Magica (Irrational characters, rational setting. Gen Urobuchi's works: Kamen Rider Gaim; Psycho-Pass; Fate/Zero, tend to fall under this banner. Picks up a few episodes in. Can watch as three movies, or a series + the third movie. Dub is great.)  


  Re:Zero (Realistic protagonist. Does a good job foreshadowing and keeping viewers hooked from the start. Probably my favourite of the lot. Dub is great.)
  ```

  - u/IICVX:

    People on /r/rational tend to like Promised Neverland, which has both an anime and a manga. I haven't watched it beyond the first few episodes myself tho, I have a hard time keeping up with anime.
