I don't know where to start with this one. There's so much. I feel like it should exist somehow. Surely I'm not the only person here who grew up alongside the saga. Help me out here, guys.

  There's /too/ much stuff, is the thing. Farshtey felt like the type of writer to connect a lot of stuff together with causal connectors just for rule of cool. "The work of the matoran keeps mata nui's body going!" What? How? Did we ever see /how/ the matoran's work keeps the Mata Nui robot going, like, how do their industries tie into Mata Nui? If Metru Nui is supposed to be in the head- as the brain, or at least close to the brain- where's the /processing/? How does Mata Nui's 'soul' move from a gigantic fucking robot's substrate to the Ignika? HOW DO LIGHT MATORAN TRANSFORM INTO BOHROK? /Why/ did the writer decide to make matoran transform into bohrok? 

  Like- it really felt like Farshtey started pulling bullshit out of his ass, as time went on. I'm not sure there's anything worth making sense out of, as much as I loved bionicle when I was young.

  Well, first of all thanks for that link. I already bookmarked it for everytime I might need a quick trip down the memory lane or when I need to explain to   friend just how big the Bionicle story got through the ages.

  As for writing a Bionicle Rational story, well... I think you might need to do it from the point of view of Makuta(Teridax of course). The reason from this comes from the way the story itself is structured.

  I've taken to interpreting the Bionicle universe just as the name tells it, a Biological Chronicle with a lot of interacting systems and sub-systems with diferent priorities and redundancy systems. The Great Beings created both Mata-Nui and its various inhabitants/materials/subsytems in redudant ways which both maximized its potential and allowed what they felt were the best chance of survival for the ecosystem as a whole. This was of course helped by the existence of elements such as Energized Protodermis which you would have to incorporate into the rational prespective as a given(you could either mention a concept similar to the universe as a computer simulation and the EP as a *goto* or just accept it and roll with it).

  In this kind of stories the universe pretty much runs itself by its own rules, and the problem with that is the length and details that the story explored. Although I would say that most characters' decisions were reasonable according to themselves and the world they inhabited, I wouldn't say they were completely rational, and exploring what would happen if they took vastly different actions would quickly run into problems. For the world to be self consistent according to the rules I mentioned earlier we have to assume there are a lot more of other subsytems and plans which we would see under other circumstances(and this is already assuming the events of the series as a statistically unplanned event whose scope of effects went way beyond most of the things the Great Beings had planned), and if the fanfic writer is forced into writing those it would be more of an original work than a fanfic within the rules of the universe.

  That's why I suggest Makuta as a focal point of the writing. From an outside prespective he's the one who observed and analised the world he was in and having defined its rules went around setting up plans and systems so he could exploit the rules. He was pretty much min-maxing his actions around Mata-Nui's redundancy systems so as to give himself the most solid standing rational wise.

  Was his plan all along to occupy the body due to the Toa defeating him? Not likely, just like Voldermort's plan for the Portkey was not for Harry Potter to escape with it, but he had plans made so that when he fell into such a situation he could exploit that. We never saw his plans for the case when they didn't defeat him, but we could probably imagine they existed.
