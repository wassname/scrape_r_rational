## [BST][HF][FF][D] HPMOR - Single PDF file now available

### Post:

/u/Pollorcetyks created [a PDF of the entirety of HPMOR](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/46a070/harry_potter_and_the_methods_of_rationality_full/), if anyone wants to grab it.

This was originally posted on /r/HPMOR and /r/FanFiction.

  This is mistagged - it's neither brainstorming, nor hard fantasy, and it's probably not discussion.

    Sorry about the mistagging. I meant to put "RST" instead of "BST", but what would otherwise be the correct tags? None at all?
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  What about the one in the "official" website? Wasn't that in a single file too?

  Also, wouldn't it have been better to wait until the epilogue?

    Apparently they hate the font of the official version, as they find it hard to read.  Ironic, considering the official version uses the same fonts as Rowling (and I love it so!).
