## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  I was starting to plan out a (more) rational *Timeless* fanfic, but kept getting hung up on how to model their version of time travel. So I went searching and found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3f21i6/bst_ripple_effect_time_travel/?ref=search_posts) which sounded almost exactly like what I was thinking of ... only to realize that I was the one who had written it, and was asking for help with the same thing I'm struggling with now. :(

    I only watched the pilot for Timeless and found it just okay. The underwhelming tv show I want to see rational fic for is The Librarians. That was a series that had a ton of imagination and occasional moments of brilliance, but could've been so much better. As is, it's just a goofier Warehouse 13 with less entertaining characters.

      I want to write a Timeless fanfic mostly because there's a lot of potential for existential dread, values dissonance, etc. You start with "the past is a foreign country" and then move toward "the present is a foreign country". I'm still figuring out what the punchlines would be though, and I would rather have a time travel model that makes *rational* sense rather than just *intuitive* sense.

      I agree that the show is mostly just okay, but I think that the supposed core mission of "preserve America" is a wonderful setup for a story that's about what America *is.* If the show grew some balls that might be what they would do, but I doubt that network television is the place for anything more than a whitewashing of history.

      It'll be coming back after National Novel Writing Month is done. I just sort of got off rhythm, which makes it hard to get back on rhythm. I've never done gymnastics, but when they're doing their routine and screw up once, then they screw up again, and the mistakes keep piling up because they're a bit rattled, so then they have to stop and center themselves before starting up again. That's sort of what I'm trying to do here, because I got off my rhythm, which leads to words coming out slowly, frustration with the words coming out slowly, second-guessing what I've written because clearly if the words came out slowly the viscosity of the words is wrong, wanting to write other words about different things, etc.

      So I have the vast majority of the next chapter written, but it's going to be a while until I know that I can move forward at a decent clip, and will definitely be after *The Dark Wizard of Donkerk* is done.

  Weekly update on my rational pokemon game, including work on the data creation tool Bill's PC.
  [Handy discussion links and previous threads
  here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EUSMDHdRdbvQJii5uoSezbjtvJpxdF6Da8zqvuW42bg/edit?usp=drive_web).

  So I missed last week, as my phone committed hara-kiri and I’m still waiting for the replacement
  to head in. /u/InfernoVulpix covered the update at least.

  This week involved a lot of research into voxel systems and brushing up on my hex grid library
  of choice, which recently went through a major version change. The unity project for the hex
  map prototype technically exists, but there’s nothing to show besides an empty scene. Reading
  up on how to create a voxel system based on hexes rather than cubes has taken more time
  than I anticipated; the ‘tons of literature’ that I was lead to believe existed on the internet is more
  concerned with whitepaper algorithms and/or code dumps, where what I need is more a bird’s
  eye overview. So oh well, guess it’s down to reading code to learn again.

  I’ve actually also spent some time tinkering with a command-line prototype of the NPC
  conversation/opinion/notoriety system, which hasn’t borne a whole lot of fruit yet but lets you
  define cities of variable numbers of people with randomized names and connections. We’ll see
  how far this can get in isolation from any other systems.

  The majority of the *visible* work I’ve done this week is on the feature roadmap. It was quite a
  mess previously, with sections but no real organization. [It now has a bit more order to
  it](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13e4bMBgsvshUBFShes2bG3RGXIzVYh16EPboqDTdpfA/edit?usp=drive_weband) has been fleshed out significantly more. Everything down to section
  15 is effectively complete, with the rest still pending. Once the rest has been finished getting
  cleaned up, I’ll have a better foundation to build the Software Requirements document on, as
  well as the Design Document 2.0.

  Some of the discussion highlights from [this past week’s Discord
  discussion](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-BBPJoGaMDwAsxP9lYNLyARKCGI9pZGLXf2x-IgWbfs/edit?usp=drive_web#heading=h.swbifc8jeyfw
  ):

  * We decided that vision will be handled in two parts: Perception will be a stat for all units that
  defines a small circle around the unit, maybe ~5 hexes or so on average. This will abstract out
  hearing, smell, and situational awareness, etc. A second Sight stat will determine how far the
  unit sees in front of it, with a cone extending in the direction the unit is facing. This naturally
  requires that we track which direction units are facing, which may or may not be an issue,
  especially with multiple heads. But it seems like a good starting point.

  * We put together the bare-bones design for a move association system, whereby an attack can
  be associated as a response to a particular incoming attack. This may or may not turn out to be
  too complicated.

  * We decided that trains probably aren’t a thing if businesses built around teleportation of goods
  ever gained traction.

  * We divided TMs into TMs and HMs: TMs will now be strictly the pokedex simulation “training
  video” that teaches how to use an unknown move, while HMs are actual vials or syringes that
  contain the ability to add organs that the pokemon does not have by default. HMs will not be
  content gates, and while you would have a Flamethrower TM, it won’t do you any good if you
  don’t also have the Oil Gland HM.

    Here are the latest odds from the bookmakers:

    **Clinton is the next president: 3/10 (short) odds, or ≤77% chance of Clinton being the next president.**

    **Trump is the next president: 5/2 (long) odds, or ≤28% chance of Trump being the next president**

    So, it's generally expected that Clinton is the next president, but it's totally plausible that Trump wins. Since this adds up to 105%+, you can tell they're shortening the odds to make a profit. These predictions are from a standing start, not contingent on anything in the future, and the odds change over time, etc. The bookies also give Sanders ≤2%, Biden ≤1%. I'll be interested to see how things turn out. 

    I hope that Trump does not win, because I think he will likely not be a good president for a variety of reasons. In retrospect, I was too hard on Bush, McCain, and Romney. Although I disagreed with their policies, I never doubted they wanted to do the right thing and help America. They weren't the enemy, just the opposition. Trump, though... sheesh, man. You know, I don't think he'll as bad as people say on some things (like I don't think he'll actually use nukes) but I think it will still be a bad presidency. A lot of the president's job is like super boring shit like appointing people to run various government agencies and making sure the right hand knows what the left hand is doing and attending complicated annoying staff meetings all the time. I can't imagine Trump will have the patience to deal with this effectively, or the humility to appoint and listen to smart secretaries and staffers. If he wins, though, I hope he proves me wrong.

    I do notice that there is a strong sentiment on some parts of the internet against Hillary Clinton because she is a very Washington-insider, business-as-usual candidate. "Too moderate," complain the Democrats. "Too corrupt," complain the centrists. "Literally the Devil," complain the Republicans. They're not wrong. Well, she's not literally the Devil but this isn't the actual complaint the Republicans have. And I do see why some people complain about her. Nonetheless, I voted for her in the primary over Bernie Sanders, because I didn't like Sanders' policies and I don't think he'd do nearly as good a job. I also voted for her in the primaries in 2008. As far as I can tell, Clinton will be a fine president if she wins. She's smart, tenacious, wonkish, centrist, and ambitious. I'll be voting for her on Tuesday. 

    Make sure to turn out and vote, everyone! If you are an American, it is your civic duty. As a citizen, you are entrusted with the power to cast a vote, and you have an obligation to exercise it.

    EDIT: fixed a typo in the odds

      Did we live through the same Bush administration?  I can believe that he believed in what he did.  That doesn't really change the fact that what he did was *atrocious*.

      I mean, he basically started out in office by passing a bunch of tax cuts I don't like, *scuttling the Kyoto Treaty after we'd already signed it*, encouraging consumerism as a response to the dot-com bubble collapse, and then *starting a bunch of aggressive wars and encouraging consumerism as a contribution to the war-effort while cutting more taxes during wartime*.  While also doing a bunch of other stuff I don't like personally and passing *massive* restrictions on civil liberties, including consolidating all internal security agencies (ie: what other countries rightly regard deeply corrupt agencies with totalitarian tendencies) into one big department (ie: one *big* deeply corrupt agency with totalitarian tendencies *and no civil-liberties laws to stop them*).

      Like, Bush was the guy who told the librarians to start handing over people's *public-library borrowing records* so his government could check for *terrorists*, by which he meant leftists.

      Bush was objectively really fucking bad.  It was under Bush that I had to hold my breath so a random guy in a mosque in my area wouldn't be convicted in a weapons trafficking "sting" that was *clearly* entrapment.  Luckily, the local Civil Liberties Union actually had our acts together, and so the case *was* eventually thrown out as entrapment.  By which I mean, under Bush, the FBI entrapped rando Muslims into weapons trafficking so it would have "terrorists" to hunt.

      And as far as anyone knows, none of this shit was ever rolled back under Obama.  Mind, I thought Romney was pretty damned evil, but just, you know, *bourgeois* evil, without as much of the god-bothering imperialist mayhem that made the Bush years so *exciting*.

      >Make sure to turn out and vote, everyone! If you are an American, it is your civic duty. As a citizen, you are entrusted with the power to cast a vote, and you have an obligation to exercise it.

      Your vote controls less than one bit of entropy.

      This is now the 4th Presidential election I have paid close attention to.  This is said every time, about every Republican candidate, to the point where it is now a cliche.  It's possible you're an introspective unicorn (much more likely than average, given what I've seen of you, base modifier for membership in this community, etc).  But there's something eyeroll worthy about watching people (who cried "Bushitler!", who declared the selection of Palin as VP the functional equivalent of *treason*, and who savaged Romney as a poor-murdering plutocrat extremist) suddenly realize that they have no room left to escalate their rhetoric against Trump.

      Disclosure:  I am voting Johnson, but I think Trump's [evil * ability to enact evil] <<< Hillary's [evil * ability to enact evil].

      Counterpoint to your final note: In all but the smallest, most local elections, any individual vote is staggeringly unlikely to matter.  I believe that the best justification for spending the time to do so is to enable the right to complain afterwards.  If this is not an important factor to you personally, then remember to vote IFF there is nothing you could be doing with your time that would be more useful to anyone.

        Yeah, one of the things that make politics so hard is that everyone wants to be superlative at all time. The opposition candidate is never "not that bad, but clearly worse than my favorite candidate", they're THE WORST CANDIDATE EVER AND THE MOST CORRUPT AND THE MOST EVIL.

        When Trumps says something about vets who commit suicide because they think they're tough but they can't take it, it's not "a clumsy statement from a good sentiment", it's Trump being the worst person ever. When Hillary says she might impose a no-flight zone over Syria, OH NO SHE WILL SHOOT DOWN RUSSIAN PLANES AND START WORLD WAR III.

        This sucks because it creates an enormous amount of noise that make it really, really hard to find actual signals, and in particular it makes it way harder to spot *actual* superlatively bad statements, like Trump saying he might shoot down Iraqi boats for taunting American warships (which sounds even worse in context).

        I was definitely a big anti-fan of Bush, but I was a young man at the time. I liked McCain much better than Bush but didn't like his pick of VP and figured he was old enough it might matter. I actually liked Romney quite a bit, though I still gave him no small amount of shit for turning around on Obamacare's concepts. I thought he was better than McCain or Bush, since he was far more centrist, and certainly he was the smartest of the three. The reason I gave for voting for Obama in 2012 was twofold; one, Romney, although a reasonable guy, would still be beholden to the Republican party with which I disagree on many issues. The other reason is outlined [here](http://ordinary-gentlemen.com/2012/11/02/four-more-years-with-head-held-high/). 

        So in my view I guess each new Republican nominee was better than the last, until Trump came along. I don't feel like I've been gradually saying each Republican is worst than the last, since it seems like the opposite is the case. I know there are whiners who always say "this is the worst Republican ever" but they're just not correct (except this time).

        About voting mattering, I agree with what you're saying. In terms of an individual vote affecting an outcome, voting doesn't matter. But, bear in mind what I said! I didn't say you should vote so you could change the election; I said to vote because it is your civic duty as an American. As a citizen, you're entrusted with the power to vote. You have an obligation as a citizen of this republic to exercise it. Not a legal requirement, but a civic duty. Not a self-interested reason, or a belief that a single vote would sway the outcome, but a duty. That's what it means to be a citizen in this republic, in my view. That's why I vote, that's why I encourage my friends and family to vote, and it's why I'm an election officer. I take great pride in this civic duty.
        ```

        - u/Fresh_C:
          ```
          If you don't believe you're qualified to pick the person who runs the country, is it still your civic duty?

          Personally I think anyone who is truly undecided should just stay home rather than cast a vote without being fully committed to the decision.

          I'm not saying a person has to perfectly sure that they're making the right choice in a candidate (or on any other issue). But I don't think we should pressure people into voting if they don't have an understanding of the issues, or if they don't really have much preference even after understanding the issues.

          If you don't care or you're not sure, you really shouldn't be voting.

            Thank you!  Everyone talks about this civic duty as if it's an inherent truth of democracy that everyone must vote.  I think the system would probably run a lot smoother if there were some sort of lottery that chose a small portion of people, and then those people would do all of the research and look carefully and then vote, and everyone else stayed out of it.  If you get chosen 1/100 of the time, but your vote carries 100 times as much weight (because only 1/100 of other people are voting) then on average you have the exact same amount of influence you do in the current system.  We could do this for any fraction, so long as the number of voters is sufficiently large to avoid significant statistical noise.

            This wouldn't actually work, but the reason isn't because it's a bad system, but because people would refuse to accept it.  Most people don't understand expected values and the idea of having a nonzero amount of actual value keeps people pacified even when things they don't like happen.  The percentage system doesn't "feel" good or fair to the people who go their whole lives without being selected, even though in the current system your vote won't swing the election anyway.

        [Scott Alexander had a good post](http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/10/01/he-kept-us-out-of-war/) about Trump as interventionist, which sums up a lot of my thoughts on the matter.

      - u/blazinghand:
        ```
        Assuming nothing too "out there" happens, I imagine Trump would be much less involved in our commitments and responsibilities overseas than Clinton would be, except for when he absolutely (rare, but it could happen) flips the heck out. If we leave aside his comments about surprise bombing civilian areas where we think ISIS leaders are (I don't think he'd actually do this) without letting people evacuate first, we can expect a significant drawdown in direct casualties from US shots fired overseas. So, leaving out the possible but unlikely "way worse than any possible policy" thing that Trump might do, I see how this could be less violent. And if that's all you measure, then this will be a great thing. I see why people might like this, and I respect that opinion.

        I'm an American exceptionalist and a believer in American hegemony. I think that international geopolitical stability, and the promotion of democratic interests and the possibility for liberal democracies everywhere, relies on the United States of America. We're the best democratic republic, and the biggest, and the richest, and so many other things. This is why I donate to the ACLU, rather than just say MIRI. The dangerous future of AI isn't just an unfriendly or poorly thought out AI running wild, it's an AI that does exactly what we want it to, and us wanting the wrong things. We are the bastion of stability and democracy in the world. My boy Barack Obama agrees:

        > But the world must remember that it was not simply international institutions -- not just treaties and declarations -- that brought stability to a post-World War II world.  Whatever mistakes we have made, the plain fact is this:  The United States of America has helped underwrite global security for more than six decades with the blood of our citizens and the strength of our arms.  The service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform has promoted peace and prosperity from Germany to Korea, and enabled democracy to take hold in places like the Balkans.  

        Yes, we kill people, both enemies and civilians, overseas. Yes, we have a huge, expensive military designed for interventions anywhere in the world--and we use it. A lot. We patrol the trade routes of our world's oceans, we back people on one side or another of various civil conflicts, and we invade countries, sometimes for the right reasons and with good outcomes, and sometimes with less good reasons and bad outcomes. We are a world power. In some ways, we are *the* world power. Blood will be shed for us to enforce justice in the world, and to bring order to chaos. 

        Jefferson once said, "What signify a few lives lost in a century or two? The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is it's natural manure." At the time, he was dismissing concerns about a rebellion that happened in the US, saying that we shouldn't worry if this happens from time to time. Though it is oft misused, the quotation itself isn't completely wrong in other contexts. I support military interventions and the US Navy patrolling the sealanes and promoting our interests around the world. I think, given what's happening in Europe and how tenuous republican democracy is in other places, we have an obligation to make sure the torch of democratic civilization keeps burning somewhere in the world.

        My full thoughts on this are a lot longer and more involved. So I guess I'm an American exceptionalist and an interventionist. But I do see why people think differently; most of my liberal friends disagree with me stridently on both these issues, and I don't think they're entirely wrong to do so. I think it's easy for people, especially young people, to discount just how valuable it is that our armed forces do what they do.

    I feel like spamming EY's "Stop Voting for Nincompoops" everywhere.  I voted early for the Green Party in a safe state.  I kinda want the neo-Nazi killed or jailed, because that's what you do when you *actually seriously believe* a major-party Presidential candidate is an actual Nazi.  This actually gives me empathy for his supporters, who sound crazy but also seem to be the only ones *taking seriously* the immense amount of evidence that their opponent is an influence-peddling criminal, that she conspired with the press corps to manipulate the primaries, and that the press has *volunteered themselves* to act as her propaganda ministry in the generals.

    I hate white supremacy as much as any good leftist, but the way the Dems are speaking "against" it only reinforces the framing of white Americans as an ethnonationality whose material interests conflict with those of other ethnic groups in this country.  So I can't speak the language of the mainstream and have to sound like a crazy commie in a park with a cardboard sign because I don't want to incite race war or feed fascism.

    The most popular Presidential candidate in the whole contest, my candidate - whose policy proposals are objectively moderate, tried-and-tested stuff meant to improve people's lives without risking radical change and whom people actually liked, trusted, and respected - was laughed out of the race five months ago as an unserious loon.

    In all seriousness, I feel like these are the situations that really do call for revolution.  "The system" has now proven that it laughs in the face of the common citizen's needs, treats the interests and rituals of a narrow elite as moral gospel, and has no sanitary cordon against lunatic nincompoops.  I actually wish it was just me being a crazy leftist at this point.

    I voted in the Presidential primaries and in the state and local primaries, for candidates who *won't* bring about Fully Automated Luxury Communism or make everyone Sapient Pony Happy, but who *would* and hopefully *can* incrementally improve people's lives in ways the people understand, can cope with, and actively want for themselves.  I've canvassed and phone-banked for the campaign I supported, and I'm doing more canvassing against a ballot measure I want defeated.  My efforts were crushed by opponents who now want me in line behind them, except maybe on the ballot measures.  The party who represent my beliefs about policy most closely are represented by batshit insane hippies.

    And the whole country or world could go down in flames because a narcissist realized he could appeal to identitarian fascist sentiments to catapult himself to the world's most influential single office.  He has sowed utter discord and crashed through the institutional rot of this society and he still manages to be worse than the toxic fungus he's against.  A perfect Ork Warboss.

    This election drives me to tears.  I'm scared, I'm tired, and most of all, I'm scared and tired of feeling like the crazy person in the room because I point out how crazy it all is.

    This isn't sane or fair or noble, and I just want it to not have happened.

      The problem for me is that Stein has too many dumb antiscience positions, like nuclear energy and GMOs, and Johnson is, well, a libertarian. I don't really want either of them to be president. I don't really want Clinton to be president either, what with the frequent greasy-but-not-quite-criminal (Unless it is now? Who knows?) behavior.

      There is no Fully Automated Luxury Gay Space Communist Party, and even the actual transhumanist party didn't pony up the grand it takes to get on the ballot here.

      But my state is contested, so the choice that optimizes for distance between Nazis and the white house is unfortunately Clinton. I really don't want some Brexit crossed with Nader shit going down, especially with a fucked supreme court.

        Oh, I agree.  Stein is nuts.  I don't like her.  I especially don't like Baraka: he's an Assad apologist.

        I voted for them mainly because, if a third-party gets over 5% on a Presidential ballot, they can run candidates for dog-catcher or State Assembly without going through a complicated bureaucratic maze -- they're just *on the ballot* by declaring a candidate by a deadline.  I deliberately wasted my Presidential vote in order to potentially buy opportunities to vote for better candidates down-ballot in future races, which we especially need in my state because we're the worst in the country for having contested (more than one candidate) state and local elections.

        And actually, since Johnson's higher in the polls than Stein, I perhaps should have voted for him.  It depends how much I care about getting a third-party their dog-catcher candidacies *in principle* and how much I care about doing so for a *left-wing* party in specific.

        >But my state is contested, so the choice that optimizes for distance between Nazis and the white house is unfortunately Clinton.

        Yep.  Entirely true.  Even my socialist organization said it really does come down to this.  If you're in a contested state, go full Popular Front (or at least, Anti-Nincompoop Front), hold your nose, and support Clinton.

        >Why the hell did nobody seem to notice he was a nazi when he launched his campaign promising racial cleansing?

        I mean... I KNOW RIGHT?  But there seems to be a major set of deontological and virtue-theoretic assumptions built into the American political establishment: that if you follow the procedures and work within the system, you have a level of Rawlsian legitimacy, Godwin's Law applies as normal, and the actual content of your political stances basically doesn't matter at all.

        So I hope that if Donald Trump teaches the establishment one fucking thing, it is this: policies matter, outcomes matter, and the value of a procedure is just the information it integrates as input and the expected utility it generates as output.

        Because HE LAUNCHED HIS CAMPAIGN PROMISING MASS DEPORTATIONS.  Not closed borders as a component of a sane, humane immigration policy, MASS DEPORTATIONS.  And he comes as a culmination of a DECADES-LONG TREND in which his party have come to consider themselves the ONLY LEGITIMATE GOVERNING PARTY, and as he continued his campaign he asked WHY WE CAN'T JUST NUKE PEOPLE, and in the closing days of his campaign he has promised to ELIMINATE CLEAN ENERGY RESEARCH OF ALL KINDS.

        This has been batshit insane from the start, and I'm really tired of being the only guy in the room who believes his own eyes.

        1.  Because that's overblown, ignorant rhetoric that devalues the utility of "Nazi" as a negative signifier and draws *actual* Nazism closer to the mainstream by associating it with a vastly wider but much less objectionable group.

        2.  Because the people whose job it was to notice were actively helping him, both for their own ratings, and because he seemed like the ideal opponent for their preferred candidate.

      I'm a total outsider to US elections, and the little I've seen of it has been very contradictory (the whole "there are two hundred sides to every story" thing), so I really can't tell either way.

      But when you say your candidate is the best one with the best policies that will help everyday people, isn't that something that basically everyone thinks of their favorite candidates? Some people vote for candidates they don't like, but people who vote for candidates they like all think they're the most reasonable one, with the most sensible policies. For every Sanders/Clinton/etc partisan out there, there's a guy who thinks Trump is the best candidate and as a president he'll, I don't know, do great things for the common people somehow.

      Also, I'm mostly quoting a guy who I'm relentlessly stalking for insightful political comments here, but aren't candidates who make it past the primary much more likely to get targeted by smear campaigns and to have dirt dug up on them? There might have been similar shocking revelations about your favorite candidate had he passed the primaries.

        I'd call that a good test of whether you have a decently democratic system with a reasonably wide variety of candidates or parties.  Unfortunately, [right now it's not actually true.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/02/for-many-voters-its-not-which-presidential-candidate-theyre-for-but-which-theyre-against/)  Most voters right now are holding their noses.

        The test would apply more easily in the primaries, where we have a wider variety of candidates, but even there, it didn't *really* happen.  Most voters in the primaries were consciously and openly voting for a compromise between desired policies and ability to succeed in the "general" (ie: runoff) election.

        Now, I personally *disagree* with my "side's" voters' estimation of who was a more viable candidate in the general election (ie: two-candidate runoff).  Your test definitely applies within the primaries to the weighted mix of beliefs that mattered in the primaries.

        Which brings up that my objection to this electoral process is systemic: despite the fact that only the primaries were even a compromised version of a real election (by the test of whether your standard applies), only 9% of Americans actually supported the primary winners.  So the "popular mandate" of our two "general election" (again: runoff) candidates is about 4.5% each.  *That was how this all happened*: first you get 4.5% of the population to support you, and then you get 51% to hold their nose because you're better than that other jerk.

        >aren't candidates who make it past the primary much more likely to get targeted by smear campaigns and to have dirt dug up on them? There might have been similar shocking revelations about your favorite candidate had he passed the primaries.

        Yes!  Of course!  That's *why* it's important to run on more than personality.  Every candidate is going to have smears thrown at them and dirt dug-up on them, and that's why they *need* to be able to point to a clear policy platform (or party manifesto, as other countries would call it), a strong back-bench within their party infrastructure, and hopefully a popular movement behind them.

        The first and third items are things that Clinton doesn't seem to *want*, and the second is something she can't seem to *achieve* (the Democratic Party has suffered a collapse of its state-and-local back-bench since about 2006).  For all that she portrays herself as an expert political insider, *she actually stands a significant chance of losing to motherfucking Donald Trump*.  For all that she portrayed herself in the primaries as better able to build a party, she's *been* doing that for all these years, and her party's back-bench of lower-level office-holders has *collapsed*.

        Maybe she and they can fix that this Tuesday and take a Senate majority and a larger House minority.  Maybe they'll be stuck with the Presidency against an adversarial Congress.  Or maybe they'll lose everything.

          Even-numbered years are national elections. The lower house (House of Representatives, apportioned to the states based on population and coming from a specific electoral district) serve 2-year terms, and the upper house (Senate, each state gets 2, elected by the state at large) serve 6-year terms, no limits on either. So in Presidential election years (years evenly divisible by 4), Americans cast their vote for President, the Representative for their district, and between zero and one Senators depending on how the terms line up (I don't believe any states have synchronized Senate terms). Generally, however, only a few of the Congress seats are actually competitive in a given year.

          If I had to guess, Republicans are trying to make the best of a situation where Hillary gets elected by refusing to allow her to enact any of her agenda, thereby protecting themselves from primary challengers (members of the same party competing to be the party nominee for the seat) who might otherwise challenge their commitment to conservative principles, and don't expect to get punished for their obstructionism the next time the general election comes up because, as I mentioned, so few seats are actually competitive. This is basically a more extreme version of what they already did with Obama following the 2010 midterm elections.

            Many Republican politicians are kinda trapped between a rock and a hard place when it comes to winning both primaries and general elections. Over the course of the past decade, basically, there has been a movement amongst some of the Republican electorate to be more aggressive about certain populist issues. This caused big changes, especially in the 2010 congressional election. Several of the blue dogs (conservative Democrats) were ousted in general elections, and many moderate Republicans were ousted in primary elections, and replaced with radical Tea Party Republicans. 

            Many canny and capable moderate Republicans held on to their seats, by swinging just far enough to the right to undercut their Tea Party challengers, then coming back to the center for the general election enough to beat the moderate Democrat who runs against them (but not so much as to piss off their base). This is *not easy*. It also really constrains their ability to act like normal people while in office. 

            Take, for example, my boy McCain. McCain *hates* Trump. He really truly loathes Trump. And for good reason! McCain is a sane person and a career politician and has every reason to hate Trump. Trump also personally insulted McCain for being a PoW... etc etc. Well, in any case, you may remember that McCain endorsed Trump. Seems strange, right? McCain really does hate that guy! So why did he do it? He did this because he was facing a primary challenge from a populist rightist who was a total nutjob. After winning the primary, he waited for an opportune time to unendorse Trump. He has since went back to the middle and now has to win the general election. He probably will.

            In any case, not saying we shouldn't blame Republicans for intransigence if they actually follow through with it, but bear in mind that they all are trying to get re-elected, and not all of them have the political skills and war chest of McCain.

      The most meaningful recent event, for my money, is the FBI publicly announcing less than two weeks before the election that it has re-opened the investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as Secretary of State. They say that evidence found in a previously unrelated case may be relevant, and they need to investigate further to determine whether anything has changed or not.

      Clinton naturally considers this a disgraceful attempt by the FBI to influence the election, and maintains that there is nothing to find. Those opposed to Clinton (disclaimer: including myself) point to the still ongoing, daily leaks of emails between her highest staff which, arguably, indicate her participation in outright bribery, on top of additional national security concerns. Clinton counters that these leaks are from a cyberattack orchestrated by Russian hackers, not to be trusted, and claims that Russia is *also* disgracefully attempting to influence the election.

      Trump, meanwhile, is continuing his ongoing vendetta against his own foot. Candid audio was released in which he advocated that when you're rich, you can get away with sexual assault (Money line: "You can grab them by the pussy!"), which he dismisses as "locker room talk". Shortly thereafter, a number of women have emerged accusing him of raping them. I think that the worst "Trump says stupid, dangerous thing" is still older lines like him asking, "What's the point of having [nuclear weapons] if you can't use them?" or him refusing to commit to defending NATO ally nations unless they've paid their bills.

        What is the correct ("rational") way to deal with an information source that does not lie but only tells one side of the story?

        Like, even if they really were evil Russian hackers or whatever, you can't just refuse to do Bayesian updates because they are not lying (does Clinton deny that the mails are authentic?). But on the other hand we should expect the other side to have awful stuff in their emails as well (maybe more stuff like "You can grab them by the pussy!") and we don't hear about them because they were not hacked.

          Ow, that's a tough one.

          Ideally, you want to weigh their opinion against partisans of the "other side" of the story - preferably from people who are roughly as eloquent as your first source, otherwise you're introducing a bias. Most of the time, you'll end up more confused and mostly neutral, which is good because you should *not* change your opinion after listening to a one-sided source anyway (or only change it slightly).

          As Yudkowsky pointed out, this method has a failure mode, especially when applied to politics: you might hear good-sounding arguments for the two sides, and never shift your opinion, even though one side's arguments are much more important/accurate/better than the other. Eg "this candidate will keep the corrupt systems that impoverishes you" vs "that candidate might start a nuclear war".

          I don't know any solution to this problem besides "be better informed". Like Professor Quirell said, only harsh experience teaches you that "Kill your problems immediately with a lot of death" is more important than "Avoid making powerful enemies when you don't have to". Otherwise they both sound very convincing.

          You have to take the all of the information at once, and update based on what you would have expected based on certain situations.

          Let's say you figure there's a half chance that there is a car behind door number 1, and a half chance that it is something nearly worthless. 

          Here are the rules:

          1) Door number 1 has one person in front of it. This person, the salesman, tries to get you to pick door number 1 no matter what (by convincing you its a car). 

          2) They can not lie.

          3) They only get one statement to convince you.

          The salesman might tell you "Behind door number 1 is an object whose outer body is made mostly of metal."

          If this person wasn't a salesman, and was instead just someone spewing out random facts about what was behind the door, that should move your posterior above a half. Why? *Because you would expect someone spewing out random facts to say something that doesn't apply to a car if it wasn't a car."*

          But since it is a salesman, you should adjust *downward,* not upward. Why? *Because you would expect a salesman to say something like "It's a car behind door number 1," if it really was a car.* The fact that they didn't is evidence *against* it being a car.

        The "daily" part is because Wikileaks is intentionally screwing around to generate the maximum media attention.  I stopped paying attention to the email leaks after the first set of them only succeeded in revealing that Hillary is in fact running a competitive campaign and working with the DNC and media.  Isn't that what a good campaign would be trying to do?  (As opposed to Trumps failure to work with the RNC and his continuous fights with the media).  Anyway is there anything actually substantial you can point in all these leaks /r/the_donald seems to upvote every little thing they can take out of context as damning evidence,

        I think Trump has buckled down on some of these points when pressed about them again.  In light of the whole "Russia influencing the election" narrative, several of the stupid things he has said about foreign policy seem kind of damning.

        Anyway, Politics is the mind killer, so maybe Trump being so stupid and awful has made me look at Clinton overly positive, but I haven't seen anything really substantial in terms of the Hillary is totally corrupt narrative.  I voted by mail already anyway so whatever.

Feminists as a group don't act like their leaders are supposed to be morale paragons.  Fundamentalist Christians have nominally pushed the idea that their leaders should embody family values, only to back off if it whenever they get a politician they like (i.e. Reagan or Trump).

    >Under standard literary convention... the enemy wasn't supposed to look over what you'd done, sabotage the magic items you'd handed out, and then send out a troll rendered undetectable by some means the heroes couldn't figure out even after the fact, so that you might as well have not defended yourself at all. In a book, the point-of-view usually stayed on the main characters. Having the enemy just bypass all the protagonists' work, as a result of planning and actions taken out of literary sight, would be a diabolus ex machina, and dramatically unsatisfying.

  Just built my first computer. Was really worried when I tried to turn it on and I didn't get a video signal, but after an hour of troubleshooting I discovered the problem was I hadn't been nearly forceful enough when installing the ram. Really gotta jam that stuff in there. Anyway, first post on my new desktop!

    Nice. Yeah, I always feel like I'm going to crack the motherboard in half with the force it takes.

    Both socketing ram and the CPU can be quite nervewracking

    Had that exact problem when building my first. Freaked out, took it to a shop. Felt very silly.

  While these guys traditionally just talk about game design, I think this week's video from Extra Credits on the way characters psychologically confront the supernatural in horror stories is universally applicable and relevant to rational fiction within the horror genre.

    As someone writing a rational horror, this was very interesting. I'm actually subscribed to them and I hadn't seen this video, so thanks for sharing it! Some of the stuff they mentioned was a bit basic for horror writers, but the difference between thinking you're going mad and the universe itself being a mad place was something I hadn't considered. It's kinda obvious in retrospect, but now that I'm aware of it, I think I can exploit better in my work.

      I think they're advice is more applicable to lovecraftian horror, where one of my favorite ideas it explores is that rationality is a fantasy. Not only is the world completely unlike what we reason it to be, but it actively defies reason in our attempt to understand and control it.

        My interpretation of Lovecraft was that humanity in particular was limited to functioning within a small subset of rationality/science, and that we simply weren't psychologically equipped to peer past the surface of our small pond.  As opposed to something like the Tales of MU setting, where the universe intelligently, malevolently, and universally interferes with the experimental method.

  I'm looking for some beta readers to give me critique and advice on a paper I'm writing. Looking specifically for things I can include or miss. In the paper I'm proposing a system for objectively quantifying aspects of games. The paper is not ready for public consumption, so I'm hoping for volunteers I can rely on.

  Note, I'm not trying to answer is "Is this objectively good?" but I am trying answer questions such as "Is this game playable the way it was designed to be played?" among other things, such as, "objectively, what is the average FPS of game X given Y specifications?"

    I'd be happy to give it a look.

  So an MLP fanfic called [Quantum Castaways](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/27429/Quantum-Castaways) just updated. I'm posting it here, because the latest chapter is blowing my mind. Evidently, the "Quantum" part of "Quantum Castaways" has do with with [Spoilers](#s "the propagation of magic through matter") and the latest chapter has a shitload of diagrams about parabolic dishes and other assorted magibabble. This is perhaps the most ridiculously in-depth theorycrafting about MLP magic I've ever seen, and I'm seriously impressed.

  It seems, by the way, that even Google isn't perfect in searching Reddit. In order to find the first link of the previous paragraph, I had to sift through [the list of Off-Topic threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/fridayofftopic) *manually,* because a search for `toakraka friendship spiel site:www.reddit.com/r/rational` turned up *literally nothing.* (Needless to say, Reddit's built-in search function didn't work, either.) Likewise, I had to check [a zillion General Rationality threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/mondaygeneralrationality) in order to dig up [this favorite comment of mine](https://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/48akta/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/d0ii4d6/?context=1), because a search for `toakraka animator slave site:www.reddit.com/r/rational` didn't find it. Sigh... Well, I'm glad that [I came up with the idea to create and maintain those lists in the first place](http://i.imgur.com/LOThjpU.png).
