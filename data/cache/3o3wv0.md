## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  So... is there anyone else here with depression? It would be nice to discuss experiences and coping strategies with folks that like to think things through.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Not currently, but depression and I have a long history that goes way back. For me, it was mostly a two-pronged strategy.

    The first prong was not getting depressed in the first place; the strategies for that were exercise, eating right, avoiding stressful situations to the extent that was feasible, keeping my immediate surroundings clean, and doing my best to cut off any downward spirals. You probably have your own triggers for depression, or conditions which make you more likely to become depressed, so watch for those and try to avoid them.

    The second prong was coping with depression once it arrived. That's the more difficult of the two, because you have such a limited amount of finite willpower with which to get *anything* done. For me, doing small things that I actually have the willpower to accomplish helps. Like, maybe that pit of apathy is going to prevent me from going out with friends. Maybe I just don't have the brain chemicals necessary to get my laundry done either. But there's got to be *something* small that I can do in-between episodes of my fourteen hour TV-watching marathon. This is basically "strategic use of willpower". If you can use whatever scraps you find more effectively, you can start digging out of a hole that you're in, or at least accomplish enough that you can get to the next day without your life falling apart in the meantime. (This largely depends on how bad your depression is and what's causing it; I was in a mental hospital for a while and I know there were people there who would probably could never get out of their depression spiral no matter what coping strategies they employed.)

    Oh, and it probably goes without saying that seeing a therapist/psychiatrist should be on the list of things to do.

      I really appreciate the help. I don't think my depression is as severe as yours was, but it's good advice regardless. I have been seeing a councilor for a while and it's been very helpful.

      Of course, I also have to deal with gender dysphoria. It's harder to find people who have experienced that. I think that there's one other active user on the sub who's trans (hi transfuturist).

    Just in case you haven't seen it already, Scott Alexander (aka Yvain) put together [Things That Sometimes Help If You're Depressed](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/16/things-that-sometimes-help-if-youre-depressed/) some time ago.
    ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    Sure. Shoot it. My coping strategy is to hide and be dysfunctional. I have been getting better after some lengthy CBT, but still not funtional.  I have a clinic stay sheduled shortly and hopefully that will be good?
    ```

    - u/Colonel_Fedora:
      ```
      I've been doing counseling for about two years now, and I think it's been very important for me. Positive social interaction is also extremely helpful for me.
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    A more accurate question is: is there anyone here *without* depression?

    My constant-chip-on-his-fucking-shoulder is actually my way of coping with my bipolarity-type issues.  You see, when I get manic, which is almost never, I can pour it into DRILL TO THE HEAVENS, WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM, and when I get depressed, which is reasonably often, I can pour it into NO MATTER WHAT'S IN MY WAY, I WON'T STOP, AND ONCE I'VE DUG THROUGH, IT MEANS THAT I'VE WON.

    Because yes, [I can see all the fucking problems](http://mindingourway.com/see-the-dark-world/), but I am NOT going to fucking break down instead of FUCKING DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

    My girlfriend is currently suffering a crying/panic/asthma attack over how her abusive job that makes her work way too fucking much and makes her feel inadequate and stressed-out all the time.  She seems to have gone to sleep now, though.  In the morning she will have to get up and go work in the lab.  And on Sunday.
    ```

  - u/Chronophilia:
    ```
    In my case, it's anxiety as much as depression. I'm actually doing much better right now than I was a month ago, thanks to therapy, loving and supportive parents, and 75mg of venlafaxine daily. Time will tell if my happy mood keeps up once the treatment's over.

    Eating a balanced diet, sleeping on time, and exercising at least 3 times a week is more important than it seems. Depression is a chemical problem as much as anything else.

    I tend to procrastinate wildly because I'm too stressed to work, and then stress out because I haven't done any work. The vicious circle is obvious. So focus on doing things as soon as you can, to avoid starting the downward spiral. As yourself "What is the benefit of doing this work later instead of now?" Usually there is no benefit, so get started. You'll slip up sometimes, and when that happens you shouldn't be afraid to get a helping hand with things you don't have the willpower to do alone.

    "Thinking things through" can be a bad thing. Perfectionism and overthinking are a major source of anxiety. Your work doesn't have to be perfect on the first draft. Don't be afraid to say yes, don't be afraid to screw up, don't be afraid to apologise. Depression makes you pessimistic; understand that bias and counterbalance it by being deliberately naÃ¯ve and optimistic.

    Friends like to help. Do not think you are doing them a favour by keeping quiet about your condition or avoiding contact. They will worry about you anyway, and they might imagine something terrible has happened to you. **Talk to people.** If you do nothing else in this comment, talk to an old friend or family member (even if it's someone you haven't spoken to in years), tell them about your difficulties, and then take their advice. Do not be afraid of looking silly. That is a small price to pay in any circumstance.

    Socially, in casual conversation people will ignore or forget 90% of what you say anyway. You can say the first coherent thing that comes into your head and it'll help move the conversation along. Don't think you're a boring person, because you're not.

    Any particular questions?

  How active are you guys on social networks? I have zero presence online but.. I don't know why this is. Sure, if someone asked me why I'd say I don't need to post selfies every 5 seconds and pretend to have a really busy social life. I don't but I think the real reason I don't have facebook or twitter is I'm afraid of rejection online just like I've faced in the real world (introverts unite). But that isn't a reason either.  

  I'm remarkably like [Jamie](http://www.leftoversoup.com/archive.php?num=722) from Leftover Soup in this regard. I'm not shy, but I'm still uncomfortable with photos of me online. Why? I have no idea. But like the comic says this is atypical of my demographic and I'm afraid I'm missing out socially.  

  I guess what I'm asking is if there's another outlier like me, if yes, why? If no, why?

    Facebook is the modern replacement for email addresses and chat clients for most people. I am unusual in my friend group-- I use forums, email, and IRC extensively. 

    When I need to communicate with most people, the best way to do so is Facebook. Organizing a party? Use facebook. Want to meet someone for dinner, so you want to send them a non-urgent low-latency low-barrier message they can respond to via computer or phone? use Facebook. Want to get someone's contact info in an arms-length sort of way and be easy to reach? Use facebook. Want to contact your college friend from years ago, even though everyone's changed emails? Facebook.

      Why is that, exactly? Facebook is a horrible company and an even worse user experience -- for one basic example, they are the only major internet property I can think of that doesn't support threaded comments. Why are they so damn popular?!
      </rant>

      Yes, I know. They used the velvet rope + Ivy name to capture the 20-somethings, all of whom were thought-leaders for family and friends. The question remains as to why the name+rope was enough to get past that crappy UX.

  - u/ToaKraka:

    I have a Facebook account, but I have only nine "friends" on it--five family members (who can see almost nothing that I post--tee-hee!), and four people ([1, 2, 3, and 6](http://i.imgur.com/IHeWJc1.png)) whom I once called *actual* friends under [this system](http://i.imgur.com/VCZSnwZ.png). I had about two hundred "friends" on the site at one point, several years ago--but I didn't like them, they never posted anything interesting, and they never gave likes or comments to any of my own posts, so I gradually deleted them all. I typically make at least one post (usually text or a shared link, sometimes a screenshot, rarely a photograph; [samples](http://imgur.com/a/2SjAr)) per day, in vain hope, but I'm nearly always the only person who gives a like or a comment to it. Other than that, my main use of the account is following the pages of The Onion and its Clickhole spin-off, since a good portion of the enjoyment that I derive from them lies in reading the funny comments left by people on the articles, in addition to the articles themselves. (Also, I follow Mr. Yudkowsky's account.)

    I don't see the point of Twitter at all, and don't have an account there. I do have [a Goodreads account](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/13619843?shelf=read), though, with four hundred books and two "friends".

    I don't believe in using it heavily (every day) like Reddit, but it's a useful tool. I have a close few friends I no longer live near and use it for staying in touch with them (although now that I'm giving it some thought, I think using email would probably be equivalent), and then locally there are a few groups that I follow so I can find people with similar interests / attend events. There's also a Rational Transhumanism group that I follow as basically the equivalent of this subreddit, although I'm less active there.

    Oh, and it reminds me of people's birthdays. So nothing too crazy but like I said, it's a tool.

    As a comparison point, my social prescence is limited to this subreddit and I spend most of my time online at sites for reading such as fanfiction.net, fictionpress.net, fimfiction.net, webserial sites like Worm, Set in Stone, and more.

    Holy cow, there are a lot of brilliant writers online guys!

    However, I have social accounts on FaceBook, Twitter, and a few others, but they're all for scholarship contests when I was applying to college which required me to have an account and I don't use them at all.

    The one exception that I use regularly is LinkedIn, because it's a nice place to put my resume for my employeers.

  OK, I feel like I should do some proselytizing for my other hobby.

  Chess has an image as an intellectual game, but the most *rational* game of note is **Bridge.**  So if you are looking for an interesting game and willing to devote the necessary time, look no further.

  1) It deals with incomplete information. Nobody can see all of the cards, but each player can see 1/4 (or 1/2, after the auction). So you have communication, but on a channel where the enemy is listening. (By the laws of bridge, your communication cannot be encrypted).  

  1a) There is luck. Good play is usually, but not always rewarded. This makes for a much more interesting game, IMO. I have played in (short) matches against Nat'l and world champions and while I usually lose, I don't always. (I'd be unlikely to win a full day match, obviously). And as someone who has read lots of bridge and chess, bridge has much more interesting stories. 

  2) Of all of the traditional games I know, it's the only one where Bayes' law comes up routinely. See the [wikipedia article on Restricted Choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_restricted_choice). In fact, the card play is highly rational, but also has the cut and thrust because the defenders use their cards to signal, but must decide (independently) when to signal correctly, randomly, or lie, and each side must consider the potential layout of the cards he needs, and if they are consistent with the bidding.

  As a downside, it does take considerable experience to become comfortable, much less competent, with the game.

    My life is enough of a miserable slog that the idea of it continuing forever is horrifying. I'm fairly sure I'll never be wealthy enough to retire so when I imagine an eternity of stressful, dead-end jobs and unsatisfying relationships... that really might as well be Hell.

    I welcome the embrace of death, but haven't yet been able to overcome my biological will to live. If I could arrange to never have been born, I'd do so immediately.

    I rate the odds that the future contains a post-scarcity utopia at so close to zero that it's statistically indistinguishable. Even if they're frozen safely and effectively, I think the preserved are significantly more likely to be thawed in an extensive blackout or harvested for organic chemicals than to be rebuilt or uploaded. Lasting, unbreakable contracts with the dead are a luxury relatively few civilizations will be willing to endure.

    I've looked into it, but I'm not signed up. I just don't think that I can justify the expense given the odds of success (Alcor gives the [Warren equation](http://www.alcor.org/Library/html/WillCryonicsWork.html), which I get much different, much more pessimistic numbers for).

      >The problem is simple prejudice. There is nothing particularly epistemologically heinous about cryonics. Most scientists recognize that there are many non-testable aspects of human belief (religious and otherwise) which, precisely because they are untestable, are outside the purview of science. These ideas include much of what constitutes religion, philosophy, ethics, history, and art, as well as much of what goes into ordinary planning for the future. A person who had never entertained an idea that was not immediately testable (i.e., scientific) would be in a sad way indeed.

    I am appalled by the willingness, and even fervor with which humanity embraces death.  Signing up for cryonics was far easier than I thought it would be, and costs me something like $250 per year. Even if the odds are one in a thousand it works, that is still an insanely good deal. (And I certainly do not think the odds are that long.)

      How do you arrive at the 1/1000 number? I see a lot of numbers floated around and most of them seem *really, really* optimistic. I'm as much about avoiding death as the next rationalist, but especially with cryonics I see a lot of what appears to be wishful thinking. I've seen Robin Hanson's [estimate of >5%](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/03/break-cryonics-down.html) but he seems to be putting a lot of faith in not only the advancement of technology, but the continuity of organizations, the continuity of society, and the motivations/beliefs of future people.

    I give the same epistemic rating as /u/alexanderwales, and suffer the same emotional setbacks as /u/Sparkwitch (though with considerably less rational justification for feeling that bad).

    On life insurance, I bite the bullet and admit to sucking for not getting it.  Or I might actually have it through work, with my fiancee properly designated as the beneficiary.

    Also, I consider *death* to be a smaller problem than both general unnecessary human miseries, and also *ageing*, including the fully general fact that people's bodies start degrading more-or-less as soon as they leave school.

  Is there an actually effective way to improve attention span and/or working memory?

   I can pay attention to tasks for a very short period of time and I never reach 'full' concentration like some people do; at the same time I'm a bad multitasker because it's hard to me to pay attention to every thing I have to think about/hold in my working memory. Also, I've noticed that I often intuitively figure out a a problem/make an observation, but I can't concentrate on the observation enough to further analyze it.

  The only thing that has somewhat helped me were SSREs I'm alleviating my depression/aboulia with, but it's still serious enough to interfere with my functioning, and no generic exercises have helped me at all.
  ```

  - u/LucidityWaver:
    ```
    Although I don't have any suggestions, I do have the same, or similar, troubles and it's mostly ADHD related for me. However, I'm unsure whether the difficulties with analysis of intuitive observations are related to ADHD, though I do experience the same. Beyond not knowing every symptom of ADHD offhand, it's difficult for me to know whether that one is not instead a symptom of something else, or simply the way I would function anyway. Aside from ADHD, for which I have been diagnosed and medicated properly, it's likely that I suffer from mild Aspergers and mild depression -- neither of which I've sought diagnosis for. The former due to my twin being diagnosed and a small number of specific symptoms I've noticed in myself. Depression isn't something I can say with certainty I've experienced and it's probably not worth going into here.

    Other than the similarities of your troubles and mine, specifically with concentration, I also experience hyperfocus, where I concentrate fully on one thing and don't absorb external stimuli well. This usually only occurs when I'm very interested in the task (reading, gaming, sometimes programming). Distractions from hyperfocus make it difficult, often frustrating, to return to the task.

    - u/Magnap:
      ```
      What, other than medication, have you found to help with your ADHD? I suspect that I might have it, but haven't been tested (yet, procrastinating on making a doctor's appointment). Currently I'm using org-mode as a mental prosthetic to get a better overview of my life, and have found it extremely useful. However, other issues like being  unable to concentrate on school work, or getting caught up in something (in a manner fitting the description of hyperfocus) and forgetting to go to sleep remain problems for me.

        Stress, hardship and a lack of options basically.
        I don't have any particular strategies that I use or any deep analysis that might help. My main advantage was having someone else devote their time to help me and getting used to / feeling trapped in a 9-5 job. I'm in a situation where I'm aware of my past failures and find the prospect of repeating them so unbearable that most of the time I don't have any choice but to keep on track. I probably should identify better strategies to use for various aspects of life, but I'm doing well enough (top of my class and the candidate for employers seeking students for employment) that it's not a priority for the moment.

        My main driving factors:
        About 6 or 7 years ago I left the same level of programming course I'm doing now for reasons including: the relevant undiagnosed ADHD reasons, security of a privileged childhood, my prior lack of having to study to pass subjects and all my other bad habits and flaws.
        Worked four years in a job I didn't mind for my father who I (much of the time) hated.
        I now have the amazing support of my partner, who helped me recognize my ADHD symptoms as such, get medication and then supervised me to keep me attentive while I studied my ass off three nights or more a week for four months to re-learn everything I'd known about programming and more. I don't need supervision anymore.
        I moved with my partner away from my family, my remaining (non-problematic) friends and everything else to get myself and my partner out of bad living situations, to enter my course, to afford life in a cheaper city, etc. I kept the newfound, near complete absence of a social life to avoid distraction, but wow I miss weekly tabletop gaming.
        The move cost me all of my savings (gradually), most of my partner's savings and finding a job hasn't worked with the course load (which is above what is typical for this level course). Both of us are on minimum welfare support, less payment of debt left in my partner's name by family.
        The only good options if I fail include moving in with family, the most appropriate of which lives far outside an isolated rural town.
        My partner, for various reasons, is actually closer to miserable now than before. Getting through my course and getting a secure job feels like the only / best thing I can do to help, and all that does is free up time and money so I can use them to learn how to better support them.

        So, yeah. Not an ideal way to manage symptoms.

          Thank you very much for telling this story. Please don't take this the wrong way, but it very much motivated me to get a doctor's appointment. I wish you the very best in completing the course and getting a job. What programming language(s) are you learning?

            I'm also looking to familiarise myself with qt based on a recent recommendation and I spent some time learning unity syntax and programming (ft. C#).

  Came back home to Europe on Wednesday after spending two weeks in the US. Had a wonderful time. Started getting sick on the last day and got progressively worse during the trip home. Am currently dealing with fever, snot and phlegm. Still, rather miserable at home than during the brief vacation.

  Also, anyone thinking of visiting New York, the Metropolitan Museum of Art is amazing. Beats the Natural History Museum hands down. Really, really big though. I could have easily spent a whole day there, seeing and reading about everything from dark age weapons and armour to exotic music instruments to Byzantine art to reconstructions of 18th century American mansions.

  Also, the statue of liberty is like half the size I was expecting it to be even after being told everyone is always surprised at how small it is.

    Second the Metropolitan Museum of Art* recommendation.  A truly world-class museum.

    I know. I spent many hours just walking around and staring at the beautiful artworks. Even had fun sketching some copies of Rembrandt's works. ;)

    How can the glorious Natural History Museum be beaten by *anything!?*

      It's still good. It's got full size dinosaur skeletons and a large minerals and gem collection, but I found the astronomy/big bang wing to be very underwhelming. One four minute video with only the zooming stuff, followed by a short walk down a spiral with signs telling you what came into being when, and... that was it.

      To anyone who has the time, I certainly recommend both, but in a pinch I say go with the MMoA over the NHM.

      Now, that said, the NHM had this wonderful little vending machine where you popped in 51 cent and it took that one cent, crushed it into an oval shape, and pressed the image of a T-Rex into it.

  The actions we take are dictated by a number of factors. Most of us can agree that we are not rational all of the time. There are times when we act or feel in an irrational manner, despite the fact that we may *consciously* realize we are being irrational.

  Prime Example. Fear. Personally, I know that fear isn't very useful to me. Caution, sure. But the feeling of fear, of ice in your stomach and nervous butterflies, sweaty hands, etc. is mostly useless. I know this rationally. But that doesn't help me in scary situations. And I don't mean viscerally scary situations, like being confronted by an angry bear, or being trapped in a burning building. I mean situations like going into a job interview, or confronting a friend about something they do that I dislike. Logically, I know that there's nothing to be afraid of and, often enough, when I'm in said situation, I perform well. My fear fades, and I can deal with the situation. But the apprehension is a killer and no matter how much I try to rationalize it away, it doesn't leave.

  So. Here's my discussion point. What's the best way(s) to utilize our conscious, rational conclusions and understanding to directly influence our feelings?

  I've been thinking about the *Matrix* movie and I was wondering how could someone with the knowledge that they're living in a stimulation escape or gain outside knowledge **without** being Neo who can warp the surrounding code for super-powers?

  I mean, what kind of proof would be required to convince you of being in a stimulation, and what would be your first steps when you don't even know anything about how the stimulation works?

  P.S. How would you feel as a successful Friendly AI? ;)

    Exasperated.  I sincerely expect that no matter what I might try to do for humans, it will take an additional century or so of cultural change before they learn that the metaphysical abstractions they use to give so-called "grounding" to their so-called "value systems" *are not fucking real* and that almost any of the various things I can do for them are infinitely preferable.

    But oh well, in that circumstance, I can afford to wait forever.  Let them live their lives as they please, and let the people who *want* my help get it.  Some transhumanists with a dark sense of humor have tended to say things like, "Oh, the ones with the right idea will eventually outnumber the dumb ones, because they'll be alive while the dumb ones are dead", but no, I will not fucking *let people die* just for the sake of ideologies they don't even really believe in.

    God-Emperorship is for corpses on golden thrones.

  I'm curious if anyone has advice on how often posting a story I myself work on is appropriate. It seems like the pace of updates has slowed down to about one every week at the shortest and occasionally longer.

  But the amount of written word per update is rather low because I do a lot of illustration work on top.

  So what's the opinion?
