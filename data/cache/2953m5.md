  I submitted this because of the juxtaposition (and this is where much of the humour stems from, too) of normal human beings using military technology to try to contain objects and creatures of the sort found in horror, science fiction or fantasy. They use their resources intelligently and, being on a budget, provide each item as much as is required to contain it safely, no more. (Sometimes the only thing that can contain an SCP object is *another SCP object* - so that's what they use.)

  That sort of feel - slightly Charles Stross's Laundry but with much more variety - is what I think fits thematically with rational fic. I also find the dry writing style tremendously funny.

  I find it very entertaining. But more than that, it's a good resource. I'm an aspiring Fantasy writer, and the ways in which organizations and countries deal with supernatural threats is something I give a deal of thought. So I read about SCPs of different kinds and potentials and power levels, and think about they could be munchkin'd/contained/experimented upon, and every now and then I get a useful thought about my Fantasy world.

  Ooh, good idea, I hadn't considered that the SCP Foundation might be rational fiction. I also like how plausible all their decisions are (except for how they almost never seem to use more than one thing at a time to attempt to kill 682, but I can forgive that).

  Tried playing the SCP game, but even though I am getting closer to 30 than 20, I am still a wuss when it comes to horror games.
