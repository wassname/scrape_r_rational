    # The Frodo Box Experiment #

    “Frodo must wear the ring once more,” Gandalf said.

    The cacophony that resulted Frodo would not forget for a long time. Thick-bearded dwarves in
    chain mail jumped to their feet, wielding axes and shouting curses. The elves did not stand, but
    some of the Ring-sight lingered, and Frodo’s eyes did not miss their tensed hands, the tightened
    faces and voices that spoke with less than perfect rhythm and grace. Neither of the two Men
    objected. Boromir of Gondor only nodded his head, and Strider the Ranger stood and voiced his
    support of Gandalf.

    Frodo hand jerked toward the ring, and he could only stop it by grabbing his wrist and squeezing
    it so hard his knuckles turned white. He had already seen that there was no alternative. For the
    Wise had proven themselves anything but, and the decisions that had lost this war had
    happened before Frodo had even been born. And Frodo had heard the whisper of the Shadow
    when he had last worn the ring and knew it to be true, that only the ring could promise victory if
    there was any victory to be found.

    “To wear the ring invites the Shadow here!” Gloin the dwarf said. Fear was evident upon his
    face.

    “It is folly,” Elrond said with barely concealed fury, “To ask the Enemy how he may be defeated.”

    “The Enemy does not believe we will destroy the ring,” Gandalf said. “He suspects us all of
    wanting to keep it for our own gain. The Shadow’s power will not lead us a false trail but instead
    offer the most plausible excuses to the one who, it believes, is using the Ring’s power to claim it
    for himself.

    “Nor does the Shadow cast his eye here. For he is not yet strong enough to pierce the walls of
    the Elves and I together, and he believes we would take the ring to Gondor to use its power
    against his armies. The roads to Gondor are what he watches now. He is not entirely mistaken
    either.” Gandalf nodded at Boromir, who inclined his head stiffly in return.

    *Fool*, Frodo thought, and he began to speak, but then he stopped. For he realized that if the
    Ring could offer him insight into a problem as impossible as its own destruction, then it could
    solve any more minor ones along the way. Including the problem of how to get the ring *off*. And
    Frodo said nothing.

    But Bilbo spoke. “I, I remember what it was like to wear the ring. To wear it a second time even
    for Frodo would be a burden too great for a small hobbit to bear. He will not,” his voice caught,
    “He will not be able to take it off again.”

    “I will bind Frodo myself with a Word of Power,” Gandalf said. “Take no offense, dear Frodo, but
    you cannot wield the ring at half its full strength, and my binding will be secure.”

    At that Frodo could only laugh, a high, wheezing sound. Even Gandalf looked disturbed, but he
    went on. “And you, Bilbo, when we have the Shadow’s plan, you will take the Ring from Frodo’s
    finger, and I will take the Ring from you and return it to Frodo, or perhaps his servant Sam if
    Frodo needs to recover.”

    The dwarves looked suspicious, but they said nothing. The elves tersely nodded their assent.
    Boromir and Strider stood with Gandalf, and Frodo signaled his consent. And in Frodo’s mind he
    applauded the sheer genius of the Ring, for he could not possibly conceive how the Ring had
    pulled *this* off. Or perhaps even the Ring’s power was not that great, but the Wise were so
    foolish.

    Frodo released his wrist, and his hand shot up to where he kept the Ring, and just as he slipped
    it on, Gandalf spoke a word of Power, binding Frodo’s body still.

    But Frodo paid his body no heed. For his mind was changing, fluctuating, expanding and
    sharpening exponentially. Color did not fade away to be replaced by shadow and fear, but
    became clearer, *realer*, and part of a pattern. Faces he saw in two parts: the part that was
    presented, and, behind it yet just as visible, the state of mind that made it likely.

    *Exploitable.*

    The Ring did wonderful things for his vocabulary.

    “Frodo?” Gandalf was saying. “Frodo, can you hear me? Are you all right?”

    A dying part of Frodo wanted to weep, and a growing part of him wanted to laugh, but that
    wouldn’t do, wouldn’t do at all. He needed to get out of this meeting with the Ring still on his
    finger. He looked at the dwarves and elves, and in an instant he conceived of half a dozen
    strategies to inflame their mutual suspicions and jealousies. It would be easy to turn this Council
    into a bloodbath…and amusing.

    No. Sauron waited beyond the borders of Gondor, a more terrible enemy than any he faced
    here, but potential allies he had in the Council and the Wise. Even the Ring could not defeat
    Sauron alone. But with his strategies, the armies of Gondor could become invincible on the
    field…if he could get to Gondor with the Ring still on his finger.

    “Frodo?” Gandalf spoke again. “What do you see with the Ring-sight? How can we Wise be
    saved from our folly?”

    Frodo noticed the way the whole Council’s attention turned on him. Surprisingly, Boromir did not
    look eager for Frodo’s advice, though he had earlier called for the power of the Ring to be used
    against Sauron as it now was. Frodo was mildly surprised to learn that he could be surprised
    with the Ring on his finger, and he noted this fact, allowed it to seep through his mind and ripple
    through all the paths of action that came to his attention until the new realization was an
    already-calculated fact in every possibility.

    They were still looking. Oh, right. They wanted his council, or rather, the Ring’s. Well, it was an
    interesting question. How *could* Sauron be defeated at this point? Something about asking the
    question swept away the visions of various tunnels through this conversation to endpoints
    where Frodo still had the ring on his finger, and replaced it with tunnels from here to the light at
    the end when Sauron withered and died, and his castles in Mordor fell, his armies obliterated.
    And what filled those tunnels…?

    “Sauron’s armies are great,” Frodo said. He noticed how Boromir’s face changed, and subtle
    flickers in the eyes of the Elves,. Ah. They thought he was Sauron or Sauron’s servant and so
    spoke flatteringly of Sauron’s power. Mad fools. How had Sauron ever lost to foes such as these
    with the Ring on his finger?

    “Great in number, though not in kind,” Frodo said loudly. “Through dark magic Sauron turns the
    flies and rats and orcs into his spies and soldiers. Though Sauron’s devious strategy allows him
    to build a dozen armies each more numerous than all of Gondor’s, the core of his army is
    treacherous and foolish. For the fly and the rat are still black and dumb, and what the orc
    touches is forever corroded. From the center outward Sauron’s armies will disintegrate.”

    So quickly did their suspicion and fear turn to hope! Even Boromir looked eager for Frodo’s next
    words, and the Elves were suddenly calculating. Did they not remember wars with the orcs? Did
    they not recall that orcs were strong, fierce warriors, swift trackers, and true shots with their
    bow? If orc armies had an inherent propensity to fall apart from the center outward, then how
    had they ever driven Men out of their ancient kingdoms, fought a war with the Elves for
    centuries, contested with the Dwarves for their treasure? Somehow the Ring had found the
    words to wipe away the weight of their experience and history. The promise of success in an
    unanticipated manner…Frodo would remember its power.

    “Sauron is building his forces rapidly and preparing soon to march on Gondor, as our friend
    Boromir has said, because of this weakness. Sauron must conquer and conquer swiftly.” And
    with that, even the last of Boromir’s suspicion was wiped out, and all the Council was with him
    now that Sauron’s actions seemed to confirm Frodo’s analysis.

    “Then we will defend Gondor from Sauron’s assault,” Gandalf said. “Until Sauron’s armies break
    apart and shatter.”

    “The gates of Gondor will hold back Sauron’s armies for as long as need be,” Boromir said, and
    Aragorn nodded his head, holding tightly his sword.

    Frodo smiled—for the spell of binding had left him that—and he said, “I agree. No, I declare. It
    will be so. Gondor’s armies, one led by Boromir and another by Aragorn and a third by Gandalf,
    will repel and defeat the Enemy’s hordes. But recall that Sauron too knows of his weakness.
    Thus he masses his armies and prepares to sweep aside Gondor’s defenses like a great wave.
    Even Gondor’s power will not be enough. For they have the Ringwraiths and Sauron himself.”

    “What of them?” Gandalf said sharply. Was he wondering if Frodo could sense them somehow?

    “The Ring-sight is exceptional at noticing patterns,” Frodo said. “One such pattern I have
    noticed with the Ring on my finger is that its effects are not entirely lost once the Ring is
    removed.”

    Bilbo nodded jerkily. “Yes—I remember. A part of the sight lingers.”

    *Thank you, Bilbo*. Frodo continued. “The Ringwraiths have all been touched by the Ring’s
    power. Sauron himself has worn it for many years. Undoubtedly they see with a part of its sight
    even after all this time. If so, their strategies and tactical prowess will be beyond anything
    Gondor is prepared for, beyond anything the world has seen since the last wars with the
    Ring-forger.”

    “Men have learned a thing or two since those days,” Aragorn said mildly.

    “Elves have their own rings,” Elrond murmured.

    Frodo’s ears twitched at that, but he pretended not to notice. “Forgive me if I am too blunt, but
    the Enemy many years after losing the Ring was still able to maneuver this Council into sending
    the Ring into his lands with only a small guard. On the battlefield, his armies will move like
    lightning, strike from every direction, disappear like smoke and reappear behind you in an
    inferno of slaughter. If we underestimate him, we will perish.”
    ```

    - u/hwc:
      ```
      If we underestimate him, we will perish.”

      “Send the Ring, and we lose,” Gandalf said slowly. “But if we defend the gates of Gondor and
      wait for Sauron’s armies to disintegrate from their own poison, again you say our defeat is
      inevitable.”

      Frodo smiled. “Not quite, Gandalf. You have me.”

      “Ah,” Gandalf said. “I cannot say I am entirely surprised. The Ring has corrupted you, Frodo! It
      will not stand against its master, not so close, not when the Enemy reveals himself in full.”
      “Again, not quite. You have misunderstood. The Ring does not seek out Sauron because
      Sauron is its master. The Ring is fundamentally a fulfiller of ambitions. And until today Sauron
      has had the greatest ambition.

      “But now! look at this assembled Council. Gandalf, you seek victory over the most terrible foe
      Middle Earth has ever known. Elrond, you desire to preserve your prosperity and peace.
      Boromir and Strider, my friend, you wish to defend Gondor, to strike down Sauron’s armies and
      lay waste to the Enemy of Man. Gloin, and Gimli, and all the dwarves want for no less than the
      return of their ancestral lands and treasure. And,” Frodo smiled at Bilbo, “We hobbits have the
      greatest ambition of all: to go home again and tend to our gardens, eat plenty of cake, and have
      no more of this business with adventures!” At that even the Elves laughed, and Gandalf cracked
      a smile.

      Frodo waited for them to quiet down before he went on. “What this Council represents is not the
      unity of our military strength or intelligence. It is the unity of our ambitions. For what each and
      every one of us here today wants cannot be achieved first and foremost unless Sauron is
      defeated.” His eyes were hard, challenging them to disagree, and no one spoke.

      “What I say then is that if I face Sauron outside the gates of Gondor in front of the armies of
      Man against the hordes of Mordor, as long as I stand for and with this Council, its power will not
      be turned to him. Rather, he will have to contend with a strategic brilliance that he retains only a
      pale shadow of today.”

      But Boromir was still suspicious. Boromir, who should have been the first to leap at any chance
      to save Gondor, which was obviously in a hopelessly indefensible position. “How do you know
      Sauron and the Ringwraiths still retain some of the Ring-sight? Or what if you are lying and seek
      only to wear the Ring once more?”

      Before Frodo could think of a response, Bilbo spoke. “No. Frodo is right. Even after Gollum lost
      the Ring, he was still cleverer, more crafty, than any creature I have ever encountered.” Gandalf
      nodded his agreement, and Boromir was silent, looking assuaged if not entirely satisfied.

      *Thank you again, Bilbo*. Who would have thought that the old hobbit would be so quick on his
      feet? For that matter, was it just a coincidence that Bilbo’s words helped Frodo? Was it actually
      true that the Ring-sight remained? If so, perhaps Bilbo could see what Frodo was doing. Helping
      Frodo convince the Council that they needed someone to wear the Ring…

      …So that he could wear the Ring himself.

      *No! No! It’s mine! You can’t have it!* Frodo’s mind lashed out at Bilbo, filled with fire and fury and
      murder, plotting Bilbo’s death a dozen different ways: poison, stabbing, a great fall, on and on
      and on Bilbo’s death ran through Frodo’s mind.

      No. Stop. Don’t let it show. Get out with the Ring, and then kill the old hobbit.

      “There is not enough time,” Aragorn said, “To take you to Gondor, Frodo, and to set you to work
      training Gondor’s armies and devising strategies. You would arrive there only shortly before
      Mordor’s attack.”

      “That is why I should begin now,” Frodo said. “With you and Boromir and Gandalf, and such
      Elves and Dwarves as have military knowledge. Together we can predict Sauron’s movements,
      devise strategies, strengthen the defenses of Gondor, while we prepare to arrive there just in
      time to break the back of Sauron’s might.”

      But they weren’t biting. Something held them back. Was it too good to be true, perhaps? Did he
      push too strongly? If only someone else could speak on his behalf.

      I need—

      “This idea,” Elrond said, “Depends solely on the word of the one who wears the Ring and one
      who wore it.”

      Ah, Elrond. You failed to kill Isildur when he held the Ring in his hand, and because of that we
      are here today to deal with your folly. Is this why you created such a still, idyllic world? So that
      you wouldn’t have to make any decisions, to risk losing anything? “Elrond, wise lord, no path is
      perfect, no decision without the chance of failure. What I tell you is that Rivendell and Lothlorien,
      all your lands, are not lost nor need be. Why do you so hastily choose to discard them?
      Sauron’s power can be defeated by a power of his own making, as does the orc’s corrosion
      undo all his metalwork.” Hopefully that would be enough to reframe the decision in Elrond’s
      mind, force him to see denying Frodo’s plan as a deliberate choice to sacrifice something close,
      something he could feel and would regret long after the decision had proved wise or
      foolish.That, and Elrond had the spin for the decision he would inevitably make.

      “This is the only path the Ring-sight has shown me to defend Gondor,” said Frodo, and that won
      Boromir and Aragorn. “There are many here who are afraid of the Ring,” Frodo continued in a
      voice that suggested it was understandable but about to be shown as foolish, “But fear itself is a
      weapon of the Enemy. It stifles our thinking delays our action, and thus is Gondor on the verge
      of destruction while only just now do we assemble a Council. Let us banish fear along with folly.”
      And that won Gandalf.

      The dwarves were still a problem, and Frodo could see doubt on Gloin’s face. Then Gloin said,
      “If it means we can take back our kingdom and our treasure, I say the dwarves are in this too.
      Let us destroy the real enemy before we fight each other,” he laughed, and in the Ring-sight
      Frodo saw within Gloin’s bravado the knowledge that all others were decided and to state his
      own reservations would draw attention and put him on the spot. And this settled the minds of all
      else at the Council, for with the last of the leaders having made up their minds, it would have
      been *rude* for anyone else to object.

      With that, it was over.

      “Enough time has been lost. Sauron is preparing his attack even as we speak,” Frodo said. “Let
      us begin our preparations.”

      “No one, not even you, Frodo, who may be our salvation, can walk freely within Rivendell while
      they wear the Ring,” Elrond said.

      “The Ring grows stronger the longer I wear it,” Frodo said, “And weakens as I remove it, and it
      does not return to its full strength instantly. Everything is at stake here. We cannot afford to
      lessen our strategic potential. But I agree. Do not let me go anywhere without Gandalf on one
      side and Glorfindel on the other. Take me into the planning chamber, and I will go nowhere else.
      If it is necessary for everyone but me to leave it for some reason, lock me inside until someone
      can return.”

      There was a pause that stretched for a millennium in Frodo’s mind, and then Gandalf nodded.
      He spoke a Word of Power, and Frodo nearly fell over as his movement returned to him.
      “Oh, Frodo,” Bilbo said quietly, “What have we done?”

      “Don’t fear, Bilbo!” Frodo said cheerfully, embracing the old hobbit. “I promise you, with the
      Ring-sight we will be back in the Shire eating cake, or, if you prefer, in Rivendell writing merry
      songs.” I’ll kill you, you scheming old hobbit. You’ll never get the Ring, my precious ring.
      But with the Ring on his finger, Frodo could not miss the contradiction. Did Bilbo want peace or
      war? He could not enjoy life in Rivendell if he held the Ring, he knew that.

      The Ring changes people, Frodo realized. Makes them stop caring for things they cared for
      before. Makes them care only about the Ring. Bilbo. Gollum. Sauron, even.

      Me. That’s why I want to kill Bilbo. Even though before I wouldn’t have been able to think of
      killing anyone, let alone someone as dear to me as old Bilbo.

      But then Frodo was walking with Glorfindel and Gandalf and Elrond, Boromir was already
      outlining Gondor’s defenses and resources, and Frodo found that he no longer cared about
      Bilbo or the Shire or even the War. He had talked his way out of the binding with the Ring still on
      his finger, and that is what he would do forever more. Anything, anything at all to keep the Ring
      on his finger until…

      …Until I die?

      No.

      I will live forever. The Ring will stay on my finger forever.

      And with the one true goal firmly in mind, with the power to bind the world to his will nested
      tightly around his finger, Frodo nodded and spoke tersely, absorbing the information Boromir
      freely gave him, the Ring-sight tunneling through all the world’s barriers to the end where Frodo
      emerged and saw only that it was forever from now and the Ring was still on his finger.

        Thanks for the copy paste.

        Seems like gollum should never have lost this ring though his starve for fulfilling the ring's goals seems to have been the best one.

            ```
            Answer: the Ring *truly* has his own will. In fact, the Ring is a magical mind-upload of Sauron, in which he poured the best parts of his intellect and personality, leaving behind a brain badly damaged by the process which couldn't function properly without being reconnected to the object which held the major part of its abilities.

            Sauron did not lose the Ring. The Ring got bored and decided to go for a walk.

          - u/RMcD94:
            ```
            Clearly he must still have it and this is all part of his optimal plan to keep the ring in forever

  I don't have a copy, but I'll put a description of the plot as far as I remember behind a spoiler. I'd suggest that you hold off on reading this summary for a day or two in case someone does have a copy, because it's more entertaining to read the story in its entirety. 

  >!If I remember right, the setting was the Council of Elrond, with all the characters present that were there in the original. They are debating over whether to take the risk of having someone temporarily wear the Ring, which some of them think is the only way to find a strategy to defeat Sauron (or some goal along those general lines). They reach the decision that Frodo will be immobilized so that he can't do anything but think and speak (I think this was done via spell of paralysis), the ring will be placed on his finger, he will be questioned about how to defeat Sauron, and the ring will then be removed.!<

  >!This is of course an allegory for the "boxed AI" scenario, wherein an AI whose only abilities are to think and communicate with its "gatekeepers" tries to convince them to give it more freedom. It turns out that what the Ring does is give the wearer supernaturally good reasoning skills, tactical acumen, cunning, etc. At the same time, it turns the wearer into a "paperclip maximizer" whose only desire is to keep the Ring on their finger, forever, at any cost.!< 

  >!As soon as Frodo puts on the ring, the value shift kicks in. He recognizes that per the Council's prior agreement, the ring will be removed from his finger as soon as they're done questioning him, which he obviously can't allow. For the rest of the story, we watch him manipulate the others into "letting him out of the box" by convincing them that he retains his original values, that he will use the Ring to defeat Sauron, and that defeating Sauron is impossible unless he continues to wear the Ring. He presents a different argument to convince each of the major players, until they finally agree to release him. The story ends with a chilling reminder that although he might play along with the fight against Sauron for a time in order to continue to be allowed to wear the Ring, he intends to eventually eliminate anything and anyone that threatens his possession of it. Every action he takes from now on will ultimately be in service to his singular goal of continuing to wear the Ring for all eternity.!<
