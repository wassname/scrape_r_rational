  [Plan: Talk no Jutsu]

  * Attempt to talk it out. 
  * Concept: Talking is actually the braver move here: picking up a sword and shield and fighting is less brave, because it is (at least partially) admitting defeat on his objective.
  * Suggested dialogue angle: "I may not be a hero, but I will do anything in my power to save the people of this world, and I am not your enemy."
  * If he looks like he's going to attack, hit him with Soothe as hard as possible.
  * Fi: Feed Link extra mana for a stronger Soothe if possible.
  * If he attacks, attempt to evade and continue to talk, unless sorely pressed.
  * Fi: If Link is in a critical situation, intervene on his behalf if necessary. For example, if Ibboso looks like he's about to deliver a killing blow, you have permission to use Compel on Ibboso to stop him from attacking.
  * Link: If dying or otherwise in a critical about-to-die sort of situation, attempt to break illusion with Scry. This is an emergency measure and should not distract from normal evasion and tactics.

  Edit: Added one extra Link step based on a higher than previously noted probability that we're in a genjustu.

  \[Plan: Job Interview\]

  * Continue trying diplomacy
  * Talking seems more likely to achieve his goddess given mission of 'release the shade of Ibboso from his eternal prison '
  * If you replace me, are you going to protect the realm, and to seek out and vanquish evil wherever it is found?
     * \[Joke\] Alternate phrasing. Where do you see yourself 5 years from now? \[/Joke\]

  Edit: My reasoning here is that Ibboso is claiming, like a certain red-haired jerk, that Link isn't a *real* lightsworn. 'Protect the realm...' is an exact quote of what Hylia said to Link in his vision. My theory is that the first paragraph she says to every Lightsworn candidate. And then the 2nd paragraph where she talks about freeing Ibboso is one unique to the candidate. So by quoting what she says in the first paragraph, that's proof to Ibboso that Link's the real deal.

  The reason I think establishing this is key, is based on what Lucia (She helped Hyrule defeat Morudo Geira worshipers awhile back so she's not one of the super evil fae) has said. When Lucia noticed that Link was a lightsworn, she took over for Urik. And then when Link revealed that he had gotten the purple gemstone from the Spire she said this.

  > “This changes matters considerably,” he said. “I know why you are here. I may be able to help you.” 

  Being Lightsworn wasn't sufficient, it was the reveal of going to the Spire that made her think we had a chance.

  > “He's Lightsworn, and chosen of the Goddesses! Hylia sent him. Please—” 

  Once again she's emphasizing Link's Lightsworn status. Which is awfully nice of her given how so many people in the know are so dismissive of it.

  Ibboso would like to know what Link’s last words should be. What do you think?

  **Disclaimer:**

  The following is, to the best of my ability, my honest take of "what I would do if I were a player, sans any particular QM knowledge," provided mostly as a stream-of-consciousness with me giving this serious thought over the course of ~1 hour. It is in no way to be construed as WoQM, and further may be incomplete or just flat wrong. Additionally, I make no guarantees that it won't end in Bad Things (TM) should you choose to follow through with it. I assure you, I am quite adept at this type of information segregation, compartmentalization, quarantine, etc., and I have taken great pains to employ such here.

  So, first question: What do we know about Ibboso? The first mention was Link's vision from Hylia at the Obsidian Spire:

  > “Although your trials have only begun, you show great promise. It is the solemn duty of all who walk this path to protect the realm, and to seek out and vanquish evil wherever it is found. The powers you are to wield must only ever serve this purpose. Prove yourself worthy of them, and you will have earned my favor.”
  > 
  > Link’s breath caught in his throat. Something about this wasn’t right. If Hylia was still here, then…
  > 
  > He knelt before her. “Holy Mother—please, you must listen! The world needs you. The realm is beset by a great evil already—there isn’t time! A man named Ganondorf… he serves… the dark god Demise…”
  > 
  > “You doubtless have many questions for me,” Hylia said, speaking over him as if he weren’t there. “Would that I could answer them. Rest assured that I am with you still, guiding your steps from beyond time. Have faith, and you will be rewarded. For now, you must continue your quest. I charge you with this task: release the shade of Ibboso from his eternal prison, and retrieve the fragment of Courage his tribe defends.”

  In particular, this line stands out to me:

  * "Rest assured that I am with you still, guiding your steps from beyond time. Have faith, and you will be rewarded."

  Now I have no idea what Hylia means by "from beyond time," but to take that at face value, she has at bare minimum foreseen this eventuality and it is a part of her over-arching plans. She has, after all, been playing against Demise for an unknown amount of time prior to the story start. Her efforts culminated in her sacrificing herself to save Hyrule and empowering a champion. Given that Link was one of the three (even if he wasn't initially chosen to be empowered), it stands to reason that Hylia had plans for Link in any timelines where he survived (so roughly 66% of them). In the timelines where Link stumbles upon the silvery egg (again, assuming that was part of her plan, given how unlikely it was said to be in the story), he gets the visions of the temples. Seeing as he's now talking to her (or her memory/imprint/recording/cognitive shadow/essence/whatever) and thus *survived* the first challenge, it seems to me it would be immensely wasteful of her to immediately send him off to die at the hands of Ibboso.

  Meaning, this isn't a hopeless situation, and Hylia may have already, one way or the other, given Link the tools he needs to come out of it ahead. Maybe if he fights Ibboso head on, he'll win? Though that seems risky, and also not the kind of answer you'd like to find out the hard way. If nothing else, just this point alone seems like it would be a source of inspiration for him to draw on. That's kind of exactly what "having faith" means, isn't it? Link seems particularly religious and motivated by that type of reasoning--wanting to believe he is a chosen hero of destiny. I'm not sure to what degree *more motivation* will help him against Ibboso, but it's something to keep in mind at least.

  I *suppose* it's possible Hylia could intentionally be sending Link to his doom as a means of letting Ibboso escape (other players on Discord have posited Ibboso wants to yoink Link's body and I think that is a fairly straightforward interpretation), but that kind of misdirection and manipulation doesn't strike me as something Hylia, as portrayed thus far, would be willing to do. I will proceed assuming this is not the case.

  I further suppose it could be possible this wasn't intended as a message for Link *specifically*, but rather as a general-purpose message for any hero-types who managed to get this far. After all, it has been an indeterminate amount of time since the Lightsworn order fell apart. The first line ("Although your trials have only begun, you show great promise.") does seem to be at odds with the interpretation that this was a message meant specifically for Link. It's still possible that the message was recorded long, long ago, and had to serve multiple purposes. I'm not sure.

  Next mention:

  > “There is not much to this one, sadly,” Naibi said. “Ibboso was said to be an arrogant king, who renounced the Gerudo way and violated the old laws. He offered refuge to the lost sons of other tribes—ꡦꡟꡛꡀꡲꡀꡟꡟꡖꡨ—those who were exiled for the crime of weakness. This angered the gods, and his tribe was cursed to roam the dry sands for eternity, never knowing the peace of death.”
  > 
  > “The crime of weakness?” Zelda said in disbelief. It was painfully obvious to her that “the gods” in this tale referred to Morudo Geira in some capacity, but she wasn’t about to mention that in front of Naibi.
  > 
  > “We no longer follow the old laws,” Naibi said simply. “Please, let us not speak any more of this.”
  > 
  > Zelda nodded solemnly. “My mistake. Naibi, in Link’s vision, there was a mausoleum in the middle of a graveyard filled with shambling corpses. He said he had a vague feeling it was somewhere to the east, but he doesn’t know exactly where it is. You wouldn’t happen to know where to find that, would you?”
  > 
  > “Ehh,” she waved a hand from side to side. “There is a certain pass in the eastern mountains where no one goes. It is said that it was once a place of ritual and worship, but is now haunted. I never put stock in such tales, but if what you say is true, perhaps the dead really do roam there. I cannot say if it is the same place as his vision, but I also do not know where else it might be. There are not many such tales.”

  Things to take from this that might be relevant:

  * Ibboso fought against the Gerudo practice of sacrificing their male children. Also, he's attuned to Courage. He's probably not evil. 

  * THIS DESCRIPTION OF THE LOCATION IS NOT WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE LATEST CHAPTER

  * The place they're at, presumably, was once a "place of ritual and worship." Maybe that's important? I dunno.

  In particular, #2 above really strikes me as off. This whole chapter seems to be one big fever dream, and I have to wonder how much of it's real. Presumably they are actually here at this location in some capacity, but from Fi's appearance at the start, to Ryn's constant reminders and Link's own internal monologue saying "none of this is real," it's obvious there's some really fucky stuff going on.

  Is the Ibboso encounter real? Or is this whole thing just running on some kind of dream logic? Presumably there are real consequences at stake here, and Ibboso really is going to kill Link and yoink his body unless Link finds a way to stop him. But is it *actually happening*, or is it some pseudo-physical manifestation of cognitive plane shenanigans? The situation might not be what it seems, is all I'm saying. It's a stretch, but Link might be able to go all Neo and use DreamLogic (TM) against Ibboso, if that is in fact what's happening. Could be risky, though. Ibboso is almost certainly more practiced at it, having "awaited this opportunity for ages." And if it doesn't work, again, not the kind of thing you'd like to find out the hard way when there's an ancient Gerudo king trying to lop your head off.

  Question: Why hasn't this happened before? Is Link & co. really the first people to arrive here? That strikes me as unlikely. We're not sure when Ibboso and his tribe was cursed, but it seems like it would be around the time the Gerudo split off from the Hylians, and the story says (via Raolin in prologue 1) that it's been "over a thousand years" since the last war with the Gerudo. So it's been >1000 years, and probably longer than that. That's a hell of a lot of time for no one else to have ventured in here for Ibboso to yoink.

  ...Is something special about Link? His Lightsworn status? Or maybe his connection with Courage?

  AAHHH.

  Idea.

  You know what? It doesn't matter. Ibboso wants Link's body. But he doesn't have Link's body. Link does.

  And what can Link do with his body?

  Oh yes. That's right, class. It's time for some good ol' fashioned 

  **[X] GAME THEORETIC COERCION!!!**

  * It's obvious Ibboso wants to use Link's body for some purpose, probably to yoink it and gtfo. Pick up your sword and threaten to kill yourself unless he stops and agrees to talk this out. (And, uh... we probably need to fill in the rest of the plan with what we want to talk to him about.)

  ^ Yeah, that's probably the plan I'd vote for if I were a player.

  I'd probably poke others to refine it first and ultimately be shouted down by more risk-averse folks, but I'd totally vote for it.
  ```

    ```
    *Starts shouting about being too risky*

    Thank you for the write up though. It reminded me of some things we'd missed. I don't think Hylia intended Link to game theory his way out of this though. Zelda, on the other hand...

    Edit: Also do not approve of this plan.

    *Shout!*

    In all seriousness, though, great write up. And great chapter, too, btw. Super interesting stuff going on.

    Edit: Also, I will state for the record that I do not approve of this plan. It is, at a minimum, incomplete, as well as being too high risk.

  Scary stuff, but thanks to Lucia we seem to have at least a chance. (Vecht sorta, maybe confirmed on discord that the Niesis incident is what let her interfere)

  Edit: Also, I strongly suspect Ibboso is trying to bodyjack Link here.

    I'm not convinced Lucia will intervene on our behalf. I certainly *hope* she will if necessary, but we'll see.

      Well she already did by opening up that Obelisk. Looks like Ibboso just locked her out of the conversation though. Somehow.

        We'll have to see if she's able to get herself out.

  \[Plan: Ibboso the Hypocrite\]

  * Continue trying diplomacy
  * Talking seems more likely to achieve his goddess given mission of 'release the shade of Ibboso from his eternal prison'
  * Say, 'I'm a *boy*, and you're trying to sacrifice me. Are you going to become what you fought so hard against?'

  The idea here is that Ibboso is known for being anti-child sacrifice. And yet here he is trying to bodyjack a kid. Throw his hypocrisy into his face in hopes of scoring an armor-piercing question. Since we know that he at least *was* a not-evil guy. I'll note here that Lucia was also calling Link boy which might be a hint from her as well.
  ```

  - u/Salaris:
    ```
    I think that there's a significant possibility that body jacking is what we're dealing with here, but it's not the only option. 

    > "I have awaited this opportunity for ages, and I will not be denied my prize." 

    His "prize" here might not be Link's body, but rather a courage fragment, which we've already seen vanishing and going to him. It's possible that he requires more courage fragments for something, such as more fully manifesting in the world, escaping his curse, etc.

    If so, he may have simply been waiting for centuries for someone to travel to his location with a courage fragment.

  Okay, this chapter is purposefully very confusing, and works had to make you forget your previous confusions by introducing new ones, so I listed my suspicions as I reread the chapter, to make sure I didn't drop them. Could help to form some idea about what is going on. The full list is below, a bit long and windy.

  TL; DR: 

  1. The illusion started at first the line of the chapter.
     1. cf. Fi
  2. There is some leakage from reality, especially in what Ryn says
     1. But not all she says is real
  3. It seems somewhat unlikely for everything to be one coherent illusion created by a single agent
     1. But there is definite intent in purposefully distracting Link all the time. Could still just be a feature of an advanced effect.
     2. Most likely: illusion containing genuinely independent agents. A dream realm? But with some control by some actor?

  Here is the full chronological suspicion listing:

  * Link is surprised by how soon they got "here".
     * Their hereness is only an assertion by Ryn. This assertion presumes they knew precisely where they were going and are  now there. So this is probably false. They were not yet at their goal, when Link entered the illusion/mindbending.
  * Koja says "that's ominuous", then takes it back. Very inorganic. I suspect "that's ominuous" leaked from reality and was explained away.
     * So some specific ominuous thing happened and Link was not meant to pay attention to it.
  * Grenja's "Did you forget why we came here?" dialogue. Clearly an attempt by illusionist to fish out why they were there.
  * Illusionist was not aware of what Fi was. Simulated another hylian.
  * “Link! Are you listening to me?”  Ryn's voice leaked from reality.
     * Simulated Fi was immediately used to distract Link.
  * Fi: "I had hoped you of all people would understand that the situation  is exceedingly dire, Master. Regardless of you believe you are seeing,  you must—”
     * I suspect this leaked from reality, requiring another immediate distraction, in the form of Urik appearing.
  * Grenja was uncharacteristically aggressive in apprehending Urik.
     * I'm not sure why. A test whether Link approves this approach? A mistake? Urik appeared also in reality, but in a more clearly suspicious way?
  * "Link glanced back to his teammates. Ryn was arguing with Grenja, while Koja stood off to the side, shaking her head."
     * Was each one dealing with their private illusion? Or did this leak from reality?
  * Urik posessed.
     * If illusion, why? To justify change?
  * “Link!” Ryn said quietly. “Will you *please* just listen—”
     * Ryn has definitely been saying a lot of things to Link, that we have not seen in the text.
  * “That’s none of your…” Link shook his head. “That’s… uh… one of the gemstones from the Obsidian Spire."
     * Explicit mindbending here. Strong enough to reverse already formed decision and redirect thought. Not used this strongly constantly. Costly? Risky?
        * If the risk is detection, why not just turn mind away from idea? So likely not that risk at least. So cost more likely. => Finite resources? Could use attrition?
  * Gem changes things, allegedly. Obelisk changes. Real?
     * If real, meaning?
        * Allows transition to ghost town? What is relation between ghost town and illusion if so?
        * Occam suggest ghost effect and the effect since first line of chapter is same.
        * Both ghost or both illusionist? Ghosts as separate from illusionist real?
  * Ghost town an inconvenience for Urik. If both illusions, why?
     * Establish danger to force trust in Urik?
     * Test reactions?
     * This is to a degree evidence against ghosts, illusion and Urik being all illusions serving same purpose
  * "He shook his head. No. This wasn’t right. This wasn’t *real*. “Boy, come! Get inside, now!” Urik yelled, holding a door open and gesturing inside."
     * Was this a rescue, or a distraction from realizing nothing is real?
  * “Uh, Link?” Koja said. “Not to sound rude or anything, but—”
     * Leak from reality. In general, there are clearly several alternative realities inside the house. If only link is illusioned, this suggests house is in some way real.
  * Ryn let out a breath. “Okay. So, I don’t know what’s going on  exactly, but … not real … this place? … none of it … but it’s safe here,  just like Urik said … can’t believe anything you see … some kind of  shared dream, or *something* … those people out there? They’re not people! … don’t look, it makes them angry … Koja? Are you listening? I said…”
     * Whatever Ryn is trying to say is being heavily edited by the illusion.
     * Likely main point of editing is to make us trust Urik. No reason why Ryn would be so confident in Urik's assertion. No reason to believe Urik exists for real Ryn.
  * " Link hesitated. Something nagged at the back of his mind. There was something he was trying very hard *not* to think about. Somehow he needed to think about it, without actually thinking *about* it. He needed to think *around* it. He needed to get Grenja to as well."
     * Genuine struggle against memetic threat? Is there anything around that should not be thought about for some reason?
     * Or is this just the mindbeding making him avoid thinking about flaws.
  * Either the illusion contains a Grenja who has a separate illusion, or there actually is such a Grenja? Unclear.
  * “It’s, uh, not so bad,” 
     * Trying to make it safe by thinking it so?
     * Was the miscalculation by Urik genuine, if so, in which direction?
  * Ryn grinned. “Yes, Link,” she said. “Urik’s trying to help us. It’s safe now.” She looked around the room. “I think.”
     * Was this a pure illusion Ryn? Usually when Link adresses Ryn, as he did here, at least the first few words back are from real Ryn. Is that different here? Is only "Yes, Link" real? Or is there a real Urik really trying to help us with the illusion?
  * The discussion about the draw and the Scry seems real. Which is evidence that something similar to what is claimed may actually be going on.
     * “Not *now*, you idiot,”
        * A sudden shift from previous line, countermanding it. Likely switched to illusion here. Should have scried immediately.
  * Urik & Iboso disagree
     * Evidence against all being illusion puppets of same master, to an extent
  * “Urik?” Ryn said, looking confused. “What are you talking about? Who’s Urik?”
     * Seems like a leakage from reality. Patched by claiming it was a joke. Suggests Urik exists only for Link.
     * There is some evidence for Urik being real to others, but "YOU ARE NOT LISTENING"-Ryn would not joke here and now, even if this joke is like her in the abstract.

  \[Plan: Constructive Paranoia\]

  Please see my long winded post in this thread for reasons to doubt everything about this chapter. Since the true state of reality cannot be known, the best plan is the one that produces the best results in the maximal number of possible realities, weighted by probabilities.

  This plan is based on optimizing for the following realities with roughly equal weights:

  * Reality A:
     * Everything is an illusion. It is hostile and trying to cause us harm.
  * Reality B:
     * Everything is an illusion. It is trying to measure our worth.
  * Reality C:
     * Everything is a dream realm. Non-party member entities are real real entities. This dream realm is the prison Ibboso needs to be released from and wants to escape.
  * Reality D:
     * Things are approximately as presented in the chapter.

  Based on this, this is the best plan I could think of, most contingencies for reality D snatched from Salaris, Mathemicae and crivtox:

  1. Scry as soon as possible
     1. Request Ibbosso to give you a moment to prepare. Appeal to his honour and mercy.
     2. If above does not work, explain that he could be an illusion and you don't want to hit your friends, so you must scry to make sure before can fight.
     3. If not, try to fit scrying in at some point if at all possible.
  2. Explain observed reality to Ryn
     1. Main point being that you will have to respond to an attacker that could be real, so please stand clear.
  3. Request/Authorize Fi to induce sleep paralysis in self, if trapped in illusion
  4. The above may take time. Dodge and shield as necessary to buy the time.
  5. Diplomacy
     1. So you would sacrifice me to save yourself?
     2. I may be no hero, but I will protect the realm and seek out and vanquish evil wherever it is found.
        1. Reference to the speech heard in vision in tower, to signal lightswornness
        2. Humility
     3. Hylia told me to release you from your prison
     4. Mention that the old evil god is dead. Ask about feelings regarding that. Ask about awareness of demise, Ganondorf.
  6. Ibboso could be the sort of guy you need to beat to befriend
     1. Try to use moves and tactics least likely to hurt friends if blinded.
     2. Can Fi read our mind to what extent? Subvocalization? Inform friends about moves.
     3. Definitely don't kill Ibboso. Use tricks, like the transfubulator.

  [Plan: lets talk through the sword]
  Seems like diplomacy isn't working and ibosso seems the kind of guy that prefers crossing swords to talking(I mean he is even complaining about our words being.empty) . 

  Link:Grab the sword and shield fight ibosso.
  Keep trying diplomacy while you do it.

  Link:Start whith saying that you don't think someone who would steal a body is a hero either.
  Mention  that you have faced the trial of the Spire and a vision sent you to release him. 
  Also that the enemy is about to wipe out hyrule and the last thing we need right now is a fight  between people who should be in the same side. 

  Link:Try to get the fight away from Ryn. 

  Link:Try to be as nonlethal as possible, we are in an illusion and we can't know if we are actually fighting an ally, and not sure what killing ibosso in this illusion/cognitive/dream whatever would do, ideally we want him as an ally. 
  But if you get too wounded, it looks like ibosso won't stop and you are about to loose attempt to shot him whith the transfubulator (if you don't have it realize this is not real and you should have it and see if you can get it to materialize). 

  Explicitly think that the fragment will come back to you (this place/illusion seems to react to beliefs and it would make sense for it to come back, since it should be bonded to Link)

  Fi:If Link is actually fighting ibosso in a way you can detect support him by giving him mana to keep him in his normal level if necesary. 
  Use rejuvenate on him if the fight is going bad. 
  Otherwise inform Zelda/link's companions if they aren't compromised of the situation Link is in and and ask for her orders about it.
