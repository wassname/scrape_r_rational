## Should UNSONG be submitted to topwebfiction.com ?

### Post:

I don't know if only the author can post their serial onto the website, but I feel that doing so could potentially give UNSONG some more exposure.

  I think this is a question better suited for discussion on /r/unsong or /r/slatestarcodex.

  But I do believe it should be posted to topwebfiction.com if only because that's the purpose of the site, to link to fiction and to enable some sort of comparison between the web serials.

  However, unless Scott is aware and regularly links to the site at the end of his chapters for regular voting, it will be very hard for his story to move up through the ranks. So I think the only person who should do the submitting is Scott.

  TL;DR - Yes, but Scott should be the one to do it.

  Once it's finished, it should be up for a Hugo.

    I enjoy it, but I don't think it's professional grade writing. Worse things have gotten a Hugo, but there are also better things out there. Not to mention that the Hugo's are a giant site of controversy in recent years, and Scott would likely not appreciate the attention.

      It reminds me a lot of early Stross (eg, A Colder War), except with Kabbala instead of Cthulhu.
