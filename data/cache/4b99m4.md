  Somebody went and made [Llull](https://rawgit.com/pirindiel/llull/master/llull.html). I note they added a feature to start at random points of the search space, so UNGONG won't come bashing down your door.

    They pronounce "ch" wrong.

  ```
  And with the infodump of the Zephyr, the world situation suddenly gets much more dystopic and depressing than it seemed to be before.
  ```

    ```
    Magic returning to the world, powerful and unaccountable corporations, North American balkanization, UNSONG is really starting to remind me of Shadowrun.  I wonder if we'll get a future Interlude showing David Baying Wolf's overthrow of the Pacific Northwest.

      I'm getting Worm-vibes.

  So...Erica didn't notice the front wall of the house collapsing.  She only noticed the gunshots and the darkness, which happened *after* Aaron collapsed the wall.

  Also, that was an amazing escape scene.  Erica is truly a fish in water.

  Pirindiel is such a [woobie](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie).  I just want to hug him and tell him that everything is going to be all right.

    The worst part is that he'll probably believe you but go overboard in it, and not understand how it could have happened, the next time that something turns out just a little bit not-good. :<

  You know, when I look at Prindiel's name, I can't help but wonder at the kabbalistic consequences of automatic gearing in cars: PRNDL.

    Thus does he bear her to getaway.

- u/Gurkenglas:
  ```
  Why wouldn't they search the train while it's driving?
  ```

  - u/ulyssessword:
    ```
    Why *would* they search the train?  I didn't see anything that would have tipped them off.
    ```

    - u/Gurkenglas:
      ```
      Just as a matter of formality, because otherwise every fugitive in America is going to want to use the train.
      ```

- u/MugaSofer:
  ```
  The holy water thing has finally reminded me what this story reminds me of - Neil Gaiman's *Cold Colours*. Computers and magic realism and a creeping sense that the good guys haven't done good enough.

  This is funnier, obviously.
