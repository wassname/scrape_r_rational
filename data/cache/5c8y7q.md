  Contrary to its name, this is actually the rational *fiction* board. You probably want r/lesswrong, except insofar as newspapers count as fiction.

  Nope, never heard of any such thing. A common assignment in my undergraduate classes is to read a scientific paper and then find 1-3 news articles that reported on the same paper and write about how accurately it did (not!) do so.

  I'll be surprised to find even one article that does so much less an entire paper.

  There's a reason why we only see villainous characters as reporters nowadays on TV. Heroic reporters like Lois Lane are a thing of the past.
