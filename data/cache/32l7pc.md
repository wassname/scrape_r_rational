  So the premise of this story is that rational agents cannot precommit, and rational thought is inherently opposed to social skills and happiness. *sigh* lovely.

  If this wasn't obviously written by someone who self-identifies as intelligent, it would be an especially offensive batch of sour grapes. As it is, it's merely heartbreakingly sad :( The poor author.

  Why does this story think that *mentioning sex* is the same as rather insultingly turning someone down? Maybe social mores have changed over time ...

    Not to mention that the supposedly rational character treats the entire series of events stemming from acceptance of seeing a movie together as probability 1 events unpredicated on information obtained during those events. Eric is far more rational in this case considering events in the causal chain as probabilities, not certainties.

    Of course I could be mistaken and she could have already evaluated all possible information she could obtain and has come to the conclusion that Eric is either someone she wants to sleep with or an inevitable rapist (Those are the only outcomes I could come up with that fit the p=1 causal chain, let me know if there are others) regardless of any additional information. Since she effectively declined, I can only assume Eric is a rapist.

  Excuse me while I break down laughing.  Oh, the social problems of having more speed in your thoughts than almost everyone around you, and too little sense of uncertainty!

  >I became a brat about it.  I demanded that my mom buy separate meat and dairy dishes, went on a hunger strike until she did. On Shabbat I threw a tantrum whenever she or Shoshana toggled a light switch, or carried something outside without first tying it around their wrists so that it would count as clothing. A religion, I reasoned, couldn't be half-true. If you believed it, if you took it seriously, then how could you wear leather shoes on Yom Kippur or let a siddur fall to the ground without kissing it?

  OH MY GOD I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO DID THAT!

  > What form could the evidence take? Ditziness, perhaps, or mad, head-over-heels, 'irrational' romantic love.  I'm such a fool, I couldn't bring myself to cheat on you even if a man with more resources or better genes came along. Can we not see how genes for ditziness could spread through a population?   Of course, the ideal strategy for a woman would be to fake ditziness while she's wooing men, yet call on a hidden stash of rationality for other purposes.

  Uhhhh... you don't think love is a real thing?  Who are you, Robin Hanson?

  >Intelligence, rationality, clear understanding—the points I'm making could apply to any of them, insofar as any of them could make one's promises or threats less credible. But my dad developed a more detailed model. He defined Type-0 thinking to be that concerned directly with the truth about the world. To find out whether astrology works, a Type-0 thinker might test its predictions against those made by rolling a die—and would inevitably conclude that it doesn't work. By contrast, Type-1 thinking is concerned with the truth about which beliefs are most advantageous to hold. A Type-1 thinker investigating astrology might first go to nightclubs acting as though he believes it—"Hey baby, what's your sign?"—and then go acting as though he doesn't believe it, so that he can calculate which belief is the more often smiled upon by Venus. We can also define Type-2 thinking—concerned with the truth about which beliefs about the truth about which beliefs are most advantageous to hold are most advantageous to hold—as well as Type-3, Type-4, and so on. My dad pictured the mind as an uneasy cohabitation of all these types, with one dominant one minute, another the next.  The types quickly diminish in importance, though, the further removed they are from the world: Type-728 thinking is unlikely to have much survival value.

  That's nice, but in fact, it's completely divorced from how hierarchical inference works.  In real hierarchical models, correct inferences require more data as you move further and further up to the hierarchy.

  > What if a hugely successful religion were founded, which taught that burning fossil fuel is a sin against Petrola, the oil-god?

  Story waiting to happen.

  > Such a religion, if it saved civilization, would also save its libraries and universities and particle accelerators.  Hence, even if your sole concern were the advancement of knowledge, you'd still have to concede that it's better—more moral—for people to believe in Petrola than to know the truth of His nonexistence.

  Not quite.  A delusion beneficial in one situation has knock-on negative effects in almost all other situations.

  >But what of those such as I, to whom clear understanding has brought only misery?  Am I to hope that, in the hereafter, a rationalist God will reward me for having the intellectual integrity not to believe in Him?

  Oh?  You think you'll keep existing after you die?

  >I know, a girl who won $10,000 in the Ayn Rand Institute's essay contest despite not believing a word of Rand's philosophy (she entered, she explained, just for the money).

  BAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA

  >George W. Bush has a simple goal: for ordinary Americans like you to keep more of their own money.

  *snrk*

  >"Ah, yet is not dancing merely a vertical expression of a horizontal desire?"

  Actually, that's only true for teenagers.  Get over yourself and ditch your virginity: life gets a lot better afterwards when hormones and curiosity stop emphasizing the wrong bits of all your perceptions.

  > Those who presume to answer such questions use what's called anthropic reasoning.

  Oh no.  Probability is about information, girl!

  >At Shannon's party I downed four glasses of wine, about five more than the number to which my brain is habituated. 

  You read the Vimes books, don't you?

  >But I'm now myself again, and every four-manifold with the same homotopy group as a four-sphere is homeomorphic to a four-sphere

  Wait... there are people who *actually* learned topology in *high school*?

  >Reaching for the flashlight under my pillow, I found On Self-Delusion and Bounded Rationality and opened it to page 34.  And there it was, in the first paragraph: "so straightforwardly that the derivation could be done, I think, even in an extremely weak system of inference."

  BALLS!  FUCK RIGHT OFF!

  >He was obsessed by the logic of promises and threats, he thought he'd found the true explanation for why rational and scientifically-minded people are so often losers in life.

  Excuse me, who said we're losers in life?

  >i mean i might accept little delusions—like that my fiancée is the greatest guy on earth, assuming for the sake of argument that he isnt

  LOVE DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY.  GOOD NIGHT!

  >"But I'm happy", I protested.  "Elliot and I are committed to each other and to our psychic and spiritual rebirth..."

  Ok, this is sounding disturbingly like my younger brother.

  > Speaking of which Elliot is the best b/f i could have imagined!!!

  In context, a combination of "lol" and "eww".

  >No more; where ignorance is bliss,
  >
  >'Tis folly to be wise.

  What a loser.

      Of course.  A story about rising paranoid schizophrenia and extreme social detachment driving a high-school girl to ruin her own life and mind would be horrifically sad if it was real.  I laugh and snark and commentate so I don't cry, especially from the resemblance to someone I know very closely.

      HINT HINT I AM THE OLDER SIBLING IN THIS STORY.

      Fiction or not, it is ridiculous and doesn't seem to be satire. None of the characters are rational. The closest it comes is a self-proclaimed hyper-rationalist that is [pointy-eared and packed with straw](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawVulcan) who is barely outside the event horizon of their own ego. With the invocation of such a *caricature* of rationality represented by the of the protagonist in the beginning combined with the continuing theme of inevitable conflict between this "rationality" and happiness, this piece strikes me as if it were an irrationality apologetics piece (if such things can exist).

        I was under the impression it was a tragicomedy.

        Hm.  Tragic.  That's too common.  I shouldn't have posted this.

        I don't understand how you can read it as a irrationality apologetics: the protagonist is clearly unbalance both at the beginning and at the end. In here 'irrationality' ~ being crazy

    a story, I'll add, that would be much more interesting than this one.

  This was rationalist horror to me: the horror of renouncing to see truth, because you weren't dealing with it properly in the beginning, and becoming fully blind to it. Ugh!
