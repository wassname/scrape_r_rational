## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You can evolve any animal according to its current situation extremely quickly, and the result will follow your orders without question. This does not work on people or anything more advanced than pigs, or less advanced than Moths.

  You can also adapt slightly to the current climate, (I.e. gills underwater, body resistant to vacuum, etc)

    This is the important part. Forget evolving to their current situation, that just streamlines them a bit; they'll follow my orders without question.

    I've got a personal army.

    An army of what? Well, dogs (wolves?), spiders, ants, locusts... anything I want, really. I can easily make money as a lion tamer if I want (I just need to evolve the lion first) or other animal-taming entertainer; I can create and sell spider-silk clothing; I can protect myself with an army of ants (and use them for pest control, too, if I want); I can have an army of super-moles plough fields.

      I think youâ€™re the first one to actually hit on that.

    Its current situation? Does this mean I could put an animal in a situation where I'm either going to give it the opportunity to mate or shoot it in the head depending on whether it can, I don't know...demonstrate human-like intelligence, reverse entropy, secrete the cure for Alzheimer's? And then it would insta-"evolve" into something capable of doing that?

      It's probably gonna be easier for it to evolve to be bullet resistant or strong enough to overcome you rather than develop human intelligence.

    Initially, do things to adapt animals to being farmed better. Factory farmed chickens, cows, etc, which can efficiently produce meat and eggs and such and be bred based off their potential.

    Once you have start up cash, build a center where intelligence helps them get fed and gives them advantages, and uplift an animal to superintelligence. Through a series of rapid advancements and harder and harder puzzles you should be able to develop very intelligent beings. Initially, how well they can use language to communicate so they can develop better language. Later, how well they can use tools to solve problems. Other ones to improve memory and understanding.

    For example, I might imagine a place where to get food and water and such an animal needs to solve programming puzzles, including building safe AI. You'd have lesser challenges initially.

    Intelligence did evolve once.

  I am writing a fanfiction about a desperate zorian who returns to the start of the loop with most of his powers and has to quickly advance to solve problems.

  Given the power to mind control people but not give them or you new skills, much combat might, and the ability to make spell items and new spells and such which offer moderate advancement, along with a time loop, what's the best way to ensure rapid singularity advancement?

  Tech is Victorian level, and its a hard rule of the universe that you can't mind magic skills. Zorian has limited mana, and can't easily solve this problem, but can do a lot with mass mind control. Mass soul manipulation is risky because of an ethical goddess with him, although manipulation of necromancers is allowed.
