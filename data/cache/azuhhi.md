## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Any new promising web novels worth following? I have been on very long reading slump.

    Vacant Throne started May 2018. It's by the author of void domain. Hard to say how rational it is. MC plans to uplift society but seems to keep getting distracted... https://tcthrone.wordpress.com/

      >MC plans to uplift society but seems to keep getting distracted

      Well, more like MC is annoyed by the low quality of life, and reasonably empathetic. I don't think uplift is an explicit goal :P
      It's fun though and updates regularly!

        Have you heard of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality? You have? What about The Metropolitan Man? It's more recent!
        ```

        - u/appropriate-username:
          ```
          Too popular for me. I prefer the more obscure, little-known stories like Mother of Learning.

          Also, did you know that Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality was based on a niche novel series titled "Harry Potter"? It's true! The fanfic caused a dozen or so sales of the book before everyone went back to reading HPMOR. I heard rumors that The Metropolitan Man was also based on something but I don't think anybody knows what it is.
          ```

          - u/None:
            ```
            Going even further back, Harry Potter was actually in no small part inspired by an obscure series called "Lord of the Rings". There are even some indie films about them you can watch since the books are a little long.
            ```

          This sarcastic exchange has reminded me to get around to trading The Metropolitan Man. So I regret to inform you that you were accidentally helpful.

  I recently found [Robert Miles' YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLB7AzTwc6VFZrBsO2ucBMg/videos), and it has been unexpectedly good. It is the best and most accurate casually-accessible introduction into AI risk concerns that I have seen. I first saw him from Computerphile videos (eg. [this one on Logical Induction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDqkCxYYDGk)).

  In particular, [Why Not Just: Think of AGI Like a Corporation?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5pUA3LsEaw) was very well presented. (I'd also like to cc /u/Empiricist_or_not to substitute part of a response to [an old comment of his](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9f06u9/slaughterbots_video/e61lh5c/?context=2) that I never ended up writing up.)

  ```
  Any multiversal empire building fics/quests? Tkioz’s Cruel to be Kind (https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/cruel-to-be-kind-si-multicross-thread-iii.295774/) is the kind of thing I’m looking for, but the quality isn’t the best.
  ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    Can you give a pitch for Cruel to be Kind? The premise seems interesting.

    The first thing I can think of regarding your request is The Merchant Princes by Charles Stross. **VAGUE MILD SPOILERS**: It starts off not quite like you're asking for, and by the last book it is exactly what you're asking for. 

    edit: This [tvtropes page](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiversalConqueror) might be a good place to start looking.
    ```

    - u/Adeen_Dragon:
      ```
      A hiker has a Tardis look-alike grafted to him, and is kicked off of his native earth. Deciding to become an emperor, he finds an uninhabited earth, buys and frees some slaves, and starts ransacking old battlefields for tech to reproduce. Eventually, he gets into a fight with the Kromagg Empire, from the show Sliders.
      ```

    - u/mg115ca:
      ```
      To be fair, the first books are *technically* what he's looking for, but with a heavy dose of "Harumph, we're the old guard and we oppose what you're doing because it's new and different and change upsets the power structure. Change is scary." so the Empire doesn't really start happening for several books by the attempt is there!
      ```

  - u/FormerlySarsaparilla:
    ```
    Have you read Chronicles of Amber? That's the earliest intrusion of multiverses into fantasy that I can think of, and the story is pretty great as well. I don't know if it could be parsed as about empire *building* but it's definitely about some empires.
    ```

    - u/BestMePossible:
      ```
      Loved this series.  Took it camping and devoured it.
      ```

    ```
    [Factory Isolation](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/factory-isolation-si-multicross.30535/#post-6491274) is the best self insert multicross I have read.
    ```

    - u/Adeen_Dragon:
      ```
      That one was pretty good.
      ```

- u/GemOfEvan:
  ```
  Stories about a transhuman humanity that isn't all-powerful, a la [transcendent humanity]( https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9271192/1/Transcendent-Humanity)?
  ```

  - u/LazarusRises:
    ```
    Crystal Society for sure. Super well-done series about an AI made up of several different goal-threads/personalities, whose creators want it to cohere into one mind. About its efforts to hide its true nature and gain resources and freedom.
    ```

    - u/moozilla:
      ```
      Can you recommend anything adjacent to Crystal Society? Really enjoyed reading from the AI perspective.
      ```

      - u/LazarusRises:
        ```
        Crystal Society is pretty unique! The closest thing I can think of as far as "nascent mind learns about the world and levels up" is Bunkercore, which is good fun but definitely popcorn to CS's prime rib.
        ```

  - u/brandalizing:
    ```
    It’s a short story, but Wang's Carpets by Greg Egan is definitely this. Fantastic hard sci-fi.
    ```

    - u/MereInterest:
      ```
      The story has also been expanded into a full-length book, *Diaspora*, if that is more to people's liking.
      ```

  What are some good podcasts and/or free audio books?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Hardcore History is some excellent narrative history. Dan Carlin tells a story excellently and has some great anecdotes. It's not 100% accurate though, he gets some things wrong, and I wouldn't recommend it if you want deeper knowledge about the topics, his audience is layman about history.

    Revolutions by Mike Duncan is excellent more academic history. It's drier than Hardcore History, but it's very accurate and goes through a lot of history. 

    Hello Internet is great, but I can't really explain why. It's two youtubers(CGP Grey and Brady Haran) just talking about random things like flags, elections, and youtube, but it's hilarious and incredibly interesting.
    ```

    - u/Dent7777:
      ```
      Revolutions is an incredible podcast if you are looking for entertaining history you know is accurate.

    There's a fan-made [audiobook](http://audioworm.rein-online.org/) for [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/), one of this subreddit's favourite webnovels.

    I also strongly recommend [We've Got Worm](https://www.doofmedia.com/weve-got-worm/), a podcast where two authors analyze Worm arc by arc. It honestly adds a lot to the experience.
    ```

- u/eternal-potato:
  ```
  I'd like to recommend [Seed](https://m.webtoons.com/en/sf/seed/list?title_no=1480) webtoon. It's not particularly rational, but it's SF about AI, Control Problem and has stuff like school kids training GANs as homework. And the art is pretty.
  ```

  - u/tjhance:

    it's cute!

      [Always human](https://www.webtoons.com/en/romance/always-human/list?title_no=557) as a fluffy lesbian romance story set in the future where casual body modifcation has become a thing. It is finished as well.
      ```

        Thanks that was a cute story!

  [The Power of Formations](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21450/the-power-of-formations), was more fun than I anticipated. Magic school, kid from the sticks, computer science references. The writing is a bit juvenile and such, but it was an enjoyable read for me.

  Somewhat related in that it involves puzzles and computer science, [Untrusted](https://alexnisnevich.github.io/untrusted/) was fun to play through. It is a browser based Interactive Fiction game that uses javascript coding for a series of puzzles. If anyone knows of similar coding puzzle type games, I'd be interested.

    Probably also doesn't fit your request (rationality is not something I would expected in this one ) but for the pure WTF of it: 

    Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay
    https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13230340/1

    It's being written on SpaceBattles and currently there's around 1k words or so per day in the thread
    ```

    - u/Lightwavers:
      ```
      Oh my gosh this is hilarious. Thanks for the link!
      ```

- u/Anderkent:
  ```
  Just starting [Raven Tower](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39395857-the-raven-tower) by Ann Leckie, and so far it's quite good. Not rationalist by any means, but ~30% in no character so far seems burdened with idiot balls.
  ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    Thanks for reminding me of this book, I'll give it a try. I mostly liked her Ancillary series, it had some great ideas but so-so execution. It was a lot of "that's really cool, but why on earth would it work like that?". Verisimilitude way easier in fantasy than in scifi, so maybe that'll be a better niche for her.
    ```

    - u/Anderkent:
      ```
      It is still mostly a character-oriented book. It takes some (again really cool!) ideas, and doesn't really question 'how would this come around', but instead takes it for granted and looks at 'how would this make people behave'.

      In this book: gods only speak truth. Not because they are omniscient; instead whatever they say becomes truth (or they die / stop being gods).
      ```

- u/Shaolang:
  ```
  Are there any stories where the MC has social superpowers like Val in WtC?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Not quite at Val's level, but [Twig's](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/) Sylvester is a devious social manipulator.

    Biopunk universe, where Frankenstein's monster wasn't a novel, but an actual scientific creation. The British Crown snatched that up pretty quickly, poured money into bio research, and conquered large parts of the world. Now, in 1920, Sylvester and his fellow young Experiments must find their place in a world of living superweapons, all-powerful nobility, and mad scientists.

    Fair warning, it's a Wildbow work, which means it's fairly dark, fairly long, and good enough you won't want to put it down 'till you're done.
    ```

- u/GaBeRockKing:
  ```
  Just got reccommended the [Out of Placers](https://www.valsalia.com/comic/out-of-placers/oops-91/) webcomic, which is set in a very interesting lowish fantasy world with minimal magic but a number of extremely nonhuman species coexisting with humans in a trading settlement.
  ```

  - u/eternal-potato:
    ```
    Author's fetishes are a bit too in-your-face in this one. I mean, human dude MC(?) gets randomly forcefully transformed into small rodentish female furry in the first 30 pages. Apparently permanently.
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      I admit, the plot is pretty "webcomic-y." In my personal opinion, though, the worldbuilding outweighs that, but I can understand why you'd disagree.

      Though with how the MC's transformation is handled, I viewed it as less fetishy and more of an examination of body/gender dysmorphia. If he was happy about the transformation or transformed into something cooler then it would clearly be wish fulfilment, but the guy's a waist high rodent now.
      ```

      - u/TacticalTable:
        ```
        Just caught up to the story. World building is done pretty well and the transformation is alright. I _kinda_ get a fetishy feel from it, but I think the major hint is that humans are drawn kinda badly and all of the rat people are drawn with great care.
        ```

        - u/GaBeRockKing:
          ```
          It's harder to get the proportions right for humans, which is partially why you see so many "funny animal" comics. When something is wrong with a representation of a human, we're hardwired to notice. I wouldn't be particulalry surprised of the author was a furry, given the subject manner, but, as I said, I think any fetishy stuff has a relatively minimal impact on the writing of the webcomic.

          Edit: so I was looking at the sidestories, and have to retract my statements. The comic was definitely written with fetishy reasons in mind. (Still good though)
          ```
