## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


### Comments:

  Actually, yes! I recently read a PDF of a book called *How to munchkin D&D campaigns, get your shit together, construct GAI, and become immortal* that I found linked in a /r/science comment.

  Well, that is, I started reading it, but I only had the link saved on Reddit and the comment was deleted for being off topic. Typical.

  So the lesson is, always save the PDF itself. Never just the link.

    has checking your history not worked? And if it was a pdf, it might be in your temp files.

    Any chance that the deleted comment still had the poster's name showing? Then you can ask that person directly for the pdf.

    If not, can you also try posting to /r/science directly asking for the poster (since the poster is likely someone who frequents the subreddit) to come forward?

    If you find it again post it, that sounds like a fun read

    The books that change us most are the ones we never knew we needed.

  In November, I'll be attending a conference in California entitled "Reducing Diagnostic Error in Medicine" which is basically the Less Wrong of the medical world.

  It'll be my first time attending the conference and while I'm interested in doing research and publishing on the subject, right now I'm struggling to find the right angle. My medical school would fund research with medical students, but I'd probably be limited to doing something about early cognitive biases and dysrationalia overrides. My real passion is in a Bayesian-styled probability generator/calculator for differential diagnoses based on signs, symptoms, and testing, especially if we could train a Watson-like system to scrub for the data in electronic medical records that link s/sx/labs to diagnosis codes.... but to be honest, I don't think that the broader medical community is really interested in this. The biggest threat to build such a Bayesian system, to be honest, is the drive for documentation is driven by reimbursement by insurance companies and the threat of malpractice, rather than the genuine desire to capture a patient's information accurately in a narrative format.

  Networking with rational doctors and sniffing out alternative funding sources for research are my two main goals for attending such a conference, but I'd also be interested in reporting back on my findings here, although that depends on medical rationality interests of the community.

  I've inquired a few times before, but is anyone interested in medicine on this forum? I think /u/gnimhey used to frequent this reddit and even wrote an awesome crossover fic between Worm and Shadows of Limelight.

  I think I am very, very, very slowly getting better at beating akrasia. I wish I had a way to measure it. Although I guess a few months/years from now I'll just be able to check my beeminder account.

    I've found that just about the only thing that works even semi-reliably is setting myself up for situations where not getting shit done results in public shame.
