  One subtle way they are inverting the normal Good and Evil dynamic I just noticed is that normally it would be the heroes using the small army and clever tactics vs. a numerically superior enemy force. The rules of the Narrative seem to work more at the level of individual named then at the scale of armies, but if I was on Procer’s side I’d be rather worried that we were letting the other side be the plucky underdogs in this.

  > We believed she’d gambled on her having enough supplies to reach Hedges even if we did, which meant she’d be picking up the pace soon to force a battle there.

  So, it looks like they're forcing the princess' hand while also demonstrating that she can make any two armies disappear at will. I'd say Cat's trying to bait Malanza into splitting her own host to guarantee catching up with at least one army of the three, but the crusaders' marching pace means that Cat will have time to regroup, so with the last paragraph my bet is on princess of Aequitan either having to split the *heroes* if they can't guess where the next gate will open, so they'll hold the chokepoint, or singling out the army that has no gate-maker.

  The phrase about Watch just needing to be there probably means that Catherine wants Malanza to leave a reserve of maybe five thousand to fight them off if necessary, but with their numbers that cannot be the only anngle at play. The fact that she sent Archer with Robber means that she'll either need them to attack some crucial part of the crusaders' host, or that she expects heroes to eventually be deployed to protect the supply line.

  The involvement of heroes in the resulting strategy is where I'm drawing a blank. Will *they* move quickly enough if Catherine keeps this up? Can they maybe enter Arcadia themselves? Will they able to make the gate a chokepoint? Catherine only has three battle-capable members of Woe with her (two if Archer is too far).

    Oh, and I forgot an important distinction: Catherine has *three* gate-makers.

    One is Larat, who's currently in the western group of six thousand soldiers led by Nauk. One is Catherine, who's with Juniper's group of over nine thousand in the center. But, for those who remember the Battle of Four Armies and One, Masego can use fairies (maybe dissected, probably not, given that the Count of Olden Oak was successfully freed by the Queen of Summer) to open gates of his own. If the Wild Hunt splits, he'll be able to move around the group he's with just fine.

    Maybe the avoidance of a pitched battle will culminate in heroes sallying out with the army to tie down what they believe to be Catherine's main means of transportation (herself and Larat), only for Masego to open a new path of retreat. Probably wouldn't be used as a straight up means of ferrying the third group around, since the procerans would get an advance warning on that. I still hope for transplanting a shard of Arcadia as an opening move, though.

    in my head Callow is fantasy France. good wine, heavy use of Knights,  that might be a reason.

    and now i come to realize that if Callow is fantasy France, Cat is Fantasy Jeanne d'Arc

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      Nah, officially southern Procer is fantasy France, hence the French names (eg the Principate of Aequitan is obviously based on Aquitaine) and the language ("Chantant" being french for "While singing").

      I guess Callow would be more like Poland?

      - u/panchoadrenalina:
        ```
        there are official real life counterparts? ohhh i want to know.

        daoine is Walles or England (longows), Procer is he HRE (plus france), the free cities italy? the thalasocracy must be either Athens (the original thalasocracy) or venice. Praes must be Al'Andalus or the north african coast plus rome

        - u/Ardvarkeating101:
          ```
          Rome was the Miezans, who lost to Carthage this time, and Praes is built on what used to be Rome.

    I am ridiculously pleased by the use of classical/early medieval titles. E.g. Basileus: king/emperor in Greek, used by the Byzantine Empire. Strategos: general in Greek.

      And Tyrant for Helike is a nice touch. Tyrant in the Greek sense (and the modern one too) is a rare occurrence.

        Hey, NotACauldronAgent, just a quick heads-up:  
        **occurance** is actually spelled **occurrence**. You can remember it by **two cs, two rs, -ence not -ance**.  
        Have a nice day!

  A war of attrition, huh? How very Winter-like of Catherine, making her enemies feel the bite of hunger. 

  This seems like a first part of a plan. Princess Malanza is not an idiot, as soon as she realizes what's happening she'll consolidate her host and march straight to Harrow, where Callow will have to meet her on the field or yield a key objective. 

  I'm guessing Cat has a couple more cards up her sleeve. Maybe she'll move Harrow into Arcadia? Or immobilize the host by killing the commanding officers using the Watch? I'm not sure either would work with Heroes around.

    > She'll consolidate her host and march straight to Harrow, where Callow will have to meet her on the field or yield a key objective.

    Did you mean Hedges? Sitting in Harrow does shorten the supply train and safeguards heroes from fighting the Woe until the demon is gone, but backtracking doesn't do anything to avoid attrition in the longer term.

    Watch “don’t need to be trusted, just need to be there.” They are more likely a distraction than not. My guess is that she's trying to bait out the heroes separately from the army that can't catch up with them. Then again, Cat has only two combat-capable Named in her host right now: herself and Masego. Still not sure why she's keeping Hakram away.

    Maybe Archer could catch up too, but then why send the raider cohort separately from the main force? Until she described the aftermath of Nauk's deployment, I thought they would be the ones with the task of harassing the supply line. Evidently they have another target, but I have no idea which one.
    ```

    - u/haiku_fornification:
      ```
      I did mean Hedges, thanks. 

      It's hard to see how this tactic on its own could result in victory. Attrition warfare is all well and good but Cat would need a lot more time to whittle down the enemy army to something manageable. 

      That's why I think she has several other plans that she'll pull out when appropriate - Archer is probably one such plan, as you say. I'm confused about Hakram too. You would think now would be the time to pull him back into the army.
