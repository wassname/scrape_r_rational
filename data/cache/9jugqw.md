Specifically, what have you learnt about what works and doesn't work in a story?

  This seems like a general question that probably calls for a brief response, and I'm going to give a very specific answer that takes the form of a not-so-brief response.

  I've waited a long time for a story to make me feel the same way I felt the first time I read Mother of Learning.  I've had few reading experiences that match the feeling of excitement and giddiness that I felt when plowing through those opening chapters, and I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out what made the opening act of Mother of Learning so enchanting.  I think a lot of it comes down to the fact that Zorian (and the reader along with him) gets to have his cake and eat it, too.

  The cliche "You can't have your cake and eat it too," refers to the fact that when you *have* cake in your possession, you can enjoy the anticipation of eating it, and if you *eat* the cake, then you can enjoy the pleasure of consuming it, but these two are mutually exclusive: consuming the cake removes your ability to anticipate its future consumption.

  In the context of a story, anticipation usually takes the form of, "The author has established a possibility space, where one of several possible things could happen.  I wonder what awesome thing is going to happen!"  (For example, "I wonder how the hero is going to defeat the villain!" or "I wonder if these two characters are going to fall in love!" or "I wonder what's on the other side of that door!")  A lot of the fun of fiction comes from the author setting up a possibility space, and then giving the reader room to speculate about all the possibilities.  But ultimately, our questions are answered: the character identifies a strategy for defeating the villain, chooses a love interest, or finds out what's on the other side of that door.  And while we're kind of happy to see the hero defeat the villain, there's a part of us that misses the time when we were left to theorize about how the hero was going to pull it off.  Ideally, we're satisfied enough with the outcome that we forgive the author for closing off all the other possibility space.  (And pretty much any time that people complain about something being a "disappointment" or "wasted potential," it's because the author delivered an outcome that took away our ability to speculate without delivering something sufficiently satisfying.)  But every time we reach an "outcome," we're leaving the possibility space behind.  The moment Protag-kun chooses who to spend his Valentine's Day with, all other possible futures are closed off forever.

  The usual solution to the problem of "can't have cake and eat it, too," is to have multiple cakes, so while you're eating the carrot cake at your local diner, you can also anticipate your future consumption of the chocolate cake that you have at home.  A good story feels like being led on a non-stop cake-eating tour, where by the time you've finished the last bite of the chocolate cake the author has already filled you with anticipation for the coconut cream cake that is waiting only a block away, with the promise that the next cake will be even better than the last (and if they're consistently delivering on the promise, "you thought that cake was good, trust me, the next one will be even better," then the sense of anticipation will remain high throughout the process and you'll be drowning in a euphoric mess by the end).  Still, the limitation exists that every time you eat a cake, you're sacrificing the joy of anticipation for the joy of tasting it.  No matter how good the next cake is, once you've eaten that coconut cream cake, you don't get to anticipate it anymore.

  Unless you have a time machine.  Then you can go back to before you ate the coconut cream cake, and you never have to stop anticipating it, even after you've enjoyed eating it.

  The beauty of a time loop story is that you get to deliver story outcomes while leaving the possibility space intact.  Every time Zorian is presented with a choice (even if it's as seemingly humdrum as "which of my classmates am I going to spend time with today"), we're left to speculate about all the possibilities.  And then Zorian makes a decision, but *we still get to speculate about all the other possibilities* because he might come back to them later.  It also doesn't hurt that all of the possibilities are interesting and fun in and of themselves.

  That's a big part of what makes time loop stories interesting, but I think you can generalize it to other types of stories that don't involve time travel.  Time loops are a way to move the story forward and having characters make decisions without closing off a possibility space, but I think you can do this with other types of decisions as well.

  For example, one of the parts I found enchanting about Mother of Learning actually had little to do with the time loop itself and more the fact that Zorian has years to work on developing his skills.  Every time Zorian goes to the library, the possibility space is wide open.  What book is he going to read?  What skill is he going to learn?  The library is full of thousands of books, but he can only read one at a time.  But when he chooses a book to pick up off the shelf and read it, he isn't actually closing the possibilty space: all of the other books remain on the shelf, waiting to be read.  In Zorian's case, he gets to read lots of books and have "magical studies" as a possibility space that remains wide open for the entire duration of the story, but you could achieve this without a time loop just by telling a story that takes place over many years, where the protagonist repeatedly gets to come back to the question of, "which skill do I want to master today?"

  I think this is actually a big part of the appeal of harem stories: choosing one romantic interest means "rejecting" all other potentially interested suitors, considerably narrowing the possibility space.  So, in order to maintain the widest possibility space, the main character never chooses a single love interest.  By remaining perpetually single, the protagonist maintains a status quo where *anything* is possible and *no* love interest is off the table.  This works up until the point when the reader realizes that by committing to perpetual indecision, the author is actually telling a story where *nothing* is really possible and nothing can really happen, because everything is done in service of the status quo, at which point readers may become frustrated and stop reading.  A solution to this might be replacing an indecisive protagonist with one who is a serial monogamist: Even if Alice begins dating Bob, there's always a possibility that she might break up with him and start dating Charlie in the future.  This provides all of the Alice-Charlie shippers in the audience with a reason to keep reading through the Alice-Bob arc, but more critically, it provides the people who were interested both by the AB and AC possibility the potential to see both of those spaces explored.  And any time a Dave, Edward, or Frank enters the picture, our minds can run rampant with speculation about what Alice's future might hold with respect to those characters.  (Incidentally, the whole "team Edward versus team Jacob" thing was entirely about a possibility space where both Edward and Jacob were viable romantic interests.  In creating romantic ambiguity, Stephenie Meyer gave her readers room to speculate, and speculate they did.  There's little doubt in my mind that this was a deliberate choice on her part.)

  Not every possibility space is like this.  When the possibility space is "what is our hero going to do about that sword that's swinging toward her face?" we might immediately get to the part where she raises his shield to deflect the blow before we even begin to consider the other possibilities.  And in that case, we're usually perfectly happy to abandon that possibility space, because simply seeing our hero deflect the blow is probably going to be more interesting than reading paragraphs about all of the options available to her before she finally settles on raising her shield as the proper response.  But sometimes the possibility space is, "What would I do if I were a kid attending wizard school?"  That possibility space is a veritable playground.  Be conscious of when you're creating a possibility space that people are going to enjoy spending time in.  If you have the world's greatest playground, you want to let people play around in it for as long as possible.  If the possibility space is broad enough, you can extend it for the entire duration of the story.  (For example, if the possibility space is "I wonder what's going to happen at wizard school," and the entire story is set in wizard school, then you never have to leave the possibility space.)

  To give a concrete example of how I have tried to implement this in my own writing, in the first chapter of [Re:Dragonize](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/re-dragonize-original-litrpg.46226/), the protagonist is faced with a choice, with several explicit options laid out for him, and he contemplates each possibility.  I wanted to set up that choice as a fun possibility space: protag has three options, what are the implications of each option?  He eventually arrives at a decision (and faces the consequences), but even though the opening explores one possible outcome, I wanted to make the question interesting enough that people would want to speculate about what the other outcomes could have been.  I was curious as to whether readers would agree with me that this was an interesting possibility space to explore.  Indeed, many early comments took the form of people asking, "What would have happened if he had chose Y or Z instead?"  I was delighted when I read these comments, because it let me know that I had achieved exactly what I had intended.

    An addendum that was too long to fit into the body of the above post due to reddit's character limit:

    All of the above discussion (focused on how to continue dwelling in a fun possibility space) kind of skips past a more significant topic, which is how to create a fun possibility space in the first place.  The main reason I've skipped past this is that an interesting possibility space is usually defined by the characters, setting, and plot that make it up, and advice like "write a story that has compelling characters, setting, and plot" falls squarely into the realm of advice that is so obvious as to be completely useless.  But I think we can break it down a little bit more by looking at the symptoms of the most successful possibility spaces.  You know that you have an interesting possibility space that fans enjoy spending time in when they go online to discuss the story and post theories about what will happen next.  Arguably, the entire point of fanfiction is to play around in the possibility space that the author left unexplored, allowing fans to realize all of the adventures that could have taken place at Hogwarts, or all of the romances that could have sprung up between the characters of their favorite story.

    Using "fan engagement" as a reasonable proxy for "how fun the possibility space is to explore," one thing becomes immediately obvious: almost all of it is speculative fiction.  The top categories on FF.net are Harry Potter, Twilight, Percy Jackson, Lord of the Rings, and Hunger Games.  Note that this isn't just a "popular books" category: lots of people read The Da Vinci Code and The Fault in Our Stars, but these books have proportionally less fanfiction.  Dan Brown is more popular than Brandon Sanderson, but /r/brandonsanderson has 18,000 readers while /r/danbrown is in the triple digits.  Based on this, it seems like stories that are focused on a *setting* (most speculative fiction, particularly stories with rich worldbuilding like Harry Potter and Mistborn) get a lot of mileage out of their possibility space, whereas it's much less a focus for stories that are centered on plot (page-turners by Dan Brown and Clive Cussler).  Plot-centered stories are more in the business of posing a question and then immediately answering it several pages later, rather than asking open-ended questions that the reader carries with them.   When people read a Dirk Pitt novel, they care about Dirk Pitt for about as long as they're reading the book, and then promptly forget about him until they pick up the next book.  But when it comes to Harry Potter, people don't just want to read about Hogwarts; they want to fantasize about it.  They spend time dwelling on the work even when they're not actively reading it.

      ...Is the best explanation I’ve ever read of why any sufficiently continued romance story must become polyamory in the end, and anime Indecision Harems are not sustainable.  Since modern authors have not widely realized this, most romance stories are at most one book.  Conversely, Laurell Hamilton uses a mix of polyamory and serial monogamy to continue indefinitely without the harem becoming unmanageably large, or the possibility space closing down.

        I think this is an issue that becomes most apparent when looking at anime that are adapted from visual novels.

        In a visual novel, the player is given a choice of romantic interests, and the game is designed so that the player chooses a single love interest to (monogamously) pursue.  After they've reached the end of the arc and successfully "romanced" a love interest, they restart the game and can make a different choice.  The *protagonist* gets to pledge eternal fidelity to a single person, but the *player* is a serial monogamist who gets to romance everyone (assuming they choose to play the game more than once).  (There have been several games that play with this meta-level contradiction between protagonist and player, most prominently Doki Doki Literature Club, which shares a lot of similarities with Kimi to Kanojo to Kanojo no Koi.)

        Trying to adapt this kind of visual novel into an anime is often how you end up with the "love polygon held in equilibrium by the protagonist's indecision," existing solely on romantic tension with no actual payoff.

        There is another (rarer) way some anime handle this, which is the "omnibus format," pioneered by Amagami SS. The way that people typically play visual novels is to play the game multiple times, pursuing a different romantic interest each time.  You can do this in the form of an anime: have a 4-episode arc where the protagonist chooses a single romantic interest to pursue.  The arc ends with the two declaring their love for each other.  And, with that "route" concluded, we hit the reset button and warp back to the beginning to tell a *different* 4-episode arc where the protagonist chooses a *different* romantic interest, the two fall in love and declare their love, before we wipe the slate clean *again* with yet another romantic prospect. Repeat for the duration of your 24-episode broadcast.  This follows a similar structure to a "time loop," except the whole "wipe the slate and start over again" isn't actually part of the fiction; it's part of the meta-structure of the show. A 24-episode broadcast gives you room for 6 discrete romance arcs, all of which begin from the same starting point but which are mutually exclusive and share no continuity.

        Clannad sort of splits the difference; it remains romantically ambiguous for as long as possible before finally allowing protag-kun to pick a canonical heroine, but there are several OVAs titled "Another World" which explore alternate stories in which he ended up with one of the other girls.

  I think I've learned this more from fan fiction in general than rational fiction specifically, but it continues to apply to works recommended here. There are at least *five* different skills that I might classify as "writing" when it comes to story quality. These seem completely distinct: success or failure in any one does not necessarily guarantees the same for any other.

  1. Basic composition - Spelling, grammar, a consistent tone and style.
  2. Engaging prose - Use of vocabulary, quality of description, efficiency with words, clarity of action.
  3. Engaging characters - Dialogue, expression, consistency of personality, believable behavior.
  4. Engaging plot - Timing of story beats, well-placed exposition, clever twists and resolutions.
  5. Theme and Meaning - Does the story make me think? Is it worth reflection?

  These are essentially in order. At the top of the list are qualities which, if they're missing, will make me drop a story fast. When a work has an excellent grasp of four and five with major flaws in the first three, people who recommend it have to ask that we "Don't give up on this one."

  At the bottom are qualities which, if they're still missing many chapters in, leave me feeling empty and disappointed. Sometimes I'll start a story with excellent skill in the first three and immediately say, "How have I never heard of this author?" Usually it's because there's weakness in four and five.

  In both cases, that seems to imply that *tolerance* for fiction and *first-impressions* of authors is based on narrow technical aspects, but *love* for fiction and *loyalty* to authors is based on the strength of their storytelling.

  For me it had been a difference that has become more concrete in my own mind after reading a lot of rational fiction.

  The idea that you have to provide the same tools that are available to the protagonist to your audience. This, to me, is one of the tenets of rational fiction, and it can also be a very powerful tool for creating tension in stories that are not necessarily rational but are just trying to be either unique or "good".

  Weirdly, or maybe appropriately, it is very much like a good mystery novel or show. And by becoming more aware of this; I've also found myself seeing flaws in other stories where I didn't before.

  I think an example (at least to me) is the Sherlock show on BBC. It does a very poor job of being rational, and, for me, good because it fails to equip its audience with the same tools as the protagonist. 

  Sherlock, especially in later seasons, tends to "figure out" plots and plans by theoretically real applications of his senses and science, but those applications and those abilities are not previously revealed to the audience nor is the evidence that is being collected by those abilities. 

  Therefore no one who is watching Sherlock can "solve" the mystery before the show reveals it. 

  Properly setting up and allowing the reader to experience those tools and is something I've been trying to do in my own stories so that 1. they can feel more rational (although I don't know if I would categorize my stories as rational fiction) and 2. so that increases in skill and power are grounded in whatever reality that the world I'm telling the story is in.

  Little late on this, but I think that from rational fiction in specific, I've learned that people have a *much* higher toleration for exposition than most give them credit for. I know MoL isn't for everyone, but even then, even if you only inserted a quarter of the exposition MoL is belting out constantly, you'd still have a story with four times as much exposition as the average. I think the difference between MoL and other stories isn't that it's desensitized us to it, it's that the author has mastered the quality of delivering information in an entertaining and *plain* way. Having read it, I feel like the hate against exposition dumps in stories is a little unfounded. At the very least, it could serve as a moderator for constant, non-stop action.
