  There ought to have been a chapter in India here, but it just isn't coming together. Hopefully I'll have it figured out by Friday. 

  It's funny how much of an effect a small change can have. I didn't expect for the cards to start getting laid down on the table so quickly in this story, but one thing led to another and here we are. 

  There's still a lot to be revealed, though.

  I have a bad feeling about Simon trusting Akvo.
