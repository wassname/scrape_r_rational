**Synopsis**

What if you really were transported to a fantasy world and expected to kill monsters to survive? No special abilities, no OP weapons, no status screen to boost your stats and no cheat mode. Never mind finding the dragon’s treasure or defeating the Demon Lord, you only need to worry about one thing—how to stay alive.

A group of young Brits wake up in a strange, fantastical land with creatures from myth and legend. They are given archaic weapons they don't know how to use and told to do their best.

Convinced it has to be some kind of virtual reality RPG, all the people summoned form parties and set off on their adventures, leaving behind the people nobody wants in their group.

Story of my life, thinks Colin.

  Been following for a while; I love your story. Book 5 was really interesting. [](#s "You found a way to make the Groundhog day-esque time travel trope really interesting and unique. That's impressive!")
