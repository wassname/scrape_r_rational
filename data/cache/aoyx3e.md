  Maybe I'm not understanding something, but the FAQ talks about Brick Nozick as if it's something well-understood and a common meme. A google search for "Brick Nozick" yields nothing except the FAQ themselves (except a review of Anarchy, State, and Utopia by Robert Nozick, which I'm assuming is irrelevant but could be some weird inside joke thing). Anyone have any ideas if this is a weird clue or something?

    I would have to guess that it's a weird clue, because I looked up the same thing when I read it, and I came back to ask about it. "brick nozick meme" and "brick nozick font" don't bring up anything, so...? The only thing I can think about is reading Anarchy, State, and Utopia and then only having it pay off in a couple of months (making it a brick joke)

      Hmm. I have an idea.

      u/teddy_teddy_teddy, we're not sure what Brick Nozick is: we know neither the nature of this meme, nor its origins. You have previously stated that questions about Brick Nozick upset you. Consider the following:

      * If you will continue to not answer these questions, it will only lead to more questions of this nature in the future, as new readers come in and start asking what "Brick Nozick" is, and as old readers continue to *speculate* what it is, trying to find clues in the story.

      * If you will answer *one* of these questions — for example, this one — the readers' curiosity will be mostly satiated, people will link to your explanation whenever someone starts asking what it is, and I personally would assist in convincing other people to stop making jokes regarding Brick Nozick.

      * Even in the edge-case where "What is Brick Nozick?" is part of the Brick Nozick meme — which, I repeat, we honestly do not know, a possibility you must at least consider — answering our question will only decrease the amount of future Brick Nozick jokes, as memers become satisfied or possibly stop pestering you directly and start joking among each other.

      As such, I would like you to post a reply to this comment, with the following properties:

      1. It contains an explanation regarding what you believe Brick Nozick to be, such that it would give us as thorough an understanding of this concept as you yourself possess.

      2. The reply is posted within the next 168 hours.

      3. The reply won't be deleted or modified after being posted.

      To motivate you further:

      If you will not comply with this request, I will be asking you to switch the site to Brick Nozick every 1D6 weeks. Neither of us wants that.

    You know, your serial is at the point where I can't even trust that I can't put anything past you. There is the distinct possibility that you've already logged into an alt and participating in discussions, and the chance that you're going to in the future is practically guaranteed. (It's a good thing)

    There's definitely a clue in using akst, I've never heard of it before and I imagine most people haven't. Expecting people to Google and time difference when most people would just use utc/gmt which everyone knows seems suspicious to me

  They should have one strike rules, two strike rules, three strike rules and guidelines. It's silly to state in every rule that's not a sludge. They should have categories. Guidelines are things there is no penalty for breaking.
