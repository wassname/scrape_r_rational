## Rationality in the Libriomancer series?

### Post:

So I just came across a new fantasy series called Magic Ex Libris.
The main character in the series is a Libriomancer; basically a special type of magician that can extract objects from books.  The main character can reach into a book and pull out any object that can fit through the pages.  This works with both fictional books and nonfictional books.

I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the series was relatively thought out.  The main character mostly uses his Libriomancy abilities in a rational way.  He can't really exploit the magic system completely because there is a magical society called the Porters that  stomps down on anyone trying to make too many waves with their powers.  Anyone who tries to break the masquerade is ruthlessly put down.  The main function of the Porters is to research magic and to deal with the other magical species in the world.

Some constraints on the power includes:

1) You can't just take out whatever object you want from a book.  The object has to fit through the pages of the book.  

2) The power of the object being pulled out is limited to how prolific the book is.  Books gain their power from all of the people who have ever read the book.  When you extract an object from a book you are really pulling on the collective power and belief of all of the people who have also read that book.  You can't pull out a reality warping wand from a book that only has ever had a few thousand readers.  The more popular the book is the more powerful objects you can successfully pull out.

3) If a book is extracted from too much it will "char".  Charred books are unusable until the collective power that fuels the book's magic is replenished.  Especially if the same object is pulled out too much.

4) You cannot extract a living mind from a book.  They become insane and non responsive when they transition to the real world.

5) Most of the books with the really powerful objects are locked by the Porters.  Objects that can cause extinction level events and give out things like immortality are locked down so no one else can access them.

6) If you obsess over a book too much you can end up being possessed by its fictional characters.

7) You can do magic or be magic.  Any effect or object that strips away your humanity rids you of your libriomancy powers.  This is unclear though because you can use libriomancy to give yourself supernatural attributes or powers.  For example the founder of the Porters (Gutenberg himself) gained immortality by extracting the Holy Grail from the Bible.

So if you found yourself in this setting how would you react?  Keep in mind that most of the obviously powerful artifacts are locked down by the Porters.  If you try to start some sort of magical singularity the Porters are gonna step in.

I'm reading the second book right now and it's pretty decent.  If you're interested in the magic system you should give the series a try!

  I'd check to see if White Wolf's RPG books are locked.  If not, then you can replicate damn near anything converting Libriomancy to Mage.  If that didn't work, I'd try an Iron Man comic for an arc reactor and Extremis armor.

  Otherwise, I'd probably become a Twilight vampire.  Sanguinarius Meyerii seems to have the best bang for your buck in the entire series, plus immortality without a whole lot of side effects.

  I wonder if the Porters have discovered fanfiction.net.

    Libriomancy is, in-setting, a cheatsy style of magic wizards who can't summon enough power to cast 'Wingardium Leviosa' do. It relies on the power of belief and the human collective to do all the actual 'magic' stuff, and 99.99% of Libriomancers don't have the magical strength or mindset for trying something like that(Most can't conceive how a 'computer' or 'ebook' is like a 'real' book at all, much less how they could possibly work the same way).

  Idea 1:
  Find a book about a world with a larger literate population than Earth's, then pull books out of that book to pull better things out of.

  Idea 2:
  Write a book that the porters don't mind, and whose contents the worlds population at large would like to exist. One might, for example, write a story about a utopian society producing artifacts like "a book with cures to all known diseases", "an object that allows the user to permanently emigrate to their own alternate reality in which they are omnipotent" (yay for escapism!), etc.. Advertise it to everyone as a means to get Libromancers to bring the utopia to Earth so they'll read it to power it.

  Yeah, the protagonist was a macho douche, and the story was told in first person, so it kind of ruined the whole thing for me.

  What happens if you know an author - or are an author - an you know that that innocuous machine we briefly see in book 1 doing one thing can also do something else that we see in book 2. If I pull from book 1 before book 2 is published, does the thing act like the author knows it does, or like the readers think it does.
  ```

  - u/okaycat:
    ```
    There's no definite answer.  I think that the object will act like the readers think it does since Libriomancy works by harnessing the collective beliefs of the readers.
    ```

- u/zypher106:
  ```
  Is there any rule that says you can't get an extremely large version of the book in order to pull out larger objects? Also, How wide range is rule 4? Would it be possible to extract a deactivated AI or a non sentient program that is programed to become sentient once activated. What about non sentient or shackled AIs?
  ```

  - u/okaycat:
    ```
    That was actually addressed in the first book.  You can't just make a giant version of the book to pull out larger objects.   Your book has to be the same size as the the one the readers use.

    For your second point no one really knows.  The more complex and advanced the mind is the more damage it suffers.  There is a dryad character in the series who came from the book, but transfered over as a seed instead of as a fully formed being.
    ```

    - u/MugaSofer:
      ```
      Aha! Pull through something that *makes* AIs, then!
      ```

  I think that a standout objects is the watch from "The Girl, The Gold Watch, and Everything" from John D. Macdonald. He was well known enough that the book could be quite powerful, but not known for his scifi enough to attract attention to seal it away. The watch itself is essentially portable, unlimited *time stop* with the only real limitation being you keep aging - basically, the watch accelerates you / slows the rest of the universe down enough that you are effectively unstoppable and untouchable. It would probably at the very least be pretty good to keep you alive and functional while you experimented with other stuff. Colonel Kassad in Hyperion used a weird arbitrary quicksilver blob that spread across his entire skin to make armor that had a similar temporal effect, but I wouldn't be as confident in drawing it through even the hardcover edition of Hyperion.

  There is a probably dead Worm/Libriomancer crossover fic [here](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/bookworm-worm-libriomancer.287867/)

    OH MY GOD it's Dio's Stand in a watch.

  Step one: Try to pull Nell's Primer from Neal Stephenson's Diamond Age. Given that it sounds like objects would work how readers expect them to, I think it might continue to operate even without the dedicated ractor behind it, and the rod logic ai should be able to teach me how to build my own nanoassemblers.

  Step two (if step one fails): Try to acquire any magical items from any major non-cthulhu based rpg books/systems, starting with those most able to prevent death and/or defy physics. 

  Step three: Experiment to determine what relative power level of objects is restricted by the Tyranny of Guttenberg, as well as the consistency of that system. 

  Does it rely on the guardians being aware of it? 

  Do they have some sort of magic power sensor? Something else entirely?

  Exploit this if possible/necessary. If it's possible to gain root access to my book magic to bypass the magical censors, then attempt that with either of #1/2.

  Step four: Do fame-based experiments with custom written books, involving objects from power levels such as "a ball of lint" up to "cheap, safe, easily duplicated immortality serum" and everything in between. Pay people to read the book, and then attempt to take out various objects. Pay Scalzi to write the same story in their own literary style (by offering free use of my powers to him as well), then find the worst possible author I can online, and similarly commission them for the same work. Run the tests again to determine if writing ability or the enjoyment of the story increases the power any.

    Or just pull the Manual from *So You Want to be a Wizard*.  Bam, a tell-all reference text on the inner workings of the universe.

      Can non wizards read that? I'd want to avoid becoming a magical creature and losing bibliomancy until I verified that one was strictly better than the other. This doesn't sound like it requires much effort on my part, while sywtbaw has a lot more restrictions. 

      Still probably useful though.

- u/Seeworthy121:
  ```
  Are there hard limits on what is considered a book? Word count? Page length? If I could get away with newspapers... A new book with decent power every morning, without a Porter Lock. Then just slip in a story with rumors of a Porter Key.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I'd probably go for a power ring. Some of them are not entirely dependent on large power generators.
  ```

  - u/Kishoto:
    ```
    Makes me curious though, you think comic books count for this? Cuz if so, we totally have to shift perspective here.
    ```

- u/protagnostic:
  ```
  How did Gutenberg get the Holy Grail out of the Bible? It wasn't in the Bible.

  It stretches credibility to imagine that the porters could keep track of ALL powerful objects in books. Here are a few that seem useful:

  His Dark Materials -> The Subtle Knife

  Marvel comics -> Cosmic Cube

  1001 Nights -> Aladdin's lamp. Or failing that his ring.

  Sylvester and the Magic Pebble -> ...the pebble. I barely remember this book, but many many children read it.

  D&D manuals -> Ring of Three Wishes

  DC Comics -> Helm of Nabu

  The Dark Is Rising -> The Book of Gramarye

  The Once and Future King -> Excalibur is probably locked down, but its scabbard probably isn't, and the scabbard is what actually conveyed invulnerability.

  Failing all that, I'll take the syringe of venom from Twilight.

  HP is presumably a bust, it'll be locked down tighter than a [REDACTED].

  Oh man. Libriomancer was so bro-y. I couldn't deal.
  ```

  - u/okaycat:
    ```
    What do you mean by "broy"?
    I liked it mostly for the unique magic system and the worldbuilding.  Its basically tailered to bookworms haha.
    But I found the main protoganist to be sort of obnoxious and annoying.  Especially whenever he tried to act all tough and macho.
    ```

    - u/Escapement:
      ```
      I think he meant 'bro - y', that is to say having qualities consistent with 'bro' culture or beliefs (probably sexist?).

      I *think* this might be referencing the sort of somewhat fucked up stuff with the one female character and the fairly fucked up relationship and attitudes the main character expressed towards her, but I read the book sufficiently long ago that I don't recall details and am unsure - frankly I never cared much about the book series.

        Goddamnit.  I was really hyped to go read this series until this bit.
        ```

        Yeah the whole plot with the dryad was creepy and sort of ridiculous.
        ```

- u/MugaSofer:
  ```
  The trouble with this is that we have to outsmart the Porters, and I don't know how good they are. Are the Culture books locked? Superhero comics? Harry Potter? Isaac Azimov?
  ```

  - u/FFsummons:
    ```
    Libriomancy doesn't work on comics.
    ```

- u/Evilness42:
  ```
  First of all, I would probably pay a writer to do something with mind uploading devices, AIs, incredible supercomputers, and souls. And also tell them to put in fabricators that can fit through pages too. In fact, why not all in one!?! I'll have to keep the book obscure, but that shouldn't be *too* hard. 

  I would probably do some SCIENCE on the subject of the whole 'living beings' rule first though, because of the stuff that happened in the book involving that rule(Explaining this would be a First Episode Spoiler, so yeah), because of the fact that my main plan would probably qualify me as a 'magical being' or get stomped on *hard* if someone found it.
  ```

  - u/Izeinwinter:
    ```
    Obscurity doesn't work - the magic of the setting runs on a Renown/belief system - In order for major items to work, they have to be popular. Which means.. Uhm.. The best stuff from the Culture is almost all sapient, and you can't conjure people..
    ```

    - u/Evilness42:
      ```
      No, my 'obscurity' method was a reference to something that happened in one of the books. As in, someone actually pulled it off, so I would try and imitate their methods. Without certain problems that occurred, of course, but I've already outlined what I hope would be a solution. Saying anything more about this would be spoilers for one of the books, I don't remember which.
      ```
