  This is it, folks!  The End.  Finito.  The Final Countdown has reached T=0.  We're done, it's over, tata, thanks for all the fish.

  ...and before you freak out, the next book will be starting next week, in the same storyline.  :>

      Heh.  Thank you.  *bow*

  This was what I'd predicted, but I'm surprised Arros suggested it. When he began the trial by combat speech I thought he was going to challenge the empty portfolio or something, and take it. 

  Taking the portfolio of death doesn't necessarily seem as though it would be great for Suze though. A massive power boost, of course, but if gods are shaped by their worshippers and Suze takes Neklos' position, his worship may carry onto her, and make her evil.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    I suspect that there are different ways for Death to be a god. Neklos was the old "harvester of souls", "creator of undead" type of dude, but it's possible that Suze could be "angel of mercy", "guardian of souls", "watcher of those who are done with life".
    ```

      Why am I imagining Suze as Madoka now?

        Hm.  Maybe, but I don't think so.  Suze is older, doesn't look like that, doesn't always think of friends first, etc.

        It boggles me that they defined a blood type for an anime character.

          >Every Japanese celebrity writeup and every anime character description with any claim to authority gives the person's (or character's) blood type. Why? Because, thanks to a remarkable bit of Science! by a gentleman named Furukawa Takeji, many Japanese believe that a person's blood type affects their personality.

          It's actually extremely common to give their blood type because of this.

          While on the subject of madoka I would like to recommend [To the stars](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7406866/1/To-the-Stars) a pretty good rationalist fanfiction that is written as a sequel to the puella magi Madoka series. Though I highly suggest watching the original series first as it is an amazing show and deconstruction of the magical girl theme.

            It's been a while since that's been posted … hint hint wink wink …

        - u/scooterboo2:
          ```
          Oh, I'll explain. At the very end of the series Madoka wishes for [](#s "all magical girls, when they die, turn not into monsters, but to go into some sort of nebulous afterlife, lead by Madoka. This ends up rewriting the entire universe and history with madoka as some sort of god that meets magical girls when they die. Her theme ends up whiteish silver with a hint of pink. This happens on the last episode of madoka magica.")
          ```

          - u/ArisKatsaris:
            ```
            I wouldn't say that that's really a good description of her wish, more of a description of the consequences of her wish.
            ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Well, that was awesome.

  "Your gods and your bullshit power trips!" - confirmed: POPE gives **negative** wisdom bonuses.

  Also, Jake said that it was he who incapacitated Neklos, but then Arros says that it was Suze!
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Shouldn't Arros have just known anyway? Wouldn't having the Magic domain give him a protfolio sense every time someone casts a spell (like, say, *Plane Shift* or *Polymorph Any Object*)? Even if he didn't notice it at the time, portfolio sense extends into the past, so if he *can* detect when a spell is cast, he could figure out it was her after the fact.
    ```

    - u/Lugnut1206:
      ```
      Easy, god of magic would know that Jake has no spells.
      ```

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      /u/ShareDVI:  Jake lied to protect Suze

      /u/alexanderwales and /u/Lugnut1206:  you are both correct
      ```

- u/FeepingCreature:
  ```
  I wonder how much physics/rules bullshit Jake has to pull out of his hat/how well-known he has to be for this before he becomes a God of Science/Munchkin. (Same thing, really.)

  Might not be achievable in two years, of course.

  [edit] Nevermind! Loki is already God of Munchkin.

        The most powerful guy here is still Jake. God of death is his personal assistant.

        Ah, good. I was afraid you meant "this does not live up to the hype."  :>
