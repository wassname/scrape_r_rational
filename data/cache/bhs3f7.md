  If you have an AO3 account, you can 'subscribe' to a work to get an e-mail when it updates. This is not what you're asking for, but depending on your intended use might be helpful.

  For my WTC updates, I usually either see get discord notification from AlexanderWales' discord, or see it here on /r/rational.

  The way I deal is just use r/rational as a RSS feed, just add .RSS to the url and Bam, RSS feed. It is useful for MoL (though RR has a RSS feed for it now), PGTE, and WtC, so it works for me.

    Does this work because reddit specifically supports it?

  I've just figured out how to create a WTC rss feed.

  The rss link is: 

  http://createfeed.wprssaggregator.com/extract.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F11478249%2Fnavigate&amp;in_id_or_class=&amp;url_contains=11478249&amp;order=reverse

  This will show the ten most recent updates.
  ```
