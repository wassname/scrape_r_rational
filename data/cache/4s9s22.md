  Sola, like the Volunteer, was inspired by two separate characters, one well known, the other obscure.  It will be interesting to see who, if anyone, figures out the obscure one.

  Incidentally, for those who remember the Xelian's Oblivion Projector from Skybreaker's Call--Sola was the target they had in mind when they built it.
