  Me 3 hours ago: Blue is being a major asshole and reacting ridiculously to this whole thing.

  Blue: "What he couldn’t forgive was that Red didn’t care for Aiko the way his grandfather cares for him. That he might not care for *Blue* the way Blue cares for him. "

  Me: Nevermind, favorite character, I love you.

  &#x200B;

  Jokes aside, I am so happy this chapter happened and I'm so glad it looks like Blue is finally coming to terms with The Whole Aiko Thing. The match seemed brutally unfair, though, and even though I know logically "Surge set up the challenge this way to teach \*everyone\* a lesson about difficult choices", it kind of feels like "Surge royally fucked over Bretta and Vlad's chances to get a badge just to waggle a finger at Blue and say 'see how it feels??'". Like, they set up a whole building with Voltorb and unleashed a Dragonite on a bunch of kids just so Blue would maybe realize "damn, I've kind of been an ass." At first I thought it was a coincidence but then Sabra straight up says "Yeah, we tried to make this just like the Red and Aiko situation." It seems...mean, to the other trainers. Although I guess this is mostly remedied by Surge's offer to give the two a 1v1 battle the very next day.

  Still, fantastic chapter, and as always I'm excited for the next!
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    So I may have done this too subtly, but I wanted to communicate that this isn't actually what happened by noting first that Surge had shot down Sabra's idea for the last challenge because it would have been too hard, and second that Sabra is specifically not saying "This is a lesson for you," but rather "I want to see how your people deal with situations like this."

    I should probably clarify this more in the chapter, since /u/knickersinaknit and /u/memes_of_production had similar interpretations. Remember that Sabra lost her friend and one of her mentors in the exact same way that Blue lost Aiko. It isn't actually *about* Blue, he's just the person who happens to be involved in both what happened between Jack/Aiko/Red, and the gym's first opportunity to simulate that sort of situation.
    ```

    - u/I_Probably_Think:
      ```
      > "I want to see how your people deal with situations like this."

      I'm actually still pretty curious about this bit. Given what's been stated, what's... *helpful* about finding this out?
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        The basic idea is that preparing people to go through such situations can be really valuable in general. A specific example concerning our protagonists is that if Blue and Red had encountered a scenario like this before what happened, and talked about it, and there was a narrative about how it's okay whatever people choose already in place... their split might not have happened.
        ```

        - u/I_Probably_Think:
          ```
          Sounds pretty reasonable! Maybe it wasn't quite "wanting to see how you deal with these situations" but "wanting to expose you to and familiarize you with these situations"?
          ```

      - u/RynnisOne:
        ```
        In my mind, there's two parts to this.

        The first is directed at Blue in particular, where it translates to "I want to see how you react when your friends are forced to make the same choice Red did and not all of them pick the response you want."

        The second is that this is functionally equivalent to military training, specifically tailored to group cohesion and leadership.  The 'squad', as it were, is being presented with a dilemma.  A dilemma, in military terms, is roughly defined as 'a set of two or more problems to where the correct answer for one results in an incorrect answer for the others, and responding to none of them is the worst option of all'.  The test isn't so much to find out if you can 'beat' it (you can't, that's why its a dilemma), but if you can come to and act on a 'good enough' decision fast enough to suffer the least loss.  How you respond to  both the choice and the resultant loss is the whole point.
        ```

    - u/RynnisOne:
      ```
      Well, it **is** about Blue, insomuch as he is one of the Deuteragonists of the story, and we the audience are reading his saga.  But that's obviously not what you meant. :D

      However, what really makes me happy about this one is that it **directly** addresses Blue's attitude toward Red, and shines a light on the former's hypocrisy--or, at least his foolish attitude toward the situation.  Blue has held this grudge for far too long, and getting to watch not one but \*SIX\* of his 'friends' be forced into making the same choice Red did **might** be enough of a wakeup call.  Especially since a majority of them made the same decision that Red did.
      ```

  - u/KnickersInAKnit:
    ```
    I'd agree with that, it did make the lesson feel rather heavy-handed. I know Blue's one of the main characters, but I feel this chapter really leaned on that point.

    EDIT: after thinking on this a little more, I think the chapter could be improved by keeping those 'sometimes you have to make hard choices and there are no correct answers' lesson in there, but maybe Blue could also have a humbling realization that he wasn't the only one who had to make that choice during the Zapdos attack. I doubt Aiko was the only trainer who perished. I think the understanding that he's not alone in his feelings of rage and disappointment in those who made a save-themselves choice could be a great motivation to share what happened at the chapter's end.
    ```

    - u/Gummysaur:
      ```
      Yeah, I have no problems with the lesson itself, it just seems unrealistically centered on Blue. Instead of Sabra being like "yep, we set this all up just so you, specifically, could realize this lesson", I expected it to be the opposite; Blue saying something like "was this all just to teach me something?" and Sabra is like "what? no. you think you're that important? We just wanted to instill this valuable lesson in every trainer etc etc." That doesn't necessarily need to be the full truth--After all, Sabra has the most motive to set up the scenario this way, because she saw the effect Aiko's death had on Red--but I think her saying it out loud is a bit tell-don't-show. Blue realizing it on his own seems more natural. He's a smart guy, after all.
      ```

      - u/JanusTheDoorman:
        ```
        Eh, given the structure of the Poke-verse and the relative importance of the few strongest trainers in any given region, if Surge thinks that Blue is genuinely likely to be a Champion and a charismatic one at that... it's not entirely unreasonable to try and make sure he doesn't turn out to be a do-or-die heroism zealot who demands complete personal sacrifice from everyone he works with.
        ```

      - u/Chemstdnt:
        ```
        Wasn't the man that died with Aiko a close old friend of Sabra. That would make it personal and explain her drinking problems and obsesion with what happened.
        ```

        - u/Roneitis:
          ```
          We saw her have /one/ drink, in a party setting, where she was pretty jovial. (Unless there are other references to her drinking alot I don't recall....) I would hardly call that a drinking problem.
          ```

  - u/Leemorry:
    ```
    I don’t know how I feel about that.
    Isn’t the irony of Blue’s thought process clear?

    > What he couldn’t forgive was that Red didn’t care for Aiko the way his grandfather cares for him. That he might not care for *Blue* the way Blue cares for him. "

    Blue would rather his grandfather stayed safe, rather than risking his life for him. Blue has no such feelings about Red, he would rather Red walked towards death for him. Doesn’t that unambiguously mean *he* doesn’t care for Red the same way *he* cares about his grandfather?...

    The way I see it, if you decide you prefer somebody died for you, rather than not, well then you don’t love them, do you.

    If you think you would die for somebody, great! The second you demand the reverse, and “can’t forgive” the suspicion that reverse is not true, you overstep. Love is a gift freely given, no strings attached, otherwise it’s something else.

    Aren’t good guys supposed to make sure friends don’t follow them off cliffs? I am just coming down from watching Fullmetal Alchemist, and the show is chock-full of people telling their loved ones to not die for them, on hopeless odds. 
    Blue himself does exactly that, but only for his grandfather.  
    [SPOILERS FOR FMAB] >!spoiler One of the tensest scenes, Roy struggling against the decision, and when he says “All right” you think he broke. When he adds “All right, Lieutenant” and you realize he chose to hear Riza instead, it’s just so powerful.!< I can’t see Alfonse preferring Ed died for him, I can’t see Ling preferring Fu and LanFan, his guards(!) died for him, even though it’s literally in the job description.  

    > What sorts of things he expects of them, to ensure they're not just willing, but aware.

    And to see the fic treat Blue’s position as the noble one instead, I am struggling to accept it.
    ```

    - u/I_Probably_Think:
      ```
      > And to see the fic treat Blue’s position as the noble one instead

      I'm not actually sure that that's the intent, here. To me it looks like we're intentionally being left in the dark about what exactly Blue thinks, to be resolved in one (or more?! D:) months' time...
      ```

      - u/Leemorry:
        ```
        God I hope so. It does end on a bit of a cliffhanger.  
        It’s just that this can’t mean a lot of things, coming as a prologue before telling why he doesn’t speak to Red anymore: 

        > What sorts of things he expects of them, to ensure they're not just willing, but aware.
        ```

        - u/I_Probably_Think:
          ```
          Yeah, that has me worried, too...
          ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      I think it's unfortunate that Blue is using his grandfather as a reference point here, because parents and grandparents often *would* sacrifice themselves for their children, without any expectation of the reverse. It's not supposed to be an equal relationship. And Blue wouldn't really want one of his peers trying to act like a parent to him.
      ```

    - u/Radix2309:
      ```
      I dont think Blue actually wants Red to ealk to his death. He wants Red to be willing to do it like Oak did. He is worried that despite their bond, Red wouldnt risk his life to save him due to his rational logic. Something linked to their previous arguments where Red was too analytical and cold.

      It's not wyat Red actually does, it is the thought that counts.
      ```

      - u/Leemorry:
        ```
        If you want somebody to be willing to do [something], you want them to do [something], it is the same.
        ```

        - u/LordSwedish:
          ```
          Red has shown (in Blue's mind) that he doesn't value their bond as much as Blue does. If someone is willing to put your interests above their own, it means that they care for you regardless of whether you want them to or not. If someone isn't willing to do it, it means they don't care about you as much, also regardless of whether or not you want them to.

          This is what "it is the thought that counts" means. Love isn't necessarily about what someone does, it's about what they're willing to do. If someone doesn't help you because you told them not to, it's very different from someone not helping you because they don't want to.
          ```

          - u/Leemorry:
            ```
            It isn’t about putting Blue’s interests above his own, it’s about dying when there is no hope. But I think you’re right, it’s the thought that counts; however Blue isn’t going to ask him to not do it, as far as I see.   

            He asked his grandfather; he won’t ask Red. Even Blue acknowledges the difference in what his feelings regarding his grandfather are (he handwaves “but it’s different, it doesn’t count” at his thoughts, but he noticed)    

            He wants Red to be willing + he won’t discourage it = it is the same as wanting it, as opposed to actively not wanting it (like heroes usually do when it comes to the people they love; they actively not want them to die trying to save them when the risk is too great) 

            > Love isn't necessarily about what someone does, it's about what they're willing to do.   

            This is about Red, not Blue, correct? I’m purposefully not touching on what Red does/doesn’t feel (we weren’t shown), I’m only unhappy with what Blue’s thoughts seem to tell about what *he* feels and the notion that if you decide you would die for someone even on hopeless odds, they now owe it to you or you get to be angry
            ```

            - u/LordSwedish:
              ```
              I won't deny that Blue isn't thinking completely logically, just that he has a rather good point. He justifies his thinking with the fact that Oak dying isn't just a risk, it's practically a certainty due to the pressure. There is still a bit of hypocrisy but he is right about about that.

              Moreover, Red and Blue are partners. He treats Red differently because they were supposed to fight together against the stormbringers. It's what they agreed on and a bit of a risk to ones life is implied, as opposed to Oak teleporting into a situation that could kill him just from the presence. Blue and Red are supposed to trust each other as battle partners, Red's decision doesn't just make Blue doubt that Red would die for him, it makes him wonder how much of a risk Red would take and how dangerous a situation would have to be before Blue can't rely on him.

              As I said, I don't completely agree with Blue here. I'm also only speaking from Blue's perspective and obviously he doesn't actually know what Red thinks or feels.
              ```

              - u/Leemorry:
                ```
                I guess you have a point, I haven’t thought of implications beyond situations that are like Aiko’s. It wasn’t just “a bit” of a risk then, but maybe that’s not how Blue sees it.   
                Although the lesson Surge taught them is focused exclusively on “certain doom”, and that was on Blue’s mind at the time, his doubts can still be about more than that, I concede my point.
                ```

    - u/JulianWyvern:
      ```
      Frankly, I see different situations in regards to his grandfather and Red. Prof. Oak WILL die if he goes into Pressure again, and if he survives he'll be crippled or whatever it is, everyone is effectively 100% sure of it, whereas with Red it was just a possibility, though we know he'd have died because we have hindsight.
      ```

      - u/Roneitis:
        ```
        Everything is just probabilities, Oak going in has a higher one, and Red had a lower one, but it's still a balance of risk and reward. At some level of risk, the cost is just too high, and you shouldn't do it, even if in hindsight you would have been fine, the right choice was still not to go.
        ```

      - u/MilesSand:
        ```
        That's what they said before the last time he went into the pressure.
        ```

    - u/RynnisOne:
      ```
      He kinda got shown to be a rather large hypocrite here, and is coming to terms with that fact.  He has to accept that not everyone will make the same choices in a life-or-death situation, and that the different responses are not a black mark on the character of the person who makes the choice.
      ```

  - u/LazarusRises:
    ```
    It's pretty clear that Surge is training his gym members for battle against Rocket. I think he wanted them to experience something specifically like what happened with Blue and Red, because that's a scenario that could happen very easily in war and it's important to 1) understand how it makes you feel and 2) not hate your fellow trainers because of the impossible decisions they make.
    ```

    - u/Electric999999:
      ```
      I suspect that's the reason for all the stunfisk too, given the lack of conventional explosives that's probably how minefields work.
      ```

    - u/partner555:
      ```
      I doubt he's preparing them for Rocket *specifically.* I'm pretty sure he just wants people to be prepared for war in general.
      ```

      - u/RynnisOne:
        ```
        I think he knows exactly what is coming.  He may not know its name, but he has much more experience with this sort of thing than most of the civilian politicians.
        ```

  - u/Memes_Of_Production:
    ```
    I agree, this is definitely one of the more "this is book!" moments of the story, where minor characters get shafted for the arc of the main characters. Which isn't a criticism, cause well it is a book! 100% realism is actually a bad goal to have. It's just notable here that it happened.

    I understand now that they have been too long in the city/gym for storytelling purposes, so Blue had to win that day.

- u/Grasmel:
  ```
  This fic can get complex with its battle scenarios sometimes. I read through the chapter with not enough focus, and lost track of the logistics of everything around the market field. Makes the chapter climax a bit confusing, though I get the gist of it. Gonna have to reread it later. 

  Doesn't help that I can barely remember about half of the characters around Blue. Combination of introducing many in a short span and reading a chapter a month, I guess. Maybe it's more clear who's who if you read through it once it's complete.
  ```

  - u/TacticalTable:
    ```
    Definitely same for me, the side characters really aren't too memorable. Hasn't really bit me though, this fic has a lot of characters that are interacted with enough to be named, but not enough to be remembered.
    ```

    - u/Grasmel:
      ```
      Thinking about it, we might be cutting down on side characters soon when Blue takes to the road and not everyone comes with. Might be a good opportunity to refocus on the ones who are left, make them more memorable.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        I was thinking that, but it also just introduced another three that are confirmed to come with.
        ```

    - u/Radix2309:
      ```
      I think there should be a stronger emphasis on an Ace for these side trainers. A specific pokemon makes them easier to identify 

      In HPMOR, each of the major lieutenants got their own unique way to shine.
      ```

    - u/phylogenik:
      ```
      Frankly I have no idea who at least half of the names characters are in Blue’s / Surge’s posse, and can really only recall “tatsumaki” from Red’s / Sabrina’s posse б/c she was a suspension-of-disbelief breaking OPM insert. And I don’t really recall which of Blue’s dudes did what during that Absol quest from back when

        I vaguely remember the religious guy. I feel like his name starts with a J.

  - u/JanusTheDoorman:
    ```
    This is a general complaint from me as well. Not just this but most written fiction that involves detail description of action sequences leads to me glossing over whole paragraphs. In a big, complex scene like this with a lot of moving parts it's really difficult to keep straight exactly what's happening and why different events are important.
    ```

- u/IknowuNVme:
  ```
  I was introduced to this fanfic in a reddit comment and I just wanted to say that it's a great read. It has added a layer of realism to the pokemon world which I really appreciate. Thank you so much for taking the time to write it! (Please don't leave it unfinished!)
  ```

- u/Memes_Of_Production:
  ```
  This is one of those chapters where the fact that most authors commit hard to solely the written word becomes a problem. The battle scene here was in desperate need of a map, for the reader. It's tons of new locales, new Pokemon, and newish people, so getting a full grasp of the scene is a challenge. Visual elements can cut through so much of that! I think few authors really consider it, and they should.

  Additionally, I am withholding judgement till after the Big Speech in the next chapter, but I don't believe this was an effective way to teach the lesson intended. Like sure Vlad ran to help out the other trainer - he wasn't in any danger! All that was on the line was a badge. I'm sure he cared, don't get me wrong, but the scenario it's meant to mimic is one where you literally would have died. I feel like this would teach a false confidence, like you have practiced a set of tradeoffs when in reality they are completely on another plane.

  (None of this says it's bad writing, it's okay for the characters Blue and Surge to make mistakes like that. But we will see if the world treats this like a real "test")
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    Yeah, it's all very well to say, "You're just as good as the others, never fear," but if you run into a burning building and it comes down on you, you don't get a rematch tomorrow.
    ```

  - u/RynnisOne:
    ```
    I disagree about the map.  The chaos and confusion reflects that of the characters.  *They* don't have an exact map of what's going on.  Everything seems OK until they get bushwhacked of of nowhere, or wander through a minefield, or have to carefully move through animals that can be spooked into a stampede at any moment.  

    I certainly do agree about the descriptions of the Mon.  I get that this is a Pokemon story and most people will have a firm grasp of the creatures involved.  But... there are often new readers who have little experience with mon who are told that the story is good from others and come to read it, knowing only the basic level of pokemon's 'cultural osmosis'.  Also, there's over 800 of the critters now.  A bit more descriptivesness on the individual creatures would probably help give people a good mental image, while also giving the veterans a new way to see old mon.
    ```

- u/ForMyWork:
  ```
  That was a good read, I still think Blue is being stubborn on the Red issue, not trying to understand what Red went through, but it was good to see his reaction here, and the reason *why* he hasn't done so. He's worried about what he'll find if he asks those questions.

  Great chapter, thanks!

  >———

  > And here was Vlad, throwing himself into certain doom for someone he met just couple months ago

  I have re-read this part, and I still don’t get it, I thought Vlad chose to ride away, not throw himself in. Am I missing something?


  > But hopefully you'll understand when I'm done.
  >It has to do with the night Aiko died…"

  Place bets if he’s going to edit out what he said to Red. 
  I want to believe Blue isn’t a coward or one to lie, but the tone of him starting to tell this story (proud and uplifting etc) would clash horribly and is bizarre if he doesn’t edit it out.
  ```

  - u/I_Probably_Think:
    ```
    >  I thought Vlad chose to ride away, not throw himself in. Am I missing something?

    I agree; /u/DaystarEld I think this did end up being a bit confusing, probably because there were so many things going on (and the scene is interleaved with Blue interacting with Sabra!), but I think what happened was that Vlad started to go back and help, then saw what was happening and decided it was better to flee.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      I was trying (and clearly failing) to draw the comparison between the initial rush to help and the final decision to flee. Does this help? (Paging /u/Memes_Of_Production and /u/Leemorry too)

      "What Red did, and what Vlad did, are different. Their situations are different. The results are different.

      But when Blue was watching it all unfold… as he watched Vlad decide, between a doomed attempt to save his friend, and a chance save himself and the civilian...

      Blue didn't feel an answer. He didn't find a solution. On both sides, there was only pain. And that was true even before Vlad rushed away from the gate, away from the badge he'd earned, to try and save Bretta in the first place.

      It was too much like Red choosing to come to Vermilion in the first place, and the comparison made it clear that for Blue it's never just been a matter of cowardice vs selflessness.

      He understands why Gramps came for him during the storm. Of course he does. He doesn't feel worthy of his grandfather's life, and the risk is just too high in a way it's not with Daisy: a certainty rather than a risk, poison rather than a dice roll. But people still face certain death for those they care about, even if the recipient doesn't want them to. He can both not want Gramps to make that choice for him, and understand why he does.

      What he couldn't forgive was that Red didn't care for Aiko the way his grandfather cares for him. That he might not care for Blue the way Blue cares for him.

      Surge said the act couldn't be judged, but Blue still feels the hurt, the disappointment. Is that not judgement?

      He's not sure.

      But the anger…

      The anger feels like it's missing. Like it's sucked all the air out of the room it was in, leaving an emptiness he doesn't understand."
      ```

      - u/Memes_Of_Production:
        ```
        I  do think that helped a ton, actually! Knowing its about the "process" of Vlad's actions, and not the one final decision, made that juxtaposition much clearer, and his own thoughts more applicable.

        Though I did honestly think it was a typo, outside of this context I certainly would be just sharing thoughts, not actually suggesting changes. I certainly don't expect an author to agree with me on my points, I enjoy seeing their vision unfold.
        ```

  - u/Memes_Of_Production:
    ```
    I had the same issue - I am just assuming it's a typo somewhere, it'll be fixed. From Blue after it seems clear he pedaled back to help her.
    ```

- u/uwu-bob:
  ```
  I've read and re-read and I still don't understand the choice Vlad made nor how it is similar to Red's.

  In Red's case, he chose between (A) heroically risking his life for a likely awful outcome, or (B) the rationally optimal but cowardly option.

  Vlad chose between (A) running back out there to save his friend, likely with an awful outcome, or (B) staying put with his civilian to get a badge, the cowardly but selfishly-optimal option.

  So that adds up, and I thought I got it. But then in-story it says that Vlad decided between running away with the civilian or helping his friend, as if him pedaling out there was a given. What is going on? That seems like there's no way for him to win, because if he leaves his friend to die, the dragonite just catches up and eats him too. It seems like it's not a good parallel to Red's situation at all.

  /u/DaystarEld there are like 3+ separate comments in this thread from confused people. Could you clarify how the two scenes are supposed to be parallels? (Also as always, thanks for writing this story, it's consistently a source of delight.)
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    I was trying (and clearly failing) to draw the comparison between the initial rush to help and the final decision to flee. Does this help?

    "What Red did, and what Vlad did, are different. Their situations are different. The results are different.

    But when Blue was watching it all unfold… as he watched Vlad decide, between a doomed attempt to save his friend, and a chance save himself and the civilian...

    Blue didn't feel an answer. He didn't find a solution. On both sides, there was only pain. And that was true even before Vlad rushed away from the gate, away from the badge he'd earned, to try and save Bretta in the first place.

    It was too much like Red choosing to come to Vermilion in the first place, and the comparison made it clear that for Blue it's never just been a matter of cowardice vs selflessness.

    He understands why Gramps came for him during the storm. Of course he does. He doesn't feel worthy of his grandfather's life, and the risk is just too high in a way it's not with Daisy: a certainty rather than a risk, poison rather than a dice roll. But people still face certain death for those they care about, even if the recipient doesn't want them to. He can both not want Gramps to make that choice for him, and understand why he does.

    What he couldn't forgive was that Red didn't care for Aiko the way his grandfather cares for him. That he might not care for Blue the way Blue cares for him.

    Surge said the act couldn't be judged, but Blue still feels the hurt, the disappointment. Is that not judgement?

    He's not sure.

    But the anger…

    The anger feels like it's missing. Like it's sucked all the air out of the room it was in, leaving an emptiness he doesn't understand."
    ```

    - u/uwu-bob:
      ```
      That clarifies things greatly, and it's even made me stop being angry with Blue. I thought he wanted Red to be irrationally selfless, but I think I get it now. I still don't fully agree with him, but I get it.

      Thanks for the clarification!

      Random bit of appreciation that the author is willing to not just go back and edit a couple of details, but to add or change entire paragraphs for added clarity. :D
      ```

  - u/Radix2309:
    ```
    He had 2 decisions. Going back is what cost him his badge. But the real comparison is whether he tried to save the civilian, or make a stand with his friend. Both options were a failure because he had already maneuvered himself into an unwinnable situation.
    ```

- u/thrawnca:
  ```
  I don't think that Blue should want Red to treat him the way a grandparent treats a grandchild - or a parent treats a child. That relationship is inherently an unequal one, where the parent assumes temporary authority and corresponding responsibility for the child.

  If Blue expects Red to sacrifice himself in an attempt to save Aiko, the way his grandfather would do for him, then he ought to also expect Aiko to listen to Red when he says *don't go in, it's too dangerous* the way a child should listen to a parent. With great responsibility must come great power.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Those roles aren't really the way Blue sees the world; he certainly knew that his grandfather would have said not to get into any Stormbringer incidents when he started, and would have ignored him :P
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      Ok. But would he have ignored him if his grandfather were right next to him, pleading with him not to go in this particular case, as Red did for Aiko?
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Yep.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          Well, at least he's treating Aiko consistently.
          ```

        - u/RynnisOne:
          ```
          So after making this decision, would Blue have still gone into the fray anyway if Oak said "If you go in to help, I'm going in to help too.", knowing that his Gramps would likely die from the Pressure anyway?
          ```

          - u/DaystarEld:
            ```
            That gets a bit more complicated. He would probably have promised to stay at one of the (relatively safe) defense points if it meant his grandpa would stay out of it.
            ```

- u/WalterTFD:
  ```
  The fascinating thing about Surge prepping for war is that there isn't an obvious threat for him to be reacting to.  That is, if he's Dumbledore, who is Voldemort?  There doesn't seem to be a Team Rocket equivalent.

  Like, we get the occasional Giovanni chapter, but his shadiness seems way more tied up in enslaving Mewtwo than it does in any intent to conquer or attack cites.

  Surge feels kind of incomplete, in that he seems to be trying to make sure everyone is ready for war, but it isn't obvious to me why he thinks that.
  ```

  - u/instanceofhuman:
    ```
    I think this was adressed in the Surge POV chapter (60). Surge expects technology will soon be advanced enough to allow someone to capture one of the Legendary pokemon, and use it to conquer entire regions. He is preparing to defend his city from an invader that commands a legendary, and likely a lot of followers.
    ```

    - u/RynnisOne:
      ```
      Not just someone.  He doesn't expect some random kid will do it.

      He knows that technology like that is very limited and the initial runs of it will cause a sord of "Legendary Gold Rush", and that the early people doing it will **not** be paragons of virtue, but more likely criminally minded.  If not the leader of an entire organization of such people.

      IE:  He doesn't know specifically about Team Rocket, but given the nature of the world, he fully expects some criminal empire to be rising to power as soon as a Legendary is captured, and wants his city (and adoptive nation) to be ready for the fallout.
      ```

    - u/WalterTFD:
      ```
      Thank you, that makes a lot of sense!
      ```

  - u/TacticalTable:
    ```
    There's a lot of this mentality across the US, anecdotally. A lot of people that grew up around/during war never really moved past the mentality.
    ```

  - u/RynnisOne:
    ```
    You're assuming a specific duality of good and evil.

    You're missing the actual reality of corrupt people using power unfettered by law to acquire more power.

    Remember that most of the regions in the world this story takes place in are now at peace, after a great war nobody wants to repeat.  There will still be militaries and such, and maybe even small brushfire proxy wars, but they are just coming down off their World War analog.  However, in every war, crime syndicates flourish in the homelands of the combatants, to the point where they can even gain international influence.  This happened both with the US Mafia and the Japanese Yakuza in the real world.

    Surge knows exactly what kind of harm a small group of people with Pokemon can do.  He also knows that there are basically the equivalent of living nuclear weapons flying through the sky or running across the land, and it's only a matter of time until one or more are caught.

    Basically, he's not worried about the most recent war, but the nature of the 'next' war, and he wants his people to be ready.
    ```

  - u/Silver_Swift:
    ```
    This chapter actually made me feel Surge is shaping up to be an antagonist later on. After all, training people to fight people tends to make them better at fighting people, which is not necessarily a good thing. 

    Or in other words: Surge is trying to [win a war before it starts.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNjDyREEiQ)
    ```

    - u/WalterTFD:
      ```
      Against who though?  Like, if Surge wants to use his Gym aggressively, that is, he isn't preparing to be defensive, he wants to wage an offensive war... who would he use it against?  Who would he attack?
      ```

      - u/RynnisOne:
        ```
        He's raising people to **defend**, not attack.  And he's not hiding his methods, instead trying to popularize them by also showing how useful they are in regards to dealing with pokemone outbreaks and endbringer attacks.

        I'm willing to bet he would **love** if every other Gym in the region, or even the world, followed this example.
        ```

      - u/Silver_Swift:
        ```
        I don't think he's planning to attack anyone, he probably just assumes the current peace (with the other regions) can't last forever and wants to be prepared in case it doesn't. 

        The problem is that this kind of preparedness also makes you much more likely to escalate a future conflict to the point of violence. 

        As for who he will end up fighting? Hard to say, maybe Giovanni, maybe Mewtwo, maybe someone else we haven't met yet.

  Having a tangela strapped to your back sounds heavy. 

  According to Bulbapedia, tangela weigh 77.2 lbs. (35.0 kg). Given that all the characters are in their early teens, a tangela could easily weigh half as much as the person carrying it, which is an extremely heavy load for a sustained hike. 

  Not to mention whatever other gear Elaine or Hitoshi was carrying.

            It only weighs something like 800 pounds. I believe a few people have calculated that it’s size plus light weight would make it lighter than air. Plus, it learns the flying-type move Bounce, which is suggestive that it’s at least buoyant enough to propel itself up pretty high.

              I've tried to work it out, but you can only really estimate the volume because the Pokédex gives "weight" and "height/length". It's almost definitely lighter than air.

  Hi Daystar

  I was wondering what was your opinion of gender dimorphism in Pokemon, especially where it results in the male and female being classified as different species. Especially with Nidoqueen and Nidoking. Sure they have slightly different movesets and stats distribution, but Meowstic also has different movesets and could have different abilities, and yet they’re classified as one species. Gallade and Froslass are classified separately being a gender specific evolutionary branch compared to the one both genders could access, Mothim and Wormadam are the male and female of their species, but are classified separately.

  Speaking of the Nido line, what’s your take on Nidorina and Nidoqueen being unable to breed? Treat it as a game conceit? After all, while menopause is a thing that can happen, that is a reflection of old age. Why should any lifeform just reaching the prime of its life suddenly become infertile?

  And then, there are the one-gender only Pokemon without clear opposite gender counterparts. For example, fanon has it that Tauros and Miltank are counterparts, but this isn’t reflected in the gameplay. Are you going with fanon and treating this one as a game conceit? Because that doesn’t solve the issue for all one-gender Pokemon.

  And then, there's the basic question of why are the male and female of the species even classified as separate in the first place.
  ```

  - u/GrafZeppelin127:
    ```
    >Why should any lifeform just reaching the prime of its life suddenly become infertile?

    I’m not Daystar, but this isn’t a hard question. You see this in eusocial animals, like bees or naked mole rats. The “soldier” class doesn’t breed, they simply increase the relative fitness of their family group, passing their genes on through close relatives instead. The family group acts as one superorganism, for evolutionary purposes.

    As for gender being treated as different species, it strikes me that you could explain it as a subjective, culturally-based distinction made for entirely practical purposes. For example, gender doesn’t really matter if you have a Dunsparce, since there aren’t even superficial differences between a male Dunsparce and a female Dunsparce. At the end of the day, male or female, you’re going to be getting an inexplicably lucky snake-bumblebee critter. But with a Glalie and a Froslass, they not only have different learnsets and radically different appearances, they also have different typing as well. The difference isn’t simply aesthetic, in terms of battling (the most important metric) they behave as differently as different species.
    ```

      > As for gender being treated as different species, it strikes me that you could explain it as a subjective, culturally-based distinction made for entirely practical purposes.

      Absolutely this! From a design perspective, it's clear that the games have taken a while to settle on an effective way to represent sexual dimorphism (potentially/probably limited by technology, too), but it's pretty cool that we can also take the perspective that hey, the definition of "species" can get very, very fuzzy.

      Red's got a lot of work to do, hah!
      ```

      Hmm, true, but it doesn't apply to every Pokemon where the gender results in different gameplay. Meowstic for example. The females are geared towards combat while the males are geared towards support.

      But if the Pokemon world simply didn't have consistent and objective standards for when precisely the male and female should be classified separately, I suppose that answers that question.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Yeah, the simple answer is that as the games got more complex and added first genders without differentiating species, then different appearances by gender, then different stats and moves and evolutions by gender, the whole concept originally set up was turned on its head. 

        One way to resolve this is to say that Nidoran(M/F) are a single specie of pokemon which diverges drastically by gender. I think it's safe to dismiss the fertility stuff as a game conceit, but we could also do interesting things with it by saying something like:

        "Nidoran live in family clusters that always breed before they evolve, then the parents basically just protect their kids until they're able to breed and evolve, after which the grandparents are now nidoking/queen of their families."
        ```

  - u/Trips-Over-Tail:
    ```
    With the Nidos it's clear that it's an artefact of the game. They were going for differences in the sexes before Pokemon even had sex as a part of their data and that was the only way to do it in Gen I, though that did allow for different move sets and stats in a way that the modern method doesn't allow. As for Nidorina's and Nidoqueen's infertility, I'm pretty sure that was a coding error that has been grandfathered into every subsequent game in accordance with some internal design rule of Game Freak's.
    ```

  Couldn't finish this chapter, I think I'm done with this story. I really enjoyed it for a while but honestly I don't even know who 90% of the characters named in this chapter are, and I didn't care about any of Red's psychic stuff. I miss Blue/Red/Leaf having pokemon adventures.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    I get it, a lot of the story's elements have changed from when it started. Sorry they haven't been replaced with things you enjoy more!
    ```

  - u/lamanz2:
    ```
    I agree, but in my case I couldn't care less about Leaf's "save all the pokemon" goals. I'm actually shocked Blue can put up with her knowing her attitudes... Maybe no one informed him about how Leaf went nuts trying to save the pokemon instead of the civilians during the Zapdos attack. I was expecting the big fallout to be over Leaf, for that reason - with Red following his heart and supporting Leaf despite contradictory personal values, while Blue (not being emotionally biased due to a lack of crush on Leaf) being furious with her for caring more about the pokemon over people.

    Either way, I'm with you on being way more interested in the three of them travelling and having adventures together than following Red's training and Leaf's vegan attitude.
    ```
