  That excommunication fiasco is going to be a shitshow. Besides wrecking Cat's plan for peace and the Pilgrim's redemption trap, it's going to blow up any chances of Callow ever turning back to Good. Like, they slammed that door so hard that everyone thought it was a gunshot. Callowans aren't going to forget about that time when they were a Good nation under Evil domination and other Good nations not only did nothing to help them but also shot them in the back for trying to break free on their own.

  That Hasenbach is losing control of the crusade also means that things are going to get really ugly really fast. For all its flaws, Procer is a human foe. The princes didn't sign for holy war and genocide, but the angels aren't going to care. Neither will Malicia or the Dead King, once angels hit the ground, demons will follow.

  >They will scour the impurities from you until all that is left is the devil they feared all along. 

  the Dead King said. I thought "they" referred to Good but apparently Malicia is on board too and so might be anyone else. Let's see just what kind of devil they fear.

    This chapter represents Cat's dreams of de-escalation getting dragged out to the backyard and shot, execution style.
    ```

    - u/Ardvarkeating101:
      ```
      There hasn’t been such a brutal execution of something so innocent since Lenny wanted to see the rabbits
      ```

  - u/turtleswamp:
    ```
    Actually the really interesting thing is that it opened up a door for a very different redemption arc. Procer has gone a bit off the rails and seems to have lost sight of the fact that Good and Evil aren't supposed to be arbitrary team names, but actual philosophies. With the House of Light in Callow denouncing the heroes and the Crusade as false there's now an opening Cat could theoretically exploit. 

    Squire, Archer, and Thief, are all neutral names that don't have to be villains. Hierophant, and Adjutant are new so shouldn't have any historical weight pushing them towards villainy. Dioblist is a defeated foe bound to servitude in death. Soverign of Moonless Night is fey and therefore outside the whole good/evil thing. Cat didn't actually become Black Queen (in spite of everyone calling her that) thanks to the Black Knight breaking the super-weapon and the name not settling in. 

    Cat's curent plan involves killing the Dread Empress so she won't get in the way of throwing the Dead King under the oncoming Crusade both for the goal of liberating/protect a Good Kingdom from tyranny. 

    This could be spun into the story of How Procer got cleansed of it's Evil via copious amounts of stabbing.

  Fuck man, Diabolist is the best. Cat becomes the Antichrist and all Akua says is "Well done!".

  A lot of people point out Cat doesn't *have* to become the Dread Empress even if she kills Malicia but I'm not so sure. It's certainly true for Heroes but that bridge has been crossed a long time ago. As a Villain, I think there's a certain narrative weight to killing the current Tyrant with your own hands that means you can't just wash your hands off of the entire affair. 

  If she had a choice, I suspect she'd place Black on the throne but again, I'm not sure that's how it works. He's in the middle of enemy territory, he'd have nothing to do with overthrowing the current regime and hes showed no ambition for the Tower.

  Interesting tidbit: Cat was given the room that once belonged to Triumphant *even when Malicia was Dead King's guest.* Looks like he knew what was going to happen from the very beginning - or at least showed Black Queen more respect than the Dread Empress.
  ```

  - u/Halinn:
    ```
    I think at the current point, if she can draw away the crusade, chaos in Praes with no leader emerging is perfect for stabilizing Callow
    ```

    - u/haiku_fornification:
      ```
      I agree that it's a desirable outcome but I don't think it's on the table.

      Killing the previous Tyrant is the de facto way of becoming the new Tyrant. If Cat kills Malicia, she might not have the ability to stop becoming the Dread Empress.
      ```

  - u/WalterTFD:
    ```
    Malicia isn't in the Immortals Club, yeah?  Dead King don't care about her.
    ```

    - u/LLJKCicero:
      ```
      Aren't all Villains immortal?
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        I'm pretty sure they are, but almost none of them make it very long.
        ```

        - u/ATRDCI:
          ```
          Villain immortality works much like the One Ring really.  Villainy does grant what is basically immortality from mundane life and even from most warfare, just as the ring grants invisibility. But just as those "invisible" make themselves easy prey for the Nazgul, villains all but guarantee they will die in a Story significant way. For all that Amadeus treads that line skillfully, he is unique in his ability to do so and even then at times has held on by a hair's breadth.

          That's the entire reason The Dead King goes for the undead version of immortality. Its a lesser experience, as Cat can attest, but it leaves him much less beholden to the trope based traps that the Bard specializes and excels in, and allows him to be on a much more even playing field with Good's immortal monster.
          ```

- u/cyberdsaiyan:
  ```
  The Gods above *heavily* leaning their hands on the scale to cut off any diplomacy on Cat's part... but also giving the Dead King not one but *two* offers to come out of his hell. 

  This stubbornness is typical of them but it'll be very very interesting to see the Grey Pilgrim's take on all this. The House of Light in Laure just declared him a villain in disguise after all.
  ```

  - u/leakycauldron:
    ```
    I disagree. I think malicia is both forces, using house of the light and dead King to corner cat.
    ```

    - u/cyberdsaiyan:
      ```
      To what end though? How does Malicia benefit from Cat wanting to kill her?

      Also, like Hasenbach, I find it hard to believe that Malicia has agents high up in ALL three of the churches of her crusader enemies. That much influence and the simultaneous actions of the three are what leads me to think of heavenly interference.
      ```

      - u/leakycauldron:
        ```
        It changes the goal of the Crusade, swings cat back towards Evil. Cat never wins against Malicia in a battle of complicated planning and conniving. So far this looks like everything malicia wants
        ```

        - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
          ```
          >Cat never wins against Malicia in a battle of complicated planning and conniving

          Right, but that's not how she fights. Malicia/Black/Akua are all planners, but Cat flips the game-board and relies on controlling the chaos better than her opponents.
          ```

        - u/cyberdsaiyan:
          ```
          Hard to see how she would have that much influence over the churches though... 

          and regarding the rest, we'll have to wait and see how that works out for her.
          ```

- u/Nimelennar:
  ```
  She can't possibly mean the Dead King (What is dead may never die), so...

  Well, we always knew that this was going to eventually be the plan, but I'll admit to being surprised at how soon it's happening.
  ```

- u/Mountebank:
  ```
  The thing is that they only have the Dead King's word that Malicia is in Keter and that she is also bidding for his alliance. They're accepting his statements as fact really easily--is it just for plot convenience, or for Plot (as in Named shenanigans) convenience?

  Cat has denied that she wanted to climb the Tower every time Akua brought it up before, but suddenly--after a few unsubstantiated words from a possibly hostile villain--and she's on board?
  ```

  - u/HeWhoBringsDust:
    ```
    Killing Malicia doesn’t mean she has to climb the tower. Else heroes would never try to murder the current reigning Dread Emperor. What likely happens in these situations is all of Praes entering a backstabbing contest with the victor being crowned
    ```

  - u/cyberdsaiyan:
    ```
    Well, they can infer from her not acting for so long that she was indeed in Keter negotiating while Nok fell. And they can infer that she herself is in a bit of dire straights thanks to half of her legions deserting with Black and not having any naval options to deal with Ashur. It isn't really that farfetched. Also the Dead King has no real reason to lie here, except to turn Catherine against Malicia, which was something that was going to happen regardless.
    ```

  - u/TideofKhatanga:
    ```
    There are taking the information given to them a bit too easily, yes. Mostly the part about Callow, actually. The Dead King has no reason to lie about his reasons for making massive and unacceptable changes to the treaty proposal. And even if he does lie, the fact remains that he made those unacceptable changes.

    As for climbing the Tower, Cat said nothing of the sort. She just said she wants to kill Malicia, which doesn't modify the old plan of bringing the Tower down, crushing Praesi nobility under the rocks and burning the ruins just to be sure. Of course, that plan is likely to go haywire and lead to climbing the tower anyway, especially with Akua as advisor.
    ```

    - u/sparr:

      > The Dead King has no reason to lie

      ha

      ha ha

      hahahahahaha
      ```

      - u/TideofKhatanga:
        ```
        The dude made an unliving of doing as straight as possible to avoid getting into revenge stories that would end with him dead. You think he would fuck over the one person he acknowledges as the next big thing, just because he's Evil?

        If the Dead King wanted to alter the terms, he would just do exactly that, say he did it because he wanted to and there's nothing Cat could do about it. He has no reason to make up a bullshit cover story for his actions. In fact, he has every reasons not to.
        ```

  - u/WalterTFD:
    ```
    I don't think Cat has any interest in becoming Empress herself.  She just needs the Wasteland to stop messing with her.  At a guess, if she manages to kill Malicia, she will install Akua as Dread Empress.
    ```

- u/Empiricist_or_not:
  ```
  Anybody notice the part about all oaths mean the Grey Pilgrim can call angels?  Considering he has a religious name and significant social power, he might be the one who took Hasenbach's reins, if so Laure calling him a villan in disguise is a bit on the nose.
  ```

  - u/scruiser:
    ```
    Isn’t the Grey Pilgrim one of the ten heroes labeled “graceless” for negotiating with Catherine though,
    ```

    - u/swaskowi:
      ```
      >ten

      I tried to look back through the past chapters but I couldn't find the most recent mention. I believe they started out with 14 heroes, and the last count I remember is 11. Is Absence still out there or did I miscount/recollect?
      ```

      - u/scruiser:
        ```
        I double checked, and the exact wording of Catherine is “over ten heroes”, which would be 11 I guess.  So no more absence shenanigans I suppose... sorry for the confusion.
        ```

    - u/18scsc:
      ```
      Graceless by the House of Light in Laure (a city in Callow), not by the Houses of Light in any of the Crusading Nations.

- u/UserAns22:
  ```
  So The Traitorous Sixth was right and the Thief was wrong.

  I don't think she has the ability to lay siege to Ater.  Wonder how she plans to kill Malicia...
  ```

  - u/panchoadrenalina:
    ```
    She already has 5 named hoing against the leader of praes. That screams plucky band of misfits kills evil overlord.
    ```

  - u/sharikak54:
    ```
    Malicia is currently an honored guest of the Dead King, and therefore she is in Keter.  No siege necessary.

    (Edit for autocorrect.)
    ```

    - u/Daimon5hade:
      ```
      But that is an issue in and of itself no, can they kill her without drawing the dead kings ire for (I'm assuming) breaking the good faith they have as a guest.
      ```

      - u/sharikak54:
        ```
        Of course!  I'm quite excited to see how they deal with this, especially since Malicia is bound to have brought defenses of her own (more Ime screentime?).

        ...Ooh, and I just remembered Malicia's body-puppet trick!  I think it unlikely that she would have been rude enough not to treat with the Hidden Horror in person, but it might be enough to foil the Woe's first assassination attempt.  Who knows!
        ```

        - u/RUGDelverOP:
          ```
          Cat saw that the Dead King wasn't in front of her during her first conversation, it's possible Cat would be able to see through similar tricks that Malicia would try to use.
          ```

      - u/Empiricist_or_not:
        ```
        He sudgested killing Malicia by telling Cat she was present and outbidding. His first "welcome to the club" speech clearly implies he will forgive her if she "betrays" his hospitality.
        ```

  - u/Yes_This_Is_God:
    ```
    Whatever it is, I'm 100% here for it. Teleporty shenanigans? 
    Maybe Black and Malicia take each other out?  

    Honestly I'm not sure how much content can be fit into the remaining one and some books. Book 5 could be her climbing the tower and the sequel could be a story about the completely different playing field that Cat would be entering as Dread Empress. 

    One can hope, anyway. Not sure how much EE is interested in writing.
    ```

- u/Frommerman:
  ```
  All right, hear me out.

  The Dead King's first major act upon meeting Cat was to pull her aside and give her a tutorial in social interaction between immortals. Though it is possible that he was lying through his teeth, I find it highly unlikely due to the fact that he should know Cat doesn't have much of an ego to stroke. Lying to her about her special status has no value to him, so he has no reason to do so.

  Second, we know Malicia has been to Keter. It is possible that the whole meeting where Cat proposed her terms was a sham, but again, the Dead King has no reason to turn Cat so completely sour on him so quickly. He knows that his continued unlife depends upon not creating stories that inevitably end in his destruction, and "Ancient lich makes the classic blunder of backstabbing a Callowan" is a pretty ironclad story.

  Third, we know that long-distance scrying requires the placement and upkeep of amplifiers at set distances. However, it took weeks for Catherine to get to Keter through Arcadia, so it is not unreasonable to think that getting there from Ater would take many months. With an amplifier chain that long, maintaining it in secret would be difficult even if it didn't require mages to be placed in miles of barren, blasted desert for multiple years. In addition, this network is likely not perfectly secure, and it's probably not possible to maintain an open, secure scry over the entire distance without at least some of the mages along the way realizing what was being spoken, or at least who was being spoken to. There's only one person in that desert worth talking to, after all.

  In conclusion, doing active negotiations through long-distance scrying is a massive security risk that is 100% gauranteed to bite Malicia in the ass for Story reasons. This means that, in order for Malicia to be making offers in real time, she must be in Keter right now.

  I think Neshamah gave Cat that little speech about how backstabs are passing nuisances among immortals to manipulate her into killing Malicia "right under his own nose," as it were. Obviously, one guest killing another cannot be tolerated, and Cat and her retinue would need to make an immediate dash for the exit, presumably under pursuit by All the Legions of Hell, but that doesn't mean the Dead King would be obligated to actually pursue them beyond his walls. He could make a show of force and believably pull his punches during the chase scene, with multiple close calls for all of the Woe on the way. Once they climbed the walls and jumped into the abyss below, only for Cat to open a door into Arcadia just before they smashed on the rocks below and just after Masego confirmed that he had a means to safely arrest their momentum on the other side, the Armies of the Dead would cease pursuit entirely. The next time Cat came to treat with him, the Dead King could welcome her with open arms, the minor betrayal understood as a passing annoyance with a mortal interloper.
  ```

  - u/rumblestiltsken:
    ```
    I think perhaps we also need to consider what the dead king can do to named who die in keter. 

    Maybe he thinks his kingdom needs a queen?
    ```

- u/Agnoman:
  ```
  >We’d been had, but here was not the place to rage about it.

  Is it surprising that the Dead King isn't going to just roll over and accept the terms he's been given? He'd hardly be the threat he is if he was reluctant to push his own agenda. And making counter-offers and talking to other alternatives is hardly an unusual negotiation practice.

  > “So much for ‘negotiations in good faith’, Hakram.”

  You went into this with the explicit plan of stabbing him in the back at the first opportunity, so... maybe be careful of that glass house?
  ```

- u/JanusTheDoorman:
  ```
  I'm confused by the House of Light's reaction in Laure. Doesn't labelling the invasion-supporting heroes as villains kinda lose its punch seeing as how they've crowned a villain as Queen of Callow?

  I mean, yeah, theologically they probably shouldn't have done that and Procer/Levant/Ashur are probably right to call them at least a tiny bit heretical for sanctioning Cat's rule.

  So, is the position of the HoL in Laure is that villains are bad and the people should be incensed against them, but it's kinda okay to be ruled by one if you don't have much of a choice, and it's really everyone *else* who are the heretics for not understanding that distinction? Or just that Cat's not really a villain and it's totally fine that she's Queen and everyone else are just being dicks?
  ```

  - u/TideofKhatanga:
    ```
    I think it's the theological equivalent of getting told "Yo mom's a slut" and answering "Fack yo, yo mom's a slut and yo sis too".
    ```

  - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
    ```
    They are saying the Heroes of Procer were not justified by Good to do what they did. They were pawns, either knowingly or unknowingly, of mortal wants and desires. Thus they should be stripped of the Divine grace backing them up as they participated in an unjust crusade.
    ```

- u/PastafarianGames:
  ```
  Now I'm just imagining Yoon Ha Lee-style letters from Cat to Pilgrim and others, because "Yours in heresy" is a goddamn mind-worm.
  ```

- u/ATRDCI:
  ```
  One suggestion I haven't seen: there is one person that we know of that takes it as an affront that such a deal as the truce was made rather than chop Cat's head off and would maybe have the sort of holy influence to pull this off.  Given Pilgrim isn't around to reign her in, could this be the Saint of Swords off her leash? (Admittedly, Pilgrim being declared graceless was probably an unintended consequence)

  Alternatively, if the Saint of Swords had nothing to do with it, holy hell Good fucked up. Heads will *roll* for daring to accuse her of what they have
  ```

  - u/xland44:
    ```
    Huh, and she's been missing for quite some time
