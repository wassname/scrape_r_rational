  Somewhat interesting that AW says that being a thief is such a rare flaw when in WtC, Fenn is a minor kleptomaniac, and Pallida is a major one. Fenn explicitly shoplifts a bunch, and the only real conversation about it was about how useful it is to have so much stuff handy. Pallida hasn't had much chance to show her ability as a thief, but she's obviously proud of it, and she's explicitly rich enough that she doesn't really need to steal much (although her current wealth was probably stolen to begin with...). Again, not really characterized as a flaw by the people around her.

  Murder is easier to redeem than rape, because for a lot of reasons that people murder others, the audience can at least sympathize with why someone would be forced into killing someone else, which just isn't true of rape. If someone needs money/resources to survive, or they're seeking revenge, the audience can at least understand what drives someone to murder. But for rape, it isn't done for any material gain, or as comeuppance for a past grievance. It indicates just a complete disregard for the personhood of others, which would be an extreme challenge for any author to attempt to fix, and even harder to do well.

    Hmm, I'm not sure that's it. Personally, I think it's partly desensitization and partly on-screen-time. Murder is a lot more common in (American) media than rape. This means we're more used to it -- when the villain threatens to rape the heroine, it's a shock, because it doesn't happen as often. Murder happens in pretty much every action PG-13 movie; rape doesn't even happen in every action R movie. 

    Secondly, I think rape has a longer lasting effect in terms of screen time. If Bob gets murdered, we might get a funeral scene, depending on when it happens, but a lot of times it happens and then the plot moves on. Rape, however, tends to linger. We show the characters dealing with the trauma and the aftermath. This is partly because rape happens more commonly to main characters (movies rarely kill a main character, unless it's a wise old mentor or something along those lines), which adds to the feeling of irredeemability -- you didn't harm Bob, who we knew for a scene or two, you harmed Jane, who we've followed for half the movie.

  Hey everyone, sorry for the massive delay: it was a pretty crazy summer. Also just an FYI, our Soundcloud account is deactivated, so the podcast is being hosted entirely on Anchor now other than a couple episodes that are allowed for free accounts. 

  This hopefully does not break anything but direct links to Soundcloud and that rss. Here is the new one:

  Enjoy!
