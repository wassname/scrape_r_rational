    Thanks for bringing it up. I had this joke in store for a *loooong* time XD.

  I think there are a couple places in this chapter where you made Lazuli a dude. You also had a tendency to call not correctly capitalize Dr. Gero's title, making him dr. Gero instead. For example, here's both in the same sentence:
  > That would be her, as a civilian consultant, the two brothers Lapis and Lazuli, a few more engineers from the R&D division, and of course dr. Gero himself, who instead of sitting was pacing back and forth nervously, his eyes darting fast between a thousand different things and people.

  Aside from that, good chapter. All of this is really making me wonder what the world is going to look like once we reach the time of Dragonball Z. We've got a project in place here to artificially boost a normal soldier up to be around Goku's level, which I'm absolutely SURE the government is going to take a keen interest in once this is all said and done, so I doubt we're going to be left with a helpless world relying on Goku and his friends to solve all their problems like we were in canon. Goku will still probably be the best of them, but I doubt he and his friends (and Vegeta) will be without peer.

  Speaking of the government taking an interest in things, I wonder what'll happen to the dragonballs once this Piccolo crisis is resolved. Now that they know they're real, they can't just ignore the existence of magical artifacts that can grant almost any wish. Will they work to keep them out of everyone's hands? Monitor and regulate the hunt for the dragonballs, allowing private citizens to obtain them so long as they don't intend to wish for something bad? Use the wishes themselves on a regular basis? Save them for emergencies? The only thing I know for sure is that it won't be like canon, where everyone just forgot about the dragonballs until they needed some resurrections or a bad guy was after them.

    I guess there I used "brothers" to mean "brother and sister"; I may have unwittingly translated the Italian custom there (in Italian we have gendered nouns, but when talking about groups of both sexes, we generally use the masculine form).

    And you're totally right about capitalising Dr. Gero, it's driving me mad because I realise I'm inconsistent but I always miss some...

    (I won't comment on your other guesses besides: yeah, *obviously* there's going to be some major divergences...)

      Use "siblings" instead ;)

      I'm going to guess that Piccolo still kills shenron here, and Kami doesn't bring the dragon back immediately. He only did so as a result of Goku impressing him, and this doesn't seem set to play out the same way.

      Of course, it's that's not to say Goku (or someone else) couldn't later convince Kami to do so.

        Piccolo killed Shenlong, Porunga is Namek’s dragon.

          You’re completely right, thanks.

    Would a regular civilian have enough spiritual power to become like Goku, or is he unusually gifted? Anyone could become way above current norms, sure. And I'd imagine that when enhancing a large number of people, you'd tend to uncover latent prodigies.

  Yay, first comment.

  I havent even started reading yet, but it seems that Full Metal Capsule might be FMA reference or/and referring to how >!Piccolo !<is trapped.
  ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    Full Metal Jacket makes more sense as a reference, given the military nature of this chapter.
    ```

    - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
      ```
      Yes, Full Metal Jacket was my thought. It doesn't help that if you include anime as a possible source you get two possible alternatives (FMA and FMP), but the theme here is war movies.
