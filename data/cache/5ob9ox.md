  This comment about propaganda in modern politics has been making the rounds on both [r/bestof](https://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/5ntjh2/all_this_fake_news/dceozzo/) and [r/depthhub](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/5ntjh2/all_this_fake_news/dceozzo/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=AdviceAnimals), so I thought I'd share it here due to the incredibly important implications it has for the current state of rationality in our society.

    [Reproducing my reply to the same topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/5ob0xw/culture_war_roundup_for_week_of_martin_luther/dci1b1b/) in /r/slatestarcodex:

    >Someone else pointed that comment out to me recently as well. My initial response is that cynicism, believing in nothing, is rational. It takes a lot of work and mental energy to sort signal from noise. There's a lot more news (or things that look like news) and the overall signal is starting to be overwhelmed in noise. So it's a rational sort of response to just write the entire spectrum of information off as a lost cause.

    >However, I don't think blaming the victims (the public) is a good approach to solving this issue. Yes the news is noisier. Yes, people are starting to disbelieve all of it. But the solution isn't to shame and blame people for not taking the mental energy and time to parse the news. That just taxes everyone to maintain the status quo. The solution is to remove the noise from the signal, create punishments that hurt noise-miners.

    Eh, seems to be a lot of projecting going on in that post.  "Fake news" as a term was destroyed by the people who first coined it; the strict sense of "clearly false news written purely for clicks" lasted maybe a few days before people were using it to mean "everything from the other side".  Then the other side applied that standard back at them, they squawked in impotent, idiot outrage for a few weeks, and are now calling for the term to be retired, having completely backfired.

    Similarly, the bit from Sartre would be at least as familiar to any libertarian or conservative as it is to a progressive.  The_Donald didn't invent that crap, they stole a technique and a gave it a new, gleeful vibrancy.  

    All that aside, the basic thesis seems invalid to me.  The dynamic of cynicism doesn't work the same way in a dual party democracy as it does in a single party autocracy, because there's always someone from the other side to call out bullshit and lies.  People either flock to the media of the side they lean to, which they more or less trust, or they conclude that it's all *bad*, but some truth can be gleaned by consuming widely while taking biases into account.  That sort of cynicism is something that I think is rarely truly felt, but sometimes offered up as a sort of conciliatory gesture between people of different factions.  "Let's accept that they're all garbage instead of arguing about which of us has a slightly greater credibility".

      I kind of hate that particular one. It's everything bad with cynicism (non-constructive, makes you feel smarter and wiser than everyone else for cheap, denies epistemology) masquerading as political wisdom.

          I think cynicism and disdain for politics (eg "politicians are all assholes and people who listen to them are morons") often But Not Always come from toxic mindset that is hard to describe but easy to recognize. Basically, it's that attitude of "everything is fucked up because of *them* and it will always stay this way, so it's not worth trying to make sense of it or make it better" that really annoys me.

          Basically the intersection of learned-helplessness, tribal thinking and contrarianism.

            Reminds me of this study I read about paying for information (and how many people ended up doing it wrong).

            Basically, information only has value if it has the potential to let you to make better choices as a result.  Cynicism or nihilism that says "nothing can be done" or "nothing matters" is completely worthless if it causes you to behave the same as someone who believes everything they hear.

            Doesn't it waste your time in practice to care about politics and spend significant thought and energy on it?  What if you know politics is a real and useful thing but that it seems mostly like noisy arguing on the small scale?

              I don't have a better mindset to recommend, I just really don't like this one. It's generally considered healthy to respect a great enemy even if you hate them (Quirell's rule 10: One must not rant about the opposition's unworthiness after they have foiled you); I guess the same applies to politics, somehow?

      That's what I thought to, until I spoke to people over at [r/AskTrumpSupporters about fact checkers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/5f0u62/what_fact_checkers_do_you_trust/). This actually is the false logic some people are using. Populists have internalized the notion that all media is biased, including the ones they follow, but have not attempted to fight against bias. It's an insidious form of cognitive dissonance that masquerades as rational thought, since it results in people embracing their own tribes in response to the dangers posed by other tribes doing the same.

        Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?  Why do *you* trust self-appointed fact checkers?  Would you trust one funded by Breitbart?  Even if they could point to a few times they said a Dem was being honest, and a Rep was being dishonest?  You mention in your linked post that you consider them unbiased, but that's honestly laughable, particularly from someone in this sub.  Everyone has biases, **particularly** when talking politics, because Politics Is the Mindkiller.  Someone claiming to be totally unbiased is a major red flag that they are full of shit.  If they at least mention which way they think their biases go, well, that's a show of good faith.  It means they're at least trying to take it into account, and that *I* can take it into account as well.

        "Everybody is biased" is a much more common (and reasonable) claim than "everyone is false news propaganda".  From my observations, I see (generally speaking) "we're all biased, but my side is better/more honest about it" from the right, versus "they are fake news but my side is solidly factual" from the left.  Neither of them is falling into that cynicism pit you originally linked to.

        The simple fact is that there are only a few formal "Fact Checking Organizations" and all of them are associated with leftwing outlets.  That's not to say factchecking doesn't happen on the right, but it's decentralized.  You say in the linked thread that you trust them because they hold themselves to a higher standard than regular journalists, but that could still easily fall below acceptable standards.  Remember politifact's nonsense over "if you like your plan you can keep your plan"?  Iirc, their defense was essentially that Obama did in fact make that promise, so totally true.  On the other hand, I've seen them give republicans "mostly false" for not bending over backwards to mention potential counter-arguments to their own claims, *while admitting the claim itself was basically factual*.  The whole debate over factcheckers has seemed to me, since 2012, to be mostly about one side wanting to be able to Appeal to Authority after their previous authorities (academia, newspapers) had lost a lot of credibility.

        But that doesn't mean the people doubting Fact Checkers are disputing the concept of facts in general!  Just from reading Instapundit during the course of this last administration, I've seen thousands of factchecking articles.  They're just offered on their own merits, without any appeal to authority.  And I've seen, online, on TV, and irl, the very fact of someone disputing the authority of the Fact Checkers being held as evidence that they dispute facts/logic/reason/etc in general.  

        TL;DR; This complaint comes off as someone in full football equipment, standing on a football field, in the act of throwing a pass, intently insisting that they're not playing political football.  You are.

          Speaking of playing football... to make this kind of claim, I feel like you have to either be affected quite a bit by some sample bias in what liberals/conservatives you speak to, or misattributing the epistemology that goes into decrying "fake news" as just "news that is biased." Or you just think that liberals are inherently more prone to irrationality, which... you know. Speaking of biases and all.

          The phrase didn't gain traction when FOX was every liberal's punching bag and conservatives blamed every fact they didn't like on "the liberal media." It only became a national talking point when literal fake news began dominating social media... and by both [research](https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/viral-fake-election-news-outperformed-real-news-on-facebook?utm_term=.ho61n9AXN#.kiJMmQgPk) and one of the major creator's [own admissions](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/11/17/purveyor_of_fake_news_says_he_targeted_trump_supporters_influenced_election.html), the fake news that got the most attention and most shares were the ones aimed at conservatives against liberals.

          [That doesn't mean that liberals can't fall for fake news](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/11/29/conservatives_aren_t_the_only_ones_who_believe_fake_news.html), or that their side is "solidly factual." But the idea that conservatives are better at recognizing bias in their own media, by any appreciable margin, is not supported by any evidence I've seen. If you have some, please share it.

            I see many fewer progressive types willing to admit that, say, NYT, WaPo, Politifact, etc have political biases than conservatives willing to admit that their media has biases.  This is understandable, most conservative media is explicit and open about where it falls as a marketing technique, whereas progressives has sunk an enormous amount of effort into marching through the institution of media, and acknowledging the resulting bias to an opponent would negate the point.  Hence "NYT and NPR are bastions of objective journalism, while Fox News is worse than Bagdad Bob" seems like a fairly common progressive opinion regarding media bias.  Meanwhile, conservative media is much more likely to market itself as such, as an "answer to liberal bias" or whathaveyou, so conservatives have much less incentive to pretend that Breitbart et al are perfect paragons of objectivity.  Instead, they say that openly choosing sides is more honest, and a reason why their bias is lesser/better than progressive bias.

            That was the case even before the "fake news" meme, and was independent of that meme.  We've had almost a generation of a large percent of progressive types hearing Jon Stewart spend 2 hours a week telling them how Fox news lies and distorts and makes shit up.  Remember "facts have a liberal bias"?  Do you remember that that was a joke, before a disturbing number of people defended it as a face value truth?

            This, I think, is why the "fake news" meme went off the rails so quickly.  A large chunk of progressives were super-primed to think of most/all conservative media that way long before someone came up with a catchy phrase to describe a different phenomenon.  Which is why, in a span of days, we went from "people are publishing Batboy-level political articles for clicks" to "here is a list of 200 vaguely conservative sites that are all shills owned by Putin".

            Even just look at the OP here.  Factcheckers are paragons of fairness, but his opponents just hate facts on principle.

            I don't know that progressives are "inherently more prone to irrationality".  I think both sides have quite a bit of it, and the incentive structures for both differ in interesting ways.  One of those differences is in the way they describe the relation both sides share with partisan bias.

            >But the idea that conservatives are better at recognizing bias in their own media, by any appreciable margin, is not supported by any evidence I've seen. If you have some, please share it.

            Oh, I don't know that they're actually better at recognizing it.  My point is that they have an incentive to *admit it*, even if ironically, they fail to truly take it into account.  Conversely, progressives have an incentive to pretend that the powerful institutions that they own are unimpeachable paragons, even when they are demonstrably not.

              The tagline for FOX News, the largest conservative news network in the country, is "Fair and Balanced."

              >whereas progressives has sunk an enormous amount of effort into marching through the institution of media, and acknowledging the resulting bias to an opponent would negate the point. Hence "NYT and NPR are bastions of objective journalism, while Fox News is worse than Bagdad Bob" seems like a fairly common progressive opinion regarding media bias.

              And conservative media has sunk an enormous amount of effort into painting themselves as the brave underdogs against the liberal titans of hollywood and places like the NYT, despite FOX consistently having the highest ratings among cable news stations and conservative talk radio blanketing the national airwaves, with the sole notable exception of NPR.  I think you might be confusing "more open with their bias" as "more ready to admit their biases."

              >This, I think, is why the "fake news" meme went off the rails so quickly. A large chunk of progressives were super-primed to think of most/all conservative media that way long before someone came up with a catchy phrase to describe a different phenomenon.

              Super-primed by who? Jon Stewart pointing out all the lies on FOX, or FOX for printing and broadcasting the lies in the first place? Or are you going to defend FOX's journalistic integrity?

              I'm not saying that CNN or MSNBC aren't biased, and you can make fun of liberals for taking "facts have a liberal bias" seriously rather than tongue-in-cheek, but when the forerunners of conservative news is FOX and Rush Limbaugh, comparing them to "liberal media" is false equivocation.

              "Politics is the mindkiller" is not an excuse for cynicism or the golden mean fallacy.  "Both groups are biased, but conservative media is better at admitting it" is a slanted view, just in a different direction than "Conservative media has more bias than liberal media" is a slanted view.

              >Oh, I don't know that they're actually better at recognizing it. My point is that they have an incentive to admit it, even if ironically, they fail to truly take it into account. Conversely, progressives have an incentive to pretend that the powerful institutions that they own are unimpeachable paragons, even when they are demonstrably not.

              I've seen liberals attacking those "powerful institutions that they own" far more often than conservatives have their own media. Jon Stewart grew his most irate at FOX, but he facepalmed over CNN or HuffPo fairly often too.

                I haven't checked recently, but I remember CNN being a *centrist* network.  When I see their coverage today, it seems basically identical in tone and content.  It seems to me that if people now think CNN has a liberal bias, it's more logical to conclude the center has once again shifted rightward -- as it has been *nonstop for the past 37 years*.

          I take issue with people distrusting fact checkers for the same reasons i dislike mistrusting scientists. While I believe science is much more important and reliably true, there is still a clear methodology for determining objective truth that the profession enforces within itself to maintain its credibility. I don't implicitly trust fact checkers and no one should, but a mistrust towards the field in general strikes me as anti-intellectualism.
          ```

          - u/Iconochasm:
            ```
            I would say that "field" is severely overstating things.  There are what, four fact checkers?  Two of them well known enough to be cited, ever?  Mistrusting "scientists" is a vastly less dicey proposition when there are 4 small research institutes in the entire country, and all of them are funded by oil companies.

            Frankly, placing those fact checkers on the same tier of presumption as "scientists" is *insane*.  We have several *centuries* of evidence for believing that even if many scientists are wrong about something, the truth will come out.  We have barely a decade of evidence regarding fact checkers, and much of it says "they have a giant, partisan double standard".

  Julian Jayne's [Bicamaral Mind](http://www.meltingasphalt.com/hallucinated-gods/) has been on my brain ever since I read about it, and it seems like a fascinating theory that maps closely to my own lived experiences, and it makes for a fascinating read.

    That was really interesting, and reminded me of how interesting split brained people are. Unfortunately, while reading about this I learned about "the functional hemispherectomy", which is probably the most horrifying thing I've learned of in a long time.

    > If that is unnerving, try this on for size:
    > In some cases, the hemispheres aren't just severed from each other. In the past, the right hemisphere would sometimes be completely removed (hemispherectomy). This could cause all kinds of complications, so eventually a new procedure was developed - the functional hemispherectomy - which severed all tissues supporting sensory input and motor output from the right hemisphere.
    > The right hemisphere doesn't die, but it can no longer access any sensory information (sight, etc.) and it can no longer cause the body to move. At all. It just lives on, in the dark and silence, unable to do anything at all.
    > These procedures are sometimes still performed. (Ben Carson was actually one of the pioneering neurosurgeons behind them!)
    > [Think about it.](http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/11/16/hardball-questions-for-the-next-debate/):    
    >> So my question for you is – what do you think happens to that person who is in an empty hemisphere, locked out of all sensory input and motor control? Do you think they’re conscious? Do you think they’re wondering what happened? Do you think they’re happy that the other half of them is living a happy normal life? Do they sit rapt in unconditioned contemplation of their own consciousness like an Aristotelian god? Or do they go mad with boredom, constantly desiring their own death but unable to effect it?
    ```

    - u/ZeroNihilist:
      ```
      I think a way to test this would be to do a partial functional hemispherectomy. Instead of cutting off all sensory input and motor output, just limit some of the inputs and none of the outputs (e.g. functionally deafen the other hemisphere, but leave vision, touch, motor movement, etc. intact).

      You would then monitor the patient to see if you can attribute any changes in behaviour to distress as a direct result of that operation. If not, it strongly implies that there is no "other person".

      Of course, you'd rightly be denied ethics approval for any such experiment even if we found a drug that could have the same effect (or a reversible procedure). After all, if the hypothesis is true then we're mutilating another person (and even if it's false, we're mutilating one anyway).

      You might be able to achieve the same result by putting an eyepatch on a patient who has had a corpus callostomy, but I don't know enough neurology to say.
