  After finding this and reaching the end of the currently posted material, I now find myself anxiously waiting for each new chapter!

  This is always the issue with finding a good story that isn't complete yet.

    I know EXACTLY what you mean. And I think this story is a long was from being complete. I'm guessing 7 - 10 books.

      Currently five books planned. Might go up to six, if there's too much material.

        Thank you, that's useful to know.

  I hope all this interaction with the Fae, gives our favorite ~~heroine~~ villainess some practice for when it comes time to fight the real enemy, also outside of creation.

    You know, that makes a lot of sense.
