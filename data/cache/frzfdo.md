    Thanks - nice to hear. That is very much the plan, after Ascent is done (just a couple more chapters), I'll be putting up more short stories. You can find the ones I already have [here, under 'Short Stories'. ](https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/)

  >The world played an unfair game. How was a twelfth century peasant supposed to discover a cure for the bubonic plague, or a sixteenth century Inca defend himself against gunfire and steel swords?

  ... but you probably already know that. Stay safe out there and be glad you're not in Vash's position. Remember, you can start the story [here](https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/2017/09/28/chapter-1-necessity/)
