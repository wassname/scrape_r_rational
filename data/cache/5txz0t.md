  I've never bought books on Amazon before. Do I get a normal _.epub_, or am I forced to use their app?
  ```

  - u/xamueljones:

    You either get .azw3 or .mobi, but the conversion from either one to .epub is very easy since they are both flow-able text formats. You could easily find an app online which can convert for you or read from both file types for you (ex. Calibre).
    ```

  - u/ToaKraka:
    ```
    The latter.

    I buy from Amazon all the time.  I use Calibre, a free library software to manage my side-loads.

    There is a plugin for Calibre which can remove Amazon DRM, found here:

    You will need to install the Kindle for PC app, then you just import the downloaded files into Calibre.  Calibre allows you to convert to the format of your choice.

      As far as I can tell none of this author's books are sold with DRM. (Amazon's phrase for this is "Simultaneous Device Usage: Unlimited".) I was able to convert them in Calibre just fine without any fancy plugins.
      ```

  - u/Anderkent:
    ```
    You get a standard .mobi if the author explicitly requested a sale without DRM; I don't think that's the case here.

    Their web and phone app is pretty good though, I use it for all ebooks (even non amazon ones)

  I've heard of this, but had no idea it was by the author of Time Braid! Time to pick it up immediately.

    I'd say it's basically Safe For Work.

      Ugh. Safe for work? I'm not sure I can read this. I have my Platinum Decadence Ranking to maintain.

    Yes. Much less. Most there is a kiss and some cuddling.

    After I read Perilous Waif, I tried to read Daniel Black, a previous series of his, but couldn't get past the second book because of the raunchiness.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I think he cut back during the third book. Its been a while since I read it though. He was floating the idea of having two versions of the books on his blog. One with tons of sex and the other without.
      ```

      - u/GlueBoy:
        ```
        The version I read had him [spoiler](#s " fucking a girl to emotional stability with a shapeshifted penis the size of his leg")

        So... not really.
        ```

        - u/xamueljones:
          ```
          Personally, I only read the Daniel Black series as a guilty pleasure. It's pure wish fulfillment mixed with some nice discussions/problem-solving on how to use magic with engineering.
          ```

          - u/vorpal_potato:
            ```
            Personally I've just stopped feeling guilty about that sort of thing.
            ```

          - u/GlueBoy:
            ```
            Yeah, same. It's the kind of shit you delete off your kindle after reading, lol.
            ```

        - u/None:

          I meant the general number of scenes. Not the content.
          ```

  - u/sparr:
    ```
    less or fewer or both?
    ```

    Man, he is just never going to live that down.

      That's why people avoid writing em

        Goodness. You can't escape American cultural puritanical nonsense even on rational boards. 

        I've had to delete this paragraph three times to avoid sliding into ad hominum because I don't have enough context. 

        Please explain why you feel the sex scenes in TB were "creepy", and what exactly you mean when you say "creepy". Anyone else with this option, please feel free to chime in as well.

        - u/HeckDang:
          ```
          Never called em creepy buddy.
          ```

      - u/abcd_z:
        ```
        Right, because nobody on the internet has ever written a creepy sex scene.  /s

          Often not connected to their real name under which they write Actual Booksâ„¢, though
