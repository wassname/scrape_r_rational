  Roko's basilisk is the Doge meme of the LW community. Everyone wants it to die already, there are more people talking about it as "this thing that other people talk about" than people who ever took it "seriously", but 10 years later we still can't stop bringing it up again and again.

    Damn, you anticipated the part where I would include doge in the fic somehow

  I don't know if this is a bit you're doing, or what. But if you haven't been screened for schizophrenia you should probably take some time and get that done.
