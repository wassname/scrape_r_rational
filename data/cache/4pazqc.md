  Hi there, I'm the author of this story.  Quite surprised to see it here!  And honoured.  Never thought this matched the writing style I expected of this sub (given that I've read HPMoR and SD, and Three Worlds Collide).  

  I must admit that I certainly did not write this story with the same level of planning that had to go into stories like Mother of Learning (much less SD or equivalent).  While I do have a clear idea of the magic system; the culture, characters and even plot aren't charted out to the level of detail in those stellar examples.  Sorry about that.  *bows*
  Also, a large part of the story 'runs' like a simulation.  I look at what previously happened, then crank time forwards a little and write down what I think would happen.  I know this doesn't bode well for a coherent storyline and I have had to delay introduction of a number of important plot points, but we'll get there.  (this practice also generated a few plot lines, eg. Morey's slave rebellion never appeared in my notes until Wind of Hope when I realized what his reaction would be when he got to Illastein)

  Yes, I do admit that the first arc is easily the weakest arc.  If I was re-writing, I would merge the first and second, ditching the tremor attack.  Some of the interactions might change, Banage might eye Cato more as a chess piece than someone useful, but ultimately almost nothing changes.  
  (tremors need to exist for a different reason, there's a magic system clue hidden in it, so I can't scratch the monster entirely; although I am questioning the necessity of that section of the magic system)

  If you wanted to skip it, I suggest reading chapters 1, 2, 4, then the Cato's Notes 1 and continue from there.  4 is especially important.  

  Reading previous threads, regarding the character voice in letters:
  I understand that Cato and Morey sound the same.  It is a known weakness of mine, that characters don't really have a distinct voice beyond rough archetypes, and that section could do with some re-writing.  Well, many sections need re-writing.

    That's how I write my stories, though I suck at human interaction and dreaming up good politics.

    Thank you so much for writing this, for me it's right up there with UNSONG and MoL for my favourite story on this subreddit. The attention to detail with the real world science is very impressive and the whole story fills me with the warm fuzzy feeling of "science bitch!"

    Thank you for the story. From the amount of details given in the story, I’d wager simulating the universe must be a very enjoyable mind game, if one is capable of playing it.

    > If I was re-writing, I would merge the first and second, ditching the tremor attack (tremors need to exist for a different reason, there's a magic system clue hidden in it, so I can't scratch the monster entirely; although I am questioning the necessity of that section of the magic system).

    I’d suggest at least leaving Cato to stumble upon a dead tremor in the first chapters for discovering their strange internal structure. It gives the readers a nice riddle to be thinking over while advancing in the story ([e.g.](#s "questions like “do they use teleportation magic to make multiple small warmholes inside their body?”, “do they operate in higher spatial dimensions?”, etc")).

    Here are two additional suggestions in case you’ll eventually decide to re-write or re-use this story:

    * I feel like the medieval society managed to adapt way too quickly to technological changes — even if no precise dates are given, it feels like all the changes managed to happen in span of only several years (the last chapter indicates only a year has passed between Landar’s two fights (ch 28–82) with her father, for instance). I don’t think older generations would be able to embrace the knowledge as well as they did, even with Cato’s explanations. He’d have to train a new generation of children to use the flexibility of their minds, or something like that. And even if the know-how and expertise were there, building so many things in span of a year just doesn’t look feasible, even with magic.

     * same with moral changes in society: things like prejudices, perceptions of human rights, etc would be much more of a problem and technological advancement by itself wouldn’t fix them. I really liked Nik Gorkaviy’s approach in his [young-adult trilogy](https://www.goodreads.com/series/80290) (Russian-only, unfortunately): in it, the protagonists had to carefully consider how each new introduced technology would affect the current balance in society, motivate people to educate themselves through various means (just putting the knowledge out there wouldn’t be enough), micro-manage in some cases with the help of a friendly AI, etc. 

    * The story could become a better young-adult recommendation if the scientific concepts touched in it had some non-obtrusive explanations about them. Not sure what would be the best way of achieving this, however. Footnotes, perhaps?

    Also, two questions, if you don’t mind:

    * how are you planning to control eventual terrorist attacks and use of WMDs by individuals? I guess you could build a magical internet, link it to the forthcoming power grid and make the grid defend city structures and enhabitants against sudden hostile attacks (similar to how PvP systems work in some MMORPGs). But even then defending against high-power attacks seems to likely to cause a problem. 
    * same with the environment: even if you can “firewall” whole cities against damage using power grids fed by citizens and mana crystallisations, how are you going to preserve the environment when any amount of power from 2 to 100 thousand magical units was shown to both cause significant amounts of damage to the environment and also be accessible to individuals by the end of the magical revolution? The planet could get really messed up not even a century after the story’s current events.

  I’ve tried starting this story once but the first arc was rather underwhelming: the giant worm thing had a striking resemblance with the [*1990 Tremors*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tremors_%28film%29#Plot) beasts, the non-humans were portrayed as rather dumb (e.g. they’ve never figured out that it would be targetting them by movement), etc.

  Does the story get better later on, and if it does — from which chapter would you recommend reading it?

    Honestly, as always I recommend reading all the chapters. Even if the beginning is not as engaging, it builds the foundations for the later parts, so IMHO it's a good idea to read them regardless.

- u/Linear_Cycle:
  ```
  This is a story I really enjoy reading! I have a nitpick: Noether's theorem states that conservation of energy is related to the time translation symmetry, not the time reversal symmetry as is suggested in the text. So if energy is not conserved, Cato should be on the lookout for something working on one day that doesn't work the same way the next day, even though everything about the experimental setup is the same. (Of course, possibly Cato is just remembering Noether's theorem incorrectly.)
