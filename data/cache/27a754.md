      You might as well ask, "Why so many rationalized superheroes?"  This is technically just one story updating.

      Additional reason: because Hollywood movies have such low fun-levels you might as well not bother rationalizing them in the first place :-p.

      Additional reason: because rationalfic of anime aren't updating and neither is HPMoR.

      Final reason: don't make me rainbow-nuke you.

  With the tests completed, the next chapter probably won't be out for at least 9 or 10 days--next weekend.
