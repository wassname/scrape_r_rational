  Thinking about the conflict between White Knight and Mirror Knight as on a meta level a conflict between a rules based approach and a conflict based one. 

  When Hanno agrees with MK he sees Hanno as on his side, then is confused when he doesn't agree with him on the next issue, but Hanno is impartially implementing a set of rules that are independent of who is involved. Eg. As he says, he think MK is the best person to weild the sword but it's not his decision. 

  You could see this as a microcosm of what's happening in the whole book of transitioning to a modern notion of what a state and political system should be. First was establishing professional armies rather than the personal forces of individual Lords/named. Then the formation of something like a professional meritocratic civil service in procer and the arsenal. And establishing laws that are binding on everyone impertially rather than being extensions of a ruler's power. 

  Mirror Knight is effectively a hold out of the old approach who doesn't realise the world has changed

    I really love your point about this story being a sort of enlightenment era transition from the fuedal beginnings.
    ```

      It also ties into the transformation of Named conflicts from Good vs Evil to Lawful vs Lawless/Chaotic
      ```

- u/TrebarTilonai:
  ```
  I know it's not important to the plot or themes, but I just loved the fact that the heroines were deliberately tormenting the Haunted Magician by setting up trysts at conflicting times and watching him flounder.
  ```

  ```
  I don't fully understand why this is the MK's hill to die on. There must be other motivations at play.

    You're expecting far too much nuance of Christophe.  So far as I can tell, his core character trait is refusing to compromise.

    It kinda reminds me of the SSC post about "epistemic learned helplessness" https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/03/repost-epistemic-learned-helplessness/

    If you *know* you can be convinced to take a course of action against your interests by people who are cleverer or more practiced, your recourse becomes refusal to consider otherwise convincing arguments.  Christophe has to know he's more a strategic asset than a chessmaster.  Now that he distrusts the people in the chessmaster role, his fallback authority is just capital-G Good, defined here as opposition to evil.

    Solution: Throw him at the dead king ASAP, rather than letting him make a hash of the Truce and Terms.  He'll probably just oppose whatever evil is nearest to hand.

    Alternative: Throw him at the Wandering Bard.  Lack of nuance and refusal to compromise might work as assets under the right circumstances.
    ```

    - u/Hargabga:
      ```
      Do NOT throw him at the Wandering Bard. A train is going wherever rails take it, and WB is a railbender of highest calibre.
      ```

    - u/Locoleos:
      ```
      Bard wouldn't have trouble with him, the whole reason he's doing so well against Cat and Hanno is that they've both been trying to work with open cards when it comes to him.

      Bard wouldn't try to reason with him at all, she'd just try to manipulate him indirectly.

      It isn't a coincidence that Laurence's on screen interactions with him were taking him under her wing in the fight vs Akua!Cat and telling him if he livesong enough he'll eventually surpass her.
      ```

      - u/stormbuilder:
        ```
        I think this does a disservice to Lawrence.

        Lawrence started from an opposite point of MK when she was his age. She was willing to give people the benefit of the doubt and a second chance. Years of bitter endings and cleaning up messes made her a hardliner (even though she was stilling willing to bend a bit when Grey asked).

        Christophe jumped straight at being a hardliner without any history giving him a justification, other than a) being young and sheltered b) not know how to deal with his inner turmoil.

        The sad thing is, I sympathize with MK. If someone had actually taking him under their wing, I think he could have turned out a fine lad (and he can still redeem himself)
        ```

  - u/Iconochasm:
    ```
    He feels embarrassed, his pride has taken a few beatings, and there's this hill *right here*.
    ```

  - u/LLJKCicero:
    ```
    On the main sub, some people are theorizing that the Severance itself is influencing him. Making him more like ol' "No Truce With The Enemy" Saint.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    He thinks he's doing the right thing, defending someone from unjust execution. And he sees the other supposed heroes disagreeing with him as being misled or too caught up in politics.

     It's not in itself an unreasonable or immoral position, but his lack of understanding of the wider context, and the way the world works, means its harmful.

    Consider the sort of things this sun normally endorses like doing something moral (giving money to the third world) even when most people around you disagree. It's the same idea, standing by your principles even if the world is against you.
    ```

  - u/hayshed:
    ```
    It really stinks of a story with no good ending for anyone. MK might just be one of those metaphorically unyielding heroes, fit's the theme, but it's hard with this story to tell if there's some 5d chess going on. I'm kinda hoping for a simple "Look how much mess one stupid hero can make" perfect storm, maybe some unknown backstory for it.
    ```

    - u/Banarok:
      ```
      or he'll die after he've fucked stuff up, and the blade of mercy Inherit the sword and his will to unfuck things.
      ```

      - u/ATRDCI:
        ```
        Perhaps even die *by* the Blade of Mercy in a rather literal Mercy Kill to keep the Christophe from becoming precisely the sort of monster he hated
        ```

  - u/Hargabga:
    ```
    Guilt. One Hero died because of him, and now he is supposed to stand by and let another one be executed.
    ```

- u/MultipartiteMind:
  ```
  I really REALLY enjoyed this part!  (I am also eager to see how matters develop from here!)
