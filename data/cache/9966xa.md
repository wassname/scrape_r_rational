## What writing flaws do you think are prevalent in rational fics?

### Post:

This isn't a criticism of rational writing, I'm just curious if anyone has anything to unload. I feel like this may help writers if they know of what to avoid writing.

For me, my major pet peeve is the stat-like, mad lib approach to character creation, as if every character was made from some type of data form. Being good at X instead of Y and wanting A instead of B doesn't make different characters.

  Some stories try too hard to make their 'rationalist' character be the smartest in the room, much smarter than all those stupid scientists who dedicate their lives to the study of a subject. By applying absolutely basic logic, the main character determines a glaring flaw in the core of their practice and is praised as a genius. 

  It only shows the weakness of the author, and how huge their ego is.

    i hate that too:/ i never understood why a main character need to be the smartest around. that just show the flaws of the story better and is less interesting because that create a sense of comfort for the reader.

      Because society necessarily confines the average case, so the main character needs to be high enough above average (in *some* way) that they can go Take Over The World and other *interesting* things.

            Nightlord series is great for this. The main character is often, by far, the smartest man in the room. His crippling inferiority complex and lack of social awareness often form the root of his issues. The trope of the absentminded scientist plays out...but it doesn't *feel* like a trope since the character is so obviously enjoying playing with ideas that he just honestly did build a potentially world destroying device without thinking about the consequences....oops. But even when he misses the small, normal, person to person interactions, the reasons why people like/respect/love him, he catches the larger social interactions. Why a group of people would do x or y under certain situations.

            The character feels *real* in other words. More, *every* character has this type of thing going on. Each has a personality and history, drives, wants, and wishes. Each acts accordingly, no one feels like a cookie cut out.

            His evil bad guys are a bit less nuanced, but even that has improved in later books.

          You can have almost any amount of unrealistic luck *as long as it happens before the start of the story*. Think of the story's world as a thing that exists before the story is written - and then the author picks which character to follow. It's natural for them to pick the most interesting character, and the most interesting character probably has a non-standard background and isn't average. (Think of it as a form of the anthropic principle)

        There are also other smart people in the world besides the hero. If your smart protagonist does something there has to be a reason no one else has; either it relies on some unique advantage, something that has recently changed (like a new invention), or the situation is so specific no one else has had to solve the problem before.




        That's why IMO something like, say, Mind Tailed Fox is far better than HPMOR.

  A lack of realism. Or rather, a failure to make the world and challenges feel \*real\*.

  Eliezer Yudkowsky once remarked that first-person stories like Dreaming of Sunshine feel more rational because it forces the author to view everything from the MCs eyes: What would *they* do in that situation? What biases might they experience? What real-life challenges might they face? It makes the obstacles feel more real, and that makes the payoff from a clever solution that much more rewarding.

  Instead, many authors treat their stories as text book problems. They look at the problem from god’s POV, ask themselves what the optimal solution is, and then simply have the MC do that and let it work.

  A related problem is a failure to appreciate what made the canon attractive to read in the first place. For example, authors will make Naruto ‘smart’ by having him read a ton of books, without realizing that this completely changes the dynamic of his team. Without the central tension between Naruto and Sasuke, the driving force of the plot is gone and the whole thing starts to feel like wish fulfillment.
  ```

  - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:

    > making Naruto ‘smart’ .. changes the dynamic of his team. Without the central tension between Naruto and Sasuke, the driving force of the plot is gone

    This is only a problem if they try [still using the old plot and tension devices](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStationsOfTheCanon) after the changes they’ve made. If they adjust the genre and spirit of the story accordingly, this doesn’t have to be a problem.

    Using the same example, all these canon’s inefficient bickering and conflict resolutions were there, because content like that was interesting to the readerbase. And since with a rational story the audience itself has different preferences, putting all these [conflicts balls](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConflictBall) back in wouldn’t work. 

    Is it unrealistic for a 12-13 year old to make seemingly too optimised decisions for his age and have high emotional control? Maybe it is in real world (haven’t looked up any potentially existing research on this), but this is the author’s world — if he says chakra (or HP’s magic, etc) enhances the mind, then it does. The problem that remains is to keep the story self-consistent with this introduced rule (e.g. with all other things being equal, all chakra-wielding children of the same talent will be getting the same intelligence boost, not just the MC).
    ```

    - u/Sophronius:
      ```
      Right, there's nothing intrinsically \*wrong\* with deviating from the canon, but it's a problem if you don't realize the consequences to the overall story. Specifically, it's worth remembering that when you write rational fanfiction, you're still mainly writing for readers who enjoyed the original.

      So for example, in HPMOR Harry is completely different from canon, but it still \*feels\* like you're reading a Harry Potter book because all of the wonder and the magic is still there. Imagine if instead Harry was completely uncaring about magic because he just saw it as a tool to be used. It wouldn't be appealing at all.

      And that's the big advantage of writing an author tract: Sure, the fact that Harry is basically Eliezer can make it feel a bit preachy, but at least you get to feel like there's a real human being experiencing these things. And that's also why the SPHEW arc feels weakest: Aside from being tacked on, it doesn't feel \*real\* because they're just a bunch of events that happen for the sake of plot.

      The contrast with the Azkeban arc could not be starker: There, you have the constant sense that anything could happen at any moment. As a reader you know that Harry is not going to die, but it \*feels\* like he might because the whole thing is written from the perspective of a real human being who has placed himself in that situation. You can tell that Eliezer felt the visceral horror of the dementors while he was writing. And for rational fiction, that sense of realness is essential. After all, if you're not going to connect your writing to the real world, then you might as well just write regular fiction.

      This can easily be swung more the other way - in a culture where kids are considered 'adults' sooner and given more responsibility etc., more maturity can make a lot of sense, like the opposite of how things went in WallE.

  Main characters don't actually struggle with changing their prior beliefs. Or change them at all, frankly. At most they are wrong at guessing something, or update some information about the world.  
  If anyone's ever wrong, it's got to be the side characters or the antagonist, who will be swiftly brought to the light of truth by our savior, MC-kun. 

  If they are ever biased, it's always (and only) related to managing their relationships.
  ```

  - u/EthanCC:
    ```
    I blame HPMOR for that. The founding example of rational fiction has a character who rarely questions his prior knowledge or, say, do an actual experiment that isn't just applying his super special knowledge he has from being so much more enlightened than everyone else. I was expecting a story where Harry shot spells through slits to see if they're a particle or wave (or neither), that is definitely not what happened.




    An example of where HPJEV should have questioned his assumptions but didn't: McGonagall turned into a cat with a cat brain, but kept a human mind. This implies the mind may not exist within the brain like he thought, but he keeps on assuming something like a soul has to be impossible and doesn't even consider the possibility he might be wrong (because EY has correctly deduced this is the case IRL doesn't mean it has to be that in the story, or that the protagonist should somehow know without testing it).

  Lack of strong feelings.  To be fair, successfully embedding powerful sympathetic emotions in writing is not an easy writing challenge in general.  Failing at strong feelings is true of almost all other fiction everywhere, with shining exceptions hither and yon like Lois McMaster Bujold or Orson Scott Card; but it feels like a lot of rationalfic isn't even *trying* to make the reader feel strong things.

  Only having one intelligent character.  Only having intelligent characters who are all intelligent in the same way.  Failing at Level 1 character intelligence, or failing to make it past Level 1 character intelligence while clearly having tried to do so.

    That's a very fine and difficult line to thread, for my own experience I can say that I have felt turned down from a story because it went too much outside what's reasonable to expect from that setting as many times as they went into canon rehashes.  

    And in some sense the former is worse, because I do agree that revising parts of the known universe makes the fanfic more interesting, it's a careful game of balance I have seen only the very best succeeding in a satisfactory way (in my limited subjective experience).

    Hmm...lack of strong feelings. I would say that ties into the need for narrative conflict, or making the challenges feel real.

    The character has to want something, and then fail to get it. If a problem arises, and the first thing the characters do is tackle it logically and with minimal feeling, and then the character *wins*, then I think the author is missing a valuable opportunity to make the story more relatable.

    I think Avatar the Last Airbender did this really well. We have Aang and his crew about to fight the Fire Nation, and at the end of the second season they lose. Badly. It was bold for a kids' cartoon, but very compelling and used to propel the narrative arcs of every character. We see not only the heroes struggling from the effects of that loss in the 3rd season, but some of the villains as well.

    We care when the characters we like get hurt. Then we root for them to come back and win.

    Bujold has some great works here. I damn near cried for Miles when his grandfather dies, the shear shame and self loathing he experiences when he feels *he* is the cause...all while in, what? the second or third chapter? That's barely enough time to introduce basic motivations for the cast and all ready I'm almost in tears here? sheesh!

    Miles is a seriously twisted and tortured genius who is strait jacketed not just by culture and circumstance but his unwillingness to unbind himself from his own social circumstance, so when he finally does let loose? it feels like someone just let loose a starved weasel in a hen house...only a *cunning* and *controlled* one. A feeling of 'oh shit, it's going to happen now!'

    I loved that series so much, I *blatantly* stole Miles' solution to the rescue of the emperor for how my mc outwits a ambush political plot. *blatant* rip off. what is that fancy french word that means to imitate in celebration of someone else's work? that thing...only not so fancy, or well done. =-P

  ```

  - u/Kuiper:
    ```
    It seems like a common fallacy of poorly-written rational fiction to think of impulse or emotion as this thing that can be thwarted simply by realizing it exists.

    For example, imagine a common phobia, like a fear of elevators.  A badly-written rationalist with a fear of elevators would say, "I am unlikely to experience pain or injury while in an elevator.  It's irrational for me to be afraid of elevators.  Therefore, I will no longer have panic attacks when I enter an elevator.  And if I ever start to have a panic attack, I just need to remind myself that the panic is irrational and I'm actually safe and then I'll stop having a panic attack. Wow, I just cured my fear of elevators!  That was easy!"

    A better approach would be, "Okay, I start panicking every time I enter an elevator.  Why?  I don't know exactly, maybe some childhood trauma, but whatever the case, the point is that my breathing quickens any time I even *see* an elevator open up, so over the next month I'm going to get a trusted friend to help me slowly chip away at this fear through controlled exposure therapy, and I'm going to develop practices like breathing exercises to help myself through those moments of panic.  Or, you know, maybe I'll seek out a therapist or someone who specializes in this sort of thing and benefit from their expertise."

    You know, the kind of thing an actual person with a phobia would do to try and overcome their fear of elevators.  (I wonder how many people writing this kind of scene would actually go up to a real person with a mental disorder and say, "Uh, have you tried not being depressed?"  Obviously there are strategies for coping with different mental disorders, but rationally identifying the ideal coping mechanism is a far cry from actually implementing it, and the definition of "the ideal coping mechanism" can vary depending on the individual and in many cases has to be discovered through experimentation.  It's actually for this reason that I find myself somewhat partial to fics about characters with certain mental disorders, because the authors of these fics usually do a much better job of acknowledging that emotions exist and affect the way that people operate and behave.)  

    Another adjacent example of the is a character whose "rationalism" has given them the super-power of being immune to hedonic motivation.  For example, a person opens up the fridge, and sees a piece of cake.  "I have appraised this piece of cake as an unhealthy eating choice," says the poorly-written rationalist.  "I will instead eat this bag of carrot sticks and can of sardines instead, for they will provide for my nutritional needs.  Yum, the sweet, sweet taste of utility."

    On some level, I get why people do this.  I imagine there are a lot of people who went to see Avengers 3 and came out of the theater thinking, "Gah, why did Starlord >!punch Thanos!<.  So irrational!" They walk out of the theater frustrated, and understandably so.  Then, their response is, "I'm going to write my own Avengers fic, one where Starlord isn't an idiot who >!punches Thanos.!<" And then they start running in the complete opposite direction and  barrel headlong into "my rational version of Starlord doesn't ever feel emotions!  The temptation to >!punch someone!< for reasons other than strategic utility doesn't even enter his mind!"  And then you get these weird characters that are completely devoid of emotion, and if strip a character like Starlord of his emotions you don't have much of a character left.

      Spot on, I usually complain about casual inconsistencies in movies, character actions (unless extremely outside their own norm) do not trigger my "plot hole" antenna, because people do act inconsistently fairly often.  

      Another thing that bothers me is the "selfish-self interest" side of the rationality equation (you may notice my flair), while yes you could reduce everything except outright self-harm to it, the most cooperative behavior could be seen as "selfish-self interest" played by the most trusting Prisoner's Dilemma (which wouldn't bee to rational to do), but it's a fact that we as a species are intuitively cooperative (which gets harder when the scale gets bigger since our meaty brains can process only so many social relations).

      Having the rationalist Übermensch be only worried about his own utility functions make them jarring to read, some people seem to write about an utility-maximizer agent without a grip on his own humanity.  

      That's the main reason why I often see those protagonists as sociopathic.

      I still remember the start of a StarTrek movie where Bones (who has medical training) spends a flight talking with the guy sitting next to him (a MC) about how unsafe the vehicle which they're in is. It's never made clear which came first - the fear of flight, or the knowledge about how they rockets work and what can go wrong, but either way it's clear that Bones isn't entirely comfortable with that means of transportation, and hasn't overcome that fear, especially when everything is shaking. Additionally, his way of coping - talking about the danger - is at odds with that of everyone else - pretending that everything is fine, and nothing could go wrong. The guy responds, and they start talking, and this is all the information we have about how they become friends, and the only insight into why the MC is considered a potential future leader - maybe he's good with people?

    There's nothing irrational about *having* emotions. *Expressing* emotions, however, can often be irrational (i.e. consequentially sub-optimal; the opposite of "practicing mental techniques that help you win.")

    Say you and a friend are in a burning building, attempting to escape, and some burning rubble falls on your friend and kills them. Do you stop to grieve? No! You might be *experiencing* grief, but *expressing* that grief—even *acknowledging* that grief—will get in the way of, well, not being crushed to death by burning rubble. Get out of the building. Then grieve, if you want.

    Even this doesn't cause the problem you're talking about on its own, though. The reason so many rationalist characters *seem* sociopathic, is that the story they're in never gives them room to breathe. It's always one thing after another, so they never get to express their emotions.

    Good example of this "problem", ratfic or not: Taylor in *Worm*.
    ```

      Taylor constantly reacts throughout Worm in extremely emotional ways, frequently doing the wrong thing because of it.  I don't understand how you can read Worm and come to the conclusion that Taylor is a stoic who always reacts to situations in the optimal, rational way.

      &#x200B;

      I also disagree that it is rational to have a character react in rational ways while under emotional duress.  That represents a fundamental misunderstanding of how people respond to stress.  Your thoughts are not separate from your emotions.  You do not have a compartment in your head for your emotions and a compartment in your head for your thoughts.  The two are intimately related, with both motivating the other.  It is severely irrational for a character to 'feel' an emotion, but then have that not actually affect the decisions they are making.

        > I don't understand how you can read Worm and come to the conclusion that Taylor is a stoic who always reacts to situations in the optimal, rational way.

        I didn't say that Taylor reacts optimally/rationally. I'm saying that Taylor seems like a sociopath *to other characters in the story*, because she delays processing trauma to deal with the latest thing that's going on. She has plenty of other emotional reactions, but people read her as "a sociopath" anyway because she specifically doesn't externalize emotions of fear, guilt, or shame. She internalizes them, which causes other emotions (like rage) to come to the fore in their place. (Same is true of plenty of other characters in *Worm*. Same is true of Harry in HPMoR, for that matter.)

        > I also disagree that it is rational to have a character react in rational ways while under emotional duress. That represents a fundamental misunderstanding of how people respond to stress. Your thoughts are not separate from your emotions. You do not have a compartment in your head for your emotions and a compartment in your head for your thoughts. The two are intimately related, with both motivating the other. It is severely irrational for a character to 'feel' an emotion, but then have that not actually affect the decisions they are making.

        Are you using "rational" here in some uncommon sense? I'm pretty sure it would be irrational to die in the burning building. It would be rational to do whatever it takes to *stop* yourself from dying in the burning building. One thing such rationality can require is "controlling and suppressing your own emotions."

        Note that I'm not saying that this is a *realistic* response for your average human being. Not succumbing to grief in such a situation would require a Zen master. What I'm saying is that *that Zen mastery* is "a rationality skill" that you should seek to attain, for the same reason you seek to attain any other rationality skill: to help you win.

        And so, if you're writing a ratfic where your protagonist character is explicitly "rational"—then them being able to avoid succumbing to their emotions under stress, is a sensible character trait for them to have. (As long as you, as the author, have a good justification for why they're like that—since humans aren't normally like that.)

      The person who consistently makes terrible decisions because of her distrust of authority? Taylor isn't rational, in the sense we're using, she doesn't attempt to improve her thought processes or act "rationally" at all (this doesn't mean being an unfeeling robot who never reacts emotionally, it means being aware of biases and strategies to think better and employing them). The word you're looking to describe her is "smart".
      ```

      - u/derefr:
        ```
        I didn't say she was being rational in any other way, just in this one specific way. An irrational person can have cultivated a particular rational mental habit, while being lacking in most others.

        My point was that, since she has this particular mental habit, people (usually, specifically, her enemies) see her as a sociopath. Rationality *in general* doesn't make a character seem like a sociopath; but this *particular* mental habit *does*.

        > The word you're looking to describe her is "smart".

        There's no definition of "smart" that implies that you actually *do* things that help you win. People can *be* smart, but people can't *do* smart. (*Being* smart is a description of how well it seems like a person *could* do, given all the stuff they know and all the mental skills they've cultivated, but this is just a maximum, and implies nothing about whether they'll live up to it.)

        When a person is actually "doing smart"—using their mental skills in practice to help them achieve their goals—we describe that as *being* (instrumentally) rational.
        ```

        - u/EthanCC:
          ```
          Taylor is emotionally driven. It's a core part of her character. The reason other people don't see her like that is because her power lets her express body language through her swarm so they never see her react. From what we can see, it's clear she has a terrible handle on her emotions. She is absolutely expressing emotion, it's a driving force in the story, but Wildbow is subtle about it since we're never outright told it.

    There's the implicit version of this where the character is written by a very unemotional person so they don't really know how to write a character getting realistically emotional in the sorts of extreme circumstances that fictional characters generally get into.

      Fenskept beat me to Flowers for Algernon.  It's a great example of scaling up and down intelligence.  As the character grows more complex, the emotions he's capable of change.  My wife says Gimpel the Fool is a good one.  To Kill a Mockingbird is a great example of what average intelligence looks like.  Tortilla Flat by Steinbeck is a loving look at a group of bums that aren't that bright; Cannery Row by Steinbeck does something similar.

      A lot of rational writers don't like short sentences or simple dialogue, but brevity can lead to great characterization.  Also, in my experience, the range of emotions ignorant and unintelligent people feel is less complex if just as intense.  The sentences they think and write in are either simple sentences or run-ons, because there's a lack of experience and perhaps a lack of capacity for multiple thoughts at once.

  Exposition and characters that are contesters for r/iamverysmart. Instead of telling people how they are smarter, more intelligent or better than everyone else they should react believably to whatever the scenario or challenge is. Some of this can be addressed as a part of character development. Punch to the face or isolation can fix a few personality flaws. 

  The problem a lot of authors face is knowledge of what's going on, and unable to prevent that meta knowledge from affecting the MC. Or again, exposition dumps.

  To me rational is mostly a case of keeping a cool head, or knowing when you need to cool down. Taking time to think. 

  Smarter the character is the the more switched on and quicker on they uptake they are.

    My partner's chief complaint on the unreadability of some of the fiction I've suggested to her from here focused on its longwindedness, especially in contexts where including extra information is not only unnecessary but breaks the appropriate mood.  Like, a monster will be mere feet away, charging the protagonist! Oh no! Whatever will he do?! and he'll think: wait, this reminds me of the time I fought all those other monsters, except actually calling them monsters is inappropriate because *Monstra* is paraphyletic, and we prefer monophyly in our systematics, and what are the ethical implications of a speciest epithet, to be monstrous and despicable because of it? Should we not instead prefer greater inclusion, and are we not the most despicable monsters of all? And the charging monster will have hardly budged an inch in this time, the dramatic tension ruined.

    I think skimming helps. Usually that's how I read most webfiction, and so hardly notice the longwindedness. Though I'll slow down if there's something I want to pay particular attention to.

      That's actually a part of what made me write about the characters in the first place. I noticed in a fix fic that not only did a prodigious  genius react in the way you described, but a regular girl who had no prior rational leanings reacted in precisely the same way. I realized that, everyone in the story would react the same way, because, at heart, everyone was the same character with different stats and goals.

          It has stats and progression systems that are both ridiculously complex and deceptively simple at the same time and the only way to work anything out is to acquiesce to its demands unless you are a special kind of stubborn, which is where the MC comes in. So yeah, I recommend you give it a shot though I feel like you likely already have if you enjoy Litrpgs. 

          Only warning is that the Author doesn't really inspire confidence, he is either arrogant or humble to a flaw though I'm still not sure which, he posts in the description of his series that he doesn't take it seriously (though clearly does), sets post schedules only to immediately break them, and *still* demands a $10+ per month patronage to stay up to date with his novel

  Every explicitly rational protagonist seems to be the same personality profile.

  + Male, early adulthood.
  + Middling agreeableness, openeness, and extraversion, low-to-middle neuroticism, and high conscientiousness.
  + Systematizing knowledge over organizing people, explicit communication over implicit.
  + Epistemological rationality over instrumental rationality.
  + Anger/grief/rage against the system as the chief negative emotion/source of emotion.
  + Low politeness, high love of humanity.
  + Introvert, but willing to adventure. More of a discoverer of new stuff, than one who experiences wonders.
  + Liberal ideology (freedom and equality for all, power to the individual, etc.)

  All of these point towards a particular archetype. The best stories on this sub seems to be the ones that break this profile:

  + Practical Guide (MC: woman, barely agreeeable, high neuroticism, organizing-type, patriot socialist)
  + Luminosity (woman, instrumental rationality, high agreeableness/politeness, low neuroticism, organizer)

  I think that lots of rational fictions have a problem where their characters don't feel like actual people.  They don't talk like people, they don't think like people, and they respond to situations in ways that aren't particularly reminiscent of how people react to situations.  They might be similar to people, but because the author wants to demonstrate rationality they end up having a main character who is absurdly rational.  This isn't to say that they lack emotions, although they might sometimes lack emotions, but the problem is more along the lines of them never reacting in a wrong way.  They might do the wrong thing, or they might be wrong about something, but they very rarely react in split section situations with anything but perfect rationality.  There are also other issues where secondary characters tend to be very weak and usually there is just one main character; this might be just a natural result of having a first person perspective in many rational fics, but I don't find that to be a very convincing argument.  Those are, I think, the two biggest flaws in rational fic that I have observed.

  It's about one specific ratfic, but it bothered me how in HPMoR, Harry (and, by extension, everybody else important in the universe) seem to fetishize being analytically clever, to the extent that it stunted what should have been normal social skills.  As one reviewer pointed out, conversations between Quirrel/Malfoy/Potter tended to take the following form:  

  > “Here is an awesome manipulation I’m using against you”

  > “My, that is an effective manipulation. You are a dangerous man”

  > “I know, but I also know that you are only flattering me as an attempt to manipulate me.”  

  > “My, what an effective use of Bayesian evidence that is!”

  That whole "which level are you playing at" nonsense is an example of what I'm talking about.  Normal people don't worry about stuff like that, generally trusting their fast-response social intuition instead of using their slow-response intellect to try to rationally figure out if another person is telling the truth (which isn't any more likely to be correct, and may even be worse, due to fast-response working so well with subconscious indicators).

You hardly ever see someone try that sort of reverse psychology because it's so complex it rarely works.

    For a contrasting viewpoint, I actually prefer (obviously well-written) epic-length stories. I read pretty fast and even the longest ones don't take me that long to read, so I constantly hunger for more stories to read. I've been getting really picky about what I like, too, which means my story selection is getting slimmer, which means that I really appreciate the longer, well-written stories instead of having to sift through dozens of shorter ones that don't align with my interests.

    This gets to the point where I currently actively refuse to read anything below 100-200k words, unless there's something really good in there and/or it's been recommended to me by multiple people. I get really sad when I read something good and I want *more*, except it's too short so now I either have to wait or I'm left unsatisfied because I want to see more of the story/world.

    Er, actually, I also have an aversion to endings, because I'm not usually satisfied with the vast majority of them, so I really like finding ongoing, super-long fics that are in excess of 600k words.

        Unfortunately, since we're all in the same place, I think I'll be naming some things that have been brought up before. Also, I spend most of my time reading fanfiction that appeal to me specifically, which means that I'm not sure if they'd suit your tastes, and they're usually popular, which means that even if they do suit your tastes you've probably heard of them already. I also like female protags (I used to solely read published fiction, so I think I got sick of the umpteenth dude protagonist in my fantasy stories and did a full 180), so lots of these have female MCs.

        With that out of the way, there are a few stories I really enjoyed:

        Worm, obviously, by Wildbow. Lots of people have criticisms and lots of people are right, but in the end it's great and I don't know how many hours I've sunk into Worm fanfiction.

        Puella Magi Adfligo Systema: this is a PMMM fanfiction that is actually (I would say) extremely rational, due to the nature of it being a popular quest that people discuss and put a lot of time into and also because the main character is extremely smart and considerate.

Updates are sporadic, but the author has told me he isn't dead, so I have hope.

The writing is kind of rough around the edges but this story sucked me in despite me being a stickler for well-constructed stories and it's one of the few that I actively follow.

Which is why I like Practical Guide to Evil so much, it's literally the trope reversal of that haha.

    I have questions. The author has established those questions. Giving me small answers from time to time, introducing new questions, works a lot better than extended side plots dealing with some side character's loyalty mission or some aspect of the backstory that nobody but the author cares about.

    I'd like to see episodic fiction written like episodic TV: Each episode with its own self-contained and satisfying plot, even as it's spiced liberally with hints and challenges related to the ongoing arc.

  Lack of concision. I think there's an incentive to just neutrally describe what is happening without cutting anything out in rationalfic, because if you only describe the important parts, then the reader has a perverse incentive to read into little things in a special fantastical way- to reason as though the world runs on drama- and it fails at being rationalfic. No idea how to solve this.

  >*Hello, my name is Zabuza Momochi and I'll be your assassin for this evening.*

  This illustrates the problem: monologuing (and his uglier friend "repeat the broken logic until it sounds true"). Its a sub section of the "show, don't tell" problem and plagues quite a bit of rational works. There are others, but for me this is a big no-no as far as rational stories go.

  But even before the rational aspect, a lot of authors have trouble with the more "classic" pitfalls of writing: Fleshing out characters, pacing, avoiding tunnel vision, grounded romance, personality variety for a group yet consistent for a character, grammar, and so on.

  The first step (IMO) for a great rational story is not a rational protagonist, but a believable world.

  I don't think there's enough such work which is explicitly intended to be in the genre to make generalizations, and there's a bit of unfair selection effect where the admittance criteria are close enough to "general principles of good writing" that among literature which is retroactively admitted, only good works meet the criteria.

  In general though when people are trying to sound smart in fiction, they use too much jargon for things that could be said more simply, make unrealistically stupid characters to show off the intelligence of the smart ones, conflate "rational" with cold detached spock archetypes, and overwrought pseudo-reductionist explanations for the story's magical elements which ultimately devolve into something much like sci-fi babble. I imagine people trying to write "rational" fiction would fall into the same traps.

    This.

    It'd be nice to read something where the fact that a character is really smart is shown by them giving short explanations a) that anyone can understand, or b) are for the level of understanding the character they're addressing has.

  Uh, while I wouldn't characterize them as unfeeling robots, many of the protagonists seem, well, a little sociopathic in their utter disregard for what the rest of the world thinks.  The environment for humans is *other humans*, and if you come off like an alien wearing a human skin, you're gonna have a bad time.

  Wish people would mention or link the fics that have these flaws. Not to be rude or anything, but it wouldn't surprise me if most of the flaws mentioned in this thread didn't actually apply because the fics that have 'em aren't actually considered rational or rationalist (at least not by this sub's standards) :/

  I don't know that it's a writing flaw, or that it's specific to rational fics, but I really dislike when characters don't have a solid flavor. Like, preferring certain things or courses of action. Something as simple as a favorite meal, or past-time makes the characters far more identifiable. When we get a solid feeling for how the character thinks, what they value, those are things I look for and often characters in rational fics kinda don't seem to have those. Their actions are dictated by whatever contrivance is currently in-scene rather than a overriding principle of the character.  


  Related to that is the short-game vs long-game planning. Characters often make choices which are optimized in the moment, but don't reflect a consistent strategy which would make them more relatable/predicable. Being relatable/predicable makes is easier for others to side with and ally with you. When someone understands what you stand for, they can either side with you, or choose not to. By focusing purely on what's in their best interest in the moment, they often overlook longer-term strategies, though authors rarely have these matter in their stories.   


  I'm not certain if it's on the rational fiction spectrum, but a story which does a fantastic job at creating consistent characters is Beanstalk by E. Jade Lomax (available free ([here](https://ejadelomax.com/leaguesandlegends/beanstalk/))) \[It's super good\]
