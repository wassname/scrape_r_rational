    Usually I say "Daystar and Alexander discuss blah blah blah," but this way I got to keep the joke in for a little longer in case anyone listening wasn't aware :)

  Hey everyone! This episode's special guest "/u/cthulhuraejepsen" joined the podcast to discuss pseudonyms, and his story [Worth the Candle](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126).  Hope you enjoy it!

    Does that mean you finally got rid of u/alexanderwales? I really hated that guy. When was his last story, even? He's a slacker!

    Interesting talk. Thanks a lot for making it and posting.

    You sounded a bit rambly at times, but you managed to get the point across really well, and I like how you both got going further out

    Really enjoyed this episode. If you are ever looking for ideas for more special guests, I cast my vote for erraticerrata (author of the A Practical Guide to Evil series)

      Would definitely be happy to have them on, I reached out about a year ago but never got a response. Wasn't sure if they missed the message or were just too busy for podcasting (and their writing speed has just gone up since then!), but I'll try reaching out again to see :)

  We will probably do another episode on this at a later date, perhaps down the road once either more has been written, or when *Worth the Candle* has reached its conclusion (same goes for *Pokemon: Origin of Species*).

  Is there anything you'd like for us to talk about in a future episode about *Worth the Candle*? Things you wish that we'd touched on in this one? Questions about writing (or the writing process) would be especially appreciated.

  (Incidentally, we haven't done a Mail Bag episode, and I kind of want to at some point.)

  Question : Are transcripts of these podcasts ever made? I find that I prefer reading to listening. No pressure though; just curious :)
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    We don't have transcripts. They're requested fairly often, but super time and labor intensive to produce. I've played around a bit with machine transcription, but the free stuff didn't really give satisfactory results, and the paid stuff costs money (imagine that!).

    The best solution would probably be to have a free machine transcription that's then edited through crowd-sourcing.

    If someone has a counter-recommendation, or some (amateur) expertise in the area, let me know; part of the problem is that I'm not well-versed in machine transcription, so a lot of time is spent on research and trying to figure things out. If it were as simple as "press a button to get a translation" we'd probably have those up already. (Same goes for uploading the back-catalog to Youtube, which I need to take some time to figure out how to do.)
