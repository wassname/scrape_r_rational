## Recommendations on rational works of fiction about alien invasions.

### Post:

So it's no secret that there are thousands of alien invasion stories that take the form of movies, tv shows, books, anime, comics, and animation. Sometimes we are the invaded and sometimes we are the invaders. But are their any works of fiction that give rational reasons on why aliens would want to invade Earth?

Before you make you post let me just write two lists one with rational reasons and one with non-rational reasons on why the invasion happened.

First, the non-rational:

1. They want to harvest our natural resources-- this is a popular explanation in science fiction stories like Oblivion, and Battle of LA. The aliens have come to our world to harvest our natural resources like water, and valuable minerals. The problem with this reason is that most the resources the aliens want are in much more abundance on asteroids, moons, and other planets within our solar system. For example if the Tet needs more water to fuel itself, it can easily go to Europa where it can get all the water it needs. (Exceptions to this rule include stories where Earth has a fictional element that is valuable for highly advanced technology like vibranium.)
2. They want to use us as incubators-- while not as popular as number one, it is one of the older explanations on why aliens would want to come to Earth. Basically the aliens need humans and other different species to reproduce. This seems unlikely because for one thing these aliens are likely to have biologically differences with us that will cause complications during reproduction. Besides assuming these aliens are highly advance they should be able to possess artificial means of reproduction like cloning and or artifical wombs and insemination. The only exception to this are aliens that were designed to reproduce by impregnating members of different species like the xenomorphs, or Zerg.
3. They think we taste good- a popular conception from the Twilight Zone. In one episode, aliens come to Earth so we can become their livestock. They even created a cookbook on how to do it. While imaginative, it is high improbable again due to biological differences. We might taste like dirt to them, or worse we may be poisonous to the aliens. And again, the aliens can easily grow food in habitats and reproduce meat substitutes like plant-based meats instead of harvesting entire species and planets for food.

Now, some of the more rational reasons:

1. They want to use us as slaves- so I know this doesn't sound rational because if we do encounter aliens they will probably have advanced technology that would replace the need for slaves and most forms of manual labor. However, if aliens do enslave us they will want to use us for other reasons. For example, a group of aliens that is centered around the hunting of other creatures like the Predators or the Hirogen might conquer humans so they might turn us into game for their hunts. Another possibility is that they want to enslave us for their galactic equivalent of the Hunger Games, as entertainment for the masses. A third possibility is that they want to turn us into slave soldiers like the goa'uld did with the Jaffa and the Espheni did with the Skitters to fight and conquer other worlds and species.
2. Earth is a prime piece of galactic real-estate- in this scenario Earth is in a strategic galactic location and the aliens want to conquer our planet to gain said location. Examples include Earth location near or on a key galactic trade/travel route, being on the border of a galactic power, or Earth is in a key military location between two warring alien factions. A notable example is Justice League: Starcrossed where the Thanagarians invade Earth because it's the perfect place to stage a counter-attack against their enemies.
3. They want to harvest the power of the sun- This scenario is one that I have heard from a youtube video. Basically, the aliens aren't interested in Earth just it's sun, because g-type stars like our are a stable source of energy and the aliens want that energy for themselves.
4. They want to harvest organic life as a fuel source- This one I got from watching a national geo documentary "When aliens attack". In this scenario the aliens are a race of harvesters who take over worlds filled with organic life as a power source. This seems like a probable reason because we are the only planet in the solar system that have an abundance of organic life.
5. The aliens want more of our art and culture- this scenario is one of the more optimistic scenarios on why aliens would want to make contact with us. Basically the aliens have found one of our probes with a mixtape of the various types of music that Earth has to offer (Bach, Mozart, Chuck Barry). So they come to our world to learn more about our art and culture and in return they give us rare minerals, exotic alien goods, and hopefully advanced technology, though the last one may vary depending on their non-interference policy. They are also very unlikely to wage war on us, because they don't want to destroy their newfound interests. One notable example are the Centauri who are interested in certain parts of human culture like poker.
6. The aliens are refugees- a more popular scenario from science fiction stories, in this plot the aliens have just lost their homeworld, or are on the run from another hostile alien race. Basically they have come to Earth for the sames reasons anybody would want to immigrate, for a chance at a better life and better opportunities. Notable examples include District 9, and Alien Nation, but stories like Defiance doesn't count because the aliens with terraforming technology would have an easier time colonizing Mars without any fuss.
7. The aliens are the equivalent to the romans/Nazis- in this scenario the aliens want to conquer Earth because warfare is part of their culture or they have an ideology like the Nazis that states that the aliens are the Supreme race and therefore they have a duty to rule over and/or exterminate inferior species. Whether this will benefit Earth is 50/50 because if the Aliens are anything like the Romans this might be a good thing because while the Romans did enslave and conquer other groups of people they also brought with them benefits that [improved their standard of living](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc7HmhrgTuQ). In which case, the aliens might end up bringing potential benefits to Earth like the end of war, poverty, and the eradication of several diseases. If the Aliens are more like the Nazis then we might be in trouble because the Nazis not only exterminated the Jews, but [anyone who did not fit in](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/prisoners-of-the-camps) with their views of the Ubermensch. The aliens might do the same thing to us, or any group of humans that they consider impure.
8. The aliens are the equivalent to religious zealots- in this scenario the aliens society is dominated by a religion, and their main goal is to spread said religion across the universe. In which case first contact will happen either one of two ways: the Aliens are missionaries who want to spread their religion across the universe, or they are conquerors who want to spread their religion through force. Again how much this will benefit Earth is 50/50 because while both religious missionaries and conquerors in the past have treated people of different religions with condescension or as second-class citizens they also brought with them access to higher education,  and advanced medicine and, much like the romans, they [improved the standard of living](https://chem.libretexts.org/Courses/Lumen_Learning/Book%3A_Western_Civilization_I_(Lumen)/13%3A_Week_11%3A_Islam_cont_Charlemagne_and_Russia/13.2%3A_Reading%3A_The_Umayyad_and_Abbasid_Empires) for both believers, and non-believers. On the other hand our treatment under the Aliens would also depend on the Aliens or the Aliens leader tolerance towards non-believers, people of different sexual orientation, the mentally-ill, and the mentally-disabled.
9. The aliens are assimilators- this is probably the worse case scenario, where the aliens are the equivalent of the Borg, the Cybermen, or the Reapers where they want to convert or assimilate us into them. Notable obvious examples where this plays out include Star Trek, Doctor Who, and Mass Effect.
10. Humans have advance technology that the aliens want or must destroy- so in this scenario the aliens are attacking Earth because we have developed advanced technology that they want like nanotechology, or they want to prevent us from developing the galactic equivalent equivalent of the atom bomb like exotic matter. This vaguely happens in Titan A.E. where a group of aliens destroy Earth to prevent humanity from becoming a threat.
11. Earth has ancient technology that we don't even now about- in this scenario Earth has precursor technology that we weren't event aware about and the aliens want that technology for themselves. Notable examples of this scenario are in the Stargate universe, and the Halo universe.
12. The aliens are an advanced civilization of dinosaurs returning home- in this scenario the aliens are an underground civilization or spacefaring civilization of evolved dinosaurs that escaped Earth's surface hundreds of years to prevent themselves from going extinct.  Now these ultraterristials have come back home only to find us as the new inhabitants. Notable examples of this playing out include the Silurians from Doctor Who and the Voth from Star Trek: Voyager, although in the later case their society isn't interested in going back to Earth.

  Another possible rational one:

  FTL is cheap, terraforming is not, and comfortably habitable planets are rare enough to make an invasion worthwhile.
  ```

  - u/xachariah:
    ```
    I'm reminded of "The Road Not Taken" (1985) by Harry Turtledove, a ~20 page short story.  Apparently FTL is the scientific equivalent of inventing fire or metal tools, but that earth managed to miss it or is missing the element locally.  

    As a result, taking over territory is orders of magnitude easier than terraforming.  Warfare is so easy in fact, that Earth is the odd one out with unique selective pressures on Earth, while the rest of space society develops differently in culture... (it's decent and short, worth the read IMO, and may be open domain as the PDF itself pops up on engines if you search.)
    ```

  - u/N0_B1g_De4l:
    ```
    The specific mechanics of FTL matter too. To take an extreme example, you could imagine a situation like Stargate: the aliens have a teleporter that goes to Earth, and doesn't go to Mars. They can march over to Earth with their Death Robots or War Cyborgs or whatever, but they don't have any particular space launch capability, let alone terraforming.

    Alternatively, maybe the alien's approach to interstellar travel is to launch a really big ship at a planet which lands automatically and dumps out aliens. For whatever reason, their ship doesn't realize there's already a civilization on Earth, so they can't jump over to Mars until they establish an industrial base here.

    Or maybe the aliens use some kind of psychic stardrive that can only go to inhabited planets. If they go too far away from a source of bio-energy, their technology starts to fail.

    Provided you're willing to accept technical constraints on the problem, it's *relatively* easy to get "aliens are stuck with Earth" as an output.

      > Or maybe the aliens use some kind of psychic stardrive that can only go to inhabited planets. If they go too far away from a source of bio-energy, their technology starts to fail.

      The problem with that is the same with food/reproduction, how is our psychic whatever general enough to be compatible with their scanners? Does all life in the universe have DNA and circuits made of tiny spindly cells running on ionic concentration differentials?
      ```

  - u/jacky986:
    ```
    I guess but war is also an expensive option. Frankly I don't see any reason why aliens with terraforming technology would want to colonize Earth when Mars is a safer option.
    ```

    - u/magictheblathering:
      ```
      War is not expensive to a species with FTL travel. Their technological advancement over ours would likely be the equivalent of bringing an ion cannon to a knife fight.
      ```

    - u/ArgentStonecutter:
      ```
      Terraforming may well be way more expensive than colonization.

      Consider human history.
      ```

      - u/jacky986:
        ```
        Could you care to elaborate a little? I mean considering Europe colonized both the Americas and Africa without taking into account the long-term costs of such endeavors, I failed to see how colonization is less expense than terraforming.
        ```

        - u/ArgentStonecutter:
          ```
          Terraforming is a multi thousand year project before you get any payback on your effort. That's pretty long term.
          ```

    - u/Valdrax:
      ```
      Assuming that their needs are roughly equivalent to ours, Earth has a functional, self-regulating atmosphere complete with ozone layer and GHG to keep warm, an active magnetic field to ensure we keep it, an active carbon-oxygen cycle, and it's in the Goldilocks zone for liquid water.

      Getting Mars to that state is *theoretically* possible, but terraforming requires an expenditure of energy and resources on the scale of an entire planet and the resources of much of a solar system, generally over centuries, whereas fictional SF FTL usually involves energy expenditures on the scale of what can be carried along on the journey.  (Just the energy required to give Mars a rotating core capable of generating a sufficiently protective magnetic field is staggering.  It's probably be orders of magnitude cheaper to build a shield against the solar wind in between Mars and the Sun, and that's not small potatoes either.)

      In contrast, when you control orbits, wiping out an earthbound civilization down to the level where the survivors are essentially Stone Age primitives with a manageable fraction of their population is the effort of a few years or decades of dropping rocks from above at most.  Smash us to the bedrock, let a few generations pass to lose any remaining scientific and technical ability to resist, and return to reap the spoils.

      And if you get too aggressive with the bombardment, you can just leave for a while and come back to a planet that might be stuck in an Ice Age but with still living oceans, which is leagues ahead of where Mars starts -- a frozen ball of rock with almost no atmosphere or surface liquid water, mostly thanks to no magnetic fields to prevent hydrogen from getting stripped away by the solar winds, much less any kind of self-sustaining ecology.

      **Edit:**  That's without considering all the things that may just be impossible or expensive to engineer nicely that humans will want in other star systems:  near-Earth gravity, a day-night cycle that won't mess up our circadian rhythms, not being tidally-locked, survivable atmospheric pressure, lack of many natural contaminants like heavy metals and chloride chemistry, a good ratio of nitrogen to oxygen, gentle axial tilt giving seasons and reasonable weather, a simple tidal system due to one moon, an orbit well-cleared of dinosaur-killers, a stable star that rarely sends out solar flares beyond what a civilization can deal with, no nearby quasars to sterilize the system, etc.

      Planets capable of supporting *some* kind of life might be common and yet planets capable of comfortably supporting *us* might exceptionally rare gems worth the hassle of dropping rocks on monkeys.

  One scenario you missed is where earth is basically collateral damage in a conflict between two different alien factions. For example in the first Men in Black where an alien species shows up and threatens to annihilate the planet unless we return the macguffin, which was stolen by a different alien. Another example comes from StarCraft, where the Protoss destroy Terran worlds as part of their war against the Zerg (Although technically not Earth, they are still human planets).

  I'm sure there are other examples of this basic theme.
  ```

  - u/jacky986:
    ```
    I thought that I said that in #2

    >in a key military location between two warring alien factions.

    Technically I wasn't thinking of MIB or of a macguffin when I was writing it, but I guess it could count.
    ```

    - u/Ozryela:
      ```
      I think that's different.

      I'm thinking of a scenario where earth is not inherently a target of the aliens, but just collateral damage. The aliens may not even want to invade earth.

      Imagine the following. Some alien space terrorist group is discovered hiding out on earth. The local Galactic Empire sends in the military to arrest him. It's not even an invasion force, just a small elite unit, a couple hundred thousand ships at most.

      They aren't attacking humans. In fact their mission is explicitly to minimize destruction of the native life forms. Before the mission was even approved, experts analyzed dozens of scenarios, and losses to native life are expected to be no more than 10% to 20%, which is considered acceptable.
      ```

  ```
  [Footfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footfall) was pretty good. I don't remember why they decided to settle, but according to Wikipedia they were facing possible extinction because of the long-term effects of biological weapons. They need a new place to settle, and Earth already has a breathable atmosphere.
  ```

  - u/TaoGaming:
    ```
    Footfall was OK. It's "The Towering Inferno" (or any 70s disaster movie) but with Alien Invasion. Independence Day but with some actual SF authors. Cast of hundreds (etc etc), doorstop of a book that I remember a few scenes from.

    As to why the Aliens decided to come to Earth .... >!They were the losing side in a civil war and were exiled.!<

  Without spoiling it, Accelerando by Charlie Stross contains both a unique method of invasion and a good rational reason for it.

  As a corollary to reason 1: They might want humans as slaves because while automation is possible, general AI might be impossible or categorically unsafe. In other words, they might have robots, but the robots are not very good, so they want intelligent slaves that won't turn them into paperclips someday.

  What you’re looking for is [Worldfall: a Modern-Day Invasion Story](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Worldfall). Told in the style of *World War Z*, this is the story of when two invasions of Earth collide.
  ```

- u/gramineous:
  ```
  I think you've gone a bit more narrow than necessary here. You've talked about an alien civilisation invading, rather than an alien invasion. I mean, if you've got mass produced robot/slave/etc soldiers, you only really need a single alien in command, and then the big cultural/social/resource motivations don't really matter when it could just as easily be the alien equivalent of a kid with a magnifying glass burning ants. >!(which is basically the plot of Stephen King's Under The Dome novel, but limitted to one town)!< I mean, there's enough fucked up "animal crush" porn in dark internet corners, there's no reason an alien can't be a shithead too.
  ```

- u/N0_B1g_De4l:

  It's a bit similar to 2, but I think a setup like the [CoDominium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoDominium), [Starfire](https://www.goodreads.com/series/41767-starfire), [Antares](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074CG2QZ1?ref_=dbs_p_mng_rwt_ser_shvlr&storeType=ebooks), or [Vorkosigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorkosigan_Saga) series does a good job of providing a rational rationale for interstellar warfare.

  Basically, the way FTL works is that there are "warp points" that provided instantaneous travel between star systems (potentially separated by great distances in real space). This means that the number of systems accessible to any given civilization is pretty low, but that civilizations that are distant in real terms can come in contact with each-other. As noted, this is kind of like Earth being prime real estate, but rather that Earth being especially desirable it's more that there aren't very many alternatives.

  Another thing these settings typically do is declare that FTL is relatively easy, technically speaking. This means that in addition to Sol system being the only choice the aliens have, they can't just terraform Mars or Venus into something better-suited to their needs. Arguably this is a stretch, but any kind of interstellar war scenario means a great deal of "tech tree" fuckery to avoid curbstomp scenarios, or extremely unsatisfying battle scenes.
  ```

- u/serge_cell:
  ```
  Another couple of reasons:

  * [Ensemble learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning). As civilization advance there are exponentially more ways open for advancing technology father. It's impossible to explore all the tech trees sprouting. Some have dead end and some end with technogenic catastrophe. Some technologies will be missed due to civilization cultural/developmental bias. To explore these missed technologies safely fresh civilizations seeded to be as diverse as possible. However then seeded civ stray too much from some promising direction corrective invasion could be used.
  * MMORPG. Invaders drop down and play, purely for entertainment. Could be PvP. PvE is especially unpleasant for natives.
  ```

- u/AnythingMachine:
  ```
  Ascent has an alien occupation of Earth for a very interesting and plausible motive (values incompatibility, saying any more would be giving it away):
