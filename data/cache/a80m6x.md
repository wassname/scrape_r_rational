## [BST] r!Animorphs theorycrafting - about that last chapter

### Post:

Last chapter of *Animorphs: The Reckoning* was pretty intense, with a bunch of game-changing revelations in a row. Be warned that there will be spoil-who am I kidding, you're already here, you don't care.

So, several things happen to change the relationship between humans and yeerks in this chapter:

- Most humans have become vulnerable to being Controlled for arbitrary periods of time. Yeerks can't be forced out of them by 3-day quarantine anymore. A ton of spying operations have also become even  more viable for them.

- A new coalescion named Terra has been formed. Its exacts objective are unclear, but it claims to be dedicated to taking only take voluntary hosts ("it is the new way"), and presumably wants the same thing everyone else does (food, a place to live, security from threats, etc). It's currently in the process of building a defensive armada.

- Tobias has asked to become a Collaborator, taking a reduced-size yeerk that would allegedly be unable to completely control him; though whether or not that's true has yet to be confirmed by a trustworthy source, Marco has already pointed out that there might be subtler manipulation going on, and Temrash has proved he *can* control Ax with memories of The Cinnamon Bunzuh.

So two big questions come to mind: how much should Terra be trusted with a space armada, and will Tobias regret his decision to become a Collaborator?

A big theme of the story so far has been trust. Not ever taking a leap of faith means you can't get anything done and you might hamper other people with the same goals as you. Taking the wrong leap of faith means you get enslaved and your entire civilization is used as canon fodder in an intergalactic war.

On the one hand, humanity needs all the help it can get on some level, if it's going to keep any long-term sovereignty at all. There are several factions (the Andalites, Visser 3, the Yeerk Empire) that want to fight over control of the planet, and none of which have humanity's best interests at heart except as slaves or hostages.

On the other hand, a malicious Terra could do untold amounts of damage to human society. We know that its short term goal is safety from the Andalites, but we have no idea how it will behave, or whether it will be satisfied with a purely consensual partnership.

We don't know what are Terra's exact abilities, and what we do know it worrying. Yeerks can suppress their host to the point they can't perceive their environment or what is happening to them. They can be given hidden impulses, which means they might be compromised even if they *think* they're acting in good faith. For all we know, they might have an addictive biology. It would make sense evolutionarily, to give out some sort of drug that make their host *want* to get back and get infested again (it might also explain why Tobias couldn't quite tell why he wanted to become a Collaborator).

Assuming Terra is a threat, it's an insidious threat, that can take over society over the course of decades or *centuries*. It's immortal, it's a super-intelligence, it can give its hosts perfect coordination, enhanced skills and knowledge sharing, while subverting ways so subtle they might not even notice they're being changed.

In conclusion, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah...

  I do love Animorphs the Reckoning, but I do feel like it takes place in a setting where humans seem so completely, and outrageously out-gunned, not just technologically, but mentally, that humans actually winning this story in any way, as opposed to 'not losing', seems very unlikely.

  The Andalites are super genius telepaths. The Chee are immortal, super strong, hyper advanced androids. The Yeerk Pools are actual, literal super-intelligences, hampered only by their need for hosts, and the lag inherent in their perspective, caused by how hosts need to physically report back. All of the above (if I remember correctly) have access to technology that means that, if they decided to wage war on the planet Earth, they could probably win. 

  And, to go even further, in this scenario, the entire human species seems outmatched, on a purely biological level. Individual humans can't compete with individual Andalites. Groups of humans can't even begin to compete with the efficiency and intellect of a Yeerk pool. Unless the fic expands on some way the human mind is actually better than the other two in some, important way, there might not actually be a way for Earth to ever actually compete/be a truly sovereign state. Sovereignty to me, in this setting, means being able to defend yourself, and it might not be that Earth doesn't have the technology to defend itself from the aliens. It might be that human minds aren't even clever enough to design the technology needed to defend themselves against Yeerks and Andalites in the future, even if they do manage to 'catch up' by reverse engineering stolen tech. Or at the very least, it might be that human minds aren't clever enough to design the tech fast enough to stay 'caught up'.

  (Note: I haven't gone back over Reckoning in a while, so my ideas of how smart Andalites are might be biased by canon; I can't remember for certain if Andalites are still super geniuses in this fic)

  Its weird to say, but the best, most independent future for humanity, in this setting, might be to become voluntary extensions of the Terran Yeerk Pool; to basically become an entire species of Collaborators. In canon, it was the Yeerks that were forced to accept 'species death', and live out the rest of their lives in new forms. It would be interesting for a fic to flip that on its head, and have it be humanity that has to accept a sort of 'species death', and turn into something else instead, just to survive.

    Yeah, I had the same problem with canon Animorphs.

    Like, you guys can enhance humans and give them better memory, exploit all *their* knowledge, and become instant experts in anything by kidnapping people with the right background. Why do you keep acting like James Bong mooks and being outsmarted by a band of impulsive teenagers?

    > Unless the fic expands on some way the human mind is actually better than the other two in some, important way

    In canon there was:

    * Humans are more creative and invent tech faster than Andalites (eg interval between "first heavier-than-year-aircraft" and "first space flight" was three times longer for Andalites). Though given what we see in the Chronicles, Yeerks are even better at going up the tech curve.

    * Humans are Winston Churchill and they will keep fighting until there's nothing left but blood and ashes everywhere.

    * There's a crapton of humans, and they outnumber every other species thousands-to-one.

Or at the very least, it might be that human minds aren't clever enough to design the tech fast enough to stay 'caught up'.

    It's not really clear how the tech curve works in the Reckoningverse (there, I named it). It kind of seems to go up until hits a ceiling. Eg the Andalites and the Naharans have hyperspace travel and youth serums, but no AI or nanomachines for some reason. Realistically, Andalites should be so far ahead that a single Andalite Battleship should be able to take on every single ship the Yeerks manage to scrape together, yet Yeerks seem to be able to pull win after win through superior tactics and numbers, which kiiiiind of doesn't make sense?

    Anyway, since the premise is that the one who wins the war is the one with the biggest fleet of space fighter jets, humanity does have a fair shot at securing its independence short-term. The problem is how we deal with Terra without it getting its hooks in.

      Very nice points. Though I now feel compelled to be a bit more fair to Reckoning, and point out that the premise; the idea of humanity getting kicked off its usual pedestal in fiction and getting involved in an interstellar in which they were more of a natural resource to be fought over than an actual player, was what got me into the story in the first place.

      Anyways, I do hope the fic does go deeper into the whole creativity thing. I vaguely remember something from canon about the human brain having two hemispheres actually being unique in the universe, and that other species simply weren't capable of the same kind of self-reflection humans were. Though, judging from the Ax chapters in this fic, that doesn't seem to be the case in Reckoning: though again I think I remember reading something about the Andalite telepathy (either in the comments, or in the story itself) actually slowing down Andalite scientific/cultural progress, because its much harder to get rid of bad ideas when everybody is constantly reinforcing them with what could be literal, telepathically enforced group-think.

      One of the things I liked most about canon, was how much effort it put into showing diversity of thought. Canon really fleshed out how different species thought, and that gave it a distinctive feel that other Sci-Fi stories lacked. Reckoning has taken that a bit further, by actually having individual characters morph each other, and see how each other think; something I found, and still find, really, really cool. I just wish it would 'zoom back out' a bit, and really highlight what makes humans different. My experience reading the Eragon series back in school has really soured me against reading books where certain groups just seem increasingly, objectively better than others. 

      Though again, part of what makes the Yeerks such scary villains, is precisely how much of an existential threat they are. In a world without functional, general AI, Yeerk Pools really are the closest thing the universe has to a super-intelligence; and that's terrifying. 

      The whole tech-curve thing is actually kind of interesting. The Andalites don't have any AI; and yet the Chee exist, so the technology is possible in universe. Maybe they just have an embargo against it? I mean, they still do make advances; Seerow did invent morphing after all, and it was  a novel creation. Though, then again, Ax does say that if the other Andalites (or even Seerow) himself truly understood what morphing meant, they never would have made it (cuz it deviates too much from The Path), so maybe their culture greatly restricts the progress of their science? Though if the Reckoning verse follows Moore's Law of Mad Science, that might be a pretty realistic image of a hyper-advanced society.

        I imagine that one thing that both the Ellimist and Crayak agree upon is squashing any kind of self-improving AI. They have phenomenal cosmic powers but even running a given person through thousands of simulations appears to take up *some* kind of resource, so it may not be worth the effort for either of them to take the capabilities of an AI into account.

      >Yeerks are even better at going up the tech curve.

      It's not clear that canon yeerks invented many things though, it may basically *all* be stolen or mildly tinkered tech from Andelites.  Canon yeerks are also each unique individuals, grow up in constant sensory deprivation, and unable to communicate even with each other without a host. On top of that, their psychology is basically human, and their evil alignment is cultural and shaped by the unfortunate circumstances of their biology. It does makes a sort of sense for yeerks to be stupid.
      ```

    It doesn't depend on humanity really. It depends on the Ellimist, Crayak, and where their respective endgames leave us. I'd be surprised if humans "win" via coming out on top of a power struggle like in canon, we win by subtly nudging the final balance towards something we like. That might mean shifting Yeerk politics, Andelite politics, etc.

    I should also note that this author really likes the idea of victory won by small nudges and scraps (which the Ellimist character is  perfectly made to provide, since his whole game is victory via very minor intervention at key points)

  Disagree, Tom has so far shown no desire at all to become a Collaborator, and he had Temrash in his head for a much longer time.

  > A big theme of the story so far has been trust.

  I think Tobias' decision is to do with this. He feels that Garett's trust in him is misplaced, and by becoming a Collaborator he can maybe...split the burden of responsibility? 

  > Most humans have become vulnerable to being Controlled for arbitrary periods of time. Yeerks can't be forced out of them by 3-day quarantine anymore.

  So if you drag a suspected Controller over to Terra and say 'hey Terra, ya mind sticking a rope of yourself into this person's ear?', I think that could forcefully remove a Yeerk. This is a kinder method too, by their standards.


  One thing that hasn't been tested yet - the group has tried to morph shards (unsuccessfully) but now they have a coalescion that might agree to be morphed. Assuming E/C doesn't interfere of course. I hope the group realizes that after the David fiasco they should probably morph check more than once, or on a regular basis. It would also force the influencing party to do a bigger trade as I'd imagine that influencing more parties frequently to block a morph check would require more effort from E/C.
  ```

    ```
    Nobody knows what David did.  Hopefully they'd still think of doing more frequent morph checks anyway.

      Wait, doesn't Ax know?
      ```

      - u/TK17Studios:
        ```
        Ax knows David came back as a Controller.  Doesn't know anything at all about the betrayal.

    Cuz he had a bad trip. Tobias had a shorter bad experience, and then a prolonged okay experience with Ruhak.
