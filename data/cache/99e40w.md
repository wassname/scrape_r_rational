## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  I've been contemplating writing a story that is divided into three acts. Each act takes place in three different 'worlds' that the protagonist is thrown into and at the beginning of each act, he has to take the time to learn about the environment.

  The part I'm wondering about is how much detail or time should I spend on the initial exploration phase. Because I have a decent amount planned out, but I don't know how much I really need to put in. Most of it I can just save for later in the story to introduce as they become relevant, but I also want to give the reader a sense of the circumstances/places the protagonist is dealing with. There is also the issue that this type of event is repeated three times in the story. Perhaps it would be fine since I'm improving the protagonist's ability to react to unknown situations throughout the story.

  How do others handle this?

    It probably depends on how long each act is. The ratio of exploration and world-building to the plot-relevant narrative should be just enough that the reader is interested enough in the protagonist's exploration but won't get bored from too much detail. How much detail is too much is subjective, but I conceptualize it as 2 degrees of separation: the first degree is details that the protagonist directly experiences/interacts with, the second being details that there's the *potential* of being later relevant. 

    More metaphorically, [Brandon Sanderson talked about the illusion of the iceberg](https://youtu.be/v98Zy_hP5TI?t=11m59s) (skimming through again, he has a lot of great advice for your situation starting from the iceberg analogy). So enough worldbuilding that the environment feels real and complex enough that the reader feels like the protagonist, i.e. just dumped in the setting and figuring out what the immediate priorities are. I don't think it's a big worry if your character is *reacting* to unknown situations because unless you start huge exposition dumps, there's going to be a natural info bottleneck.
