  Seeing how popular www.hpmorpodcast.com is and how Worm is often mentioned here I thought this could get some traction. They also could use some feedback, because even they started in June and have ca. 4000 downloads I'm still the only one to comment.

    The audio isn't great, that's going be an instant turn for a lot of people.

  Oh, thank you for sharing this here!  I've been meaning to read Worm and wishing there was an audio version.
