  Mind saying a bit about why Skein is worth reading? I can't see any posts on the sub about it before

    ```
    It is an altpower!Taylor Worm fanfic. The protagonist basically sees a wordnet of associations in people's minds.

      Is it especially rational/interesting?

        Well, I mean, it's still short enough that it's hard to say. The power is definitely interesting, and there's been nothing egregious (heh) about the writing and characterization so far, but at the same time, there's nothing about it that makes it particularly *well*-suited to this sub, either. I'd say give it a read, and if you don't like the first chapter, give up on it.
