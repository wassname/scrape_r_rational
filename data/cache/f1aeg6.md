## Pyrebound 12.2

### Post:

A quick survey for my readers: which installment/chapter was your favorite, and why?  Anyway,

[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2020/02/09/chapter-12-2/](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2020/02/09/chapter-12-2/)

Pyrebound is the story of Rammash im-Belemel, a luckless young man in a luckless world where literal disaster strikes every four days.  He sets out just trying to make ends meet for his family; it doesn't end there, of course.  The beginning is [right here](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/).  Thank you!
