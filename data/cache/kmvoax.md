## Anyone have recommendations or a list of completed stories, preferably short?

### Post:

I've already read Mother of Learning, Metropolitan Man, Three Worlds Collide, Carefully Chosen, Bruce Kent / Masculine Mongoose stories, (Naruto) The Waves Arisen, Sivad's Question, "…And I Show You How Deep The Rabbit Hole Goes", and I've followed "Pokemon: The Origin of Species" for a while.

  Several short rational fiction stories I enjoyed are listed here: 

  https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/fiction

  My top reading list of short stories there, trying to optimize for impactful and interesting, is That Alien Message, The Sword of Good, Answer to Job, and Three Worlds Collide, in approximately that order.

  Short fics I enjoyed: [Stargate Physics 101](https://archiveofourown.org/works/3673335), [The Rules of Wishing](https://archiveofourown.org/works/4637439), [Instruments of Destruction](https://archiveofourown.org/works/17356235), [Tony's New Assistant](https://archiveofourown.org/works/411457) (27k words).

  I'll also rec [The World As It Appears To Be](https://archiveofourown.org/works/9402014), though it's medium-long at 132k words.

  If you're not allergic to ponies, the Friendship is Optimal MLP fanfic and its recursive fanfics are really, really good and mostly completed and short. 

  It's about AI safety, unfriendly AI, escaping the box, and that sort fo thing. In my mind the ponies are only a backdrop and it doesn't require knowledge of the show beyond "there was a tv show with ponies that children and a certain type of young man enjoyed"

  Recommendations (all in universe):

  https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal - the original fic that started it and laid down a lot of groundwork rfor the setting. 38k words.

  https://www.fimfiction.net/story/69770/friendship-is-optimal-caelum-est-conterrens - an amazing story that stands alone about identity and brain uploading among other things. can stand alone IMO. 55k words.

  https://www.fimfiction.net/story/386867/leftovers-a-friendship-is-optimal-story - A story about cryonics. I'd probably recommend you read the original story first as it assumes knowledge of the setting. 12k words.

  https://www.fimfiction.net/story/406526/implacable - revcerse munchkining very thorough anti-AI defenses. 17k words.

  https://www.fimfiction.net/story/114862/friendship-is-optimal-tiny-morsels-of-satisfaction - a whole bunch of short flashes set in the FiO universe that provide cool worldbuilding. 36k words, but each chapter stands alone and is <5k words.

  there are TONS more fics in the universe but those are IMO some of the best.

    Thank you. I've known about Friendship is Optimal for some time, but didn't want to read it since I was not familiar with MLP universe. But your post convinced me to to try anyway.  And I've read all of what you listed (over than some of the short stories) and a bit more and was very satisfied.

      I'm glad! They're really some of my absolutely favourite stories and it's a crime that the ponies scare so many people off.

      How did you find the "ponyness", as a non-pony-person? I'd seen a season or two of the show so I was familiar with it enough to get most/all the references. Did you have a problem with it?

      Also, there's many, many more good FiO stories. I think there's a "folder" of them in fimfiction.
      ```

      - u/Ashtero:
        ```
        Well, I guess, I've missed most/all references. But to me it is a story of AGI and its effect on people. If CelestAI was instead satisfying values through friendship and kittens, I doubt the story would've changed that much.

  Alicorn (the writer of Luminosity and some other works that have been linked on this sub) has a whole bunch of [completed short stories.](http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/stories.shtml)
  ```

- u/PeridexisErrant:
  ```
  [Most of Greg Egan's short stories](https://www.gregegan.net/BIBLIOGRAPHY/Online.html) are available online, and they're all great.  A suggested starting order:

  - *In the Ruins*
  - *Bit Players*
  - *The Plank Dive*
  - *The Moral Virologist* (cw: 2020, title is a misnomer)
  - *Oceanic*
  ```

- u/Amargosamountain:
  ```
  * Worm, by Wildbow. It's extremely long, but is the magnum opus of rational fiction in my opinion.

  * Super Powereds by Drew Hayes. Also rather long, and like Worm it's a reconstructed superhero story

  * Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality

  Are you interested in traditionally-published fiction as well?

    Not really, but feel free to reply anyway for interested lurkers!

    Just wanted to point out that super powereds isn't rational, but i did enjoy it very much.

  > "…And I Show You How Deep The Rabbit Hole Goes"

  You should probably read the rest of the fiction stories on SSC, then? I liked that one, and I liked the rest of them as well.

  Otherwise, [*Cordyceps*](https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868) is readable in one sitting, complete, and very very good.

  Also, I'm surprised no one ever links [*Dave Scum*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SddGHeVfcVa5SCDHHTOA4RlKwnef-Q6IMw_Jqw9I0Mw/edit?usp=sharing) by the same author. It's not *as* very very good, but awesome anyway. (Edit: I think it might be unfinished?.. When I read it, it felt *completed* even if not 100% satisfyingly wrapped—but since then, two new chapters appeared. So who knows at this point.)

  Out of already mentioned in this thread works, I second *Answer to Job*, *Instruments of Destruction*, and *The World As It Appears To Be*.

    You were right about Dave Scum, that was a great read.

  Unsong, Chilli and the Chocolate Factory: Fudge Revelation, and Practical Guide to Evil have all come up here before. I need to go back and finish Unsong since I got distracted last time, but its good. Chilli is short and the first ~third is a bit clunky, but I really enjoyed it overall. PGTE is not short, book 6 is very nearly finished and then the final book will start. I mentioned a bunch of rarer stuff in this week's recommendation thread too, so ctrl+f that thread for more stuff.

  A Practical guide to evil, is awesome
  ```

  - u/Amargosamountain:
    ```
    Not completed though
    ```

    - u/Smartjedi:
      ```
      Not exactly short either lol. 

      /u/koolkid372 try Interviewing Leather. It's a short read (14 chapters) about a journalist interviewing a C-list supervillain. Light hearted, enjoyable read.
      ```
