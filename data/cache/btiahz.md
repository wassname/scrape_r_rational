## Rambling nonsense about evil and sociological storytelling, just read the last 4 paragraphs

### Post:

Let me tl;dr what I’ve wanted to express on writing evil so far:

1. Having villains who burn the hero’s parents alive while cackling about how much they love killing people is *really useful* to a lot of stories, particularly action-oriented ones; and there need be *no* sacrifice to the story’s complexity or maturity, or the complexity of the villains themselves (e.g., HPMOR, Game of Thrones, Worm—voldemort a murdering psychopath, joffrey, ramsay bolton, etc., and literal nazis, endbringers, etc, respectively).

2. Villains of the above kind *are* psychologically realistic, but a combination of human psychology—we can only understand evil when we’re in a position to do evil ourselves—and our culture’s treatment of the word “evil” as *requiring* psychological incomprehensibility make this difficult to perceive.

So Game of Thrones ended recently **FULL GOT SPOILERS**, and a lot of people were unsatisfied. A lot of commentary, and very little actual analysis, has been given as to the ending’s faults. (The main problem, by the way, was just *choosing to end it* well before the plotlines established could come to logical conclusions. Cut anything short enough, and even Shakespeare couldn’t save it.) One of the more interesting pieces of commentary/analysis is an [article on sociological versus character-driven storytelling.](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-real-reason-fans-hate-the-last-season-of-game-of-thrones/) Much of the modern style of American TV and film demands that stories be told fundamentally about individual human psychology, incentives and institutions be damned. Game of Thrones had been about the real patterns of history and human decision-making in changing institutional contexts, and after season 4ish it became more and more about the qualities of individual people, context be damned. (Which is necessary when you’re cutting a story short, by the way; history takes a long time to do what individuals can be rather quick about.)

It’s true that mainstream American entertainment has this problem. I remember being disappointed by *Silicon Valley* for this reason. Early on in the show, there’s a scene where Richard is talking to Peter Gregory, his funder. Richard is like, hey, can I have a bunch of money now? And Gregory is like, you need to give me all these forms and this information and have plans for this and that and blah blah. And Richard is like, uhhhh, how do I do that? And Gregory is like, that’s kind of your job. And Richard is like, I thought you were going to hold my hand through this. And Gregory is like, nah, starting a business is fucking hard, welcome to real life kiddo.

It’s a really cool scene because it presents an interesting and fairly novel problem for television: how do you start a (tech) business (in Silicon Valley)? It’s very hard and requires a lot of things to happen. That’d be interesting to watch, maybe. At least it would be different. But the show quickly pivots its attention away from the challenges of inventing and profiting from new technologies and focuses more on the quirks and foibles of its main characters. Why have an interesting discussion of the pitfalls and challenges of creating a business in Silicon Valley when you can have the fat bearded one say something offensive, and then have the mean enemy businessman do something goofy with animals?

My favorite scene in *Silicon Valley* is probably the same as a lot of people’s: it’s the scene where they’re all analyzing how to most efficiently jerk off a crowd of people. Maybe some people thought this scene was funny because the word “dick” gets said a lot. I didn’t exactly find the scene *hilarious*, instead, I found it *interesting*. It was a relatively *honest* portrayal of what it is like to be a nerd in a group of nerds: the intense focus on optimization and the comfortable use of mathematical and scientific jargon in applied settings. It’s that [xkcd comic about how the ultimate pair for computer shopping is a nerd and a normal person since two normal people will buy the dumb thing, the nerd and the normal person will buy the smart thing, and the two nerds will spent hours arguing over minutiae, having completely forgotten the goal.](https://xkcd.com/309/) In the *Silicon Valley* scene, instead of the nerds going “But that does not compute, captain! Illogical to 99.734 percent!” the nerds were actually *being nerds*: seriously doing their best to mathematically determine the optimal approach to jerking off a room full of people, because someone had raised the question and therefore it had to be answered.

But it’s not long after that the writers are back to dumb rude sex jokes. Why do they do that? Part of the problem is that it takes knowledge, of course. How *do* you start a business in Silicon Valley? I dunno. Writers don’t know things. They just write. You either do a lot of research, or you tell dick jokes. George RR Martin has read a ton of history, which is why his books are so fleshed-out, detailed, realistic, and organic. It’s based on real life, and real life is detailed and organic.

**ALERT ALERT ALERT WRITING ADVICE**

if you want to write your epic medieval fantasy it really helps to know, like, *anything* about medieval stuff. or whatever you’re writing. actually knowing things is helpful. It’s a lot easier to innovate on reality than to wholly invent your own. like a billion times easier. in a past life i read about a million first chapters of fantasy books a week from bright-eyed noobs and it’s painfully obvious that most of them have no experience with medieval anything beyond what they’ve experienced from Lord of the Rings and Dungeons and Dragons. your story doesn’t have to be *realistic*, but it really helps to know what reality *is*.

**WRITING ADVICE OVER**

But, uhh, I forgot where I was going with this.

TRANSITIONnnnnSCHWAAHHH TRANSITION NOISES SCHWAAANGGG

So what can we learn about writing evil from Game of Thrones? Are people evil because they have the Evil Gene, as popular culture would have it? Or are people evil because their incentives are bad, as Proper Rational Thought would have it?

neither you sluts keep reading

***

What is the sociology of evil? 

Let’s start with Ramsay Bolton. Was he born evil, or did he have evil thrust upon him? On the one hand, he’s blatantly a psychopath. On the other hand, most psychopaths don’t start wars and torture and kill loads of people. They never get the opportunity.

A great tragedy of modern life is that most people never get the chance to be truly evil. Most people never find themselves at the head of an army or with a significant number of people at their mercy. In real life, we prevent Ramsay Bolton situations, not by keeping people like Ramsay Bolton away from office, but simply by limiting what they can do. We have constitutions and rights and stuff now. If elected Boltons want to torture people, they have to call them terrorists and move them off-site.

Ramsay a psycho, but he was given the opportunity to do evil by the extent of the evilness of the institutions around him. In our world, he would have been an IP lawyer.

There’s a line of argument that the Ramsay Bolton part of it doesn’t even matter at all. Power corrupts, and acquiring and using it effectively requires doing horrible things. For example, the Brotherhood Without Banners are a group of religious fighters sincerely devoted to protecting the people. Yet they also sell innocents to be murdered—they can’t get the gold they need otherwise. Also, as the Brotherhood expands, assholes enter in under their, uh, “banner” and exploit the Brotherhood’s reputation to murder and rob people. So even if you have a good thing, trying to expand it lets the evil in.

Maybe the best example that it’s all incentives in the end is Robb Stark. If Ramsay is evil, and the Brotherhood is somewhere in the middle tending toward good, then Robb is surely Good—after all, he is nice in person and handsome and doesn’t do *pointlessly* evil things. But he does start a war for revenge.

Robb Stark’s war kills thousands of innocent people, or at the very least thousands of people who never wronged him. Killing Joffrey will be personally satisfying, but it will do nothing to help anyone but himself. It will also leave a power vacuum—Robb does not intend to remain in King’s Landing to rule—and will plausibly kill thousands of innocents more in the resulting war. All for one quest of person revenge against a 14-year-old boy.

Is Robb just an asshole after all? Well, there are a couple of facts to consider. The first is that Robb’s people mostly don’t see a problem with this—they live in a culture where killing faceless innocents in revenge is cool if you’re a lord. Apparently, we’re still pretty cool with it today considering how many people still think he was the hero. So how can we judge Robb, a product of his age? 

Moral judgements are very rarely frank evaluations of I-wish-that-had-happened and I-wish-this-hadn’t. Very often we are judging people as potential allies or enemies, and to do that, we would like to know what sort of algorithms they are running on. To that end, we often judge people, not on how good they are, but how good they are *relative to the norm*. Robb is a nice guy *for his era*. Joffrey and Ramsay are not. 

As a comparison, we wouldn’t judge a caveman who believes the world is flat to be stupid. He’s not running on the stupid algorithm. He’s just really ignorant. But someone in the 21st century who believes the world is flat is running some pretty stupid algorithms, even if he knows a lot more than his caveman counterpart.

Scott Alexander once made a taxonomy of racism; we could also make a taxonomy of racism *algorithms*, or reasons to be racist. As Harry explains to Draco about Salazar Slytherin versus Pansy Parkinson, there are people who love to hate, and there are people who just grow up in an ignorant and backwards society. 

Salazar and Robb are both huge dicks, but if we brought them into our circle of friends, they would be cool, so we judge them as cool. Joffrey and Pansy would be dicks anywhere, so we judge them as dicks.

The constraints of incentives are incredibly depressing. Consider Robb’s war against the crown. Suppose that Tyrion became king instead of Joffrey. Would the smart and somewhat decent Tyrion make peace with Robb? Well, Robb demanded independence, so if Tyrion acceded, he would look like a bitch. Bitches don’t remain kings for long. What if Robb decided never to launch a war in the first place? Certainly the moral decision—but again, he would look like a bitch, and bitches don’t remain king for long.

This is the logic of inadequate equilibria which rationalists are so fond of. Even if you have decent, smart people in power, the raw logic of incentives makes them act like stupid bad people. But there are a couple of problems with it. The first is that it only holds if someone else is a bad person. For example, suppose Robb Stark refuses to wage a war of revenge, and so he is assassinated by a vengeful Theon Greyjoy. Well, then Theon is evil. What’s his incentive? Maybe he knows the Greyjoys will wage war against the Starks if they sense weakness, and he doesn’t want to die in the fighting. Then the Greyjoys are evil. What’s there incentive? Well…and so on. These explanations for the general presence of evil seem to assume the very thing they’re supposed to explain. They could explain why it’s hard for a single good person to make a difference unilaterally, but it’s much more likely that most people just aren’t very good in the first place.

Which brings me to my second point: *no ACTION can be rational or irrational.* Only action-value-constraint *triples* can be rational. Why is it rational for Robb to start a war so he can maintain power? Only if he values his own power more than the lives of thousands of innocents. Which makes him an asshole.

It’s like people who join neo-Nazi gangs. Like, sure, you have no support group and whatever, and you feel generally helpless, isolated, and betrayed by society. On the other hand, deciding to beat up minorities is still a moral choice, and it’s a bad one. Culture, institutions, incentives, and whatever else, *explain* choices, they don’t explain choices *away*.

The role of individual morality in society is *very powerful*. We just don’t notice because the variance is so small. Most people in the GOT universe think killing loads of innocents is totally cool as long as you’re a lord and have a personal reason. Most people in our world today think it’s pretty cool with the added caveat that the lord need be handsome and have good interpersonal skills, and the enemy lord be ugly and a douche. 

General moral progress seems to happen rarely, and in huge leaps. Jesus, Buddha, the, I don’t know, Magna Carta, and then a big acceleration in the last few hundred years, similar to the scientific explosion. But it’s slow enough that people just assume it, and then think they’ve assumed it *away*. 

Of course, I blame Robb, but what about the lesser lords who followed him and even the individual soldiers? Just obeying orders isn’t a valid moral excuse in our society. No soldier has the moral right to kill the foe unless the foe attacks him first, and what foe would do that except an evil foe, so here we go assuming evil to explain evil again.

Indeed, the Boltons would seem to be running the same algorithms as the Starks. The Boltons rule with tremendous fear and violence—but that is their way of things, and if they try to modernize and be nice, that will show weakness. The Starks must’ve lucked into a better equilibrium, that’s all.

And yet, Robb was raised by Ned Stark, and Ramsay was raised by Roose Bolton, and that has to count for something. Indeed, it probably counts for quite a lot. Jon, for example, is very honest and honorable even when it’s disadvantageous. That’s a personal moral quality—which is an immense source of confusion to people since it’s a personal quality that comes from outside his person, i.e., from Ned Stark. This is basically the entire confusion over the nature of good and evil—can someone be better than another person, if their betterness doesn’t come from being made of Betterness Molecules?

duhhh yesss ughhhh

Brienne has a conversation with Podrick about how a bunch of boys were mean to her, and she was about to go all Rambo on them, then Renly danced with her and was nice, and it taught her to be nice ever after, and now she doesn’t go all Rambo on people unless they rape and butcher women for allegedly smiling at Lannisters.

duhhh yesss ughhhh

It’s that conversation that Harry has with Dumbledore about winning against bullies. Dumbledore is all like I’m constrained and Harry is all like DO BETTER.

Or, you know, the whole inadequate equilibria thing. Yes, everything is stuck because people are making the best decisions they can given everyone else, and *also yes*, everything could get better if people *unilaterally* made better decisions. 

Dumbledore was making the best decisions *he* could, not the best decisions that *anyone* could.

It’s like *The Wire*. Yeah, the drug people sell drugs and do murders and stuff because of their terrible environments, as the show portrays so well. And the cops and schoolteachers all do their best to contribute to the violence because, you know, they need employment, and they’re just following orders, and they were never in Quirrell’s Battle Magic class so you can’t really consider them responsible for their own decision making.

But someone who lacks intellectual skills because of a lack of education is nevertheless failing due to their lack of intellectual skills. It’s not a judgment. An improvement of individual qualities is definitely sufficient and probably necessary for institutional improvement. You can’t get democracy until people start believing in and valuing a lot of stuff that they don’t naturally. Naturally we’re power-worshippers—look at r justiceporn, it’s amazing that *every* context-free video just happens to feature the *victim* knocking out the bully and not the other way around. We can’t even settle for them both being jerks, the winner is great and the loser is scum.

Hell, look at the absolute hatred for the extremely tragic Joffrey from modern audiences. No matter how obviously unfair his life is, a person we haven’t been *exactly specifically* trained to sympathize with, no matter how plainly sympathetic, is a target for total hatred. What’s the incentive to hate Joffrey? We’re just a bunch of bad people. That’s how power corrupts a nice lady like Dany—humans do have the Evil Gene after all.

In fact, it’s amazing how much of the dissatisfaction at the ending of GoT reflects a failure to comprehend its relatively advanced morals. A sword fight with Jon versus the Night King or Grey Worm would have gone a long way to making everyone happy, despite both of those things being literally pointless. We did get the pointless and gratuitous Cleganebowl, which everyone loved. Ultimately, the problem with the end of GoT wasn’t it’s lack of sociological storytelling, it was just that they didn’t do the character-focused storytelling well. Just imagine the Night King slicing off Jon’s hand and then telling him that *he* is Jon Snow’s father. Then have a dragon shoot down some Tie Fighters. Then Daneryrs…daneryes? How do you spell her name. Then D-LADY sits on the Iron Throne, and yayyy, it turns out the entire problem of the cycle of power is just finding the right person to rule with absolute power. Hire me, Hollywood.

The brilliance of game of thrones is the *balance* between sociology, individuality, and dragons. Yes, there are the great forces, the institutions, the histories, the limited information, the coordination problems, and all that. There are also the individuals whose faults and virtues drive the story to a great extent—Joffrey didn’t have an incentive to kill Ned Stark, he’s just a vicious retard, and that starts the whole fucking thing.

uhhhh 

Let’s talk about sociological storytelling. wouldn’t it be cool if this essay had a point. shut up hands do what i say stop typing this. ur dumb brain. shutup hands.

I think the best way to understand sociological storytelling is that it’s psychological storytelling *on a massive scale*. I love the struggles Robb has keeping a united Northern army and getting them to do what he wants—his issues with the Karstarks, Greatjon, Edmure Tully. Robb’s problem, and what makes this sociological storytelling, is that *the universe does not know that Robb Stark is the main character*. He wants Edmure Tully to lure the Mountain in while the Mountain continues to brutalize Edmure’s home. But actually, *Edmure* is the main character, and he attacks the Mountain because the hero doesn’t miss a chance to drive off the villain torching his villages and towns. That’s why it feels like Robb Stark’s campaign falters due to historical forces—because *real actual* history is the story of *lots* of characters, and none of them are playing to the audience’s expectations.

Worm does this too. It’s got a bajillion characters, and it is very focused on its individual characters and their distinct psychologies as the main method of storytelling. It’s this very focus on *individual character and psychology* that enables such powerful sociological storytelling.

There’s no trade-off. It’s just a question of whether you want to write a book once a year or once a decade. Or, if you’re Wilderbung, the equivalent of ten books a year.

Um. Is that the end of the essay? I guess.

  Maybe he's reasonably assuming that he makes a good enough king and whoever replaces him is likely to be worse, and the net loss from that is more than what it takes to keep him in power?

  And that if you don't punish the evil other people may follow suit?

  You must not be reading the right subs then ;)

  GRRM said he's more a gardener than an architect when it comes to stories (plant the seed, let it grow however it has to grow, organically). This seems to mirror your point about sociological storytelling.

  > A great tragedy of modern life is that most people never get the chance to be truly evil.

  A very, very good point that you've argued sensibly, thank you. So many people think that they wouldn't do any of the shit they see the Hollywood villains do (or read Nazis/Commies did in History books), and then promptly tell all about what "we should" do about all kinds of topic and how people they disagree with must be subhuman, on their Facetumblitter.

    A lot of problems in this world can't realistically be "solved" without a lot of people dying. (Slavery in the US wasn't resolved until the American Civil War, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has people on both sides who would rather die than give in to the other.) The "least evil" strategy for dealing with these kinds of problems is often *not to deal with them* - let the armed insurgency go on for thirty years instead of acting like Saddam Hussein or Stalin and killing as many people as it takes to end it, regardless of whether those people are "innocent" or not. Eventually the insurgents will get old and die, and if you're lucky the next generation won't carry on the fight.

  Read the last four paragraphs, and yes, I agree, and actually, I think you make the good point in a very succinct way:

  "Robb’s problem, and what makes this sociological storytelling, is that the universe does not know that Robb Stark is the main character. He wants Edmure Tully to lure the Mountain in while the Mountain continues to brutalize Edmure’s home. But actually, Edmure is the main character..."

  I think this is really well put, actually. Sociological storytelling (among other factors) then has two parts: from the universe's perspective, there is no main character; from each character's perspective, they are the main character.

  I think PGtE does this really well, as well, and frequently takes huge advantage of the degree to which each person actually is the universe's main character, at least for their part of it.

  Like, in the Pilgrim's universe, he's DEFINITELY the main character. In living Akua's universe, she's definitely the main character. Up until they're not, and I feel like this really comes through when you read their perspective chapters - especially Pilgrim's. Cat (and the Bard) are kind of the only two for whom that's not completely true (ironic, given that Cat is the literal main character).

  Reading the article on sci-am gave me a sour taste of deepity. In fact, if we are going to use xkcd's, then this one https://xkcd.com/435/ seems appropriate. So when prof Tufekci labels Dany's abrupt plunge into cartoonish villainy as 'spontaneous psychology' I can't help cringing. This sociologist is salty, and I know this because GOT writing wasn't psychology. That was just bad, lazy writing, period. So maybe that essay has a point, but HBO!GOT is a poor example to illustrate it because the glaring flaws just obscure the nuance, or maybe leave no room for it whatsoever.

  So in regards to sociological vs psychological writing, and the writing advice I think the distinction is how many actors does the writer simulate and how well he does. It's fairly easy to tell when the writer does not simulate an actor in his story. The Dothraki in the GOT finale is a good example: so they are in this foreign land, their ruler is treacherously killed, and they react... how? Oh, right they just disappear peacefully. If the writers asked themselves how they would feel if they were an average Dothraki rider, it would be apparent to them that they can't and won't go away peacefully, and this issue has to be addressed, somehow. But nope. So failure or unwillingness to simulate enough actors is *laziness* and it's a deadly sin. Then there's *quality*, which stems from how diverse and accurate these actor models are, which is where the 'knowledge of medieval stuff' helps. This is less of a sin, because we, readers, are also biased and are not very good at modeling medieval peasants inside our heads, so we can give presentism a pass. At least to some degree. Ideally, you want to simulate in earnest, but in terms of practicality, building a set of decent Chinese rooms for minor characters is okay. Let's call it our 'Chinese hotel'. Then we add some real models of our main cast to explore this hotel and we have a story that feels *alive* (no laziness) and *authentic* (no, or at least not too much presentism). Last seasons of GOT fail on both count. It wasn't perfect in terms of authenticity from the start (but it was good enough!) but it *really* dropped the ball on laziness.

  This is reductionism, I guess. And yeah, "sociological" writing is just "psychological" writing done non-lazily and authentically on a large-groop scale. 

  AKA Simply Good Writing.
