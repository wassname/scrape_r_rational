  Can I take a moment to rant and rave about WTC for a bit?

  I've been on this manga/isekai kick for around a year, searching for whatever scraps of escapism I could get. In my search for a Light Novel translation that I could stomach, somehow I ended up on /r/rational. 

  "Huh. Worth the Candle: Self-Insert, LitRPG, Alternative Universe - Fantasy. On this weird subreddit about that one "what if Harry Potter made sense" fan fiction(eww) that gets posted as a reddit curiosity every quarter."

  At this point I got blindsided by this fully loaded Australian road train of a story.

  I don't even know where to start. I don't even have the dictionary to express the ways I enjoyed this web serial. I don't understand how a work of such scale and quality can exist in the first place, let alone patiently waiting around for someone to read it on some god-forsaken fanfiction archive without asking for money upfront. 

  There's the infinitely tessellated grid of Aerbs to get lost in, the complicated cast of companions following Joon, some frankly bizarre plotlines, the narrative dissecting itself and every other story I've ever seen, played or read along with it, the examination of what kind of person could actually enjoy getting Isekai'd, just quality fantasy schlock in general, transhumanist dreams and nightmares, the fact that there's seemingly no big bad to the story, apart from the story itself...

  And that's just a fraction of what WTC has on offer. And then it's all kept in check by the /r/rational brand of magic sauce of "having the story make sense". I'm sold on the concept.

  I don't know if I'm just showing how poorly read I am - and the fact that WTC takes time to explore this with Valencia sperging out over Harry Potter just makes my head spin - but this is special. Capital S life changing kind of Special.

  Can I now think about anything that isn't this cursed text, please? It's been almost a month. Absolutely outstanding work.

    For the record, while much of the story's following is here, people often also find it through topwebfiction.com, which isn't all rational stuff, but has a lot of well written web serials.
    ```

  - u/MuonManLaserJab:
    ```
    Totally agree.

    (By the way, did you give *HPMOR* a shot?)
    ```

    - u/signspace13:
      ```
      I did, it was *very* funny for the first 20ish chapters, then it gone *very* dense, and as someone who has never read the actual series, I wasn't devoted enough to the characters to read what was coming across as a text book for entertainment, it was a good text book, but still a text book.
      ```

      - u/MuonManLaserJab:
        ```
        Fair enough. It definitely feels more like a story later -- for example, the foreshadowing in the first chapter ("*Beneath the moonlight glints a tiny fragment of silver, a fraction of a line...*") means something by the end, at which point it feels a little more like a mystery novel because *why didn't I see all that coming?*

        But I agree that, along with the pacing, the "textbook"-like exposition is one of the book's problems. Sadly he has no financial incentive to ever give the book a proper edit.
        ```

      - u/p3t3r133:
        ```
        As someone who read Harry Potter and didn't like HPMoR, knowing the characters from HP adds nothing because they are all changed so significantly the only thing they share is their names
        ```

    - u/Namelis1:
      ```
      I need to read Harry Potter first. Then a bunch of web serials. Then get over "fan-fiction" being a dirty word in my mind.

      So, someday.
      ```

      - u/MuonManLaserJab:
        ```
        I don't imagine I could have made "fan-fiction" not a dirty word to me without reading *HPMOR*. I think "fan-fiction other than *HPMOR*" is still pretty much a dirty word to me...

        It probably makes more sense after reading *Harry Potter*, but I didn't think that series was very good, so I don't know if I'd recommend that. You definitely don't have to read other web serials referenced by *HPMOR*; I didn't (unless I missed a *Worm* reference), so I didn't get some of the jokes (unless I saw them pointed out somewhere), but none of it was significant enough to matter.

        There is a great *Puppet Pals* reference, though (which I also didn't know about until someone pointed out the reference).
        ```

          >You definitely don't have to read other web serials referenced by HPMOR; I didn't (unless I missed a _Worm_ reference)

          There is one in [chapter 100](http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/100):

          >"Wouldn't 'ave been a matter of speed," Hagrid said, giving Draco an indecipherable glance. "Ere's no end ter the ways that creatures hunt. Poison, darkness, traps. Imps as can't be seen or heard or remembered, even while they're eatin' yer face. Always summat new an' wonderful to learn."
          ```

          - u/MuonManLaserJab:
            ```
            Ha! I totally missed that on multiple read-throughs. Goes to show you don't need to get these little references to appreciate *HPMOR*, I guess.
            ```

      - u/Sailor_Vulcan:
        ```
        Fanfiction doesn't exist. There is only fiction, some good and some bad. The whole concept of fanfiction as a distinct and separate category was arbitrarily created by big business interests which killed the public domain and then brought about the cultural stigmatization of any works that build on an idea or concept which someone else is already profiting off of -- works which would have otherwise entered the public domain ages ago, especially if you account for accelerating cultural change as a sort of "inflation" on how quickly a work becomes cemented in common culture and the public consciousness.

        I could write an entire novel by myself, but if it builds off of or references any ideas or concepts that somebody else is making money off of, then that person owns my novel in full, even though they did not write my novel. Luminosity by Alicorn is what Twilight could have been if its author were more intelligent and sensible and better at writing. And yet Twilight gets to be shared on platforms where the generally public will actually be able to see it, in bookstores and libraries, while the much higher quality and thought provoking "fanfiction" is forced to be relegated to obscurity, and thus censored. Stephanie Meyer has a virtual monopoly on novels which build on or remix Twilight, and any such works exist only as long as she permits them to, even though some of those works are significantly better than the original Twilight.

        Sturgeons law 90 percent of everything is crap, but "original" fiction has access to gatekeepers in the publishing industry who clean up all the crap through editors and rejections.

        "Fanfiction" is barred access to those gatekeepers, and so readers have to wade through heaps of garbage to find the gems. This reinforces the stereotypes about "fanfiction" and thus prevents people from caring about the death of the public domain because they dont know what they've lost in the process.
        ```

        - u/Makin-:
          ```
          Fanfiction literally means fiction written by fans of a work, mainly using concepts from that work. It exists, and the name is fitting.

          Even if you were arguing it's an useless word, I find it useful to know whether something is say a Naruto fic before reading it, because then I know (*edit: for the vast majority of fanfics*) I have to have watched or read some Naruto in order to get the most out of it. It's a good thing that fanfics aren't expected to reintroduce every single basic concept and character, and that can only happen if you're told you're expected to experience the original work (which obviously means that's also valuable. Yes, even Twilight).

          I think what you're actually saying is that IP law is too restrictive, and I wholeheartedly agree, but you're choosing the worst way to express that.
          ```

      - u/I_Probably_Think:
        ```
        HPMOR was the fanfic that helped me realize "fan-fiction doesn't actually have to be bad, there's just a lot more of it that *is* bad." That said, I found parts of it to be grating (even though most of the time I found it extremely funny/engaging), and personally prefer *Pokémon: on the Origin of Species*.

    I went through basically exactly the same series of events except my first series was Mother of learning, which is every bit as good as WTC, it boggles my mind that work of this quality isn't getting published, especially with MoL because it is so well suited for that format, I have been reading webnovel for years (initially translated ones of the Chinese variety) and understand the pressures that doing something like this for a living put on an author, though obviously not all authors do, and the differences in quality and continuity that this format of ten produces, bit some of the novels I have found since I found r/rational and topwebfiction.com are so good that it boggles my mind, to the point that they are some of the best series I have read. Worth the Candle, Mother of Learning, WORM, and A Practical Guide to Evil are those novels, and I can't imagine not having read them at this point.

      ```
      >it boggles my mind that work of this quality isn't getting published

      Publishers are slowly catching on to the potential of publishing webfiction in hard copies because it's a conservative industry. With american comics nowhere near as popular as manga, comparatively, publishers don't already have a habit of publishing cheaply made, niche works.

      What *would* need to happen for the english-language publishing business to thrive on publishing webfiction would be to drop the prices on both books and ebooks by quite a bit, reduce editorial oversight of YA books, and introduce more works targeting towards young boys (think shonen and younger seinen age), because young boys currently read at rates far less than girls. But in the english language market, Amazon's monthly kindle offering is already sort of the beacon for publishing polished webfiction, and with its exclusivity contract, publishers can't pick up books by authors on the platform, so they can't see the promise of webfiction because it'd already out of their reach, for the most part.
      ```

        Self-publishing on Amazon is pretty easy... In theory.

        I used to think that the publishing industry was pointless, just a middleman taking a cut from the authors but no longer necessary in the days of Amazon and Lulu. Now that I've published a few things I realize that a publishing house is extremely valuable, because it's a one-stop shop for editing, cover creation, and marketing. Those are things that you can either do yourself or pay for individually, but there is definitely value in having someone else do it.

        Still, getting your work out to the public for sale is not difficult.

        What would you say about the quality of the prose?

        I just clicked on *Metaworld Chronicles* because it's at the top of topwebfiction right now, and I noped out when I saw the word "blaring" twice in the first two sentences...
        ```

        - u/TheFaceOfAThing:
          ```
          mol has significantly worse prose. i wouldn't say *bad*, per se, but def mediocre. the lower end of what i would expect if i were to go to a bookstore and pick up a random novel. wtc is comparatively much cleaner.

          looking at the first few paragraphs of each from the perspective of some hypothetical editor, this is pretty obvious:

          >Zorian's eyes abruptly shot open as a sharp pain erupted from his stomach. His whole body convulsed, buckling against the object that fell on him, and suddenly he was wide awake, not a trace of drowsiness in his mind. 

          >"Good morning, brother!" an annoyingly cheerful voice sounded right on top of him. "Morning, morning, MORNING!"

          even aside from the trying-too-hard "zorian", there's some pretty flagrant overuse of adverbs, the prosody is at odds with the content, etc. this is text that i can read without discomfort (we won't, at least, find a mistake in grammar until the fourth paragraph), but i certainly won't enjoy it. 

          > I strained against the collar that held my neck in place, trying to get a better look around. My hands and feet were both cuffed, with thick metal bars connecting the cuffs to each other, resulting in no give at all. I had a gag in my mouth as well, but that was a little bit looser.

          >Five seconds ago, I had been passing notes in fifth period English. 

          this isn't stand-out prose by any metric, but it's certainly competent. the only major complaint i have is with "but that was a little bit looser", which is awkward, but it's also clearly necessary to maintain the sentence pacing. i don't immediately know what to do to improve it, which to me is a good sign. the scene-setting is inoffensive, the punchline is punchy, and in all this prose smoothly conveys me to the parts of the work that i'm interested in.


          as an aside, i'm surprised that /u/Namlis1 says that they have a distaste for fanfic; ime the general quality of writing for fanfic is miles higher than that for original webfiction. the only webfic authors i've been able to tolerate have been wildbow and aw, despite what probably are more than a hundred attempts at reading other popular web serials. by comparison maybe one in twenty stories on sv have prose i find tolerable.

          i suppose the difference in our experiences is probably due to fandom and platform; the average pmmm fic is miles better than the average worm fic is lightyears better than the average hp fic, and likewise for ao3 vs. ffn or whatever

    Can I just piggyback off your comment to rant and rave about how intelligent _Worth the Candle_ is?

    For example, when they are discussing the Demonblooded Festival, Juniper remarks on the injustice of executing someone just because of how they were born, and Grak mentions that the Demonblooded is supposed to be a criminal. The second I read that, before I read the next paragraph, I was thinking "wait, that doesn't make any sense. Assuming this festival is held once a year, isn't it an astounding coincidence that they always have a condemned Demonblooded on hand for execution? How many Demonblooded are there in this city, and how many murders or whatever can they commit?" Then I read on and I was gratified to see Juniper echoes the exact same thoughts I had, because that's the _obvious_ thing for an intelligent man to wonder when he hears that.

    Another example, when asked why she wants to become a combat mage, Lisi casually replies that it's her comparative advantage. She doesn't even have to explain the concept; Alexander Wales _expects_ his audience to be familiar with the idea of comparative advantage, or willing to research it, and he's justified in that assumption. And yet again when Oberlin mentions talking to Finch securely using one-time pads, without bothering to explain what they are or how they can provide secure communications in a society without computers.

    You don't _see_ this shit outside of rational fiction and maybe hard science fiction (Greg Egan is the only professional author I can think of who writes like this). I'm guessing if you tried this with a professionally published work, some editor would slap you down and tell you to stop alienating normies. And for all I know he would be right, and a book without these things would sell better. But, dammit, I _want_ fiction aimed at people like me!

    _Worth the Candle_ is smart fiction with smart characters written by a smart author for smart people. I can't tell you how _refreshing_ that is.

    > let alone patiently waiting around for someone to read it on some god-forsaken fanfiction archive without asking for money upfront.

    I think you very much underestimate the reader base of sites like fanfiction.net, archiveofourown.org, etc. And to a lesser degree, a subreddit like this one.

    I suspect there are five to ten thousand people reading this serial. I can't even guess how many people were reading Worm as it was written. If you want to compare to published authors with tens of millions of readers I guess that's small potatoes, but the average published novel only sells something like 5000 copies in its lifetime, and might gather some multiple of that in readers from used sales and libraries and such. Compared to that, stories here are not at all "god-forsaken".
    ```

    - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
      ```
      Yeah, 5-10K is about what I peg it at. The story has close to 4K kudos on AO3, which would be consistent with about half the readers taking the time to click that little button, about what I expect as far as engagement for readers. Reddit somewhat recently removed the ability to see hits on posts, but when had that, threads like these were between 2K-3K, which again, is about what I expect for engagement (i.e. most people just read the work and none of the discussion). Tracking hits from just before a chapter is posted to roughly a week after is probably one of the most accurate ways of getting numbers, and by that metric it's ~7K.

      I actually read MoL first, before WtC.

      It was interesting and gripping in its own certain, maybe clinical way, but I didn't engage with it. I didn't care for the characters much, nor did I find myself caring much about the world around them. The time looping nature of the story reseting any character development doesn't help. 

      It did walk me through the paces of what rational fiction is, though.
      ```

        - u/Namelis1:
          ```
          I get the appeal of MoL, I really do. It's a neat idea and works in a lot of ways.

          The more I think about it, the more MoL sounds to me like a "hard" Sci-Fi story. It's built solely around a neat concept and the author sees where he can take it, within its rigid ruleset. It's just set in a fantasy setting incidentally.

          And man, hard Sci-Fi despises characters. Mostly because they get in the way of the big idea.

            I probably should listen to it more, however there are a few episodes which I think you might like. You should listen to episodes 6 & 7, Magic Systems, where they talk about exactly what you just mentioned. And by exact, I mean exact. How sci-fi and fantasy end up very similar, having their own magic system that can be hard or soft. Really, just go listen to it. :)

      Any idea how close it is to conclusion, and what the update schedule is like? I'm not sure if I want to be compulsively F5'ing *another* serial.
      ```

      - u/Green0Photon:
        ```
        It's really close to finishing. Probably just a few more chapters left. (Since the story is about a time loop, and they just left the time loop, now they just need to resolve everything. There's a lot of plot threads though.)

        The author updates regularly every three weeks and have been doing so since he started (~2011 I think), though occasionally he says he's going to have to postpone a week. So technically it might be a few months until the absolute conclusion, but the progress is very steady.

        If you don't want to repeatedly F5, you can make a fictionpress account, which you quickly do with a Google account, which emails on an update. The story is also split into three parts, so you can read the first two and wait until this sub explodes that it's done sometime before the end of the year. No need to compulsively update.

        I also read a ton of fanfiction, so I just compulsively check my email instead for update alerts.

    Maybe he'd be able to handle it if he'd leveled SOC a bit more?  I definitely think confronting it will be a good thing, but he still can't just go back to his doppelganger's home town; the world's ending like a dozen different ways and there's a lot of exclusion zones to dungeon crawl through.

  So, Juniper is 5/12ths of the way through is overall character arc. Character growth seems less exponential than combat power, and much less conducive to progressing off screen. So assuming that it's linear, and that Juniper will have an A by the end of the story...

  (WtC was published 540 days ago, 540 * 7/5 = 756...)

  Worth the Candle will be completed on January 30th, 2021, with a total word count of 2.05 million, so roughly 1.2 million words to go. There are no possible flaws with this methodology.

  Am I the only one who got the feeling we are about to see a WtC send up of Harry Potter when we had a scene with 3 students in a school for wizards suddenly forming a friend group (MC, girl and boy), and a combat magic class while a teacher gives a speech that had a certain number of parallels to Quirrel's intro from HPMOR?  

  Likely just a coincidence or nod given the style of WtC isn't generally to reference things like that for plotlines, but Harry Potter IS already relevant to the story and it would definitely be entertaining in a Juniper-exasperated-by-the-game-world way...

  Time to let y'all know what we've been busy with over on **[the *Worth the Candle* wiki](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Worth_the_Candle_Wiki)**...

  Summaries are complete for chapters 7-10, courtesy of Daniel111111222222 on the Discord: "[Twenty Questions](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Twenty_Questions)", "[Diamond and Iron](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Diamond_and_Iron)", "[Making Magic](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Making_Magic)", and "[Sewer Rat](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Sewer_Rat)".

  u/Makin-'s been hard at work on pages for the story's main cast: [Juniper Smith](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Juniper Smith), [Amaryllis Penndraig](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Amaryllis_Penndraig), [Fenn Greenglass](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Fenn_Greenglass), [Grakhuil Leadbraids](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Grakhuil_Leadbraids), [Oorang Solace](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Oorang_Solace) (and the [Six-Eyed Doe](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Six-Eyed_Doe)), [Valencia the Red](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Valencia_the_Red), [Bethel](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Bethel), [Pallida Sade](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Pallida_Sade), [Raven Masters](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Raven_Masters), [Arthur Blum](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Arthur_Blum) and the new friend.............. [LISI](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Lisianthus_Penndraig).

  He's also compiled a [list of skills](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Skills), a [list of entads](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_entads) and a [timeline](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline).

  Jaczac's contributed a page for [still magic](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Still_magic), which is particularly relevant for this update, and one for the [Anyblade](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Anyblade).

  I've been occasionally throwing stuff onto the page for [Earth](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Earth), which basically tries to collect everything Juniper's ever said about Earth and its locations in the story.

  In terms of new templates, I've thrown together a couple of disambiguation notices to put at the top of future pages: [Disambig2](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Disambig2) (for two similarly-named pages) and [Disambig3](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Disambig3) (for when three or more might be confused). The new [Flashback](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Flashback) template can be used to mark a character who only appeared in a flashback in a summary's cast page. Oh, and maybe check out [Category:Fanart](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Fanart) - a place where I'm looking to collect any and all unofficial art that gets produced for the story.

  Finally, I've also tried to give something of an overhaul to [the TVTropes page](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WorthTheCandle) for the story. *Worth the Candle* should interest TVTropes users, but the story has very few crosswicks there and I can't imagine it gets much traffic from the site as things stand. If general wiki editing isn't your thing, but you know a few relevant tropes, maybe throw them up - and don't forget to link to the story from the trope pages themselves.

  My thanks go out to everyone that's contributed over the last month, even just in the form of pulling out key information from the text for others. If you want to show your support for the story by helping out, just say hi in the wtc-wiki channel of the Discord server (linked at the end of the last chapter) - **no experience necessary.**

  For some reason this update feels shorter even though it doesn't have less words than previous ones. Was it the long wait (I know, I know, Christmas)? Or that we're again on the brink of Happenings™? Next update can't come soon enough.

  Incidentally, even though as far as I can count Raven was the 7th person to get the companion status, do you think that Fenn getting completely removed from the GUI means it's possible that we'll be picking up another companion here? If so, hopefully that's Reimer (or even Tiff) rather than Lisi as I'm with Reimer on her being kind of threatening and we already have Bethel to fill that role. Though I'm afraid that the No Longer Dice Guy would probably find it amusing to hoist a (excuse the weeb terms) kuudere vs. yandere tug of war on our dear Juniper.

  Also, I do have another fanart, this time of our dearly departed Fenn back from her "meet cute (with zombies!)" routine. I'm not sure if I'm satisfied with it (I dun goof'd on the scars for one and it's generally not as nice as Mary turned out), but here you go none the less — [https://i.imgur.com/tHvt28k.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/tHvt28k.jpg).

  so we got an ominous line during valencia’s point of view: that she’s tried to manipulate people before (implied: it went poorly). obvious allusion to fenn. she came off as somewhat addicted to using devils.

  we also got a few more chekhovs. it is probable that juniper will eventually interact with fake tiff, fake other friends, fake parents, in descending order of likelihood. it also seems reasonable that the next arc after the athaenium will involve the penndraigs. 

  finally there was the thrown away line from the instructor about walking a path made by others. this is, of course, exactly what juniper is doing, so it could either be a reference to uther, a reference to the dm, or a new subplot. 

  i am still waiting for a dmpc reveal or similar. none of juniper’s close companions have tried to stab him in the back yet; it’s unlikely none of them ever will.
  ```

  - u/GeeJo:
    ```
    Valencia's line was troubling for what it implies about the past; Grak's line is troubling for what it implies about the future:

    > Grak was pleased with himself; he’d been useful.

    That is not a healthy indicator for Grak's self-worth.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      oh yeah meant to include that. it reminded me heavily of something i can’t place. had sort of a “he loved big brother” vibe but that’s not it. 

      it’s also an odd line to write, because grak’s warding makes him an essential member of any team like juniper’s, all the time. he is useful basically every chapter... but *narratively* this often gets skated over. (they entered. grak set up wards. the others began talking while grak sat silently.)

      i wonder if the author is deliberately highlighting a difference between normal usefulness (setting up wards) and narrative usefulness (advancing the plot by getting info). grak is keenly aware of what happens to narratively-irrelevant characters. 

      so it may mean more than just his declining mental health. i don’t think it makes sense viewed through that lens, because if grak values himself only in terms of helping juniper, he knows his value lies far more in warding than in intelligence collection. in my opinion the line only makes sense narratively.
      ```

    - u/Makin-:
      ```
      Honestly, I think maybe people for once are looking too deeply into this. It's good to feel good after doing good things, and it was Grak's idea in the first place, for mostly personal reasons.

    > finally there was the thrown away line from the instructor about walking a path made by others. this is, of course, exactly what juniper is doing, so it could either be a reference to uther, a reference to the dm, or a new subplot.

    I read that as a request for a secret passphrase that fell flat because Juniper isn't part of whatever secret organization she thought he was in.

    Regarding Valencia: I interpreted that more as her trying to help people become better, but recalling that her unique tools are very very sharp and that her ability to use them is not perfect.

    *Based on what we knew before*, Grak's whole section in 143 has pronoun-use problems, both on da nad own part and when da thinks about other dwarves like the police-folk. It's plausible that it's Juniper-as-Narrator being his usual chauvinistic self in his 3rd-person-omniscient insights into Grak's thoughts, or even that this is a *deliberate* demonstration that Grak has internalised the Imperial perspective on the issue, given the other insights the chapter offers into Grak's self-image issues. But on the off-chance it's just an oversight, better to point it out than not.
    ```

    - u/cthulhuraejepsen:

      I just think it reads awkwardly. There's currently a note at the end of ch 137 which reads:

      > Special note: If you'd like a version of this first half of this chapter which uses non-gendered Groglir pronouns, it's available here. This is more true to Grak's internal understanding of da-self, but it gets in the way of the story (in my opinion).

      And then links to [this](https://archiveofourown.org/works/16690513), which is the first half of that chapter, from Grak's POV, with Groglir pronouns. I haven't really found any solutions that I like for the problem (and I've tested all the obvious ones, like writing around it, using singular they, etc.). Probably means that Grak will get fewer POVs in the future, because it's going to bug people no matter what.

    Couldn't make sense of this. Bursar seemed to be heavily implying that greasing his palms would make things faster. But the *donation* line is a month, so the Special Returning line is definitely shorter. Assuming Joon is asking to combine the two, wouldn't it be shorter, not longer?

      TWI does the variety/slice of life thing very well, it's got a wide range of mostly likable and interesting characters doing different things in ways that often rebound off each other.

      But the quality of the prose and moment-to-moment plotting is...not great. It's super tropey, in particular the constant "I can't believe [main character] is so amazingly [good/strong/unusual but charming]" kind of grates on me.

        While I agree with this assessment in general, I find that The Wandering Inn, when it gets up a good head of steam, is just masterful at sweeping me up along in it. That’s really the thing I look for in any sort of art or story.

        Nothing’s perfect and no story is going to have the same appeal for everyone. Is the prose the best? No. Could it use an editor? For Christ’s sake, it’s a story which often produces just shy of 40,000 words *per week.* That’s batshit insane. Of course it could use an editor. But as a freeform work, I find it immensely enjoyable despite its flaws.

        Trust me, I had the same reaction. I thought it was gonna be cheap dime-store isekai genre schlock. Needs a hard edit, that first chapter does. But it was mostly done in an experimental sort of style/narrative voice that isn’t in the rest of the story. Stick with it for a few more chapters and you’ll see what I mean.

        I mean, in fairness, I also gave the hard side-eye to the premise and first few chapters of Worth the Candle, and I sure as hell don’t regret withholding judgement for a while on that one either.

            The answer is no, it is not always like that. Not even mostly like that. In fact, it’s pretty much confined to the earliest few chapters. Which, if you think about it, the first chapter is just about the least optimal chapter to be the worst chapter, because it turns off a bunch of people right out the gate. Thankfully it’s short. Still, the author *really* needs to correct it, and I think they might have for the ebook version.

            All the same, the rest of it is still extremely enjoyable. I currently support the author on Patreon, that’s how much I like it. The only other authors I support are D.D. Webb and Wildbow.

    I think it's the generic strength and speed buffs you can do with blood magic.  It's not a specific spell, it's just "my blood makes me physically better".  Joon spams it so much in combat it doesn't even get noted any more.

  Lisi feels like Amaryllis' nerdier sister. I assume they even studied together at some point, if Amaryllis spent 5 years there. Lisi seems to be further along already, so maybe that 6 std means she's actually smarter than Mary? 

  I'm noting that the power scaling of Blood Magic feels pretty weak. Mary's quite smart and 5 years only left her with a finger flame and enhanced punch. Maybe the scaling of practical use is quicker once you slog past the theory?

    >This is just begging to be abused/munchkined.

    I think that's the joke. Without knowing *ex ante* what the virtues are going to be for any given skill, who would ever actually dedicate time to Woodworking in a game/world where you need fighting and magic to get anything worthwhile done? Same thing for Accounting, as mentioned in the chapter, and probably several other seemingly useless skills.

      Short answer:

      > **Aches and Plains** - Perhaps farming might seem an innocuous thing to evoke the exclusionary principle, but given the time and attention brought to it by a billion minds, it was inevitable that someone would breach its deeper secrets. The land of Pai Shep is now guarded by a single warrior-farmer, his fields impeccable, his power absolute.

      You're right that the average combat-minded Aerbian would never dedicate precious time to Woodworking because they simply *don't know* the secrets of reality. But it's different for Joon or any PC with a GUI because they have the knowledge that there is a worthwhile (for a certain *worth*) virtue at the end. 

      I think the Woodworking 100 reveal was an intentional tease. There's guaranteed to be limitations, but it's a wink from the DM that even worthless-sounding skills can have a huge payoff. Yet Joon isn't likely to achieve 100 in any skill naturally and will probably never find out all the virtues. The morals are (1) choose wisely for those 40 skill slots and (2) soul magic is OP.

  Crazy theory: maybe Earth!Juniper actually is fictional.  The Dungeon Master witnessed Aerb!Juniper's bizarro rules system and decided it would be funny to alter reality to run on those rules; then he created an alternate personality for Aerb!Juniper so that he wouldn't have too much of an advantage when playing the game.

    Either he doesn't care because it's not a priority compared to the secrets of the universe (manual of his home game) or it's an extension of his attitude towards his past life. He doesn't want to know anything about his doppelganger's parallel life because of all those awkward interpersonal issues.

    Though Joon's situation is really fun food for thought: if you were sent to a parallel alternate universe where you replaced "yourself," what would that be like? You meet your friends, whose mannerisms match perfectly but share a set of experiences just different enough that you're always aware of the transposition. Even without the falling-out and drama, I'm not sure if I'd ever be able to feign memory loss and integrate back into that uncanny valley.

    Maybe Arthur went through a similar experience, at one remove. Unlike Joon, all the familiar faces and characters he met only resembled his past on the surface or metaphorically. I could see where he started treating everyone as NPCs, as -without the tug of a goal like Joon has with The Lost King- his whole life is a divine joke.

  Alas, I'm late to the party.  A few thoughts of my own:

  * What if one sidequest is Joon reconciling with all of his friends - each has a substantial slice of his quests?  It would be worthwhile to ask if Aumann was a quest for them, et cetera.  That would make for a surreal experience for fake-friends, as their fantasies become reality in a strange way.
  * I always wondered what the DM said to Joon.  I guess we know one of them now: most likely, that Joon got an offer to be taken out of his world and placed in a simpler one without the hells and grimdark of his current world.  Less likely, but the last two redactions become obvious now too

  >“I’ll do it,” I said. “Can I … what happens to me, when I leave Earth? I’d like to leave a note or something.” *If I was really here, was Earth even real?* “I don’t want to hurt anyone.”  
  >  
  >“>!An alternate Juniper from another world takes your place!<,” he replied.  
  >  
  >“Oh,” I replied. “Okay, I guess that works. Unless >!I win and become God!<?”  
  >  
  >“Then >!you can do whatever you want, if you feel like it!<,” he replied.  
  >  
  >“And that’s the whole deal?” I asked. “I go through to this place, Aerb, I play the part of a hero, I fix everything there forever, if I can, and in return ... I don't have to worry about Earth?”

  * What if Joon decides that he wants to go home and make amends, and the final boss is other-joon who has been questing back at home?  Winner gets to go home, loser is dead.  This doesn't make a ton of sense, since there's less questing to do on earth, and Arthur is a better final boss, but it's also a fun idea.
  * On another note, the combination of the Void and Sable has not been adequately explored.  If the void effect goes through "six inches of flesh and bone, half an inch of steel, or five hundred feet of air", then you can apply directionality to the void effect by simply wrapping it in a cube of steel at least 1.1 inches on a side (well, only the base is flat, the other sides can be a sphere to save on mass).  Remove a cone from this cube to define the direction in which the void propogation will happen, and design the object so that it triggers instantly upon being exposed to light.  Activate them in an extremely dark place, with known orientation, and suck them all up with sable.  The next time you're in trouble, and OK with an indiscriminate destruction, unleash a bunch of those puppies in the direction of your foe.  You can now stand in one place, your allies all behind you, and  blow away your enemy with ease.  Unleashing several at once would allow you to destroy the intervening air before it can be sucked in from the sides-this would improve range.
     * I'm sure that all of this will raise the ire of the Void Beast

  Oh wow, this is a long one. Here's my stream-of-thought, on second read:

  > When the counter-imperialists failed to seize power for themselves, as everyone thought they would

  - Everyone thought that they'd seize power, or that they'd fail to seize power?

  > “Not sure,” replied Pallida. “Ransomed it off, maybe, but that’s always partnered with its own problems, because naturally, people don’t want to give you money, they want you dead and their stuff back.”

  > True to her word, Pallida left us behind when we got to the campus proper, insisting that she was going to ‘do her own thing’ and would meet up with us later

  - I'm getting strong "Fenn's new PC" vibes from Pallida. Similar humor, similar background, showed up a little before Fenn died...

  - Also, she's totally going to get a warrant on her head before this arc is over.

  > “Helps me think,” he said, frowning at me.
  >
  > “I know,” I replied. I designed the he’lesh. “It’s my understanding that it’s not considered rude to ask which you just took?”
  >
  > “Indignation,” replied the bursar, narrowing his eyes at me. “You want to skip not one line, but two.”

  - So this species needs to take drugs to feel specific emotions or mindsets? That's an interesting concept.

  > "No, no, I told him that I could arrange it, but I never said that it would be completely without caveats, and because there’s no money changing hands, my hands, are, eh, tied."

  - That seems like a really easy to solve. How expensive can it be to bribe a unique-in-the-world academic institution that's powerful enough to control its own city-state and.. yeah, okay, I see why it might be too expensive.

  > You must take classes, at least for long enough that you can have four instructors sign off.

  - Uuuuugh. So it's not just a sidequest, it's an *open-world* sidequest, where you have to win over multiple NPCs each with their own problems and agenda. The DM *really* liked his "Return to school" level.

  > but it would be better to not have it come to light that the bursar was using his discretion in such a manner.

  - Well that doesn't look like a Chekov's gun at all, especially since you're the second person to mention this.

  > Things started clicking into place. “I was,” I said. I shrugged. “Trial by adversity.”

  - Juniper is being very smooth about this. I'd have probably given the game away at that point.

  > The first night they had slept together, he had been hesitant, but she had removed his clothes with deft fingers and pressed her skin against his own.

  - So we're leaving the "this is something the other characters told Joon later on" framing device, uh?

  > She had thought she could manipulate people before.

  - Dew it!

  > “They’re about a young orphan who becomes a wizard. Would you like to read them?”

  - This whole Harry Potter thing reminds me of a passage from Glimwarden:

  > (It was with some dismay that Melanie realized Eden’s Waltz was an overly sugared coming-of-age story mired in its own unreality. The author of The Cafard’s Contradiction was using the book to say something subtly unkind about Odessa’s naivete.)

  > “She has the Dagger of Dreamspeech,” said Amaryllis. “She can look into our dreams.” 

  - Well Bethel keeps getting creepier.

  > “Speak like that inside me again, and I’ll kill you all.” She began ripping Tiff apart, limb by limb, moving with furious calm.

  - At some point, Joon needs to have a serious conversation with Bethel about the appropriateness of death threats in a functional relationship. They're treating it all as a joke when I feel this should really be more of a dealbreaker, given how easy killing seems to be for her.

  > “So send Tiff a fucking letter then, asshole!” asked Reimer.

  - In retrospect, "Not checking up on your previous identity's relatives and telling them what happened" is a decision that makes perfect sense as a PC, and makes you look like a complete scumbag as a human being. Joon is essentially treating the Aerb version of his friends as completely disposable and not worth the time to interact with them. I mean, obviously there are opsec concerns there, and it's not like Joon has the free time to rebuild his relationship with them... but on the other hand, they're probably the people in Aerb most able to understand what Joon is going through, and they probably *do* have intelligence that Mary could conceivably use.

  > “You’re weak,” Raven replied. “You were also impaired, but beyond that, you were weak. I’m not at the peak of my power anymore, and even then, the fight we had, it was like you were one of the enemies I sometimes had to deal with on my own, not trivial, but not strong. The kind that Uther could kill by the handful as a prelude to the real battle. The kind of enemy that I would fight one-on-one while the real battle was happening elsewhere.”

  - What the hells was Uther fighting by the end of his reign, and how the hells was he fighting them? Raven is making it sound like a succession of DBZ fights, but realistically, I'd expect these kind of fights to end much quicker than in DBZ, because whoever is stronger would likely be an order-of-magnitude stronger, and probably experienced and pragmatic enough to go for the throat from the get go.

  > "Maybe he would have, if she hadn’t tried so hard to force women on him."

  - That does sound a little odd. I mean, I can totally buy Uther wanting to stay faithful, but this feels a little bit forced. Plus it still feels like an un-fired Chekov's gun. Although maybe Zona just *really* wanted him to be happy.

  > There was something off about the wine we were drinking, and when we opened the keg … I still have trouble with wine sometimes.”

  - For the record, I'm imagining a race of evil wine-spiders that lay magic eggs in wine that burrow in your veins and transform your body into a cocoon when you drink it.

  - Wait, no, she was *drowned* in the wine? What the... why?

  > I took me a moment to realize that she was talking about Reimer, who had been toiling away in the other room. I got up, took one last look at Bethel’s impassive face, then went to go join him.

  - I don't know why, I keep imagining Bethel as Moira from Overwatch. Probably the stern personality and affinity for murder.

  >  “I want more,” I said. “Everything that you can remember. Everything.”
  >
  > “I’d be here all night,” Reimer complained.

  - All things considered, Reimer is being a pretty good sport about this. The money probably helps, but he could probably poke a lot of holes in Joon's cover story if he didn't feel like playing along. I know if *my* long-lost friend showed up, claimed to have amnesia, and instead of asking about our home life, wanted a complete description of our tabletop games... I'd probably be way more frustrated than Reimer.

  >  He’d been reticent to let them in, but Valencia had taken the reins, and from there, it hadn’t taken her too much to get him to open up. My dad, the real one back on Earth, never opened up, except a few times when he was drunk. [...] After a search of his house, which he’d for some reason consented to, they had gone to my mom’s house, which had produced nothing worthwhile, then over to speak with a few of the fake versions of my friends, none of which produced any fruit.

  - That seems surprisingly smooth. Nobody question an heavily armed squad coming in from nowhere and asking questions about Joon?

  - The way Joon keeps insisting that Aerb's versions of his friends are fake is a little sad. I'm kind of hoping that we get so see them interact with the cast (especially Mary and Grak, since Fenn... well, she's dead).

    - I like that description. Like, the guy doesn't *need* party tricks to be heard. Very military-like.

    - I'm getting a very strong "HPMoR Quirrell" vibe from his "gun speech". Also, I love how he just casually shows a highly illegal weapon to his students in his introductory course. That guy doesn't fuck around.

    - Also, I really like the implication that the vast majority of students came here for a self-defense class or just for academic credits and end up studying next to the kind of people who say "I've killed people before and I will probably have to do it again in the course of my job".

    > To my surprise, Lisi raised her hand too, not casually, but like she was straining to make sure it was noticed.

    - She *does* have a Hermionne Granger vibe (except evil). Oh my, we really *are* doing the Harry Potter arc.

    > If you are a combat mage, you will likely be working for either the Third Empire or one of its member polities at the behest of Sound and Silence. That employment often comes with political and mission constraints, which might limit lethality. To give one example, hostage taking has been an effective aspect of warfare since the dawn of time. More insidiously, sometimes the powers-that-be wish to limit casualties because of how it would appear to the public, even if that requires risking a mage’s life.

    - Oh wow. I don't know if this is because Anglecynn is a seriously militaristic country, because combat mages are special forces and expected to act like it, or just because he personally had a rough career, but this guy *doesn't fuck around*. I'm a little intimidated. I mean, what about regular police operations? There's a large range of situation where overwhelming force is useful but you don't necessarily want to kill your targets, right?

    > “And I’m, what, some unconnected person who you know is clean?” I asked. Gods, how many times had I used that line as a DM?

    - Ooh, that's a good one. I'll be sure to steal it.

    - Also, careful, you're getting native with the swearing here.

    >  Oberlin gave me a skeptical look. “No,” he said. “Are you the kind of idealist that thinks soul mages aren’t out there, manipulating things as best they can from beneath the screenings that the Third Empire does? Do you think the Third Empire doesn’t have tame soul mages of its own to rip their way through captured prisoners?”

    - Oh my god, I love this guy.

    > “Like I was ever going to listen,” said Reimer. “You’re trying to push me out of this like I’m some NPC.”

    - I mean, PCs are the guys who have to double-check every conversation they have at the grocery shop to make sure they're not about to get ambushed and murder. Are you sure you've thought this through.

    > "It’s a trite Utherian observation that everyone is the hero of their own story"

    - I love these worldbuilding bits. They feel so... digested. Like the world is made of a consistent culture, that has been exposed to the worldbuilding for centuries, and developed it own relation to it, including philosophy and litterature and clichés that everybody's tired of.

    > The first concrete action that the Second Empire took was to topple the troll kings and institute leadership of their own, administrators who would oversee what was only barely a government and institute the particular type of planned economy that was in vogue at the time. They dealt with the inevitable problems that follow from that sort of thing, which the Second Empire would become well-acquainted with over the years, dissident populations, asymmetric warfare, worker strikes, and the general problems that come with governance by force rather than governance by consent

    - In general, I love the concept of the Second Empire, and it's definitely something I'm going to steal in future fantasy stories. It's not especially original (evil empire with general Nazi parallels), but the execution feels like something I've never seen elsewhere (except a little bit in *Shadows of the Limelight*). The Empire isn't just evil, it's broken, and that broken-ness defines everything it does, how it operates, how it fails to operates, and how entire civilizations saw themselves even centuries after its destruction.

    > Maybe I should have mentioned this before, but our instructor was demonblooded.

    - What *is* the demonblooded's deal? I mean, obviously, people who have an ancestor who's a demon, but how does that even happen? How shitty is their parent's life? I honestly pretty curious.

    > Most of you aren’t here because you really want to be. [...] This course is required for anyone going into combat or biological tracks, and for many, it will seem like a burden. [...] You will be transformed such that the ethical mode of thought is your default.”

    - I can *taste* the sound of students thinking "Okay, that's cool and all, but is any of this going to be in the exam?"

    > Less obviously, the solution was to teach people to be ethical, which was to be done early in the education process for people who were going to find themselves in a fair bit of power. I couldn’t tell whether this was laughably idealistic thinking, or simple virtue signaling, but I was leaning toward the latter. 

    > “The class is mandatory, as I mentioned,” she replied with a shake of her head. “There are some significant pressures in place for instructors not to outright fail someone, and the class sizes are large enough that what I’m attempting to do, which is to shape minds, can’t really be done effectively.”

    - Yup, that's college.

    > If you’d like, I can give you some outside instruction

    - I really hope Juniper ends up talking to her and Professor Quirrell again. Maybe set up mail correspondence. They're really cool and interesting so far.

    > The rhannu reproduced via mitosis, like cells did. When that happened, each would get a portion of the skills and memories of the original, and my guess was that this worked via the soul somehow. They would die if they didn’t split every thirty or forty years, and each half had to spend some time building back up into a whole person again, mostly mentally rather than physically. Now that she mentioned it, I could clearly see how Sound and Silence might have to have some kind of provision for her species.

    - Wow wow wow, they reproduce by multiplying? How old is that species? Because unless a lot of them die before reproducing, I'm surprised the world isn't covered in them.

    > “Perhaps storming across campus to confront him was a mistake,” replied the masked woman with a monotone that I couldn’t help but think was a little sarcastic.

    - These people are way out of their depth. They're acting like they know what's going on, but it's pretty clear they just student syndicate representatives and they were clearly expecting a "my dad bribed the headmaster" situation, not an undercover imperial agent.

      Described in-universe as a deliberate effort—during meeting with Reimer, I think?

      > [E]vil empire with general Nazi parallels [...] The Empire isn't just evil, it's broken

      Well, in a more general sense, actual Nazis are also this. “Final solution” not originally meaning “extermination” is one example, but also, well... nationalism (in the sense of “states should be built around nations”, like a certain modern democracy that shall not be named) being _the_ idea of the new age, every European intellectual thinking eugenics is the hottest idea ever ’til they actually tried it (_cf._ communism, not in the US-politics sense, but in the original one), generally researchers doing what they thought best with the same abandon they always had but now with state resources and direction (thankfully Heisenberg was shit at project planning, but Sakharov still had to learn the lesson the hard way later, and Teller never did). Nuremberg looking long and hard at the 19th-century idea that allegiance to your country is in itself a virtue and deciding to raze it and salt the ashes was also a big, big change at the time (still is for some in the US, or at least so it looks from the outside). Nazi leaders don’t fall into this pattern, and I wouldn’t call it the main one, but it’s certainly there.

  Thought on the last line of 142, before I read 143:

  It's interesting that the Reimer/ Reimer-clone only recognizes Juniper, and not Raven, who's standing right there. Probably not actually Reimer. Maybe someone who knew the Aerbian Juniper? Or someone left info by Arthur.
