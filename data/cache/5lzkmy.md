## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  Thoughts on the world of The Old Kingdom books. In general it's a series I like but after reading the latest there were a number of things that bothered me.

  First if you aren't aware some brief outlines of the universe. There are two locations of real note. The Old Kingdom and Ancelstierre. Ancelstierre has no magic (magic doesn't work at all) except for a narrow strip net to the border with the Old Kingdom and has a tech based civilization on a par with maybe early 20th century earth. The two are connected at a wall and the strong implication though it's never explicitly said is that the two are located in separate universes which overlap at the wall.

  The magic system is one of my favorites and in my opinion would make a great foundation for some sort of rationalist take on magic though I'm annoyed at some details. Keep in mind a lot of what I'll say is speculation based on the book and may not be exactly mind of god/canon. Basically there are are two systems. The first called free magic is less well defined in the books but appears mostly to be based on attempting to control usually malevolent entities of which the strongest would do a good impression of godhood. The problems with this are numerous but while the it may be a result of the lens the books put on it using this form basically dooms you to madness. 

  On the other hand there is the Charter which is imposed and organized. Again speculation but it appears to be the result of free magic spells. It functions for it's users as a general purpose magical language with photographic runes either being mentally conjured as needed or bound to physical objects. The scope of it's powers are varied but include, flying machines, magical semi sentient servants, shields, fireballs, and the like. One of the most interesting properties is that it's use does not work everywhere even free magic does. There are stones called charter stones which project some form of field allowing the magic to function. Users also must undergo a ritual of some kind giving themselves a mark that can be used to prove they are not in some way under the influence of free magic and giving them the use of the charter. 

  Anyway on to some criticisms.  Beyond the writing which in most of the books has felt somehow shallow (don't really know how to describe it better), I can't seem to get over two basic facts. First there is no massive trade between the two sides of the wall. This is explained in the book by saying that machine made goods from Ancelstierre break down quickly in the Old Kingdom, but not only does this make no sense (how exactly does anything know it's machine made), but even so would not prevent some level of trade. Raw goods would still be valuable to the Old Kingdom and while ill defined at times I have to believe that some of the processes Old Kingdom magic could perform would valuable to Ancelstierre. If nothing else some spell work and the like seems to violate conservation of energy or at least entropy so set up on the border where magic starts failing and industry starts working some form of magical energy production facility turn a iron shaft or compress a fluid and use that to drive more tech oriented stuff on that side of the divide.

  My second problem is with the political and social organization of the Old Kingdom. It's never wonderfully defined but it appears to be a monarchy with most of the population stuck in the middle ages, but without a lot of the features and reasons that actually made that time period make sense. It's got a monarchy but is neither feudal nor as far as we see constitutional or even a police state. Large scale economies don't function but there doesn't seem to be large scale starvation or lack of healthcare. Some of this can be explained by magic. With easy to use general purpose healing spells lots less people would die of the plague, but magic should if anything make trade even more widespread.

  Anyway long rant and I'm curious what others might think.

    I like the way Charter Magic and Free Magic have a different feel. Part of that's down to the narrative's requirements for good-guy magic and bad-guy magic, but it still works well.

    Charter Magic seems safe, controllable, somewhat ethereal. People use it to light candles and send messages. You can turn yourself into an owl, and there's no hint of body-horror even if you mess the spell up. And you don't have to worry about the enchantment running out while you're flying high in the air - even if an enemy Charter Mage rips the spell apart, you'll probably make it to the ground in one piece. Its spells seem quite codified, and do no more than what they are meant to. Charter Magic can hurt and kill, if it has to, but even when weaponised it tends to focus on binding and imprisoning.

    While Free Magic tells a different story. It's dark, forbidden, corruptive. Fatal if you get it wrong and often worse if you get it right. It's controlled through brute willpower, not carefully learned and practised spells - if you have enough raw power and bind the right servants, you can command anything you think of and it'll be done. It can't be a part of everyday life, because if Free Magic is everyday then your life won't last long. It never does anything small - it's life and death or nothing.

    ... and all that is nicely tied up by the explanation that Charter Magic is artificial, designed and built by ancient Free Magic demigods. It's intended in-story to be safe for humans, it's a semi-intelligent interface so people can get the benefits of magic without melting their brains. Magic user design.

    This isn't the main focus of the books, but it's an excellent piece of worldbuilding and a theme I've seen in some rationalist stories.

    Garth nix is one of my favorite authors, and I just recent re-read the series, ostensibly in preperation for [the fourth book](http://www.garthnix.com/books/the-old-kingdom/clariel/) but really just because I enjoy reading them, so I feel qualified to respond :)

    I think the writing is aimed at a younger audience, which is the reason for the "shallowness" you described. Regarding the lack of trade, I think you're falling into the trap of 'what would I have my protaganist do' versus 'how would this realistically play out'. And in reality, with a scary 'other' over there across teh wall which ocassionally has scary things break through it, is officially persona non grata by the government, and which the entire border is controlled by the military, which prevents any civilians from crossing, it's actually quite reasonable. 

    RE: Political organization: I think the first step is to establish the population we're dealing with. I believe in *Abhorsen* it mentions that there is less than 200,000 people in the entire side of the wall. So we really are dealing with a feudal system (I think - I admit on not well versed on feudalism). Additionally, you're using the "Well, I grew up in a democracy (I'm assuming) so everything should be like that"-blinders (I'm sure there's a term for it) that misses the fact that monarchies were the dominant form of governance for a very long time. In fact, I'd potentially argue that its a natural state  without the conveniences that we have nowadays. Gravitation towards a strong leader is basically hard-wired into humans. And trade would be negatively affected by wandering Dead, etc.

    Just my thoughts.

      Yep I definitely think it has something to do with being intended for a YA audience and to be clear I did enjoy the series including the latest book nothing against the author. I just always had trouble getting into Garth's books.

      >  I think you're falling into the trap of 'what would I have my protaganist do' versus 'how would this realistically play out'.

      Partially but the problem is that if it would be something I'd do than it would probably be something that plenty of other people would do too. Profit motives a huge motivation and can quite easily move government policy and even defeat some level of taboo. The military guard has to be incredibly expensive.  I think I'd agree with you if Ancelstierre was also medieval superstitious hold over, but it doesn't appear to be. Despite the huge capital drain required for their defense of the wall it appears to be a quickly growing economy with as I mentioned development approaching about where we were at the start of the 20th century. Do you think oil barrens cared about superstition, security risks, or the government if there was lots of money to be made?

      I think you make your best point when it comes to political organization. It has been a long time since I'd read some of the earlier books and I was picturing a population on the level of maybe me medieval England at 1.5 million. For such a small population a true dictatorship might work, but there are just fundamental problems with it. Basically you have to delegate somehow and unless your carefully you invite huge amounts of corruption when all the power comes from the top. Even states like China have some of these problems and they have a far more complicated governing structure than what is portrayed in The Old Kingdom. It might be worth watching [CPGreys Rules for Rulers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs). I suspect it of falling into simpler explanations for complicated things, but it should make clear some of the problems with dictatorship.

      Feudalism by the way is basically what they had in early medieval Europe. I suspect it's the natural result when you let war lords stay in power too long. Basically everyone of importance personally controls some land. Then they also have other people under them who they have essentially agreed to protect from outside threat in exchange for help fighting said outside threat and often taxes of some form. This arrangement is usually stack a few layers deep until you get to a king. The brake down seems to have happened as the individual nobles realized the King had too much power and set up formal constitutions among each other defining how the government would function. The king would be left with some power but over time this was stripped away until you get the figurehead kings of Modern Europe. 

      I think you also make a good case that the disaster prone nature of the Kingdom may hurt trade, but the impression I got from the books is that by the end of the last book that kind of thing has mostly been taken care of inside the border of the Kingdom and certainly in the prequel things had been quite stable for a long time to the point that the security apparatus was starting to fail due to atrophy.  And again they are living right next to a modern civ. Some of the ideas should be spreading to them.

        Ancelstierre's inhabitants, by and large, do not *understand* magic.

        They recognise it - in the form of big scary monsters that come over the Wall on rare occasion. (And the only magic things that survive more than a dozen steps from the Wall *are* the Big Scary Monsters, so...)

        So there's not that much call for trade. Ancelstierre has machines - which stop working over the Wall (I assume this is because the presence of even a low level of Free Magic causes small-scale effects that mess up delicate mechanisms but have negligible effects on, say, a great big sword) while the Old Kingdom has magic - which stops working on the Ancelstierre side of the Wall. Sure, they could trade things like gold and cloth back and forth, but you'd need guards willing to face Big Scary Free-Magic Monsters in a place where guns won't work and where the monsters *learn* which route the food takes and are intelligent enough to set up ambushes... so I can see why people might be reluctant to try.

  I am continuing on with [Upsides](http://archiveofourown.org/works/5135483/chapters/11817437) (tl;dr: gravity reverses for every person on the planet, sending them to crash into their ceilings or die from asphyxia in the upper atmosphere).

  First, a math/physics question. Let's say that you have a 180 pound man accelerating upwards at *g*, with 200 pounds of weights strapped to him accelerating downward at *g*. The math that I've been using for this is something like:

  ((200 pounds * *g*) - (180 pounds * *g*)) / 380 pounds

  ... which gives 0.05 *g* acceleration for the overall mass. Is this correct? By analogy, it would be like two cars butting heads with each other, but one has more gas applied to it, which means that overall both cars are going to move in the direction of the car with more gas, at a much slower rate. I am really not sure that this maths out correctly though and feel like I'm just dividing by pounds to turn kilogram meters/second/second back into meters/second/second and not because that matches what would actually happen.

  Second, let's suppose that billions of people died by being flung into the air, society is on the brink of crumbling, etc. and then rebuilding/adaptation actually goes surprisingly well. What new technologies would you expect to see thirty or forty years down the line? What would you expect to be true about the world given that humanity has survived this inexplicable worldwide curse?

    (Your link is broken: It contains ****.)

    Walking around in a 180-210-pound spacesuit is going to resemble our walking on the moon in a spacesuit, along with being able to drop ballast/drink water to increase jump length or go up, and cutting hair/pooping/vomiting or dropping helium balloons to go down.

    Also, free energy. Do corpses drop back down? Did the chimps flip? Did neanderthal skeletons flip? Did HeLa cultures flip?

  Let's start with the premise:

  ___

  The world has long since moved past the Xenocide Wars. Indeed, The sixty-two sapient species exist in an age of relative peace. In fact, now, in the year 812 A.E., magic and technology have advanced to the point where interdimensional portals of reasonable size can actually be created.

  So, predictably, one is.

  Observing mages are disappointed, but not overly surprised to find the other end of the portal is surrounded entirely by water.

  To their pleasant surprise, however, a boat of some sort is noticed in the distance. At the hope of making contact with an extradimensional civilization, scouts are sent through the portal.

  But even though they fly and fly, the boat doesn't seem to get any closer, even though it's obviously moving.

  After a while, the scouts realize that this isn't a boat, but a ship of truly gargantuan proportions.

  First contact is made in 2017 A.D. aboard the USS Gerald Ford.

  ___

  So, way back in 2013/2014, I started on a worldbuilding project to culminate in a play-by-post forum roleplay. I kind of lost interest in the project, but recently I dusted it off and realized I put a *lot* of cool stuff in there.

  [con-lang document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qmK8qTXn1j3grDtMG_62PTnV56FU1bW5ce_dE2nPCrA/edit?usp=sharing)

  [worldbuilding document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xpf39rsD5mcfmVdwfVtcdjHY8w6k8MydoX_f0RmU3IM/edit?usp=sharing)

  [world map](http://i.imgur.com/uaSPurp.png)

  The conlang document doesn't really have a purpose except as a mental exercise, so I probably won't be updating it. The worldbuilding document, on the other hand, contains a number of contradictions and blatantly unscientific stuff I need to paper over somehow. I haven't decided on political borders for the map, but if you layer a Mercator projection directly over it, portal locations directly correspond to geographic locations.

  Though while the worldbuilding on this isn't complete, I wanted to ask /r/rational: what kind of roleplay would you guys be interested in, given this premise?

  Also, is anyone interested in helping me worldbuild?

  Some notes:

  * The incredible number of sapient species is because magic allows for a greater variety of ecological niches, leading to more speciation
  * More honestly, there are that many species to allow players to make their own custom species.
  * The restriction on crossbreeding was put there to prevent people going full "special snowflake" without at least adding something to the wordbuilding document.

  I'm toying with the theme of "what is and isn't the right thing to do, when you're facing extinction". Specifically, I'm focusing on having a new Six Day War within the next twenty years, after which they created a selection of 'Israeli Defensive Buffer Territories' (eg, Sinai, Lebanon, Damascus), in which the IDF could do as they needed to keep Israel proper safe.

  What further consequences and implications of such an arrangement occur to you?

    Bad things geopolitical. We have quite a few countries in that region with lots of weapons (some even with nukes) and lots of friends. It could easily get really really nasty. Lets say it works though and the territory is controlled. Occupying territory for a long time is hard. People get angry. They feel like they should have rights. People who in hard times doubly so. I think you'd see a large tick up of terrorists attacks especially aimed at Israel.
