  > Red stares after it, then turns slowly to Leaf, whose face is as blankly shocked as he imagines his is. It feels like his brain is broken. His mouth moves silently for a moment, then can only emit a flat, calm, "What."

   "You turned into a clefairy! A SMALL clefairy! You violated Conservation of Energy! That's not just an arbitrary rule, it's implied by the form of the quantum Hamiltonian! Rejecting it destroys unitarity and then you get FTL signalling! And Pokémon are COMPLICATED! A human brain can't just simulate a Pokémon's anatomy and, and all the Pokémon biochemistry, and what about the neurology? How can you go on thinking using a Pokémon-sized brain?"

  Hey all, welcome back! Here's another 10,000 word chapter, and this one was able to fit in most of what I wanted it to. Edits might come a bit slower this time, since my computer decided to implode yesterday, and I'm still in the process of replacing it. Hope you enjoy, and as usual, all feedback welcome!

  Also, quick note for my Rationally Writing podcast, we've paid to upgrade our Soundcloud account, so downloads aren't so limited anymore. Thanks for listening!

  Really great chapter!  I liked Leaf a bunch this time around, and in general our three protagonists came across as mature and wise.  I'm looking forward to what the introduction to Bill will mean for the story.  I really would not have expected the Clefairy thing to be possible in this world.

    I've been waiting to get to Bill for awhile :) I hope people find him as engaging as writing him so far has been.

      My guess:

      It is a well trained Clefairy carrying a microphone/communication device.  It may have been trained to move its lips in time with what is being said or it may have  somehow picked up the behavior on its own.

      Or maybe some kind of android.

      Possibly magic.

        All things are possible, especially in a world of pokemon.

        But not all things are probable, even there :)

          You mean this hasn't been an elaborate crossover with HPMOR this whole time!?  That throws off all of my predictions for the direction of the plot!  Not to mention the changes that'll have to be made to my shipping chart.

          Well there's plenty of stuff that seems like magic. Organised by type (not all of this has been shown so you could just not have half the moves exist, but I expect you can do better than that):

          * Psychic is the big one, practically everything they do seems like magic, teleportation, mind reading, telekinesis etc..
          * Fire, while mostly sorted out as not magic with the flammable materials being expelled, still has the question of why things like fire punch don't burn the user.
          * Water, while absorbing and expelling water seems not magical pokemon seem able to hold more than their own volume in it (I won't mention this again if I see any other examples of it), though with things like pokeballs it might not be magic. Moves which affect external supplies of water are pretty magical though, being effectively water only telekinesis. 
          * Grass, there's a mix of simple muscle like hitting things with or shooting out plant parts, which isn't magical, spores which might be magic but are probably just drugs, and then you have absord which magically sucks the life out of things to heal you and solar beam for a sun powered death ray.
          * Rock and earth (they seem pretty much the same), are a mix of simply throwing rock, mud and dirt at things, which isn't magical and limited telekinesis that only works on rocks, dirt or mud.
          * Poison doesn't seem to have anything magical.
          * Ice seems to have the ability to instantly cool things to sub zero temperatures, which is probably magic.
          * Fighting is a mix of non magical muscle and magic by another name ki and aura based attacks.
          * Dark and ghost seem to be magic, it's mental attacks and 'energy' blasts (can't think of any other way to describe things like shadow ball and dark pulse).
          * Dragon appears to be a mix of brute force, like dragon claw, and magical stuff like creating twisters, fire that doesn't count as fire typed, dropping meteors on people and whatever dragon pulse is.
          * steel type seems to be mostly hitting stuff while being made of metal, though there are things like flash cannon which might be magic and there's the occasional bit of metal only telekinesis.
          * Normal is a mix of muscle power, supersonic and hypervoice style sound based attacks which are probably all nonmagical, and some weird stuff like hyper beam which seems rather magical. Probably other things, not much pattern to the normal type.
          * Flying seems mostly wing and beak based brute strength with a few wind based attacks which could easily be perfectly mundane as wings are used as fans thrown in.
          * Electric types have kind of been explained, but the details of how they create the differences in charge and such haven't and certainly seem like magic.
          * Bug type moves seem to be mundane physical attacks bugs use, a few mundane web based attacks, the sound based bug buzz which might well be mundane, but there's some stuff like signal beam and leech life that seem like magic.  

          I think that's the lot, if there are mundane explanations for all of that I hope you include some of them in future chapters.
          ```

          - u/DaystarEld:
            ```
            Great write-up :) I guess I should have clarified that I meant human-based magic, since we were talking about Bill, though that list only includes the vaguely magical psychic and "Ghost" powers, and "Ki," none of which approach the kind of powers that pokemon can use.

            I'll definitely be explaining more of those as the story goes on, though some of them will definitely get cut, or changed somewhat. For example, I'm thinking Hyper Beam is going to be a sound-based attack, since all other Special Normal Type attacks are sound based. Maybe a beam of sound so intense it forms a defined beam of kinetic force. What do you think? Too much of a cheat?
            ```

            - u/Icare0:
              ```
              > all other Special Normal Type attacks are sound based

              Tri attack?

              Edit: After checking out Bulbapedia, there is also Judgement, Razor Wind, Hidden power, Spit Out, Swift, Weather Ball, Wring Out and Trump Card. So something like a third to half the special normal moves aren't sound based.
              ```

              - u/DaystarEld:
                ```
                Many of the non-Sound based Special Normal Attacks are variable types, like Weather Ball and Judgement and Hidden Power. They can be Normal type, but they're clearly some form of magic that only include Normal in their permutations because their Type changes based on other factors

                Tri Attack is a strange case, because it's clearly a Fire/Ice/Electric attack, but because it was made in Gen 1 I guess they decided to just balance them out and consider it a "Normal?"  Maybe the technology wasn't there to make it count as all 3 types, and they figure it would be too complicated for kids to have a move that acts like all 3 types at once. In any case I have no qualms about making it an actual mix of the three elements it represents.

                I'm okay with Razor Wind as Normal instead of Flying as an exception because it seems to be similar in effect to other Normal attacks, ie, getting cut.  

                Swift and Wring Out, however, I don't really have an explanation for. I'm not sure why Wring Out is Special, there's nothing in the description that makes it seem like it should be.  And the stars formed by Swift seem to be just magically formed sharp objects thrown at something, so there's no real getting around that.

                So you're right, there are enough exceptions to this rule to invalidate it.  I guess I'll treat Hyper Beam as an energy based attack after all :)

      ```
      > Confusing, isn't it?

      In Game of Champions, it was some sort of mind-transfer... that doesn't seem technologically possible here.  In a parody web-comic (Nerd Rage I think?), Bill was actually cosplaying and was trying to distract Red from realizing this with the science stuff.  Metronome seems like it can do anything...?  Maybe the mechanism is some sort of ability to copy moves from other Pokemon and implement them, and Bill figured out how to leverage it into getting the Clefairy to temporarily copy his mind?  Or just copy his vocalizations, for something more moderate?
      ```

      - u/Electric999999:
        ```
        Well, psychics can mentally communicate, maybe mind swapping is based on how that works, seems rather beyond what we've seen so far though.

  Finally some fighting, I love how you included switching around pokemons to get exp and STAB.
  I'm not good at keeping count as I read, are pokemons still limited to 4 moves?

  Also reference to Alola, this is getting better as I continue reading.

  And Bill, that was just great.

  Also can you believe that a dark alola rattata was just announced? I find it extra funny considering the psychic rattata comment by red

    What /u/scruiser said :) I'll be sure to add it to the FAQ.

  - u/scruiser:

    I can't find the exact comment, and its not in the FAQ on the website, but DaystarEld definitely said that they weren't limited to 4 moves, although practically speaking a trainer needs to actually teach all the moves to a Pokemon and keep them fresh in its memory.  Looking at the [Team Roster for example](http://www.daystareld.com/pokemon-team-roster/) some Pokemon only know 2 moves...  Blue, the competitive battler that he is, has trained his Squirtle with 9 moves.

  Great chapter once again, interesting to get a few more specifics about evolution, though waiting a month for an explanation about Bill might be a bit annoying (though that's just my own impatience lol). Anyways, I have a few questions if you don't mind me asking:

  * Considering you referenced Alolan forms, I'm curious if 6th gen Pokemon are in Origin of Species's universe or not (dunno how you'd explain/work around fairy types though...)?

  * How do Pokemon that are said to get along well with humans (Eg. Goodra, Lapras) fit into the more overtly hostile nature of wild Pokemon in Origin of Species (as compared to the main series)?

  * Have human psychics and sensitives in Origin of Species ever considered/researched if their powers are some form or parallel of synesthesia as a possible explanation?
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    >Considering you referenced Alolan forms, I'm curious if 6th gen Pokemon are in Origin of Species's universe or not (dunno how you'd explain/work around fairy types though...)?

    This was discussed a bit in an earlier chapter, but I'll add it to the FAQ when I get home: Fairy type exist, but as an "inactive" type. Right now they're considered a myth, but when a Xerneas awakens from hibernation, its Fairy Aura activates those around it, who then activate those around them, and so on, until the Xerneas goes into hibernation again.

    >How do Pokemon that are said to get along well with humans (Eg. Goodra, Lapras) fit into the more overtly hostile nature of wild Pokemon in Origin of Species (as compared to the main series)?

    As /u/EatZelda_ShitAwesome says, they're much more friendly than most, though some still cause harm to humans. For the most part though, they don't go on rampages or attack towns.

    >Have human psychics and sensitives in Origin of Species ever considered/researched if their powers are some form or parallel of synesthesia as a possible explanation?

    As far as I'm aware, synesthesia isn't consistent across people, while psychic phenomenon are. What I mean is, two people with sight/taste synesthesia might describe the "taste of Green" differently from each other. Psychics tend to have different power levels, but the same stimulus brings about the same sensation/feeling.
    ```

    - u/FletchMaster26:
      ```
      Thanks for the answers, I now have two follow up questions:

      * I'm still genuinely curious if all 6th gen Pokemon are in OOS's universe? (sorry for being pedantic but you only mentioned Fairy types in your first answer and OOS started before 6th gen was released)

      * What type are Fairy type Pokemon classified as before activation, Normal? Or does it vary per mon species?
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        All pokemon from the games exist, and yes, pure fairies are Normal, mixed types are the other Type :)
        ```

    - u/InfernoVulpix:
      ```
      Hmm... if Xerneas' presence activates the Fairy type in a viral spread, it strikes me that Yveltal should be able to do something similar.  After all, they are yet another set of counterpart Legendaries, with one focusing on life and the other on death.

      Obviously, Yveltal can't activate a type like Xerneas does, since Fairy is the only type that needs an explanation like this.  I'm curious about whether Yveltal will 'suppress' a Fairy typing, or suppress some other type, or if the phenomenon will be marked as a rare case of asymmetry between counterparts.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Unless Yveltal differ in population amount or hibernation habits.

    Sounds like she somehow put the call on the table.

    "Cerulean North's heart" or "the heart of Cerulean North"

    lids

    > weighs heavy on his mind

    Should be "weighs heavily", but this can be artistic license I guess.

    >  But the only way to regain his momentum from it is to take Misty out in their first fight

    >  based on the amount of badges their challengers have

    >  between getting one's first badge and their second 

    "and one's second"

    >  but Leaders would always pull the most punches against someone who's untested

    I would pair "would" with "was" (so "someone who was untested"), but you could also just do "someone untested".

    > incase she gives you something too

    in case

    > stopping to let some people off and others board

    "off" and "board" don't quite match.  I would use "off" and "on" or "leave" (or something) and "board"

    >  Red and Leaf get off when the bus reaches Cerulean North's Trainer House. 

    Subjective (I think), but maybe "when" -> "as"

    > which might make it harder for him to climb the ranks faster and challenge Misty.

    "harder to climb the ranks faster" is weird.  Maybe "harder to climb the ranks quickly"

    > The sight makes Blue's heart fill his chest

    Sort of an awkward phrasing.

    >  It's only been a couple weeks since he beat Brock, and an eventful couple weeks at that, but he still feels like forever ago. 

    An "and... at that" comment should amplify the preceding clause relative to what follows, but this diminishes it.  Try "albeit an eventful one" or something.  Also either "it still feels like forever ago" or "still feels like it was forever ago".

    > There are few better ways to showcase how well the gym can train their pokemon than to put a bunch of them on display in a public area and trust that all would be well.

    and trust that all will be well

    > only to come up a few meters away to fire back at the spot Zephyr was a moment ago.

    I would use "before" in place of "ago"

    > His pokemon lashes out and strikes the poliwhirl just before the water crashes down around him, but Amy's pokemon is sufficiently distracted by the strike to follow up properly.

    "too distracted by the strike to follow up properly"

    >  just as Amy sends her poliwhirl back into the water, then shoots another Water Gun that Joey just barely has time to dodge

    Here it reads as if it is Amy rather than her poliwhirl that is shooting the Water Gun.

    >  Blue keeps an eye on the water just incase there's any obvious amounts of blood from the wound he inflicted

    in case

    >  If it's one thing Blue has learned from watching a thousand competitive trainer battles, it's never to underestimate the depths they'll go to hide their methods and mislead opponents.

    "If there's one thing", "the depths trainers will go to" (not the depths the battles will go to)

    > The battle continues more even than ever, with Amy's poliwhirl having to dodge the sprays of acid his ekans shot out of its mouth every time it was attacked. 

    Maybe "more evenly than ever".  Also the tense is weird for the second clause.  Maybe "his ekans shoots out of its mouth every time it is attacked".  Also you use "him" to refer to the ekans in the next sentence, but "its" here.

    > A beam of white light flash-freezes the ground below it traces a path toward Kemuri.

    Hard to parse.

    > but he'd rather not reveal it until he faces Misty, just incase…

    in case

    >  suddenly reminded of his sister. She and Amy would probably get along

    You say the same thing a couple of lines up.

    >  long enough to relax or clear his mind…despite

    space before "despite"

    > his mind i still offering up distractions.

    is still

    others.

    > verdant green fields 

    Maybe a bit redundant.

    > which slowly resolves itself into a distinct shapes. 

    "into distinct shapes" or "into a distinct shape".

    > Technically the house could be referred to as a cottage, relatively small and quaint looking, but it's connected to so many wider, more modern buildings around it that the whole thing can easily be referred to as complex.

  ```
  After the past few chapters, something's been bothering me. 

  I really feel like Red is completely ignoring how unprepared he is to deal with emergencies, which seems out of character for him after being exposed to so many dangerous situations already. I get that he doesn't care about becoming a strong battle trainer, but it doesn't seem like he's even considered training up a few of his pokemon to be strong enough to protect him when the shit hits the fan. 

  It just seems strange to me. I mean, he reflects on his mistakes and comes up with countermeasures for the future, he's been shown to have good judgment and forethought when it comes to preparing *stuff* he might need to increase his safety, and he can usually make sound situational judgments, but he hasn't even *considered* making a deliberate effort to strengthen, let alone evolve, his pokemon. In a world where you can get attacked at any time, where he's already had some of his pokemon killed, and where he's already witnessed like 10 people die who had stronger pokemon than he does, it just seems really out of character for him to ignore this key part of risk mitigation when he's supposed to be smart. 

  I guess maybe he could be subconsciously avoiding doing so because he wants to maintain his self-image of being different from "Blue the Battle Maniac", or he could just be caught up in his intellectual pursuits and ignoring it, but it should be REALLY obvious to him that **survival is priority number 1** and that he's woefully unprepared from a pokemon strength standpoint.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Thanks for the feedback! 

    So there's something I'm struggling with a bit, and namely it's that there's only so much screen time to devote to every activity Red and the others engage in.  I try to summarize their travels to keep the story going, and I've been also trying to do the same with their training.  Red and Leaf are both still training their pokemon to make them stronger: they just don't focus on it the way Blue does, so it doesn't take up screen time. 

    I'm planning on only highlighting his training when it's in reaction to something specific, or has some particularly important thing happen (like when a pokemon evolves).  But the trade off to that is that it seems like he's not doing it all that much, which I'll definitely have to work on making more clear.
