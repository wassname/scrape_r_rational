## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  **Mistborn Munchkinry Miniseries Part 4: Pewter**

  Ok, week four of the mistborn munchkinry miniseries. For a general overview of this series and the magic systems in question, see [part one](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9zz4sa/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ead595h/). I strongly recommend reading the first part of that comment if you weren't here for the past weeks and aren't familiar with the mistborn setting.

  *Spoiler note*: I will avoid things that I consider excessive spoilers, but the exact workings of the magic system are moderate spoilers themselves, so if you intend to read the books and are sensitive to spoilers you should probably skip this one.

  This weeks metal is pewter. Its powerset is probably a little more straightforward than the ones we've seen before, but I'm curious see what you all can come up with. As always I'm interested in what a pewter twinborn compounder can do, both here on earth (where they are the only one with this powerset) and in Era 2 Scadrial.

  **Allomancy**

  Allomantic pewter enhances your body. The most obvious effect of burning pewter is that you become physically stronger, roughly two to three times stronger than you were before (~~note: this means the effect of allomantic pewter is amplified by being in good physical condition~~ edit: this is wrong, see below), but that is only the tip of the iceberg. You also become faster and more agile, your reaction speed and sense of balance improve and you tire much slower and heal much faster than a regular person. On top of that an allomancer burning pewter has a vastly higher tolerance for pain and is able to push his body well past its normal limits, ignoring lethal wounds and continuing to fight or run long after normal person would have blacked out from shock or exhaustion.

  With enough pewter to burn, an allomancer has essentially unlimited stamina. Combined with the added strength and balance pewter gives you, this allows for a process called pewter dragging: by burning large amounts of pewter continually over an extended period of time, the allomancer is able to run across extreme distances at speeds faster than any galloping horse, even through dense forests and other types of difficult terrain. In a semi-pre-industrial world like scadrial this means pewter allomancers can get to places faster than anyone else and even be in a condition to fight after they get there if needed.

  Worth noting is that pewters healing ability isn't Wolverine levels of healing, it makes you recover in hours to days from wounds that otherwise heal in weeks to months (if ever). More significantly, it allows the body to continue to function _despite_ those wounds: regenerating lost blood, preventing you from going into shock and letting partially severed muscles work without tearing themselves appart further. Also worth pointing out is that enough aluminium in the wound surpresses all of these effects (which makes aluminium bullets a good way to deal with pewter allomancers). 

  Burning pewter is not without its own risks either, if an allomancer runs out of pewter to burn they immediately lose their enhanced stamina and pain tolerance and they run the risk of collapsing to exhaustion they didn't realise they had or wounds that they had written of as irrelevant. An allomancer running out of pewter during a pewter drag can easily kill themselves through over-exertion. Moreover, pushing your body past its limits for extensive amounts of time takes its toll on the body and an allomancer coming out of a heavy pewter drag may need days or even weeks of rest to recover. All of this only happens if you seriously abuse your body though, in normal day-to-day life, pewter allomancers are healthier, more energetic and need less rest than regular people.

  **Feruchemy**

  Feruchemic pewter stores physical strength. This differs from allomantic pewter in that feruchemy works on the level of actual physical muscles. When storing strenght, the feruchemist visibly deflates, becoming scroungy and weak. Afterwards, they can tap the pewter metalmind created this way to become more muscular and powerful. A feruchemist tapping a pewter metalmind can be much stronger than a allomancer burning pewter, but they do not gain any of the other benefits that pewter grants an allomancer. Moreover, because feruchemy physically increases your muscle mass, tapping too much strength makes it harder to move around as your motions become limited by the sheer bulk of your muscles.  

  The key difference between a pewter allomancer and a pewter feruchemist is that the former are more athletic and mobile (packing their enhanced strength into a much lighter package), while the latter have more raw strength and the momentum that comes with being physically larger and heavier.

  And that is it for pewter, the last of the physical metals. Next week we start with the mental metals!

    A Pewter compounder is an easy source of biomass for any project which needs it. You can get effectively infinite muscles, cut off some irrelevant and easily-healed ones, and survive the process with Pewter endurance. Furthermore, since burning Pewter protects you from the effects of crushing as well (mild Mistborn spoilers, there), a compounder could use their ability to become arbitrarily large to destroy any room/building they were in by just overfilling it.

    I'm now imagining a world dominated by ever-swelling mounds of living flesh cascading outward from particularly distrought Pewter compounders.

    Infinite muscles means infinite blood and skin, which means you just need to find cooperative pewter compounders of all blood and tissue types to solve blood shortages forever. This also gives scientists a limitless supply of human tissue to experiment upon.

    >The most obvious effect of burning pewter is that you become physically stronger, roughly two to three times stronger than you were before (note: this means the effect of allomantic pewter is amplified by being in good physical condition), but that is only the tip of the iceberg.

    This is kind of a nitpick, but burning pewter provides a flat bonus to your physical abilities, it doesn't multiply your pre-existing strength. Most pewter mistings still like to pack on muscle because it makes them that much stronger, but a body builder and a starving street urchin would both be receiving the same degree of enhancement.

    >"So," Ham said, "an Allomancer doesn't have to be physically strong to be incredibly powerful. If Vin were a Feruchemist it would be different-if you ever see Sazed increase *his* strength, his muscles will grow larger. But with Allomancy, all the strength comes from the metal."

    >"Now, most Thugs-myself included-figure that making their bodies strong will only add to their power. After all, a muscular man burning pewter will be that much stronger than a regular man of the same Allomantic power."

    Also, the amount of strength pewter grants is somewhat beyond two/three times a regular person's- Vin, for instance, is capable of swinging swords that weigh as much as she does with a single hand.

    >Vin Pulled on the fallen sword. It lurched up at her, but also pulled her down with its weight. She caught it as she fell—the sword was nearly as tall as she was, but flared pewter let her handle it with ease—and she sheared free the attacking koloss’s arm as she landed. She took its legs off at the knees, then left it to die as she spun toward other opponents

    Does Pewter Feruchemy also protect you against the consequences of having such high/low muscle mass? You mention it being hard to move around - is that only due to physically reduced range of motion due to increased muscle mass? Does it protect against hypo/hypertension due to the massively changed blood pressure requirements for all the new muscle mass? Can Feruchemists control what muscles they are storing/tapping?

    There are a lot of obvious problems with this I can see: Draining/boosting muscle mass seems like it would very easily kill you due to changing the thickness and strength of your ventricle chambers. The muscles that control saccades in your eyes would start overshooting, blurring your vision. It'd enlarge your tongue, making it hard to talk or suffocating you. There's a *lot* of things in the human body that are classified as "muscles" that would start fucking up if they just increased in mass in a second.

    Also, muscle *mass* isn't all that important. It's muscle density - there are lots of really bulked out weightlifters that can't lift that much due to never cutting. And even then, you wouldn't be able to do "superhuman" strength feats without tearing your muscles from your bones since the weak point is as the connective tissue.

    You'd also start experiencing loss of breath due to not being able to oxygenate all those new cells, even if it handled blood volume and pressure for you - there are lots of story about professional bodybuilders essentially always being out of breath as a consequence and how it kinda ruins their life. Things like prolonged fights or having to run anywhere at increased muscle mass would be a very bad idea, and you'd be liable of passing out.

    There's the very obvious solution of "use this to get free power" - it very obviously increases their mass, so just get a bunch of them to stand on hydraulic plates and oscillate, even more than the more esoteric "increase momentum but not weight" metals since there's no loss from burning any resource or need for complex setups.

    I'd also be interested in what force the muscle expansion would have, like the sibling comment says - best case scenario you could stick a finger in a hole, jiggle your muscle density back and forth, and shatter rocks due to stress as your finger muscles expand and contract like water.

    How does damage to your muscle work? If you tap pewter and get increased muscle mass, is it at the same "damage" as the rest of the muscle group, or what damage it was when you stored in the metalmind? If the first, then you have a pretty efficient shield for bullets - bulk up, get shot, shrink and have comparatively much less damage. If it's the second, then you could just store away the damaged mass of muscle again and be fresh as daisies, or do stuff like storing your damaged muscles in one metalmind and tapping unharmed muscle from a second to cycle out any damage you take.

    You could also constantly store muscle mass and prolong your life for quite a while if you're ever trapped in a rockslide or somewhere without food by decreasing calorie requirements, but that might be dangerous depending on how muscle damage works since you'd start cannibalizing your muscles for calories.

  Whenever a camera sees you, the last second of time is undone, including everyone's memories, including yours. Once per day, choose up to 8 numbers. You are always aware of the last of these numbers exceeded by the day's reset count. When the last number is exceeded, you fall unconscious and your power turns off for an hour.
  ```

  - u/BoojumG:
    ```
    I'd want to explore what constitutes a "camera" "seeing" me, but the first order of business is finding any way to actually know the effect has triggered, since it essentially reverses time, which seems observationally identical to the triggering *not* happening at all. It seems like without any loss of generality we can characterize the same effect as looking *forward* one second and preventing any course of events that leads to being seen by a camera. "It happened and then unhappened" seems to lead to back to the exact same world-state as "it hasn't happened", except for the reset count going down by one. 

    If the universe is deterministic, then any number of reset counts has the exact same effect - none. There is only one possible timeline, and whenever it passes through being seen by a camera you'll fall unconscious after it pointlessly resets a few times. Observational history will be identical the anomaly to having no effect except "being seen by cameras knocks you out".

    If the universe is fundamentally probabilistic, then you could observe the effect as making being seen by a camera anomalously unlikely, with you falling unconscious if you push it by being exposed to lots of cameras lots of times. You might be able to get an angle on what the day's reset count is if you can measure just *how* anomalously events where you're seen by cameras just fail to happen. Maybe some setup with rolling a die and opening a shutter to a camera if it comes up 6. 6's should suddenly appear to happen less often as the attempts where the effect is triggered cause a reset (assuming rolling a die is sufficiently probabilistic. If it's not, try radioactive decay triggering geiger counters or something). This should be quantifiable, but you'll have to consider that *other* ways the camera-incident could not occur will also be effectively boosted, like the camera failing in some way.

    >Once per day, choose up to 8 numbers. You are always aware of the last of these numbers exceeded by the day's reset count. When the last number is exceeded, you fall unconscious and your power turns off for an hour.

    This just seems like a puzzle for gaining partial information about how many times the effect will work. I'm not sure I really understand it though. Is the idea that you can say "1 2 4 8 16 32 48 96" and then learn which is the last-occurring number that exceeds the day's reset count? So if it's 16, you know the effect can trigger between 8 and 15 times before you're knocked out?

    Best I can tell this is "you've got unconscious reality-bending that's camera-shy, but if it gets tired you pass out", with a side of being able to gain limited information about how strong the effect is that day. I assume it varies from day to day?
    ```

    - u/hh26:
      ```
      If you can react quickly enough to the knowledge when one of your numbers is exceeded, then even in a deterministic universe you could potentially stop whatever you're doing (for instance, if you were about to walk around a corner) and hopefully avoid getting hit by a camera again.  This would effectively give you eight distinct attempts each day at avoiding cameras that you could predict would see you one second in the future.
      ```
