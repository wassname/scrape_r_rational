## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  A lot of people seem to think that rational fiction must avoid narrative causality, but I think this is a bigger hurdle to overcome than people realize. Narrative causality is major part of storytelling and I've seen plenty of stories here try to avoid it in ways that hurt the story's quality such as shoehorning exposition into dialogue, denying characters agency by making events feel arbitrary, and defying the audience's expectations instead of playing to them. While there are many stories that have pulled such things off, not all stories can or should and we need to keep that in mind if we want rational fiction to catch on.

  I've read EY's essay where he says a rational protagonist should be Genre Savvy enough to figure out the rules of their story, but many authors seem to have interpreted that to mean they need to deny the audience of narrative satisfaction. I say this because we want more people to read rational fiction, but people outside this community aren't going to read stories because they happen to fit the criteria of rational fiction. They're going to read them because they're good stories, so I think we should discuss how to make rational fiction more palatable and entertaining according to the standards of fiction in general. What do you think?

    I agree. Tropes and genres exist as they are for reasons, and one of the biggest reasons is that authors have been trying to optimize their stories for entertainment value for thousands of years. Throwing out genre convetions without understanding their purpose is ***Bad***.

    Take the Unspoken Plan Guarantee, for example. Characters make a plan off-camera, then execute it perfectly on-camera. You can't have characters make a plan on-camera and then execute it perfectly on-camera, because you drain the tension from the story and the audience gets bored. The trope exists for a reason; if you want to not have it in your story, you need to figure out a way to keep the story entertaining.

    I'd really like for people to just ask themselves *why* some convention/trope exists. *Sometimes* it's because the author is a stupid lazy hack, but I'd argue that's the minority. Authors are trying to be entertaining; the things they do with their stories are primarily in service of entertainment (this is less true in more commercial works, e.g. Hollywood, where budget and merchandising play a larger factor). Sometimes this entertainment is shallow pandering, but you have to know which is which before you throw the baby out with the bathwater.

      Now I feel bad for using Metropolitan Man as an example of what not to do because that is excellent advice that I completely agree with, yet I haven't read any of your work after I didn't like your Superman fic. [Your review of HPMOR](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/3096lk/spoilers_all_a_critical_review_of_hpmor/) even did a good job of pointing out the flaws with the narrative, and I love that story.

        Oh, I fully understand why people dislike *Metropolitan Man*, I don't begrudge anyone that. It's one of the reasons that I'm hesitant to recommend the story to people. But I didn't do the things that I did with the story because I was trying to subvert genre expectations, I did them because I was trying to create certain unpleasant feelings - the feeling that I get when I think too deeply about the end of humanity, or the wealth of pain and cruelty in the world, or the ambiguity of good and evil. Some of my favorite books have left me in a melancholy state for days afterward. (And I'm not saying that *Metropolitan Man* does this perfectly, but I've gotten enough reviews to the effect of "I loved this, but I'm never going to read it again" that I think it was at least a partial success.)

        If I knew of a way to do it, I would have signaled to the reader beforehand that it was going to be that kind of book, so they could have bailed out if that wasn't what they were into.

        Edit: To be clear, there are *other* reasons that people dislike it, which I'm also very familiar with, just trying to address the specific complaint about lack of catharsis/satisfaction and deviation from narrative conventions.

          > I did them because I was trying to create certain unpleasant feelings

          This is what I loved about Metropolitan Man!

          Now, I normally hate it when writers do stuff just to create unpleasant feelings, because usually it's really contrived ("Let's kill this character everyone loves just to signal to the reader that now things are getting serious!") or else it's not a story that has enough to say to justify it ("Now that the hero has slain the dragon and rescued the princess, let's have him get blinded so we can have a Lesson About Disabilities shoehorned in here")

          Metropolitan Man actually had something to say, the unpleasantness was what the story was about.

          Would like to state that I love Metropolitan Man so thoroughly that doing a faithful adaptation of it as a movie would be the easiest way Hollywood could get me into superhero movies.  I've also read it several times.

          I felt Superman was "allowed" to kill Calhoun because (1) he regretted it immediately afterwards (by opposition to going evil Episode-III-style) and (2) as far as I'm aware, he's a character created in the fic. If it had been Lex Luthor, or Deadshot, or the Joker, the point might have been lost, but here it feels like man Superman kills is an actual 40s mob boss: a person who lived, breathed, smoked cigars and did horrible things. Not cackle maniacally while his hostages were lowered into a vat of acid only to be saved at the last second by Batman/Superman/The Flash, but actually run a mafia with its share of beating, maiming, killing and generally hurting people. Alive, he's a reminder that there are bad, powerful people out there who hurt others; and when he dies, it shows that someone more powerful than you can hurt you if they don't care about ethics or consequences, and it's messy, and it's most definitely not a good thing.

          I did not get that from this story, but now I understand why others did and why you wanted to write it. I'm happy that I have a reason to respect this story and its fans even if I don't count myself among them. As intentionally unpleasant stories go, I highly recommend The Way of Shadows and the rest of the Night Angel Trilogy that I haven't read yet but have no doubt I will love. 

          I would describe the book as fantasy Assassin's Creed meets Jessica Jones, with child sexual abuse. It's dark, depressing, and disturbing without ever being exploitive or unnecessarily graphic. It's everything that I think an unpleasant story should be as it forces you to confront inhumanity without giving up on humanity. And now that I think about it, it's actually pretty rational.

      *Game of Thrones*/ASoIaF is light on narrative causality, and while that helped it carve itself a unique niche, it also means a lot of it is unsatisfying. 

      Things you *want* to happen may be abandoned; characters you *want* to see evolve and progress may die or face endless setbacks; virtue and cleverness may get punished by chance or inertia. 

      This is ultimately why I dropped the book series.

  /u/xamueljones had suggested we do another collective read-through.  I nominate [Algorithms to Live By](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Live-Computer-Science-Decisions/dp/1627790365/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1466119826&sr=8-1&keywords=algorithms+to+live+by#reader_1627790365), which is basically a combination of freshman-to-sophomore computer science with a bit of the probabilistic-computation school of cognitive science, for a lay audience.

  Thoughts, anyone?

  I've realized that only sleeping once a day has been one of the worst things for my school life and have decided to begin napping whenever i find it particularly difficult to work. This may be placebo effect, but i find that after an hour or two nap i am able to work more efficiently on school work and get better performance.

  Why do you think this isn't a thing in modern society and the workforce? Taking a nap, in my opinion, has done wonders for my willingness to accomplish the tasks before me. Thoughts?

    The *riposo*/*siesta* is fairly common in S. European and American countries, and broadly in warmer climates, afaik. I worked a bit in France once and they'd let us off every day after lunch for nap-time. Apparently naps are fairly standard in China, too [e.g. from [random article](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2869364/Asleep-job-order-boss-Chinese-factory-workers-given-half-hour-nap-lunch-breaks.html)]. 

    The health effects of a midday nap seem to have been examined before (e.g. [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17296887) and [here](http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/3/429.full)), though from what I can tell skimming some abstracts the results don't always point in the same direction.

      Granted, Mediterranean siesta customs are generally due to temperature being so high midday that it's quite impossible to do anything but napping without getting a heat stroke.

      I'm pretty sure standard naps aren't a thing in most french workplaces. I'm a student and have little work experience, though, so who knows.

  (dunno if this should go here or in the OT-thread. I can delete and repost if necessary)

  Is anyone here familiar with fitting multivariate hierarchical generalized linear mixture models? Specifically, I'm looking for something that'll let me have vectors of outcomes realized from, say, some combination of non-independent zero-inflated Poisson processes (or a similar enough model, or something more appropriate). I’d also like for it to be able to both accommodate measurement uncertainty and impute missing data with respect to discrete variables (both outcomes and predictors).

    It actually sounds (for once) like probabilistic programming is right for you!  I recommend Venture (which has horrific internals but allows powerful customization of inference strategies), Figaro (probabilistic programming in Scala with the ability to attach to JVM libraries), or monad-bayes (if you're a Haskell fanatic).

    [Here's a VentureScript tutorial to get you started.](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/venture/release-0.5/tutorial/)

  I was recently reading one of the codex alera books, which, for the most part had been fairly consistent in their worldbuilding. In previous books, it was a major plot point that people acquired their furies (elementals based around the Wu Xing elements(+ air)) Most people have one or two weak ones, and one of the major features of the nobility are their powerful furies (which, I should mention, are not rare). Then, someone mentions that it is not only possible, but common for furies to be passed from one person to another. 

  Its not that I don't expect people to specialize, but to ignore low-hanging fruit to the point that a member of the elite secret police has only one fury is just SOD-breaking.

  - u/Mbnewman19:
    ```
    Iirc, which I may not, that was mentioned in terms of the [leader, blanking on the name] doing that for his son. We know that Gaius had several unique powers, mostly due to his communion with the fury of Alerea itself. If you want to explain it, you can say that such transfers were merely in his province (or the lords only, etc.) Or that there has to be a familial relationship.
