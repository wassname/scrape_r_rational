## [BST][RT][HF] Name for the new novel

### Post:

Hello, wisdom of crowds, I wonder if you'll help me find a title for a book?

With *Induction* finished, I'm starting my next novel and I find myself stuck for a title.  Given that I'm the person who named a book "The Two Year Emperor" because it was about a guy who would rule for two years and would eventually decide to call himself an emperor after 132,000 words...well, yeah, maybe a little wisdom of crowds would help.

I'm taking suggestions for the title; all of /r/rational in general and the submitter of the winning name in particular will get a 'thank you' in the book itself, and I'll send the chosen submitter a copy of the ebook before it goes for sale.  (Note that I might riff off your title and use something slightly different.)  Any help much appreciated!

Here's the blurb that will go on the 'back' of the book.  Comments on the blurb also welcome:

----

Jess's father was a tinker, a golem-maker, a wizard who specialized in building the magical automata that do so much of the work of modern society.  He wasn't the best in the world, nor the richest, nor the luckiest, but he *was* the one who invented a new kind of golem, a kind that would transform the industry and change the shape of the world.  The golem wasn't stronger or faster, it wasn't a better fighter or laborer.  No, the secret that Peter Tinkersmith invented was simple: how to make a golem learn.

Unfortunately, mana -- the power that underlies all magic -- is derived from the collapse of worldlines.  Anything and anyone with the potential to cause change generates mana, just in the process of existing...and, of course, they generate even more when their death eliminates all of those worldlines at once.  A man whose invention could change the shape of the world was a potent source of energy, so perhaps the fire that claimed his life wasn't quite as accidental as the authorities ruled.

His daughter, Jess, had snuck out the night of the fire to win money at the mecho-fights. She came home to find her childhood home in smoldering ruins, her father dead, and her life shattered.  Today she survives on the streets with Rob, her father's final golem, as her only companion.  She eyes the shadows carefully, always wondering if the people who took her father might someday discover that she and Rob did not die with him.  Every day she struggles to learn a bit more, understand a bit more, for knowledge is power and she will need all the power she can get to achieve her goal:  forging a world where no child must come home to a father killed for the power of his death.

- u/JackStargazer:
  ```
  * "The Tinker's Daughter" - If the work focuses more on Jess
  * "The Murder of Worlds"
  * "Thinking Machine" - If the work focuses more on Rob
  * "The Tinker's Legacy"
  * "Erudition" - If the book ends/results in FOOM.

  "The Tinker's Daughter" is my favorite of these. Fits fantasy naming schema in my head, and makes you want to read the blurb.

    Alternatively "The Tinker's Child" if you want more ambiguity, or "The Tinker's Children" for something a bit different.

      Ooh, nice touch.  Thank you.

    Mine too.  I'm going to wait before saying "Eureka!  That's it!" to see if any other suggestions come in, but it fits really well.  Thank you.

  "The Entropy Engine" is my submission. Or "The Golem, Yet Unformed" (which is an adaptation of [Tehillim 139:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Tehillim+139%3A16&version=OJB)).

  I think my general preference for titles is that they're evocative, have a double meaning, and don't have too many conflicts on Google. But matching tone is also important, so I doubt my suggestions are what you're looking for.

    Good ideas but yes, a bit more highbrow than I was looking for.  I don't think most people would get it.

  "I t~~h~~ink, therefore I am" - silly title that popped into my head. The h, in case it's not clear enough, would be marked out but visible in some way.

  "The Changesmith's Daughter"
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Hm.  I like the term 'changesmith'; I'll look around to see where it fits as an element of the setting.
