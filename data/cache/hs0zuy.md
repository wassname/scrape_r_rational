  [Plan - The Chalice from the Palace]

  Super basic and action focused plan this time. I still want to get to research, but I think other things should be handled first.

  [Action - Zelda]

  * Speak to Taetus privately. Attempt to discern if the marriage thing is what he was hiding. Talk to him about his long-term goals. Explain that we are the ones that suggested him as an option for the power fragment and that we *do* want to work with him.
  * Send for Lensa to come talk to us. Make it clear that you are not angry with her in the message. When she arrives, ask her about the "witch" she was talking about. If Fi has the means to do so safely, attempt to detect if Old Magic has been used on Lensa recently, e.g. something resembling Fi's Compel. This part of the plan can be held off for a different update if it takes too much time.

  [Action - Link]

  * Continue the marking process.
  * See if Link has improved green imbue/blast powers as a result of his spiritual changes. These could be relevant for ghost fighting.
  * While heading toward the ghost gerudo area, activate the disc to detect for old magic periodically, especially in the area near where you sensed magic previously. Attempt to take enough readings to triangulate the source of old magic and find it. Spend up to 1000 VP on this.
  * Go talk to ghosts. Be diplomatic if possible, defend selves as needed.

  Edit: Removed Gerudo language part, it was unnecessary.

  Edit 2: Added for Taetus convo: "Explain that we are the ones that suggested him as an option for the power fragment and that we *do* want to work with him."
  ```

- u/Mathematicae:
  ```
  Pretty much exactly the same as The Chalice from the Palace for Link, with some extra meetings and marking Taetus for Zelda.

  \[Plan Por que no las dos?\]

  Zelda Actions

  * Have a meeting with Taetus without Shesan present. Confirm that there wasn't anything else he was concealing besides the whole marriage thing. Talk with him about his long-term goals. If time (and writing space permits) inform him of Link's Lightsworn status and ask his opinion on how to best ~~evangelize~~ spread the good news. If he doesn't reveal anything truly alarming, offer to have him marked. If he doesn't accept he better have a really good reason.
  * Send for Lensa to come talk to us. Make it clear that you are not angry with her in the message. When she arrives, ask her about the "witch" she was talking about. If Fi has the means to do so safely, attempt to detect if Old Magic has been used on Lensa recently, e.g. something resembling Fi's Compel. This part of the plan can be held off for a different update if it takes too much time.
  * Ask Shesan to clarify what she meant by the Niesis incident 'unsealing the fae'. Do this before meeting with Vestele.
  * Arrange your intended meeting with Vestele. Apologize for putting the Faith in that awkward position. If Shesan clarified what she meant about fae being unsealed, communicate that. Also ask if the Seekers have more information on how Sacrifice was used to appease the fae and what boons they granted in exchange. Fi can potentially replicate the boons without the whole human sacrifice issue and Ganondorf may be using Sacrifice to attack Hyrule.  Finally, are the Seekers are aware of other ancient evils that Ganondorf could potentially unleash?

  Link Actions

  * See if Link has improved green imbue/blast powers as a result of his spiritual changes. These could be relevant for ghost fighting.
  * Go talk to ghosts. Be diplomatic if possible, defend selves as needed. Use the disc for more precise directions.

  ~~Meta choice: Taetus should be the 3rd viewpoint character and Koja with a passive mark, if both are successfully marked.~~

  Edit: ~~Since Fi can't mark people simultaneously, marking Koja should start immediately. Marking Taetus would have to happen after it completes.~~

  Based on the QM answer removing marking Koja.
  ```

  - u/Cariyaga:
    ```
    I support this plan, though I'd prefer we gather blin for mad science, and poke at the idea of marking Ibosso for the purposes of getting a ghost army.
    ```

- u/Cariyaga:
  ```
  Modification of Mathematicae's modification of Salaris' plan. This one adjusts some wording (Notably, not leaving Taetus the option to refuse the mark), and adds in pursuit of Blin test subjects for more dangerous void magic. 

  [Plan - Sacrifices and Servants]

  Zelda Actions

  * Have a meeting with Taetus without Shesan present. Confirm that there wasn't anything else he was concealing besides the whole marriage thing. Talk with him about his long-term goals. If time (and writing space permits) inform him of Link's Lightsworn status and ask his opinion on how to best evangelize spread the good news. If he doesn't reveal anything truly alarming, inform him that he will be accepting the mark of the Goddess' agent, Fi.

  * Send for Lensa to come talk to us. Make it clear that you are not angry with her in the message. When she arrives, ask her about the "witch" she was talking about. If Fi has the means to do so safely, attempt to detect if Old Magic has been used on Lensa recently, e.g. something resembling Fi's Compel. This part of the plan can be held off for a different update if it takes too much time.

  * Ask Shesan to clarify what she meant by the Niesis incident 'unsealing the fae'. Do this before meeting with Vestele.

  * Arrange your intended meeting with Vestele. Apologize for putting the Faith in that awkward position. If Shesan clarified what she meant about fae being unsealed, communicate that. Also ask if the Seekers have more information on how Sacrifice was used to appease the fae and what boons they granted in exchange. Fi can potentially replicate the boons without the whole human sacrifice issue and Ganondorf may be using Sacrifice to attack Hyrule. Finally, are the Seekers are aware of other ancient evils that Ganondorf could potentially unleash?

  * Arrange for the capture and containment of Blin, who may serve as test subjects for more dangerous magical experimentation. 


  Link Actions

  * Mark Koja iff it won't cost significantly more than Taetus, or we decide against marking Taetus. 

  * See if Link has improved green imbue/blast powers as a result of his spiritual changes. These could be relevant for ghost fighting.

  *    Continue testing the disc's void magic detection and attempting to improve it. See if you can find the source of magic you detected in the ghost area. Spend up to 1000 VP on this.

  *    Go talk to ghosts. Be diplomatic if possible, defend selves as needed; do not be afraid to draw back and reengage later.
  ```

  - u/Lugnut1206:
    ```
    approve of this plan, but I want Koja to only be marked if... A) we decide to mark Taetus, do so, and find that it won't cost more to mark or B) we decide not to mark Taetus

    In other words, Taetus has "priority" in my eyes as the more important mark - Koja has some benefits and will get us some VP gain.
    ```

- u/Kurkistan:
  ```
  **Rules Announcement: Fi Admin Privileges**

  With the elimination of "Legacy" as an entity in the quest, a gap has been opened up to explain where [Fi's SOP](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/fzscpf/rtdc_legacy_of_the_goddess_a_rational_zelda_quest/fn9mztr/) comes from, as well as how to resolve conflicts between Marked.

  As of now we are codifying that Zelda is the primary authority on Fi's behavior. She defines Fi's SOP and what Fi will or will not do. If, for instance, Zelda didn't want to allow Link to be able to use Fi's MP reserves, then she would have the power to forbid it.

  Admin privileges can be assigned to other Marked via ᏪᏅᏮ'ᏡᏨᏨᎲ' ᏇᎤᏫᏬ'ᏇᏅᏍ' ᎹᎺᏅᏅᎤᏈ \[voting\]. Death or permanent incapacity of the current admin will trigger an immediate ᎣᏫᏮ'ᏨᏅᏨᏭ ᎲᏫᏅᏅᎤᎾᏫᏯ ᎹᎺᏅᏅᎤᏡᏨᏨᏨ\~ᏈᏨ \[vote\].

  \---

  **Second Announcement (less ruley):**

  We have decided to expand the points system a bit more. For a range from 20-200 points (specifics depending upon complexity of request) you can get the QMs to give an "If I were in your shoes" type answer to the question at hand.

  Disclaimer: Obviously sans-QM knowledge, absolutely *not* guaranteed to be a magic answer to your question that leaves you super satisfied.

  Amount of effort scales roughly linearly from "honest answer after thinking about it for 5 minutes" to "very serious answer, at minimum meeting Vecht's standard of 'serious.'"
  ```

  - u/-Vecht-:
    ```
    > Vecht's standard of 'serious.'

    super srs

  ```
  ~~**Voting time!**~~ E: Voting is closed.

  Zelda is in Castletown pondering the vagaries of life while Link & co. are at the mountain pass and prepared to lay the dead to rest, one way or another.

  **What do you do next?**

  - No really, we want to mark Koja
  - That's silly. Taetus is our man!
  - ¿Por que no los dos?
  - Accept Taetus's's's' hand in marriage
  - Have Taetus thrown into the deepest dungeon you can find and throw away the key
  - Kick Shesan in the face
  - Make Shesan marry Taetus if she likes him so much!
  - Bust some ghosts
  - Negotiate with some ghosts
  - Liaise with the Zora
  - Talk with Vestele about that whole co-opting the faith thing
  - Spread Lightsworn propaganda and raise a cult with Link as its god
  - Find some Fae, because that's gone super well thus far.
  - BLIN DEATH CULT
  - [X] Today we do SCIENCE
  - Other (write-in)

  Your previous VP total was 11079.

  Fi spent:

  * 76 VP on telepathic communications

  * 200 VP on two ethereal avatars

  * 100 VP on marking Koja

  * 742 VP on charging the stone disk artifact at Link's request

  Marking Koja was unsuccessful. Fi believes it will require between 1950 and 6550 additional VP to successfully mark her. Her estimate that "marking additional people requries more VP" has increased from 21.3% to 24.5%.

  Chapter 20 spanned 1 day. During that time, you earned 42 VP from Zelda and 40 VP from Link.

  You have earned an additional 150 VP per day (out of a possible 250) from the planning and discussion incentive bonus. Total: 150.

  **You currently have 10193 VP.**

  The more I see of Shesan the more I'm surprised at her ability to recruit fanatically loyal agents. I don't see how you can build such trust when you routinely go behind peoples' back like she does. Unless she only does this to Zelda?

  \[PROTO PLAN - Divine Right\]

  \[Action - Zelda\]

  * Test using compel on a imprisoned spy to get them to spill the beans.
  * Call the most powerful people in the kingdom (Taetus a must) into a meeting.
     * Their should be at most 6 people in the room besides Zelda.
     * No talking, no objections, no questions.
  * Compel everyone besides Zelda to spill their most damaging secrets, and profess loyalty.
     * Let them know that anyone but Zelda abusing these secrets is high treason. Not only will we execute you, we will liquidate portions of your estate and hand them out as we see fit.
  * Announce that  Lord Councilor is a temporary position, and will be dissolved after the crises has ended, and any decrees will be subject to royal review.
     * However, the crises is not over, and if anyone wants their powers back before it is, they need to prove they can do better than Taetus.
  * Remind them that we are Zelda Hyrule. We rule by the will of our Father, the Blood in our Veins, and Divine Right.
     * Open the floor to questions.

  The nobles don't like Taetus having power, and they are worried that it will become permanent, because they know we are weak and might not be able to stop him. This assures them that his power won't be permanent, and that we will be able to stop him (because we know all his secrets, and have freaky powers that none of them even guessed we might have.).

  And, it enhances our power over them, so if they disagree, they can take a hike.
  ```

  - u/Salaris:
    ```
    I don't think Zelda has the right personality to use this style of confrontation effectively. She's not a master political schemer, and even if she was, this has huge potential to backfire.

    Broken down another way, we stand to gain the following through this kind of strategy:


    * Secrets we can use against people.
    * If someone is overtly planning against us, we may be able to get rid of them immediately.
    * A demonstration of this kind of power could be intimidating.

    Downsides include:


    * We alienate everyone we do this to, potentially permanently.
    * We motivate everyone present who has a sufficiently terrible secret to get rid of both us and everyone else present in the room.
    * We expend a potentially tremendous amount of our resources on something that may have no immediate benefits.
    * Our intimidation comes from the usage of a power we have barely tested. It could fail to work the way we intend, for example expiring almost immediately or being countered by sufficient willpower, targets with sufficient mana, etc.
    * Making powerful people aware we have this means they can plan around it in the future. 
    * Using this tool now means it is no longer a surprise tool for true emergencies.
    * Using this as our tool to inflict fear when we do not have the VP to use it consistently means that we are putting ourselves in a position where we may be put in a position where we are expected to use this and cannot utilize it.

    The single most important factor here, in  my opinion, is that Compel has not been tested adequately to attempt to deploy it against more than one person at a time. If we want to try to use Compel aggressively, we need to have a much better understanding of it's capabilities and limits first, in my opinion.

    If we want to try Compelling someone to spill their secrets, we should test it on one person - perhaps one of the "traitor" sheikah. If we've managed to capture any of Ganondorf's agents, they'd be even better potential targets for testing. 

    We could also try testing with a trusted ally in order to get feedback on how it feels to them, an accurate idea of how long it lasts, if it can be resisted, etc.

  - u/Mathematicae:
    ```
    I do not approve of this plan.
    ```

  - u/Lugnut1206:
    ```
    i don't approve of this plan, for the exact same reason as mathematicae

    it's a bit spicy for me
    ```

  - u/Cariyaga:
    ```
    I'd be super down for this plan if it weren't for the fact that compelling costs a stupid amount of VP.
    ```

    - u/immortal_lurker:
      ```
      My point of view, is that I think its worth it. Yes, it is a nigh ruinous cost, but it should button up our political and administrative problems for the foreseeable future. Some of the nobles might very well be scheming against the crown in dangerous ways. This might get us some immediately actionable intel.

      But also, the cost is 100-1000. Are all humans at 1000? This plan might be cheaper than the staggering 7k worst case. Perhaps as small as 4k, which would still make it the most expensive thing we've ever done.

      I guess, the game as we've seen it at the moment is split in three. There is "what the f is going on, really?", "Dungeon crawling", and "stop Hyrule from falling apart". This *wins* a third of the game, and spending most of our VP seems like an acceptable price to pay. We will get more eventually. Judging by the number of Tri Force shards still out there, we are fairly early on, and 7k might not be that much in the grand scheme of things. 

      Its not a fully polished idea, I don't even name anyone specific besides Taestus. But I think everything else shown here is a half measure, or one that makes our allies think they need to go behind our back to get things accomplished, and makes them believe that they *can* go behind our back.

      *We need to go for the throat*. Demise is pulling moves like "Collapse a neighboring kingdom overnight", "Send a wholly expendable species to fight to the last man", "Kill their goddess before they even know the fight is on", and these are his opening moves. We do not have time to play nice or leave openings. In the long term, this will damage our relationships with everyone, and thats fine, because in the short term it will make everyone too terrified to start shit, *and* it will stop whatever shit they currently have going dead in its tracks.
      ```

  - u/eltegid:
    ```
    What about doing it only with Taetus first, and then conferring with him and maybe someone else about how to better approach this plan?
    ```

- u/eltegid:
  ```
  All plans involve speaking to Taetus, but there's one thing I'm missing: talking about how to keep running Hyrule efficiently or how to keep him as a regent with the least amount of pushback from the nobles. In other words, talk with him freely about wether the marriage is a good idea or not.

  Maybe it's better to wait until we can see into his head, though.
  ```

  - u/Lugnut1206:
    ```
    I approve of this line of questioning - if it's possible to slip into this chapter.
    ```

- u/Cariyaga:
  ```
  For the QMs' convenience, I'd like for support for the following options to be laid out below:

  * Marking Taetus ASAP

  * Marking Taetus conditionally 

  * Marking Koja ASAP

  * Marking Koja conditionally 

  And of these options, I would support marking Taetus ASAP and Koja conditionall.
  ```

  - u/eltegid:
    ```
    Mark Taetus ASAP and Koja conditionally, yeah

    EDIT: Mark Taetus ASAP and Koja possibly never, since it'd come too late for ghost stuff anyway.

    Active marks are Zelda, Link and Taetus (obviously)
    ```

  - u/Mathematicae:
    ```
    ~~Mark Koja ASAP and Taetus conditionally.~~

    ~~Ghost stuff is happening tomorrow, marking takes all day, and Fi can't mark multiple people at a time. So we have to mark Koja now if we want it active for ghost stuff.~~

    Changed my mind mark Taetus only for now.
    ```

  - u/crivtox:
    ```
    Marking Taetus  ASAP and Koja conditionally.
