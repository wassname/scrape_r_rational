  [spoiler](#s "That said: Twilight was indeed being evil. She was pretty clearly just motivated by some kind of status quo bias, or something; she likes the way Equestria is run *now*, and damn the possibilities. She would not make a good Alicorn Princess.")

  In response to [your review.](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/233242/the-pill#comment/6036916) Here be spoilers.

  First, I feel you were undeservedly rude to mrmaximus, and you should consider apologising. Just because you didn't like the final plot twist is no reason to insult the author. The story was reasonably well-written, the jokes worked, and it's entirely your personal interpretation that the bad guys won in the end - an interpretation which I do not share and the author does not share.

  So what if it doesn't conform to your beliefs? Normal people are perfectly capable of reading stories written from a viewpoint that's different from their own. It's one of the best ways to learn about others.

  Now then, for someone who claims to be rational, you're really not parano[i](/r/NotParanoidEnough)d enough about rogue superintelligences and un-Friendly AIs. Rainbow Dash takes an *under-tested drug which does not behave as it was supposed to*, and decides to conquer the neighbouring empire (and has a good shot at pulling it off) - which Twilight and *the original Rainbow Dash* find abhorrent. Clearly, she's lost her moral compass.

  I think it's hopelessly optimistic to trust that she really has found the best solution - by the end of the story, she's one step away from becoming a cackling supervillain, and three steps from becoming a paperclip maximiser. If you create a superhuman (superpony) intelligence that's not provably Friendly, pulling the plug on it is absolutely the right thing to do.
