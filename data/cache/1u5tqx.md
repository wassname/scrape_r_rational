## What bugs me from children's fiction

### Post:

Most of the most popular kids book series of the past few years have had one thing in common. *The 39 Clues*, *Harry Potter*, *Percy Jackson*/*Heroes of Olympus*/*Kane Chronicles*, *Artemis Fowl*, even *Series of Unfortunate Events* and *Young Merlin*. (Ooh, and *Star Wars*, if that counts.) That's that the protagonists of these stories get their "interestingness", if you will, from something out of their own control. Predestined greatness.

* The kids in *39 Clues* were born into special bloodlines.

* Harry Potter's parents were wizards, and his mom gave him magical blood protection, not to mention the whole prophecy thing. [Prophecies](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropheciesAreAlwaysRight) are a tell-tale sign of predestined greatness.

* In Rick Riordan's series, the protagonists are descended from gods.

* Artemis Fowl's parents are/were rich.

* The kids in *Unfortunate Events* were rich and had nasty family members.

* Young Merlin is born with all sorts of special powers.

* Anakin was the immaculately-born "Chosen One" to bring balance to the force. Once again, another sign: ["Chosen One"](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne).

* I'm probably missing a bunch, feel free to share if you think of any!

To me, this fits the "long lost uncle bequeaths millions in inheritance" trope. These kids are special. These kids are extraordinary. And not because of their own actions! Because they were given that extraordinary-ness by adults.

There are admittedly a few exceptions to this rule. For instance, *The Hunger Games* trilogy (and, to a lesser extent, the knockoff series *Divergent*)... While not *rational*, per se, they surely could fall under the "soft rational" or "medium-hard science fiction" category.

Anyways. Just wanted to get that out there.

ETA: Ooh, ooh, I thought of another one that doesn't use this trope: *The Mysterious Benedict Society*. Excellent books. And I think they actually *would* fit the general characteristics of rational fics, as listed in the sidebar. Hmm...

  You make a good case but the main "interestingness" about Artemis Fowl is his intellect. He has to manage the finances or his family would be ruined anyway. Besides, if anything the thing he got from his parents would be criminal contacts rather than wealth.

    Mm, that's true. Though his butler/bodyguard - whatever his name is - saves him from death numerous times, and that's a result of his parent's wealth. I'd say that there's less to it than you think.

    Either way, if a boy with Fowl's intellect was born in a poor family instead of a rich one, for instance, he'd not be able to achieve anywhere near the magnitude of awesomeness that AF did.

  David Brin wrote a good essay to this effect in 1999, [*"Star Wars" despots vs. "Star Trek" populists*](http://www.salon.com/1999/06/15/brin_main/), lambasting Lucas and the SW movies

  Well yes, you could argue that the stories are something out of their control based on their birth, but that's such a narrow definition. Every story has that plot. If the plot involved something within their control, they would end it without any drama. Everyone is given their "interestingness" by something out of their control, because they were born with certain genetic predispositions and brought up in a society that wanted to raise them a certain way.

  In *The Hunger Games*, there is a lot that is special about the main characters. They had to be born in a specific situation where they would participate in the hunger games, and they had to be determined enough to win. They had to be the right people in the right time, just like rich people or wizards. Sure, the determinism about it is less blatant, but it's just as true.

  Well, there's two things to say here.

  1) Duuude, you should totally read Diane Duane's *Young Wizards* series.  No chosen ones there!

  2) Unfortunately, a realistic portrayal of a lower-proletarian lifestyle doesn't really allow for "and then the kid had a brilliant opportunity to get his hands on Applied Phlebotinum, become a magical knight, and save the world from dragons."  Usually even the pettiest Applied Phlebotinum is kind of confined to the middle classes.  In fact, the life of a truly impoverished person is so difficult that they'd Miss the Call because they're too busy struggling to eat or pay rent.  It's *hard* to tell stories about kids that poor.

  It has been a while since I read *A Series of Unfortunate Events*, but if I recall correctly, a big part of what made the Baudelaire orphans interesting as characters was that they were very clever and resourceful. Violet was an inventor and Klaus was well read (Sunny was an infant, and thus, somewhat less of interest, to me at least). The money mostly served primarily as a lure for the villians of the stories.

  I think the kids would have turned out pretty interesting even if they weren't wealthy and terribly unlucky.
