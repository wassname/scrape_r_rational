  So that was an entertaining round of Fae politics.  Is there a term for that?  Murderolitics?  Insanocracy?  

  Also: “Be careful not to provoke anyone you are not capable of killing,” he instructed me gently.

  AWWWWWWWWWWWWWW

  edit: Well, time to update the TVTropes quote page with this gem "Gods, did she intend to gossip with Akua Sahelian? This was surreal even by my standards, and I’d turned into fucking mist this week."

  edit 2: Goddamn can we just name this best chapter already?  I mean, Jesus!

    ```
    The Hunt are just lucky that Cat hasn't realized that they are how Gods Below gifted her that supply of oiled up manservants/womanservants she's been pining after for a few books
    ```

  - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
    ```
    Stabocracy?
    ```

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      The goblins have a monopoly on the name Stabocracy.
      ```

      - u/GeeJo:
        ```
        They change the name whenever anybody finds out about it, though.
        ```

- u/TideofKhatanga:
  ```
  >I rarely drank. Enough to prove I’d obtained the correct antidote, but it was never my sin of choice.

  Akua in a single sentence. Doing a ton of shit she didn't care about just to keep up with social expectations. I would bet that even her fling with Fasili was merely a way to keep him happy at the moment he was most useful. No wonder she wanted to end the world and watch it burn. 

  Also, Indrani didn't repeat herself once when calling her names. That's some GSGT Hartman shit right there.

  Edit: rather ugly typo
  ```

  ```
  Cat and Hakram's interactions are my favorite, I hate that he's leaving again. Hope he doesn't die.

      he might be the mini boss who has to die before anyone defeats her
      ```

- u/AurelianoTampa:
  ```
  >Hakram, that gossipy bitch.

  Scott Pilgrim reference? Even if it isn't, it made me laugh! 

  Judging by the comments I keep reading, I feel like I'm one of the few not shipping Cat with Vivienne (or gunning for some odd threesome or foursome among the girls). Wasn't it established that she's straight? I honestly would like Cat best with Hakram... They already love each other, Cat is bisexual, Hakram's amorous, and physiological differences between species aren't really a problem when your body is a concept. Hell, Cat could probably glamour up some tusks to get Hakram's motor running if her flat cow teeth turn him off too much!

  Anyway, good chapter, nice cliff, and a plus that EE dispelled the confusion about "dark elves." I wonder why the term stuck if drow aren't elves and don't really look like them?

    People still call Native Americans 'Indians' regardless of how far NA is from India/East Indies. Labels are sticky.

      ```
      cuz he is. and honestly, i think its genious to characterize him as a gossipy slut. makes me like him even more
      ```

  - u/WalterTFD:
    ```
    Yeah, Thief is 'almost painfully straight', I believe it was phrased.  I think that's why Cat hasn't done anything beyond leer.
    ```

- u/Arancaytar:
  ```
  Cat pursuing Viv blindsided me, I must be exceptionally oblivious.

  Or maybe she's just been more subtle about it than with Kilian, because *that* was telegraphed almost the moment they met.

  Edit: Of course, come to think of it, that was as much Kilian's work as Cat's.
  ```

  - u/DTravers:
    ```
    IIRC Catherine's monologue in an earlier mentioned that she found her attractive, but "Vivienne was as straight as a ruler.".
    ```

    - u/Arancaytar:
      ```
      Ironically, Cat herself is a ruler and not particularly straight.
      ```

      - u/DTravers:
        ```
        An excellent pun, my good (wo)man.
        ```

  - u/ATRDCI:
    ```
    Some of that may be self denial. From Book 4 Chapter 4: Warpath, during Thief's informal debriefing before Procer crossed the Stairway:


    >“I’d kiss you, if you weren’t so painfully indifferent to women,” I replied with a smirk.
    >
    >She coughed awkwardly. I had no intentions there whatsoever, but seeing her get jittery at the lightest of suggestions was always good for a laugh.
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      This line felt way too "workplace sexual harassment" for this series, though.
      ```

- u/Cariyaga:
  ```
  I've got to say, it's quite charming to have some goddamn asexual representation.
  ```

  - u/CeruleanTresses:
    ```
    It's especially validating to see other characters (e.g. Cat and Archer) acknowledging it as Masego's intrinsic orientation, rather than treating it as an obstacle to be overcome.

    'Course, I'll be happiest when I start seeing more ace characters with varied personality types--including warm, socially adept, emotionally expressive aces--rather than hyper-focused ultranerd research dudes every time. But ace Masego is worlds better than no ace, and Masego is a really fun character regardless.

      ```
      >'Course, I'll be happiest when I start seeing more ace characters with varied personality types--including warm, socially adept, emotionally expressive aces--rather than hyper-focused ultranerd research dudes every time.

      Protagonist from Sufficiently Advanced Magic at least splits the difference here.
      ```

    - u/Cariyaga:
      ```
      Right. And the fact that his being ace follows from his character rather than being shoehorned in in any regard is really lovely.
      ```

      - u/CeruleanTresses:
        ```
        I guess I sort of wish it didn't follow from his character as much--I don't want to feel like he's ace *because* he's not very social and prioritizes his research above human contact and physical urges, since of course in reality any personality type can coincide with an ace orientation, and he'd still be ace if he abandoned magic tomorrow. That said, I don't have any inherent problem with ace characters who are like Masego, I'm just looking forward to a future where that's only one of a wide variety of ace personalities represented in fiction.
        ```

        - u/Cariyaga:
          ```
          Oh, I don't mean it in that way just I've seen a lot of fics where it's just thrown in kind of thoughtlessly.

          ...I blame my being tired for this but I just misread Masego as [Mettaton](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/undertale/images/2/2b/Mettaex_sprite.png/revision/latest?cb=20160318032021). Snrk.
          ```

  - u/TaltosDreamer:
    ```
    Right? I have an ace friend who I think is going to love every part of the story, but that is some icing for the cake.
    ```

    - u/ProfessorPhi:
      ```
      You've also got a character on Bojack Horseman which is an utterly fantastic show imo
      ```

- u/LLJKCicero:
  ```
  > “I know he’s not interested in bedplay, Cat,” Indrani snorted. “Come on. Last time he saw me shirtless he asked if I needed healing.”

  Masego is adorable.

  I can't believe he confused Archer with Genji!
