  Huh. I must say it was kinda obvious that Emma would survive but I’m disappointed at the  “power of friendship & determination ” explanation

    Well maybe she will faint from blood loss and almost die next chapter .

    ```
    I'm a week late of course, but I would argue "getting up for a few seconds to fire a single bullet, in spite of mortal injury" is well within acceptable bounds. That's the sort of thing that people do in the real world with some frequency. Not kids, of course, but it's already established these aren't ordinary children.

  The little monkey demon thing is clearly Chekhov's pet and its going to be a problem in the future .
  Maybe I'ts smart enough to tell their enemies about what happened ,or just finding it will indicate other demons that Lewis is dead.
