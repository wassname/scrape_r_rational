## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  So, a lot of the "bootstrap civilization" stories, cognizant of the fact that modern society is built off the backs of genaration after genaration of machines building machines, give their charachter some pretty massive advantages. For example, easy contact with royalty, the ability to use magic, or having their charachter just, out of sheer happenstance, be the kind of person that's memorized, among other things: the bessemer process, a macroeconomics textbook, the art of war, gunsmithing, the periodic table, etcetera.

  But it occured to me that'a not exactly necessary. Most of us have smartphones, and with battery conserving tactics most smartphones can last for eight hours.

  So with the much more plausible assumptions that an SI will prioritize finding themselves a writing material, and that they'll have a fully charged phone (okay, not that plausible), what set of images could the SI have on their phone, transcribable in under eight hours, that could plausibly give an SI the knowledge they need for bootstrapping?

  **edit:** to clarify a little, I'm asking this in the sense of "what set of images should *I* put on my phone" (or any other /r/rational reader) to prepare for uplift. Not because I seriously think it's a possibility, just as a thought exercise.
  ```

  - u/ZeroNihilist:
    ```
    You could potentially circumvent the eight hour time limit if your first set of images allowed you to construct a generator and any other necessary things to charge your phone.

    I'm not sure exactly what would be required for that. From "scratch", you might have to do the whole bootstrapping process up to and including smelting and forging, which could take longer than 8 hours.

    There may be a way to short-circuit the process for the specific application of charging your phone, but I wouldn't know how off the top of my head. Getting it wrong could potentially brick your phone, which would be disastrous in the long term.
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      It's my understanding that a simple generator, in and of itself, isn't too hard to build if you can generate electricity, and phone chargers are designed to take in a fairly wide range of voltages and amperages.

      The real problem would be acquiring the materials to build that generator, and if you've just been dropped into a random fantasy world/historical era you're going to have far more pressing concerns than recharging your phone, so it's not feasible until the long term.

      In the short term, you need to get useful knowledge down fast.
      ```

      - u/buckykat:
        ```
        In the short term, get some fruit or root vegetables and bits of copper and zinc.
        ```

  - u/Dwood15:
    ```
    Another thing, is that if a person were to be SI'd into a story, it's not unlikely that they would have a case with an extra battery, like if they had a Galaxy (S3-S6) phone, that would be reasonable, OR the user would have case battery as well, doubling the phone's life span. 


    My phone gains about 2-3 hours of active use when in Airplane mode. Then with battery saving turned on, a good 12-13 hours is reasonable. If you had been planning for a two-way trip, say a trip across country, you'd probably have most of the external power sources already figured out any way. I mean, with my last phone, I had a case that doubled as a battery pack, giving me an extra 1.25 battery charge. 

    Your story could be similar to: go on trip, go on hike early in the morning, bringing charged phone and case from night before, get trapped in fantasy world. Have battery packs. The only thing would be to make why the main character would have all that stuff on their person on their phone already. 

    If someone had a Kindle or the kindle app on their phone, on the other hand, they could be reading Art of War for fun (yes, people do) or other historical war books (about the Mongols or Exploits of Roman Generals) for fun as well. That, and a Kindle can last for weeks without needing to be recharged.


    So I guess my point is that extra batteries for their phone or a Kindle would be likely.
    ```

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      There are cheaply available battery banks with solar panels. I imagine they're used for hiking occasionally, so if the SI is into hiking or camping it would be plausible.
      ```

  - u/gabbalis:
    ```
    Hold on, why would you need a phone? Are you telling me you aren't constantly wearing your [Time Traveler Essentials Shirt](https://www.topatoco.com/graphics/00000001/qw-cheatsheet.png). Just in case?
    ```

    - u/rhaps0dy4:
      ```
      That's way too advanced stuff to be built, most of the time. Except maybe the electric generator with copper and a river/waterfall. Actually this would help charge your phone, as suggested in the parent thread!
      ```

  - u/Predictablicious:
    ```
    If we're talking about written material why not something like a Kindle Oasis with an offline copy of the Wikipedia.

    Also there are portable chargers, I always carry two with me, a pocket-sized one (3Ah) and a larger one in my laptop bag (21Ah). The Oasis battery seems to be 245mAh so, theoretically we're talking about 100 charges with 23h of usage per charge.

    Even if one assumes the chargers and the kindle are at half capacity we're talking about 50 days of non-stop reading.
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      The thing is, that's just giving the charachter arbitrary advantages, which is the whole problem.

      The reason I'm talking about a phone is that it's much easier to justify "character downloaded a .zip file on a lark and then forgot about it until now," than it is to justify "character is optimally set up to uplift civilization due to bizarrely prescient decisions with electronics."

      Some handwaving is always required to start these cross-world stories, what with Narrative Causality, but the less of it there is, the more immersed the audience.
      ```

      - u/Predictablicious:
        ```
        The character already has arbitrary characteristics that may be advantageous, e.g. college degree, knowledge of science, lack of chronic medical issues (including mental illnesses) that would impair him without his medicine, particular mindset, specific background (e.g. he read some book before that in the story will be relevant/quoted).

        Like /u/Dwood15 said if you start from a character that was planning for a hike/trip it would make sense to have an ebook reader, a decent portable charger and, if it was somebody like me, have an offline Wikipedia on it (I had on my older tablet before it died). IMO if you play it right you can still make it challenging, e.g. wrong/missing info on the wiki, the offline version is text only and the relevant part are on images, the search tools are very basic.
        ```

  ```
  I noticed a little while ago that there's a distinct lack of rational fiction set in the real world, either modern or historical. Also noticing that there are certain lessons, insights, or other basic information that's lacking from rational fiction in general because of the tendency to make characters significantly overpowered for their settings (usually by exploiting some seemingly simple aspect of the setting that somehow the millions of equally well placed people who came before them somehow didn't think to exploit) or else by being unusually well placed to execute an exploit or apply some rationality with large and far-sweeping consequences.

  With that in mind, I picked up a biography of Napoleon, thinking it would help to illuminate exactly how real world stories of those who climbed top or were otherwise able to have an outsized influence on the world differ from rational fiction.

  What I've discovered is that Napoleon basically exploited as aspect of his world that none of the equally well placed people who came before him did, and was unusually well placed to have an outsized influence on society.

  He read *everything* even tangentially related to warfare and the basic concept of a Great Man as he was taught it and turned theoretical tactical suggestions into applied battlefield strategy, and micromanaged the shit out of his army's logistics and supply to the point of simply making up statistics to send to the government in his requests for more supplies.

  He was the first generation of Corsican nobility offered the chance to integrate with the French nobility and attend their prestigious military academies, but unlike most other young French nobles he got early and direct exposure to national level politics on Corsica, which emboldened him in his dealings with the other nations of Europe later on. It's shocking to imagine a 27-year-old nation builder until you realize he had been pretty damn close to the center of Corsican politics at 17. That, plus being one of few competent military officers who hung around during the Revolution meant he was thrust into high command in his mid twenties instead of ~50 like most others.

  I will note that the second aspect as a "just-so" story feeling to it. If I had been there at the time, I'm not sure I would have picked a Corsican as "Most Likely to Take Over the French Government" on the basis that he had experience in national politics, but I imagine it would have been a useful discriminator in looking for those likely to make an attempt at a coup.

  The one area he does differ from most rationalist heroes is that he's incredibly, incredibly, and repeatedly lucky. He's discharged from the Army as a junior officer for desertion while he's off getting caught up in Corsican politics, but on return finds that his discharge papers have been lost and he's been granted a promotion instead based on the shortage of available officers. His response? He demands an extra promotion on the basis that it would match the rank he was awarded in the Corsican National Guard.

  Later, when he leaves his Army in Egypt to return to France and effect the coup of the national government, he's sailing through waters patrolled regularly by the British Navy, which had just destroyed the fleet meant to escort him and his army back, but gets lucky with the wind and doesn't encounter them.

  I haven't gotten to the downturn of his career yet, but the author has at least hinted that it's more a matter of his perennial luck running out than any dramatic shift in his approach to problems, so we'll see how that pans out.

    I'm not sure there's that much improbability to justify away with Napoleon. He rose to power in an era of great political instability, and since at that time France was militarizing like crazy he had the manpower to start a series of conquest that lasted until his empire collapsed under its weight. I'm personally not sure whether he was really really good at what he did or just really lucky, but I certainly don't see him as a hyper-rational/one-man-industrial-revolution protagonist.
    ```

    - u/JanusTheDoorman:
      ```
      If I had to sum him up so far - he appears to have been genuinely and exceptionally competent as a general. He was incredibly detailed focused and capable of a level of micromanagement that I can hardly believe.

      His record in other areas is sketchier - he essentially appears to have created satellite states for France based on the principle that their institutions should have the apparent structure and appearance of Republican idealism, but should have particular restrictions that obligated them to France, or where possible to him directly. Most of these subordinate states were conquered and dissolved or annexed directly into France in short order, though, so no real insight into how well they would have fared longer term.

      With regard to France, his assumption of almost total control as First Consul certainly triggered a massive turnaround in the state of the country, but a large part of that was probably simply more due to obvious corrections to the faults and inadequacies of the Directory which preceded the Consulate.

      You're absolutely right that the chaos of the revolution was what opened the door for Napoleon's rise to power, and certainly an outside observer would probably have predicted the rise of *some* strongman dictator in its wake as a significant possibility, but the question of why that person was Napoleon takes a bit more analysis. The proximate answer is simply that he was the most successful of France's generals and had the ambition to parlay that success into political power when there was a relative power vacuum in France, but digging deeper into why he was successful, and why he succeeded when there's evidence of at least a dozen other plots to overthrow the Directory at the same time as his coup was being put in place is more interesting. I'm not sure I'm able to offer a satisfactory answer other than "Everyone knew it had to be someone, and he was the obvious focal point to unite the nation."

    Malcolm Gladwell makes a similar case with regards to Bill Gates in *Outliers*. Bill Gates gained access to a computer in 1968 when he was 13 years old, which made him one of very few people his age learning programming, and also spared him having to learn programming using punch cards.
    ```

    - u/JanusTheDoorman:
      ```
      *Outliers* is interesting, but I've gone back and forth in my opinion of it since I first read it. The whole book is a weird mix of starting off from a good scientific foundation (The whole 10,000 hours of deliberate practice leading to expert-level performance seems to trace reasonably well back to the Cambridge Manual of Expertise and Expert Performance and Ericsson, et al. (2007) - "Making of an Expert") but that gets piled under a whole lot of anecdote and conjecture.

      That's not the worst writing style in the world, as it makes it far more accessible to people unused to the academic citation-chain style of writing, but also prompts people to go off on their own tangents and rely on anecdotal evidence really heavily when thinking about this sort of thing. 

      Ultimately, I think the snowball effect (wherein early initial advantages can be decisive because they prompt the further accumulation of info and resources that further exaggerate the advantage, and on and on...) is a valid observation. I also believe that deliberate practice is probably the dominant if not near-exclusive determinant of performance outside of genetics and physiology.

      Where I think *Outliers* and the culture that grew up around it after it was published fall short as generalizable advice or a set of parables for rationalists, is the implied conclusion of believing both of those two things - that success can be predictably achieved by deliberately practicing the most advantageous skills. That's how you end up at "Tiger Mom".

      The tricky part is identifying which skills you're best placed to take advantage of, and which will be most advantageous ~10-20 years down the line.

      For Bill Gates, he might have known that access to a computer gave him a rare chance to develop skills few others would have, but would the *rational* prediction at that point been that personal programming skill and knowledge of computers would give him a decisive advantage in his career? His family had apparently been pushing him to pursue a career in law, and his grandfather had been a bank president. Even though he's an archetypal example in *Outliers*, I think that if he had been presented the book without his story in it, it would likely have been interpreted as encouraging him to press his advantage in law or finance. Being a pioneer in a field without much in the way of established practice methods at the time would seem foolhardy.

      As such, while *Outliers* has some good methodological advice on *how* to reach a performacne goal and why focusing on performance leads to success, it's ability to predict ahead of time exactly which skills will have the biggest impact is limited, and so the scope of its thesis should not be interpreted as arguing for any particular skill over another.

  Man I hate my brain chemistry. Long history of depression/anxiety, a cup of strong coffee(!) yesterday hit me like a sledgehammer and kicked my brain into some weird metastable productive nondepressed, but not manic, attractor in my brainspace.

  I've decided, just now with little forethought, that there are two kinds of irrational characters: the proud and the stubborn. Proud characters know that their reasoning is flawed and don't care, while stubborn characters reject the idea that their reasoning is flawed. I split them up like this because I've noticed I tend to enjoy the former and despise the latter.

  I actually find characters that admit their irrational and don't see that as a bad thing to be entertaining. They're a person who chose to give into their biases and believe fallacies instead of overcoming them because they value feeding those desires over changing them. These characters are usually villains, of course, but I find myself enjoying them as characters.

  Characters that are too thick headed to realize they're irrational, on the other hand, I just find annoying. From a narrative perspective they accomplish the exact same goal of creating a character that seeks to fulfill a goal and can't be reasoned with, but it comes across as them being stupid, which I don't find entertaining. Does anyone else have thoughts on this?

  I wrote a thing about population ethics, or how to apply utilitarianism to a set of individuals:

  http://agarri.ga/post/an-alternative-population-ethics

  It introduces the topic, covers literature a little and I finally give a tentative solution that avoids the Repugnant Conclusion and seems satisfactory.

  I was close to asking people to "munchkin" and raise objections to it on the Munchkinry Thread, but then I found out it was only for fiction. If you feel like doing it though, I'll appreciate any issues you find.

The difference is the maximum price, in negative purple-welfare, that you are able to pay. All choices outside of the budget are outlawed for Green.

    I don't think the add-on rule quite works. Consider these three options:

    1. Green 1000  
    Purple -1

    2. Green 1001  
    Purple -1000

    3. Green 0  
    Purple 0

    Green's absolute best is #2, where green has 1001. Its best option with no negative purple is #3, where green has 0. Therefore it has a budget of -1001 to inflict on purple, and it is free to choose #2.

    This seems pretty bad, though ... green is only better off by +1 by switching from #1 to #2, but it imposes a cost of -999 on purple to do so!

  **Time to rebuild a library**

  My 5 terabyte harddrive went *poof* this morning, and silly me hadn't bought data-recovery insurance. Fortunately, I still have other copies of all my important data, and it'll just take a while to download everything else I'd been collecting.

  Which brings up the question: What info do *you* feel it's important to have offline copies of, gathered from the whole gosh-dang internet? A recent copy of Wikipedia and the Project Gutenberg DVD are the obvious starting places... which other info do you think pays the rent of its storage space?
