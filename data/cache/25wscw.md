  Old one, but a good one.  The proposed mechanisms for how Kaiju actually work are of course ridiculous.  But the ending, where it begins talking about how to _exploit_ the kaiju for a hyper-industrial revolution, _that_ is munchkinism at its finest.

  I think this kinda invites a framework for a Rational!Godzilla fic, maybe from the perspective of a scientist trying to boost humanity to a hyperculture, and all the interstellar/intertemporal politicking and backstabbing and giant-monster-fighting that'd entail.

  D.G. (Den) Valdron does great fan speculation about a lot of series. I'd recommend also checking out his(?) Edgar Rice Burroughs stuff, even if you've never read the Tarzan or John Carter of Mars books. He even did a speculative take on evolution of [muppets,](http://www.erbzine.com/mag17/1744.html) of all things.
