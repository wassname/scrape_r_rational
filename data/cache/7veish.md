  After finishing [Orders of Magnitude](http://www.2pih.com), I had the itch to continue writing something a bit more light-hearted. 

  My daughter is in the full-on My Little Pony stage of her life, and so over the past year or so I've passively consumed seven seasons worth of TV shows, four movies, eight or nine graphic novels, a handful of junior novelizations, and probably more than that. I find myself impressed by its commitment to world-building, and of course, I appreciate the near constant stream of winks and nods to the parents, especially in the graphic novels. 

  Given that a certain pair of unicorns make a guest appearance in HPMOR, I thought it would be amusing to write a crossover of the two worlds. 

  My goal with this is for familiarity with My Little Pony to **not** be a pre-requisite for enjoying this. Those who aren't familiar with the series may find themselves as bewildered as Harry, but the plot should stand alone, same thing with the humor and tone. 

  Criticism both positive and negative is appreciated, and I hope you enjoy!

    Interested to see a new project from you!

    There was a bit of culture shock for me as I'm not as immersed in MLP and it's a bit at odds with the more grim and serious setting of hpmor.

    Do you consider what your planning to be true ratfic or more of a fanfic crossover for fun?

      I consider it to be a ratfic, at least as much as possible given the fact that it's a collision of two worlds where physics-defying Magic is possible and at least one world where death is already a solved problem. 

      Thematically, I plan to explore what I felt were two of the larger themes of HPMOR: 1. rationality clashing with the fantastic and 2. The impact of such a clash on interpersonal relationships. 

      I expect the tone will match the early chapters of HPMOR when Harry was still experimenting with the rules of Magic.

  Very fun beginning; I'll be watching this!  Having not read *Orders of Magnitude*, I have no idea what world Hermione's found herself in, but I'm intrigued.  Meanwhile, I love Harry getting the shock of his life in finding Rarity to actually be sapient, and I hope this'll help him learn epistemic humility.

  Unfortunately, if we go by canon, [Professor Quirrell drank Twilight's blood a few weeks ago](http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/100).  I hope you're not going to just ignore that, but I'm curious to find out whether she didn't quite die, or whether Discord is going to *MESS WITH TIME*.

    Hermione's situation so far is unique to this story. The added bit about Tirr inna Noc was an in-universe excerpt from "Significant Digits" by /u/mrphaethon , but as mentioned in the text, the characters of the HPMOR-verse are not unanimously convinced of the veracity of the tome. 

    And yes, Twilight has definitely been attacked and mortally wounded by Quirrel. The rest of the girls are on a rescue mission (much like Harry, in a way).
