  Haven't read the latest chapter yet but I feel a need to acknowledge that *holy crap I'd given this story up for dead and now it's back, this is awesome*.

  Anyway, here's hoping for a swift and resounding comeuppance for Blue the traitor and thief.

  Edit: Have now read it, good solid entry right there. A shame his squirtle is kind of an ass, but I guess that's more characterful than having every 'mon be perfectly sweet and compliant.

    Was very momentarily confused until I realized that this is a different fic from The Origin of Species. Just automatically assumed while not reading the complete title.

  Well, it looks like the holy trinity of badass rational pokemon fanfiction is finally complete- after Game of Champions and The Origin of Species, here's The Line. Cannot wait for more.

    Does anyone know if the game of champions is still alive?
    ```

    - u/Golden_Magician:
      ```
      I believe it's dormant, updates seem to be coming on a yearly basis at best. I still have hope though!

        I feel like the author could get a Patreon account and write this part/full time. Obviously up to him/her if they want to do that
        ```

          ```
          Well, the author's update rate has drastically dropped since he joined the Air Force. There might or might not be some correlation there!
          ```

    - u/addicted_to_reddit_:
      ```
      I believe it still is. The author posted a little excerpt of the latest chapter for beta reading on misc authors forum on darklordpotter back in december, but nothing since. So, its still alive just being updated very very slowly.
      ```

  Loving the rivalry between Blue and Red. It's one of the things that Game of Champions did fantastically well, and it looks like this story will too. Looking forward to the next chapter!
