## [WIP] Unto the Breach

### Post:

I'm taking my first stab at Rational fiction with [Unto the Breach](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30400/unto-the-breach). 

It's the story of a bunch of high school kids who are summoned to fight the demon army... and fail. Humanity is conquered, enslaved or used as livestock. Decades later, one of the failed heroes gets a chance to go back to the body of her 16-year-old self with all her acquired skills and knowledge. 

Sophia's motivation is simple: Save the human race, no matter what it takes to do so. 

The first part of the story focuses on establishing her base--

\-- She knows there are traitors and spies among the human nobility and will work to discover who they are and eliminate them without drawing attention to herself. 

\-- She knows the strengths and capabilities of the other students and will focus on empowering them and keeping them alive long enough to reach their potential. 

\-- She's working to ingratiate herself with members of the nobility and manipulate the politics of the land such that the right people gain or retain power. 

My goal for the character is to take the trope of the 'scheming, manipulative, and amoral vizier' and give them selfless, humanistic desires instead of selfish and materialistic ones. 

This is progression fantasy. There are strong elements of cultivation but the MC is a wizard, so there will also be a focus on spellcasting. 

The feedback I'm most interested in is this: 

Do you believe that the MC's thoughts and actions are rational given her desires, situation, and level of information?  

Do you feel she's acting as an intelligent adult would? 

What information do you feel is lacking and would like to see explored? 

I'm only eight chapters in but hope to make this a long-running series.

  I've enjoyed what I read so far but I was never fully "hooked". I kept waiting for the moment that would make me feel that the clock had started counting down or that the plots had really kicked into gear. I simply wasn't hit with the degree of urgency or danger I expected (excepting the scene with the playboy prince).

  MC's decisions make sense to me, although I don't feel as though I've actually seen her progress. Excluding Chapter 1, I've don't think I've seen her develop and been convinced that she's qualitatively improved. I suspect it's because I feel like I've just been told certain skills have been used (sage and twin minds) rather than seen their impact. Alternatively It could be that I don't really understand the nature of cultivation in this world.

  So far I don't really feel connected to any of the side characters. I didn't come away with the impression that much of the dialogue and interaction with them has been at all very meaningful, (exceptions again the playboy prince, the abused girl and the powerful witch).

  Another thing that threw me was the lack of realisation from the rest of the party that the other world is real. I'm assuming at this point that we, the audience, are to understand that they, the party, are aware that the world is "real". However, I don't remember seeing or hearing about this realisation and it's consequences directly or indirectly.

  In summary the opening couple chapters were well done and I'm curious to see if/when the later ones will cash in on the promise of a real "fight for our lives" against a superior foe.

  This is good. Some feedback:

  1: I'm not sold on what is driving her to save the world yet. She mentions that in her last life that she gave up. Why does she care now? What's different? It's a beautiful world, but I need more than that. It's clear that she could probably ally with the demons and retain a comfortable life, so you need to demonstrate to me why the suffering and sacrifice needed to actually win is worthwhile.

  2: No one seems all that upset or surprised about being yanked to another world and then encouraged to swallow a live eel. I don't think this is plot critical or anything, and maybe this drama is happening off screen, or the calm acceptance is a 'god/wizard did it' type situation. But everyone seems weirdly accepting of having their lives totally and instantly transformed without their consent.

  3: You're got a slow start. It's not bad, but my preference is to open stories with urgency. The introduction of Dartanian was good because it gives us a concrete enemy. He's a rapist and a monster pretending to be a hero, and now he's here, touching our protagonist, invading her space, threatening her. And there's the lingering question of why he betrayed humanity. Or perhaps he hasn't even been turned yet? Either way, flashbacks involving him or other ways of increasing his presence in the story would add to the urgency and help sell the threat the demons represent.

  Eh. It's not really a problem you could fix, but the pre-isekai part is kind of lacking to me in terms of "how would a sane adult prepare for this given that knowledge, skill, and time". If I understand the setting correctly, being able to tap into the "mana" of Earth isn't some innate gift from being a time looper, but something anyone could do if they knew how. At some point, she is deeply concerned about a potential demonic invasion on Earth. Lastly, it seems that there is some noticeable kinesthetic feedback from learning to tap into mana.

  To me, it seems more logical that if you have a tangible and reproducible method of magic meditation that improves your physical and mental faculties, a big portion of that year would be best spent trying to spread that knowledge around. Make a vlog about your fitness progress while touting your unnatural improvement to a specific method of meditation. Especially try to spread that knowledge to your classmates, at least the athletes who would likely give your testimony weight since you've become a star athlete at an unprecedented rate.

  Not only would it empower the Heroes more than anything else she could have possibly done on Earth as well as leave Earth in a much better spot in case said invasion did happen, it would give her an immense amount of credibility and authority to her classmates once the isekai happened. Playing off having a prophetic dream (divine inspiration!) could also give immediate social power within the nobility if she could spin it well.

  So given that that's the first thing I thought of after reading the premise, it'd be nice to see some reasoning why she decided to only empower herself personally and limited herself otherwise to just making friends with her fellow isekai-ers.

  Good start, I'll keep an eye on it. 

  I know we are missing context to why she valued certain people over others "striker on my schoolâ€™s football team, joined the chess club, and even snagged a minor part in the school play. Along with that had come juggling my new social links." [Ch.2] Learning who/why she reached out to different group would be valuable, also, how many?

  I know that with the amount of information given I definitely would have dodged the re-up, sounds like a horror show.
