## Thoughts on a community irc?

### Post:

So I've often been in a position when I had a small idea or question I felt like posing to the community that didn't seem like it warranted a thread. Or I just wanted to discuss something, or maybe just talk with like-minded people. 

Basically I'm just wondering

A. Do people here want such a thing? 

B. Would the mods be willing to put it in the sidebar?

  The sub is usually quiet enough, just make a thread about it. More inclusive, chafeel

  Sounds nice and i would probably join such a channel if opened, but from my experience having an IRC channel can cause some alienation.

  Essentially what tends to happen is that you get a certain subgroup in IRC which develops its own quirks and inside jokes etc. and as a result becomes much harder for new people to join into it.

  One aspect that tends to make this worse is the fact that over IRC people develop much stronger interpersonal relations vs forums.
  But while that sounds good, and it is good in the sense that its always nice finding more like minded friends and getting to know them better, it makes the barrier to entry much higher.


  Some of the issues can be solved by having public logs or somesuch which makes it easier for people to get to know the IRC community, but some of those "issues" don't really have a solution, at least not one that I am aware of..

  Sure. It could be a place for asking minor questions that you're wondering about but don't think should be put in their own thread, too.

  I'd say it's worth a shot.

  I'd idle in it for sure
