## The Days of Thyme

### Post:

A little while ago over on Questionable Questing, Questingdragon, the author of [The Sins of Cinnamon](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-sins-of-cinnamon.7774/) started a quest in that same universe to expand upon the lore of the world theyâ€™re in. After about 45k words it entered a hiatus that has just ended today. Check it out [here](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-days-of-thyme.9683/)

  It lives! Thanks for the heads up. Both of these are *great*. 

  Days of Thyme is an active quest, city building/managment, with voting and dice rolls to determine outcomes. They play in the same game-overlay fantasy world and have great prose.

  The site keeps forcing me to create an account. Is there a way to read this anonymously?

    Nope, QQ restricts the NSFW half of things to people who've signed up, in order to avoid drama mongering from its sister sites.

  Is it a sequel? Do you need to read *The Sins of Cinnamon*? I started reading that a while back but stopped because it read like the Erogamer and I was reluctant to inflict that kind of angst on myself.

    Its not a sequel. *Sins* is paused, *Thyme* will for now be used for worldbuilding and later *Sins* is supposed to finish.  Its not clear wether these two are concurrent in-world or not. 

    *Sins* starts out with a bit of progressive sex stuff but later these parts take a really small role over the whole awesome dungeon fighting.

    What part of The Erogamer was too angsty for you? (After reading Stephen R. Donaldson books, normal levels of angst barely register any more...)
    ```

    - u/nytelios:
      ```
      Just to be clear, I meant angst in its actual definition, not as a colloquial synonym for edgy teen stuff or doom n gloom. But specifically, it's the philosophy of sex masqueraded as litRPG. It's just weird and anxiety-inducing for me. I still read it but it's something I have to be in the mood for.
      ```

      - u/CronoDAS:
        ```
        Oh, I thought you meant in-story angst, like Cindy's internalized shame at being fat and the characters worrying about what's happening to the world and reality as a result of the Erogame's influence.
        ```
