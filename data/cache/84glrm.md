    To be fair, the padding would help. It would make it weaker, but he just needs to pull against air resistance instead of his own weight. And using padding with more friction would help further.
    ```

    - u/LeifCarrotson:
      ```
      *Far* weaker. 

      I work with industrial magnets in my day job, and for something like this, or like the Mythbusters example, you have both magnetic poles in direct contact with the steel so that the fields don't have to go through any air.

      A layer of powder coating 6 mils thick reduced the strength of a 200 kg magnet to 80 kg. We tested the theory with a few layers of paper. 

      There's an exponential decrease in strength as you increase the distance. Thick padding, even with huge magnets, would not work well.  Especially if his Anyblade ring contained steel; it's closer to the magnet than the train roof and would take his finger off.

      What he wanted would be electromagnets and a battery pack.  Place them silently, engage the magnet, move up, wait for the field to collapse, and lift silently.  That would have been a good test of Amaryliss' engineering abilities, actually.

      Also, with all his points in physical stats, he's really fucking strong. He could put the magnet down lightly.

      Oh, and thicker metal wouldn't shake nearly as much.

  > “Quest?” she asked, when she’d finished. She was keeping her voice low; the tuung had been talking among themselves at the next table, but they’d apparently been eavesdropping, at least enough that they’d heard us talking to the man whose familiar I’d inspected.

  > “No quest,” I said.

  > “Huh,” said Fenn.

  ...

  > Dead drop, second table on the right. Not a quest.

  > (There was no message saying that he’d been defeated, which gave me hope that I had somehow avoided killing him.)

  You know, it's possible that the GM disabled quests, or at least quest notifications.  When's the last time Joon got a quest update?

    Yea I've been thinking that is the case. Probably something Joon said too.

      Oh, hey, more evidence for this:

      That seems to be the only quest notification after the chat, though.

    Well, can't say Juniper didn't deserve it. If person is a victim of oppression it doesn't miraculously make them good or honorable. By volunteering  to help Juniper put himself and possibly his party into vulnerable position and  it's natural for desperate person like tuung handmaid to exploit situation to it's fullest. Juniper had absolutely no ground to expect fair play form partner who can't afford fairness. I would be surprised if a new passenger is the only complication Juniper should have been fully prepared for situation of rescuing hostile hostage complicated by traps and ambushes, if he was so insistent on rescue.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      > can't say Juniper didn't deserve it

      Um...I think I can? What trouble did he ever cause for her?
      ```

      - u/Mr_Evildoom:
        ```
        I think they don't mean that Juniper deserves it in a karmic sense, but that he didn't act or think to prevent the situation.
        ```

      - u/serge_cell:
        ```
        It's not what Juniper did, it's assumption he did. He assumed that handmaid should feel gratitude or they have some kind of contract which oblige handmaid to behave in most convenient way for him, or that most convenient way for him is the one most beneficial for handmaid. That is not how handmaid may see the situation. She is desperate, don't value her life much,  and don't feel any obligations toward Juniper. He is just a an element of lucky circumstances which should be exploited to maximum. So she don't care about acceptable risks for Juniper or whatever. Juniper deserve it because he didn't paid much attention to handmaid motivations. If he had more empathy he may have got it and being more careful in his approach.

            well CRJ likes to subvert tropes like this. And I've a paranoid feeling that the comment section on here is influence CRJ's directions with the story. It really feels like there is a DM listening to us and tweaking the story slightly in various directions.
            ```

  - u/DCarrier:
    ```
    It's possible that she didn't. Perhaps she convinced the guard to join in the time since the drop-off.

  I thought this was a decent chapter, although I admit I was initially disappointed we only got a single chapter. I like having 2-3 to read... I think I got spoiled, haha.

  * Grak and touching butts... isn't that kind of the case? As I recall, the cloaca is an all-purpose organ for sexual activity, excrement, and laying eggs (at least in birds). So "touching butts" seems actually somewhat accurate.

  * This was an interesting way to perform the heist, but not where I had hoped the story would go. I was soooo ready for a murder mystery interlude, especially since I recently finished relistening to *The Adventure Zone's* "Murder on the Rockport Limited. 

  * If Joon hadn't been shifting his Level priority lower with essentialism, I wonder if he would have been having so many moral issues about killing those guards. On the one hand it fits his character and his past... but on the other, hey, cheap exp and plenty of rationalizations for it (like some of those mentioned in the D&D flashback).

  * Not sure what the guard's deal will be. My guesses are, in order of what I think is likely, would be... handmaid's lover; handmaid's pheromone-slave; princess in disguise.

      Fixed, thanks. I don't know why I make things hard on myself by giving things names that aren't sensible English (and are therefore harder for me to remember consistently).
      ```

  - u/russxbox:
    ```
    So is it Kuum Doona or Kuun Dooma? Multiple instances of both in this and previous chapters, from what I remember.
    ```

- u/Makin-:
  ```
  Man, the dialogue early on feels stilted, and the fight was so asymmetrical it wasn't really engaging, with the DND segment appearing to try to serve as justification. It doesn't work though, because it turned out really easy to both win and let them live, and the dilemma doesn't really apply. 

  I hate to say it, but I only liked the touching butts part of this chapter. Maybe it felt like a rehash of previous "kill or no kill" chapters as a whole?
  ```

  - u/Ace_Kuper:
    ```
    We did have the almost identical moment of realization, when Juniper almost killed a young boy in the elevator during Aumann tower invasion.

    This chapter was good for me, but this and the "don't kill murderous bandits that ambushed us" felt like a hard response to criticism of Juniper and the party being murderhobos.
    ```

- u/mp3max:
  ```
  I wonder how many other readers don't enjoy the DnD segments of the story. They feel jarring and apart from a few here and there, i just can't bring myself to read them. 

  The one from this chapter just brought up an issue that feels like it was dealt with long ago and disrupted the flow of the chapter for me.

      > I think the backstory adds to June's character building in ways other parts of the story can't

      The problem for me is. All those things happened in the past, so it actually doesn't build anything. It only displays something that was similar to current situation and often the information presented and Junipers moral struggle or thought process is already obvious from the story itself.

      Like, this past chapters and guard fight in particular is clearly the author addressing complaints people had about "murderhobo ways of Juniper and the Party" or "not having interactions with non party members". That's fine on it's own, but with added D&D segment it felt like that point was hammered to intensely.

      For example. Did the number of Tuung guard and guards in D&D story really needed to match, so Juniper would recall that particular time? We already had Aumann’s guards and Juniper almost killing a kid at that point, he already had that moral struggle and as far as i remember he didn't recall the D&D story when. That struggle to kill frankly was forgotten for a good chunk of chapters and now resurfaced again with the same premise. It's not a bad thing, just shifts are to sudden at points. He goes from killing everything that stand in the way to the goal, to not killing when it would actually put him at huge disadvantage or in danger, morality seems to jump to extremes.
      ```

      - u/icesharkk:
        ```
        It's nostalgic for me to see the DnD segments and I think they serve a useful purpose to illuminate otherwise untranslatable tabletop weirdness from the story. Should make the concept more approachable for non tabletoppers
        ```

  - u/arunciblespoon:
    ```
    "apart from a few here and there, i just can't bring myself to read them"

    Do you mean this as exaggeration or some sort of figure of speech, or are you actually criticising parts of the story that you're mostly not reading?
    ```

    - u/mp3max:
      ```
      Figure of speech. Sometimes i skip them just to read the rest of a chapter but usually go back and read them.
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I personally enjoy them quite a bit. It's fun looking into the past and seeing how Juniper was when he was a lowly mortal DM.
    ```

  - u/SkeevePlowse:
    ```
    I can see why you wouldn't like them, but personally, I wouldn't be even half as invested in this story as I am if we didn't have these snippets of Joon's real life to show us what he had compared to what he has now.
    ```

  - u/acinonys:
    ```
    The DnD segments are my favourite parts. While reading this chapter I noticed a moment of happiness when I realised that there's a jump back to the Dnd group.
    ```

  - u/Marthinwurer:
    ```
    I kinda just skim them. They're probably my least favorite part of the story right now, but I do think they were important towards the beginning so that we could get the backstory down. I just don't really care about them anymore.
    ```

  - u/Ace_Kuper:
    ```
    I think they are fine, but their placement sometimes is not ideal. Or they state really obvious things and feel like addressing the readers directly. Them being at the end or start of the chapter would be fine or during some breaking period, but they do break the flow especially if they are in the middle of action.

    It wasn't that bad in this chapter, but the worst one for me was Chapter 83.

    D&D segment was sandwiched between

    >“Well, I’ve got no idea,” I said. “I’m going to shut up and eat my food.”

    Joon thinking to himself.

    After the D7D segment it was:

    >“Mary thinks that we’re the most important people in the world,” said Fenn.

    Which led to a whole separate conversation. So i felt confused. Did time pass, did Fenn talk to Mary, did the scene even change, what brought up this unrelated and sudden conversation? The last segment was them deciding to eat quietly, but after D&D insert the conversation jumped into a whole different topic.

    [Dream Drive](https://www.literotica.com/s/dream-drive-ch-01). I think [Arcane Emperor](https://royalroadl.com/fiction/8463/the-arcane-emperor) is very addictive and has some interesting munchkining, but it's not very well written and it's definitely not rational.

  - u/I_Probably_Think:

    I think someone asked a similar question somewhere and was pointed to /r/litrpg -- I skimmed the recent posts there a few days ago and I think that may be the fledgling genre you're looking for?

  ```
  So besides this being an actually interesting and good chapter.

  Last time somebody said this to my points about Anyblade transformations.

  >No. There is a DM around and he manages what the backpack gives. Seems obvious that he would say no to getting whatever with the sword too. Would be stupid anyblade anyway if you could just make a hammer with a blade somewhere. Or a nuclear bomb with a blade stuck in it.

  My response was that "Hammer with blade is pretty tame and doable."

  Well, now we have this, so frankly it seems even more doable.

  >I had the Anyblade as a ring
  ```

  - u/ketura:
    ```
    It's been a ring for like 90% of the time he's had it.
    ```

    - u/Ace_Kuper:
      ```
      Well, i forgot that detail at the time and person that was arguing against the possibility of Anyblades drastic appearance change, didn't bring it up. I brought up it being a toothpick and change material from copper, to iron to something else as my point..
      ```
