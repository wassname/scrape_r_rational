  Yes it's fanfiction of *My Little Pony*. No it doesn't require any knowledge of the show; in fact it could have been written as original fiction with only a few minor details changed.

  Either way, it's a short story about Adagio facing Death and coming up with a clever solution using his rules to bring her friends back to life while worrying about whether or not to trust her friends and I recommend reading it.

    You really don't have to justify that.  We've had them before.  They're awesome.
