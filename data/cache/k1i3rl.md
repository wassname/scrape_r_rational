## [RT] [FF] Elasmosaur: A post-apocalyptic Outlander/Brigadoon crossover fanfiction

### Post:

“We’ll reach the coordinates you gave me by nightfall,” Moira said in her thick Glaswegian brogue. Her ever-moving eyes roved over the granite, heather and larch of the highlands, “You said you’d tell me what we were going tae find when we got close.”

Professor Brian Wicklow hesitated. “You’ll think I’m quite insane. That’s fine.”

Moira nodded in agreement. “Madmen use the same money as sane men. Makes nae difference tae me.”

“Very well. What do you know about Pox?”

His native guide's eyes stopped their ceaseless mvoement for just a moment, to level a disdainful look at him. “I've heard of it, once or twice”

“Fair enough, but do you know where it *came* from?”

“Central Asia. Loony religious zealots stole it from the Chinese government after it collapsed and decided tae settle a border dispute with some light genocide that got a bit out of hand.”

“And where did the Chinese get it?”

“They didna' get if from anywhere, they *made* it in a lab.”

“From a disease that already existed—smallpox.”

“Sure.”

“Only, smallpox *didn’t* exist for quite some time—not in a location the Chinese could access, anyway. Like our modern Pox, it was not zoonotic, and had been eradicated from the human population. There was some held under lock and key in the United States, that part now called The Confederacy, and there was some in Russia, but none in China, and *certainly* none in Scotland.”

There was a heavy pause. “What does Scotland have tae do wi’ anything?”

“The 2047 smallpox outbreak. A historical footnote far overshadowed by its aftermath, these days, but quite odd in its time. A disease long-dead that emerged as if from thin air—not from some isolated community in darkest Siberia or island in the Indian Ocean, but in rural Scotland nearly a century after it was eradicated off the face of the earth.”

Moira turned on him. “Rural Scotland. Are you telling me we’re heading toward some super-disease?”

Brian shook his head. “It may have been ‘super’ enough in its time, but it’s a kitten by today’s standards. Some people *survived* smallpox, and weren’t even shambling disease vectors thereafter—unlike the Pox we have these days.”

Moira scratched absently at her shaved head, shifting her gas-gun from one shoulder to the other. “Can’t say I get it. A disease that’s *slightly less apocalyptic* in scope seems like a piss-poor prize tae be chasin’ after.”

Brian considered this. “What is the biggest threat any city faces in the modern world?” he asked

“Shamblers,” Moira said.

“Essentially, yes. More specifically, the Pox they carry. Each aftershock of epidemic brings humanity closer to extinction or barbarism. What if there were a place utterly secure against shamblers?”

Moira rolled her eyes. “Let me guess, a cult bunker? *Most* of the shamblers that have cropped up in the past decade are the remnants o’ ‘pox-proof’ sepratist utopias.”

“This place is different, I assure you. It has the best possible defense against any threat, including the pox.”

“An’ what’s that?”

“It doesn’t exist.”

Moira pondered this for a while. “It’s a bonny riddle, professor,” Moira said, “But ah’ve no interest in goin’ tae Thebes or boinkin’ me dear ol’ mum, so make like a sphinx an’ eat me.”

Brian opened, then closed his mouth. A Sophocles reference? From this savage? He woudn’t bet money that she was literate, clad in a great kilt and cream-colored linen tunic, a dirk at her narrow hip and a woad triskelion tattooed on the back of her shaved skull. “Very well. I will come to the point. I have, for some years, been most interested in the journals of a twentieth century businessman who, along with a friend, went on two trips to the Scottish Highlands. His friend did not return from the second. The body was never recovered, and a suspicion of murder hung over him for the rest of his life. In his journals, though, he wrote of a town which seems detached from the flow of time. It appears for one day every hundred years, then vanishes once more.”

Moira snorted. “Oh aye, an entirely plausible account from an unimpeachable source.”

“I initially had a similar thought. As, indeed, has everyone else to whom I’ve relayed this story.”

“But you believe it?” Moira’s voice was flat.

“I believe it’s worth a look.”

“And why the fuck is that?”

Brian chewed his lip contemplatively for a moment. “1947—A man reports encountering a Georgian-era Scottish town that appears only once every hundred years. 2047—an extinct disease appears as if by magic in Scotland.”

Moira snorted. “An’ now it’s 2147.”

“Now it’s 2147,” Brian confirmed with a smile.

The somewhat jeering good-humor Moira had barely been able to conceal the night before was notably diminished when Brian woke her before dawn the next morning.

\---------

"Moira! Wake up!"

She was instantly on alert, a hand on her dirk. "What?"

"It's the fog, Moira!"

Several seconds of silence followed, before, "I'm sorry, what?"

"Fog! It came on practically in an instant! I think this is it!"

Several more seconds, then Mora said, in a voice labored with patience, "You're tellin’ me that you woke me up during your watch tae report that fog appeared suddenly before dawn in the highlands. Ach, wheel, I'll just fight it off, shall I?"

"No, it's not a *problem*, it's what we've been waiting for! The fog is a harbinger of Brigadoon’s materializing!"

"The fog is a harbinger that the relative humidity has reached the saturation point of the air due tae declining nighttime temperatures, yeh mad Yankee bastard. Wake me when Marty of Clan MacFly rides up on a donkey cart wi' a flux capacitor." With that, she rolled over and went back to sleep.

Not an hour later, she got tired of Brian's louder-than-strictly-necessary breakfast preparations and got up, annoyed. "Will ye quit that racket? The sky's barely gray, man. You're like my daughter on Yule morning."

Brian hesitated. "You have a daughter?"

Moira began packing her bedroll. "Aye. An’ a son, but he's too small tae get excited yet."

Brian stared at her.

"What?" she asked.

"Sorry, you're just...very young and, um. Don't seem like the family type."

"Wheel, aren't we judgy? A woman cannae ha'e her own career while her husband an’ his boyfriend look after the bairns?" She checked the pressure gauge on her gas gun before lifting the lid on the steaming pot of field rations Brian had been cooking.

"Just surprised, not critical," he said, "Wait, are you serious about—? Sorry, nevermind."

She grinned up at him. "You Americans sure have gotten prudish since the fall. No, my husband doesna have a boyfriend. But we do have two bairns."

She was the least maternal person he may ever have met, and besides, a girl her age back home on Long Island would scarcely be done with her second year of University, and would be the target of no little gossip for being too familiar with men at all, much less starting a family. It was another of her paradoxes—a woman so aggressively buried in the past, yet so non-traditional.

They ate their fortified porridge and packed up the little Stirling stove, then made their way into the valley.'

The roads were the first indication that something was different, here. The few plasphalt roads that had been built through this region prior to the Pox had been ravaged by frostheave and errosion—it wasn't uncommon to see young trees rooted in the cracks. When they'd turned off those, the even more ancient tarmac roads had been reduced to little more than gravel beds. Now they were on a dirt road—a rutted track which, rustic as it was, looked more heavily and recently trafficked than anything they'd seen since departing Glasgow's sphere of influence. Moira said nothing, but Brian could tell the oddity wasn't lost on her. Brian only really let himself start grinning in earnest when they met the man on the road, however.

He was short—shorter even than Moira, dressed like an actor in a period piece, and hailed them with a completely incomprehensible string of syllables before catching himself and switching to English. "Ach, wheer are my manners," he said, with an accent that made Moira's exaggerated and somewhat transient one seem pale and paltry, "Welcome tae Briga Na Dun!" Brian and Moira might have had wildly differing backgrounds, but the history professor and the neo-primitivist were both, in their own ways, fanatical about the same things. Moira dressed like a Mel Gibson fan who couldn’t choose between William Wallace or Mad Max, but she *knew* the history of Scotland like the back of her hand. This man’s outfit was as authentic as could be; it was an honest-to-god Georgian-era highlander’s outfit.

Moira stuttered out a few words Brian couldn’t understand, and the man’s face lit up. “Tha mayest dress queerly, lad, but I’m glad the English still havenae managed to stamp out the Gaelic and those who speak it—however poorly.”

Moira’s face fell, but the man pressed on. “If tha’ shouldst follow along this road, tha’ may’st reach the town. Folks there will answer any questions ye may have—I must be getting on.”

They thanked him, and he continued up the road the way he’d been coming.

“Alright,” Moira admitted, “This...disappearin’ city seems distressingly plausible at this point. So why are we here?”

“We? *You’re* here because I needed a guide. *I’m* here because I want to be an elasmosaur.”

They walked in silence for a few moments, before he caught Moira’s air of skepticism. “*Metaphorically*, I mean.” he waved a hand impatiently. “Like the elasmosaurs of Loch Ness…countless studies for decade upon decade with no trace. Everyone was convinced they were a hoax, until boom—2034, a whole pod of the damn things turn up. Marine biologists captured four alive and that fisherman killed one, but the others were never seen again. Now, the idea that the only remaining population of dinosaurs—or their aquatic cousins, or whatever—survived in a lake dwarfed by many North American reservoirs for 65 million years…that’s a bit farfetched. But if they only turned up for a single day every century? That’s less than 3000 years since the comet wiped out the rest of their kind. An extinction event is far less worrisome if you can just fast-forward through it.”

Moira was silent again, but this time in contemplation rather than derision. Finally, she quietly said, “You’re lookin’ tae fast-forward through humanity dyin’ oot.”

“That is my sincerest desire, yes.”

“An’ what if we make it through? If humanity doesna’ go extinct?”

“Even better,” Brian said, “But it could take a very long time for this plague to pass. While your type take up dirk and targe, seeking refuge from the present in the distant past…I look the future.”

They passed several other travelers on the road, only some of whom spoke English. Everyone stared, but most seemed far too preoccupied with their own business to stop or talk for any length of time. Brian did decide to stop beating around the bush with one anglophone and asked directly, “Am I correct in thinking this is the same Brigadoon that appears only once every hundred years?”

The man seemed entirely taken aback. “Briga Na Dun it is…but I’m nae the one tae tell tha aboot such things. Ask frae Mister Lundy in town. He’s the one tae ask.”

Brian broke into a broad smile at this—“Ah, yes. Mr. Lundy. I’ll do that, thank you.”

They did eventually reach the town, a walled village with only a few roofs that were slate rather than thatch and a low stone wall surrounding it.

“What…what makes it work?” Moira asked as they passed a vegetable vendor setting up shop.

“Have a look at these carrots!” Brian said excitedly. “No cultural diffusion from the orange Dutch breeds…”

“Sure. Bonny shade o’ purple, Professor, but how the hell does a town travel through time? Or a Loch, if you’re right about the Nessies.”

The stall’s owner was unloading various root crops from a cart, watching Brian and Moira with the mild fascination people everywhere directed toward boisterous foreigners.

“What? Oh, damned if I know, I’m not a physicist. Read that old Hawking tome once—found it more impenetrable than Newton’s, and that was in the original Latin.”

“And it started in the 1700s—in 1747,” Moira mused, “This town wasna built in a day. It was a normal town until…what? 4 days ago, it just vanished? 4 days, 400 years…”

“Imagine what the world would be like in a few weeks,” Brian said excitedly. “Hyper-advanced societies, perhaps, but just as likely, a world that may as well never have felt the ravages of humanity. Carbon levels back in equilibrium, ecosystems stabilized…a fresh start for mankind.”

“Uh-huh.” Moira stared around at the villagers. “An’ repopulating this brave new world will be…you an’ a bunch of pre-Enlightenment-era sheep herders?”

Brian wagged a finger at her. “*Now* who’s being judgy about other people’s lifestyles?”

Moira’s eyes snapped to the side, and as Brian followed her gaze he saw a man wearing a powdered wig and a severe black coat hurrying toward them.

“Welcome, welcome,” he said in English, “My name is Callum Lundy. May I ask your names, sirs?”

“Brian Wicklow,” Brian said, extending a hand to shake.

“Thou art an American, I think?” Lundy said, accepting it gladly.

Brian hesitated. “The United States of America no longer exists as a sovereign entity,” he said. “But I am from a city-state located within the former borders of that nation, yes. Long Island, formerly of the state of New York.”

“Ah! We had some visitors from that part of the world only two centuries ago!”

Brian nodded—as if this were a perfectly normal thing to say. “Mr. Douglas and Mr. Albright, yes? I found this place after reading Mr. Douglas’ journals. Is Mr. Albright here?”

Lundy’s bushy eyebrows drew together in consternation. “Nae—he left wi’ Mr. Douglas before sunset the day before yesterday.”

Brian’s face fell a little. “Mr. Douglas’ journal said that Thomas Albright was able to re-enter Brigadoon—Briga Na Dun, if I am to understand that that is its proper name—some weeks later. That he woke you from your bed and that the town rematerialized so that he was able to re-enter it, they having returned with that goal.”

Lundy’s face was grave. “Such a thing isna possible, I fear. Mr. Douglas…may no’ ha’ been telling the truth.”

Brian shrugged. “I always knew it was a possibility.”

“An’ thou, young man, wha’ may I call thee?”

Moira arched an eyebrow, but said, in a voice that seemed a few notes lower than her natural speaking tone, “Logan Fraser.”

Lundy seemed a bit nonplused by the terseness of ‘his’ answer, but didn’t pursue it further, turning instead back to Brian. “Thou sayest thy country is nae more? Right sorrowful am I tae hear it. A nation that hath thrown off the yoke of English oppression is a sad loss tae the world. If I may ask…what happened?

Brian shook his head. “I fear the world has suffered a great many losses since you went to bed last night.”

As Brian told Mr. Lundy all that had transpired since the outbreak of the Pox, Moira’s constantly roving eyes noticed a woman near her own age lingering nearby, watching the newcomers with a distressed look on her face. She observed with apprehension as Moira approached, but she stood her ground.

“Can I help you?” Moira asked in Gaelic, despite a twinge of self-consciousness at the reaction her previous attempt with a native speaker had produced.

The girl gulped, but stuttered out, “You speak our language?”

“I speak *my* language,” Moira said, “My sires have walked these lands since before Hadrian built his wall.”

“Your pardon…sir,” she said, and her inquisitive look as she said it made Moira think she was a little less quick to assume the clothes made the ‘man’ than the men they’d so far encountered.

“You seem mighty fearful of us,” Moira said.

“Oh, no! Not at all sir,” the young woman said, “It’s just…I don’t suppose you know a man named Tommy Albright?”

Moira hesitated a moment then said, “Albright…my companion spoke of him. He came here two days ago.”

“Yes.” The woman looked like she was about to cry.

“I’m afraid I haven’t met him myself,” Moira said carefully. “He…he tried to come back here, but I’m afraid he was unsuccessful.”

The woman broke down crying. “I knew it,” she said, “I knew he didn’t want to leave. I don’t care what Mr. Lundy says, Harry Beaton was right! This town isn’t blessed, it’s cursed!”

Moira was about to ask what she meant when an enraged scream from Mr. Lundy himself cut her off. “WITCHES!”

Moira wheeled around to find the man red-faced and breathing hard, pacing back and forth in front of a rather nonplused Brian Wicklow. “Mohommetan witches from the Orient, unleashing a plague upon the world. War, Pestilence, Famine, and Death! Death on a pale horse! I knew it was coming! The tribulation has begun! A thousand years shall we dwell here on the fallen earth ere the kingdom of God returns!”

“Um—” Brian seemed inclined to interject, but Lundy would not be dissuaded, a mad light in his eyes.

“I knew it. When the witch came here, God saw that even the righteous would not long be safe from the corruption of interlopers! He set us free from the fallen world! And the thousand years of darkness shall be as ten days to us! Praise be to God!”

He turned back to Brian suddenly. “This news thou bringest is grave, but in a way, welcome. I ha’ much tae do, friend, alerting the village patriarchs to the threat these abominations you spoke of pose to us. Wilt thou excuse me?”

“Um. Of course,” Brian stammered out, still seeming off-balance.

Without another word, Lundy turned on his heel and stalked off, the other villagers giving him a wide berth.

Brian walked over toward Moira, his face troubled. “Well,” he said, “Rather an excitable gentleman. Oh, hello—my apologies, young lady, I don’t believe we’ve met. Miss…?”

“Campbell,” the young woman said, though her voice was still tight with distress.

“D’ye still mean tae stay here, professor?” Moira asked.

“Oh absolutely,” Brian said, “Charming place, if a bit…rustic in their outlook.”

“Well then I do believe our contract is fulfilled. I’m off.”

“So soon? I’d think someone with your interests would want to explore a bit. Quite a fascinating timecapsule we find ourselves in—less than a year after Culloden, and it wouldn’t surprise me if there are men here who fought in the battle. Rather a Jacobite stronghold, if Mr. Lundy is anything to go by. Honestly, I’d consider staying, if I were you. This may be the only safe place in the world.”

“I wouldna abandon my hus—” she caught herself and looked sharply at Miss Campbell, “My *spouse* and our bairns tae a world I wouldna face mysel’.” She said coldly. “An’ on top o’ that, I dinna really feel dressed for the company. I’m guessing their outlook is no less ‘rustic’ when it comes tae…tae people with two X chromosomes actin’ like I do.”

Brian sighed. “Very well. You’ve fulfilled your contract admirably, and I wish you and your family all the best.” He extended a hand.

“Good luck wi’ your wee holiday here,” Moira said, and shook it.

“May I accompany you to the edge of town?” he asked, and Moira nodded.

“May I as well?” Miss Campbell asked suddenly.

Moira raised an eyebrow but nodded assent, and they started heading back the way she’d come in.

“I want to leave,” Miss Campbell said quietly in Gaelic, and Moira glanced sharply at her.

“Today might not be a good day,” she responded in the same language, after some consideration, “The world is in a bad way, Miss Campbell.”

“Call me Fiona,” Fiona said, “And I don’t care. It can’t be worse than here. Mr. Lundy is going to do something awful, I just know it. He’s accused half the women in the town of witchcraft at one point or another, and since the old priest died and we broke loose from time, there’s been no one to keep him in check. I think he’s going to hurt someone soon…maybe today, with the state he was in when he left your friend.”

Moira sighed. “Do you think people will be upset if you leave?”

“I fear so. But after Tommy left it’s been all that I could think of. I packed a bag…please. If we just stop by my house, I’ll tell my father I have herbs to take to a family friend outside of town. They’ll never know I’ve left until it’s too late. I think you understand how powerless a woman can feel in these situations.”

Moira gritted her teeth at the implication of those words, but nodded. “We’re takin’ a wee detour for Fiona here tae pick up some things for an errand she’s running,” she said in English, and Brian nodded in happy unconcern, his eyes following a man carrying a rather ratty sheep up the lane.

Fiona led them to her home, disappearing inside for her things. As soon as she had, Moira turned to Brian. “Yon lass is leavin’ wi’ me,” she said, “She doesna want tae stay here and I dinna blame her. It’s none o’ your business, except it may make things a wee bit uncomfortable if people think you were involved, so I figured I’d tell you.”

Brian’s face contorted with dismay. “Well I *wouldn’t* have been involved if you hadn’t said anything! God, I’m a terrible liar, Moira, I wish you’d kept it to yourself.”

Moira shrugged, genuinely apologetic. “Sorry. I didna think of that…” she trailed off, head cocked to one side. “D’ye…d’ye hear that?”

Brian went quiet and listened, as well. “Singing?”

“The Skye Boat Song,” Moira said.

From a nearby house they could hear the faint words,

*“Billow and breeze, islands and seas,*

*Mountains of rain and sun,*

*All that was good, all that was fair,*

*All that was me is gone.”*

“Well, as I said, this place does lean that way politically,” Brian said.

Moira shook her head. “It’s no’ a contemporary song—you said yourself, we’re less than a year oot from Culloden’s Field. The Skye Boat Song was written well after that.”

Brian hesitated. “How long after?”

Moira shrugged. “I’ve no’ a clue. But those particular lyrics aren’t even original. They were written by Robert Luis Stevenson.”

Brian bit his lip. “Gah, when the hell was he alive? He wrote Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hide, so 1800s at the earliest.”

Moira nodded. “We’re no’ the only outlanders here. There’s a stowaway. Probably the woman who’s singing.”

Fiona emerged from her own house, dressed in a more rugged travelling dress and with a wicker basket on her back. “I’m ready.”

Moira strained her ears to pinpoint the song’s origin, but the singer had trailed off. “Fiona,” she asked, “Did anyone come here the day before Mr. Albright?”

She nodded. “An Englishman and his wife. That’s how we knew for sure we’d broken away from time.”

“Did they stay here? Either of them? The woman?”

Fiona hesitated, but shook her head. “No. They are no longer…with us.”

“And did anyone else come the day before yesterday? The same day as Mr. Albright and his friend?”

Fiona shook her head again. “Not that I know of.”

Moira thought about this for a few seconds, then shrugged. “Whatever. Let’s go.”

The three of them headed once more toward the edge of town, but when they reached the low stone wall, a group of men were loitering by the gate, and they didn’t look too happy to see Fiona or her companions.

“Another *sassenach,* eh, Fiona?” one of them said. He stepped forward and his friends edged sideways, blocking the gate.

The man who’d spoken gazed levelly at Brian, then Moira. “Our little Fiona has a hard time staying on her feet when there’s someone from out of town passing through,” he said to his friends in Gaelic.

“Move,” Moira growled in the same tongue.

The man feigned surprise. “Well, this one even understands civilized language, lads,” he said,

“Fingal, please,” Fiona said, “This gentleman just offered to escort me to—”

“Shut up, slut,” Fingal hissed angrily.

Moira punched him straight in the nose. He staggered back, clutching his face, then drew a knife, glaring at her.

With a practiced motion, Moria unslung her gas gun from her shoulder with her left hand, aiming from the hip, and drew her dirk with her right. “We’re leaving. Move.”

Brian’s eyes went wide and he and Fiona both backed up several paces.

In contrast with the sharp, hissing snap of the gas gun that Brian had expected and feared, a deep boom sounded, and Moira lurched sideways, blood erupting from her leg. Another local man emerged from a small outbuilding off to one side, dropping a blackpowder pistol and drawing a long knife as he approached. Moira hauled herself to a sitting position, her face a mask of pain and rage, and leveled the gas gun at Fingal, but he had already closed the distance and kicked it out of her hands. Moira was swinging her dirk as he did so, though, and opened a nasty gash on his arm. As he staggered back, she climbed shakily to her feet and dodged a knife thrust from the man who’d shot her, slamming the pommel of her own blade into the left side of his face with a sickening crunch before giving him his own gushing leg wound in turn.

The remaining two men rushed her simultaneously, one of whom had a blade longer than Moira’s. She deflected his swing easily and despite her wounded leg caught him a savage kick under his kilt that put him off balance while she landed a blow on his head that dropped him to the ground, perhaps permanently. The second man managed to put a shallow gash across her arm with his small knife, but stumbled back as Moira turned from the possibly-corpse of his friend and leveled her gaze on him, looking like a goddess of war.

“Fiona?” A man’s voice came from up the road, ringing with concern.

The final combatant turned and ran, and Moira collapsed to one knee, then fell flat on her face as a man and a woman who was clearly kin to Fiona ran up, the man holding a basket-hilt claymore in one hand.

The three of them exchanged several words in Gaelic, Moira unable to focus on the words, drifting in and out of consciousness. The last thing she heard before a terrible dark coldness took her was “We have to take her to the witch.”
