## Groom of the Tyrannosaur Queen

### Post:

This is a bit of an experiment. It seemed like all the cool kids are doing serial novels, so I serialized this one on Mangatoon.

The Groom of the Tyrannosaur Queen is a time travel romance story about an ex-soldier from the future who stumbles across a lost colony of humans living in Late Cretaceous Montana. It's also got a self-aware Conan type, a haughty bronze-age princess, and a paleo-palinologist who lets a power-suit go to his head. The paleontology is good as of about four years ago. The story might be somewhat rational?

Here's [link](https://mangatoon.mobi/en/detail/30670/episodes). I'd love to hear your feedback. It's also un-serialized on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Groom-Tyrannosaur-Queen-time-travel-romance-ebook/dp/B018UD6DH2).

  The linked site requires you to install some kind of adware/payware/malware to your phone to read past chapter 6.  I don't have any objections to linking samples or non-free books, but I would appreciate if that was made clear in the link.  As it is, it left a bad taste.

  I enjoyed the opening episode enough that I have bought it on Kindle for ease of reading, so please take that as positive feedback.

  Also thanks for not just writing a “rational” subversion of some children’s fiction property.

    Wow thank you! I hope you enjoy it

    I guess the subversion of tropes in Tyrannosaur Queen is how I pretended that the Conan books were written in close 3rd person.

  This reminds me a bit of The Human Dress by Graydon Saunders.

    I haven't read The Human Dress, but I enjoyed the sample of The March North, so I'll take that as a compliment :)
