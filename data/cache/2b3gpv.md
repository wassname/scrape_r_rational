  Probably because I've been rereading The Two Year Emperor, I think that [spoiler](/s "there are other gods at play that Boccob is involved in some wager or competition with.").

    That's probably a fair bet _any_ time gods are involved.

    Also, I can't help but read your name with Sean Connery's accent.

      Of topic:

      I had some dental work done a few days ago, and half my mouth was numbed.

      My username was one of the many things I tested my newfound Sean Connery accent on.

        It works a _bit_ better with Brosnan's, since there aren't any S'.  But Connery was the Bond I started with, so he's the Bond I default to.

  ```
  Finally! Gotta love the allusion to [](#s "Planescape: Torment").

  I'm exited to see an update but I can't remember what was going on in the story. I guess that means it's time for a reread.

    Oh shit Bellatrix is gonna go after Milo's parents but they are gonna be saved by Milo's sacrifice from the end of the ~~first~~ second book.
    ```

      ```
      At the end of the second book, I think?
