  This story always makes me tear up a bit. Entropy is a bitch, but we will win eventually.

    (When that song starts playing in my head as the mental BGM to a particular story, I know it's a damn good story.)

  Ok, it's a *little* disturbing when the Cosmic Mind-People take the same shape as Anti-Spirals.

  And I do wonder how they had hyperspace, hyperspatial travel, and an eternal Cosmic AC and *couldn't* reverse entropy much, much earlier.  In fact, I find it hard to believe they figured out the nature of space and time and couldn't come to a conclusion about entropy.

  Ah, well: I'm living much later than when Asimov wrote, and at least the Stelliferous Era is projected to last 100 trillion years rather than a mere 1 trillion.

    Haha, no kidding. If you can find a place to permanently house an AI, you've solved yer problems. Still a great story.
    ```

- u/holomanga:
  ```
  Why not just simulate a universe inside Cosmic AC, since it doesn't need an external one to process data?
  ```

  - u/puesyomero:
    ```
    well they did go in at the end, but the AC still had unfinished business in realspace before abandoning it for good
    ```

  - u/MoralRelativity:
    ```
    Maybe that's exactly what Cosmic AC did. How would anyone know for sure?
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  This is beautiful. 

  Somehow the comic form is a perfect match for the themes of this story: the awe-inspiring vastness of the universe, the evolution of mankind into something radically different and yet still the same, the nearly religious feelings stirred up by thoughts of our inevitable death and extinction.

  ```
  What's with the huge vertical images?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    It's standard for Korean webcomics, which this is.
    ```

- u/mrmonkeybat:
  ```
  So did the interstellar settlers add a gene for a blue pigment to the Y chromosome for some reason? Or is that a blended family of multi pigmented mutants?
  ```

  - u/gabbalis:
    ```
    Yeah and it can't be just aesthetic, because obviously, given the choice we would all choose bioluminescent purple.
    ```
