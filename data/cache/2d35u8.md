## [NSFW][DC] A deconstructive short story about sex with a non-human intelligent race.

Lurker here, I thought this might amuse and/or inspire the kind of mentality which seems to be popular here.

There's plenty of "furry" interspecies porn out there, but how much of it actually tackles and overcomes the difficulties of such a relationship?

Even though Kvothe was talking about flaws in an object, instead of simple differences between two people, I think this quote really captures the spirit of the idea.

“It had flaws, but what does that matter when it comes to matters of the heart? We love what we love. Reason does not enter into it. In many ways, unwise love is the truest love. Anyone can love a thing *because*. That's as easy as putting a penny in your pocket. But to love something *despite*. To know the flaws and love them too. That is rare and pure and perfect.” ― Patrick Rothfuss, The Wise Man's Fear

  Hmm. this story is getting several degrees removed from what I would counsider directly rational. But it resonates somewhat with me.

  You see my desire as a transhumanist is to see a world in which persons can wear bodies and sexualities as you or I would wear a set of clothes. In fact, in spite of the danger and the dedrigation of what we might call the continuity of conciousness, I find the idea of a world in which beings can wear alien personalities and mindsets seductive as well.

  At any rate, the linked fanfic deals with two beings with reletively human minds overcoming differences in their relatively alien bodies (which are still both relatively humanoid anyway, among the vast diversity of lifeforms). The issues with comprimising greater difficulties between species might be worth looking into. Of course, many authors have tackled this problem on the scale of interplanetary relations, but it is fewer that go so far as to bring the questions to the bedroom...
