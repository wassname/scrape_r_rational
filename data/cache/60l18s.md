    >the main characterâ€™s initial goal seems a bit silly to me

    I actually disagree! Yes, it's not very lofty or anything, but it's very human and believable. I find it far more reasonable than the MC being that hard working without an unrelated motivation, the way it is in many Royal Road stories.

      Exactly, I thought it was very believable... It's actually more believable to me than just being ambitious. As a kid, ambition wouldn't have moved me that much but impressing a girl....

  Thanks for posting this. Despite the plot starting out like every cliched South Indian movie ever (rags-to-riches + poor-boy-wins-rich-girl), I find it emotionally compelling. Takes me back to my childhood in South Asia where high school final exams are almost a matter of life and death. The grades one gets in this last exam literally determines the course of ones' life. That part really isn't a fantasy in large parts of the world. And there have been documented cases of dirt poor kids taking the top rank in their state.

  This is actually really good, far better than I expected! 

  It's a bit of the usual Royal Road fare, but with actual good writing. The plot so far is rather interesting, the characterization very good, the world a little bit generic but also unusual in some  interesting ways. 

  I'm actually really excited to see what comes in the next chapters. So far almost every one has been a treat to read.

  I kinda want to hear a story about a good student who *is* interested in the truth behind things now.

  Was almost put off at the beginning by it all sounding a bit clinical and robotic in tone, but a little further in and that's becoming characterful rather than feeling like poor narration.

  Now it has more of a sense of "Whatever bull this world tries to pull, he's going to casually dissect and dismantle it, by a greater command of the facts".
