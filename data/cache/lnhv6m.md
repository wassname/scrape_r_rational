## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  Curious to hear a less fitness / bodybuilding focused perspective -- of [the following lads](https://i.imgur.com/PZVrOSk.jpg), who do you think has the most aesthetically pleasing physique?

  (ignoring differences in pose, lighting, & oiliness, and comparing only those included in the set above)

  edit, as a follow-up question: circling back to a favorite theme of this subreddit, young-adult fantasy literature -- suppose the Forces of Evil have swept across the land, and you're to hire one of the aforementioned blokes to guarantee your safe passage across the Forbidden Forest, the Chaotic Crags, the Unkempt Undercity, and other Place of Interest, all while carrying an Object of Power well-known to serve as a homing beacon to those who wish you harm. Taking as equal the experiences and equipment of the well-muscled men above (i.e. they're *all* in boiled leathers marked by hard use and careful maintenance, or *all* in golden, gleaming full-plate enchanted by the king's finest, etc.), which would you trust the most to succeed in such a venture? Narratively speaking, whose physique connotes the greatest strength and overall competence? (IRL, 'show'-muscles are nearly as functional as they are aesthetic, contrary to media portrayal; Ronnie Coleman in h) and Konstantin Konstantinov in g) weighed about the same off-season and had very similar ~2100lb big-3s, for example)

  edit_2, the extra details of the previous edit were maybe not too helpful here. An alternative scenario could be if you were the casting director for some fantasy miniseries, who’d project the best image of valorous heroism when clad in gleaming plate, or grizzled competence in cuir bouilli, etc.

    Most of them look utterly absurd to my eye. A/B/C the least of them, with C seeming the least uncanny valley. If they're all equally experienced and whatnot, I'd pick the one who doesn't make me want to run screaming, so C.

        There's something about the pose and the way the boxer-hang combines with the... line of his hip-bones? I think?

        It's not A's muscularity that throws me off specifically.

        That said, I tend to hang out with people whose lives are sedentary and whose exercise routines are structured around cardiovascular health and flexibility, not weights. I have a lot of friends who are fit (including a fair number of marathon runners) but none of 'em look like that with their shirts off. (And the ones that do a lot of weights tend to also be pretty chubby; ridiculously strong, yes, but rounded.) So there's a definite weirdness that arises from that.

            >  I went with 14 rather than 15 because one percent does actually make a difference with how defined your muscles look. One percent can be the difference between seeing the outline of your abs and looking like you don't have abs at all. 13 or 14 percent is pushing it as far as ab visibility is concerned, at that level they'll only be visible in certain lighting.

            If we're spitting hairs, it should be noted that charts like [this](https://kubexfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/body-fat-percentage-men.jpg) tend to "underestimate" bf% a bit relative to more reliable methods. I've had a DXA scans done a few times and they always peg me at ~15.0%, and I'd say the outline of my abs is [reasonably visible](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/6rjhyg/physique_phriday/dl5hzlp/).

                I think it's just much more recent! I remember seeing those charts in the mid-2000s, and think they emerged from prevailing broscience informed lightly by caliper measurements etc. (which, when I looked into it last, tended to just be based off perhaps not the most reliable or x-population generalizable linear models fit via OLS back in the day... I actually tried to reach out in the mid-2010s to some science-y-er fitness folks to see if any would be willing to collaborate on something a bit more sophisticated but didn't get any bites). DXA was only invented in the late 80s, and only worked its way to the 'fitness enthusiast' crowd as a way to track body composition in the 2000s & 2010s. 

                Thanks! I will note that I found the strongest possible lighting for those pics too haha. [Here's a shot](https://www.instagram.com/p/BPvwEjOjcrd/) in more natural light (but still flexing hard as lol, and also not exactly selected at random from all possible candidates ;])

                One way to maybe think of it from the perspective of appearance or athletic performance is that for a given physique, higher bodyfat % is always better because it represents that much more possible 'progress' able to be made (e.g. to look leaner or hit a lower weight class, if those are goals). But it's maybe a bit worse from the perspective of overall health and wellness.

    as a straight woman (who was once described by a friend as "the most aggressiely straight woman she's ever met"), I... don't really find any of them aesthetically pleasuing. 

    I tend to like dadbods and skinny wiry men, and if I had to pick it would be a) and g) - a because he has a really defined adonis V which I love, and g beause he seems to have the most body fat.

    That said, I'm also a domme, and I would find all except f and h really, really sexy if they were dressed in pink frilly lingere and begging for me to peg them, so it really depends what for. 

    As far as YA literature/casting the next GOT, I'd probably go for a, b, c, as they look the least "unrealistic", which is great both for men watching (to more easily identify with the character) and for male-attracted people watching (so think that this sexy person is someone they could reasonably kiss).

    hope that helps!

    Aesthetically pleasing (but not necessarily more attractive) are, to me personally, a) and c). But I'm definitely biased against too prominent muscles.

    Edit: regarding your edit, I would've picked d), who seems to strike the best balance between showoff-y muscles and looking strong/competent (if that makes sense). g) is also close, but he makes me slightly uncomfortable. To be fair, I find the edit strange—I wouldn't choose a guard based on who has the most aesthetically pleasing physique.
    ```

    - u/--MCMC--:
      ```
      The guard question was less about aesthetic pleasure and more about tropes, and which sorts would be narratively most associated with competence in a fantasy setting (also, presumably physique would play some role in assessment of IRL guard evaluation too, but maybe more-or-less plateauing before the first of the images). I feel in comics [muscularity](https://i.imgur.com/aS3mjBP.jpg) tends to scale well with [competence](https://i.imgur.com/5gY8oNq.png), but fantasy favors [wirier](https://i.imgur.com/ajJMfMJ.png) bodies, with [larger men](https://i.imgur.com/Ynq2qyH.png) largely serving to get worf'ed and show that muscles are meaningless.

        Iroh is a counter-example from the same show, and I'd absolutely pick him over any of the lineup you posted. Regardless of whether it was pre- or post-exercise regimen Iroh variant.

    Aesthetically pleasing? G, or B.  I think the extreme definition you get by cutting body fat over powerful musculature looks uncanny.  Fascinating, and very aesthetically distinct, but not exactly pleasing to me.

    To the edit, for assessing competence/reading physique for trope-driven competence, that gets very complicated very quickly.  As a character in-world, the sort of situation you've posed makes me unlikely to hire anybody.  The sorts of people used to accepting pay for prowess seem just as likely to be hired by my enemies, and trust matters a lot more than competence.

    If I have some external reason to believe they are sufficiently trustworthy, and all equally so, then I let them decide among themselves who's best suited to help me.

    If you just want me to identify, as a reader rather than a character, which body strikes me as most badass/competent... for me personally, bodybuilder's physiques just don't rate that high for me.  Sure, weightlifting can demonstrate functional strength of a kind, but still doesn't really translate well to what I imagine the ultimate warrior's physique should look like, or what kinds of function I equate with functional strength.  Still probably go with G, here, just because I'm inclined to have more faith in somebody who hasn't spent a lot of time cutting body fat.

    C, then D. Then maybe G. The groin lines or whatever on A are really strong and I don’t like that.

    ```
    RL warriors in Ancient and Medieval times were either wiry muscled and lithe (skirmishers, standing armies, duelists, assassins), or (if well fed, and specifically kept for combat like mercenaries or gladiators) would be heavily muscular and fat.

    The bodybuilder physique did not exist in pre-modern warfare context: it requires and extreme diet and training regimen that makes no sense for a fighter. A medieval-ish fighter would have to either have a lot of stamina and be quick, or have a lot of stamina and be durable (stocky with layers of fat over muscle to protect from blows and glancing cuts).


    Remove some muscle from the second left guy, or add a big fat belly on the second right guy, and you have yourself a proper heroic build.

    As for pleasing physique: I would say the 3 from the left are nice looking, if a bit over-build.
