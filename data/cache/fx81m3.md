## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  I've been trying to write this fight scene, but I've gotten kind of stuck, and I think it's due to my lack of knowledge about how fighting actually works. Maybe somebody here will have advice.

  == Short question ==

  If you have an injured leg, and your opponent has an injured leg, how does that impact your tactics? This in the context of unarmed, hand-to-hand combat.

  More meta, does anybody know a good resource for these sorts of questions?

  == Long question ==

  Okay, so what I'm trying to write is the following: my MC and her friend both have an injured leg. They are both skilled combatants who enjoy testing themselves against each other (with the friend being more skilled) and they decide to test their skills against each other in their injured states. This is meant to accomplish:

  * Demonstrate how my MC thinks about the efficiency of her movement when she can't walk on one leg
  * Illustrate how both characters have little regard for their own safety, recklessly jumping into a fight when they ought to be letting their legs heal
  * Illustrate how both characters have little regard for the others' safety, ruthlessly trying to win, capitalizing on the other's injury even if it would risk hurting them, even though it's just a practice match.
  * Show that my MC really just wants to just beaten up because she's a masochist.

  Anyway, I think I can do most of that headspace stuff. What I *can't* do is write 2 sentences about how the circumstances affect my characters' tactics in the match. Really, I'd be pretty happy with 2 non-sucky sentences on this. I could write,

  > I shifted my stance to account for my bad leg

  but that's vague and says basically nothing. I presume that I could write something along the lines of,

  > His right leg was broken, so it would beneficial to approach from the right/left, and he knew that and would be defending against it [mind games ensue]

  But which is it, right or left? Or neither, and the considerations are actually just much deeper than anything I, an inexperienced person, could conceive of while sitting on my couch? (Probably that last one.)

  I've tried googling around various issues, but I've gotten absolutely nothing, probably because sensible people don't actually fight with injured legs. I know this sort of question isn't the usual for this thread, but does anybody have any advice, either on this specific question, or general comments about writing a scene of this nature?

    One answer is that they could kick at each other's injured legs.  But attacking an injury like that seems sort of dickish; I'm screwing up my opponent's recovery and not practicing anything that will be super effective against a normal opponent.

    Instead, I'd have them circle each other, and play with distance.

    Consider an exchange that's as trivial as: I step diagonally towards you, putting me outside of your guard.  I kick at your side with my injured leg. You block, step back (bringing us back to starting distance) and then do the same to me.

    There's a sense in which this is a no-op; neither of us is gaining or losing ground.

    But, underneath that, we're trading pain. I step (ouch!) and kick (ouch!).  And then rather than try to catch my leg or close, you're showing me that you can endure an exactly equal amount of pain.

    Anything other than mirroring me would be merciful since, regardless of who wins the spar, a tap means that we can both stop walking around on injured legs.

    MMA is a good place to go for this sort of thing. Generally speaking, hand-to-hand fights end up on the ground and then the person who is the best at fighting on the ground will win, and it's usually not close once it gets to the ground assuming one person has skill/experience on the ground and the other doesn't. 

    Assuming two unskilled people, I'd see one getting on top of the other and beating the shit out of their head. 

    > They are both skilled combatants

    What are they skilled in? Is it the same discipline or different? This will inform it. I'd recommend watching clips from UFC 1, 2, 3, 4 and you can see a karate guy fighting a sumo wrestler, etc, to see how different disciplines might match up IRL. 

    How ethical are they? Head butts are very effective in combat but very likely to injure your opponent permanently, so they're illegal in MMA. Ditto eye poking, sticking fingers in mouths, hitting the kidneys, dropping people on their head, etc.

    You're saying broken legs. That's.... hideously reckless. Like, almost unrealistically so. There's a scene in one of the Jurassic Park novels where Malcolm says that a black belt in karate can kill someone with his bare hands but the karate training gives you the experience / knowledge / empathy / etc to not to want to kill someone with your bare hands. Obviously this isn't actually true but it is in a purely illustrative sense: high level fighting training gives you an appreciation of how fragile the body is and how long injuries take to heal and how debilitating they can be. If it's possible for the injury to not literally be a broken leg, that'd be a good idea.

    If you want two sentences, here's my attempt at writing it. If they're both Present Day people who are learning to fight in mainstream gyms, MMA is a very popular "discipline" to learn, so you can probably work with this. 

    I'm not an expert and I hate writing fighting too so this is a writing exercise for me as much as anything else

    My right leg was killing me: I couldn't believe I'd done this again, let myself be so stubborn and reckless as to do something like this. And the worst thing was, she was as stubborn as me, and even more skilled. I watched her front leg: I knew she'd be aiming to strike my weak leg, just as I was fixing to strike hers. But I had a plan: she was the more skilled at stand-up, but she didn't know I'd been seeing a new coach for my ground game. I thought I might have a chance. I attempted a few leg kicks, one of them striking her swollen red thigh. Her face contorted into a satisfying wince. I feinted a few more kicks, and, when she was too focused on me pushing my advantage on her injured leg - and when she'd given me another two big shots in my own leg and a punch that was dangerously close to my liver - I shot in for the takedown. My time on the high school wrestling team paid off: I had her legs, pulled myself onto her, and was in half guard before she knew what had happened. I laughed, a combination of relief and bloodlust as I started punching her face in furious volleys. She grabbed one of my hands, trying to redirect my might, before pulling me close so I couldn't get enough space to land a big punch. Her face was bleeding, and I kept going. If we had a ref, they would have stopped us by now: but we didn't, and she lay there, not reacting as I kept punching.

    Finally, I realised what I was doing: stupid pride. I sat there on top of her, trying to catch my breath. She looked up at me, her nose crooked in the nest of her bloodied face. I gave her a smile. She smiled back, as we both knew how insane this whole thing was. I helped her sit up, and she blew her nose. As bloodied mucus flew out of her, her eye swelled shut. 

    We started laughing again: we both knew that the last thing you did was blow your nose if you had the slightest suspicion it was broken. 

    We were idiots, through and through.

      Oops, did I say 'broken'? I did just mean 'injured', either a sprain, or *maybe* a broken leg that's on the fast-path to recovery due to magical healing, or something like that.

    So the biggest issue I see with this is that under known physics, an FTL machine is necessarily a time machine as well. You could play with that, or just handwave it away, "our previous models of physics were wrong."

    The two technologies that you mentioned seem very well suited to facilitating space travel. I could see a good story focusing on expansion into space, especially with an eye toward acquiring the classified material that enables anti-gravity (which I would make strangelets, 'cause those are neat).

    Other generic sci-fi technologies which could be worth exploring include power generation (I would personally use zero-point energy rather than fusion), and force fields as you mentioned, as well as a teleporter.

  Was wondering what are some likely scenarios to which a ruler would take most his army out of the castle to war and leave it virtually undefended?
  ```

  - u/Norseman2:
    ```
    A few possibilities come to mind:

    * The ruler is expecting a battle against overwhelming odds, and lots of siege weaponry, so the castle would be a deathtrap for anyone who stays in it rather than helpful. The ruler abandons the castle to fall back and regroup with more allied forces.

    * The ruler has very limited forces and is embarking on a mission to attack (or defend against an attack) on a crucially important person, place, or resource, and cannot spare even a token defense force to hold the castle (or the objective is of so much greater importance that the castle is negligible in comparison).

    * The castle has been left as a deathtrap for the enemy. The water and/or food reserves have been poisoned, maybe intentionally as a baited trap. Or perhaps there is a secret entrance that the ruler will use to access the castle at night and butcher any enemy forces who try to occupy it.
    ```

  - u/best_cat:
    ```
    This happened regularly in the crusades.  Lords would take their men and go to the middle east, leaving their castle with their wives and a handful of guards.

    There's also the "Empty Fort Strategy" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_Fort_Strategy where you try to fake out your opponent.

    A related ruse would be to tell the castle garrison to make it look like there are a ton of guards still in the castle.  Maybe they run around maintaining a bunch of distinct fires, so that the enemy sees the smoke of 20 cooking fires and assumes there are 100+ men inside the castle walls.  Or the inside guards could get clever with their patrols to make it look like there are a lot of people.

    This would make the enemy deploy their forces so they're able to respond to an big attack coming from inside the castle. Meanwhile, the actual army is somewhere else
    ```

  - u/Rhamni:
    ```
    In addition to Norseman's suggestions, rather than facing overwhelming odds the ruler could believe they are the one with an overwhelming advantage. If you think it very unlikely that anyone could sneak around your army or attack from some other direction, and you expect a quick, clean victory against whomever you are attacking, then it makes sense. Why leave 10% of your army behind if you are facing a seemingly easy battle and bigger advantage = statistically smaller losses? Generally speaking, if you bring 1000 men to attack 500, you will lose fewer soldiers than if you brought only 900.

    That said, the ruler would probably be a bit arrogant if they did this, or at least a gambler. You never know when the enemy has an ace up their sleeve or someone else decides to backstab you.
