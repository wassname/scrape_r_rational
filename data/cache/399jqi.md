## Looking for a story.

### Post:

I think it was posted on here, but I can't find it in a search. In it, a group of friends (vacationing on one of Jupiter's moons, or something like that) take a drug that melds their consciousnesses together, so that they lose all sense of identity and heterogeneity. Then something happens, and it's where the story gets really interesting. Does anyone remember the name of this story?

  I remember that, it was about the principle called Veil of Ignorance. I looked it up and it turns out it was just called [Veil of Ignorance](http://www.davidbarrkirtley.com/veilofignorancebydavidbarrkirtley.html). Convenient title for searches, heh.
