      Holy shit. The guy is amazing.

    Am I the only one reading his surname as direct insult for everyone present?

    > And I ,stenographer Mehere,(giggles silently) will write down the story of Red Fox Conspiracy against Dread Emperor Traitorous.

      As noted by others:  Shamna Mehere ->  "Sham name here".
      ```

      - u/SeaBornIam:
        ```
        Yeah, I've seen it. At first I've misunderstood it - thought name was meaningless and surname was a pointer - Hey, "me, here", you, suckers. It turned out even better still.

  I, for one, haven't laughed that hard at the banter in *several* chapters, at *least*.

  ```
  Seems worth pointing out that Vivienne has lost her Name, Black has lost his Name and now Masego seems liable to lose his. Not sure what the greater picture there is but it is a trend.
  ```

  - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
    ```
    Masego lost more than his Name. He lost his magic.
    ```

    - u/notagiantdolphin:
      ```
      One of his POV chapters has him theorising that there are 'two' kinds of magic ability, the one that most Wizards have, and one for High Arcana. Maybe he'll find himself able to develop that, and do nothing but play with High Arcana. 

      He's already got some ability, but I imagine further development will make things strange. If that theory about it being part of the original language of creation filtered down is true, then something to do with being Hierophant might let him bootstrap himself into something else. We'll have to see if he kept the name properly, or becomes something else entire.
      ```

      - u/BlackKnightG93M:
        ```
        My understanding of how you lose a Name is that the core driving force that got you Named had wavered, died or changed. The core driving force of Masego was to tear apart Creation to see how it ticked. What sprang from this was his focus on seeing the connections between how magic works (recall how he unlocked witness). 

        Just because he lost his magic does not mean he lost this drive to see and understand magic. It's similar to a career physicist losing access to their laboratory and equipment. They no longer have the tools to study reality but the will to know is still there and if they're driven enough, they might reaqcuire the tools or obtain something better.
        ```

    - u/Dent7777:
      ```
      Is it possible he lost his magic but not his name?
      ```

      ```
      Her only proper Name has been Squire, right?

      Black Queen, First among Night, and all her other titles -- these don't carry Aspects or any of the other pieces of a Name
      ```

- u/Academic_Jellyfish:
  ```
  There's no way the Pilgrim knows what he's dealing with in the Bard. Considering that she orchestrated the Doom, there's no way Pilgrim would work with her if he knew what she's been up to. At least we know what the Dead King was referring to when he said that they would all turn on her.
  ```

- u/JanusTheDoorman:
  ```
  Oof. So was the Dead King playing one level above the Bard or the other way around?

  Kinda surprised that Tariq is willing to take the Bard's word that they should spare Kairos on pain of letting him run around any longer and further indebting himself to Catherine. (Anyone remember what their deal was? I'm terrible with these details.)

  Masego criticizing Trismegistus' (I love that half the characters in this story have like 4 different names you could use for them) sorcery was pretty uproarious. It felt a bit like watching Einstein slag off Newton as a "natural philosopher". I may be badly wrong about it, but I imagine the loss of his magic won't actually affect Masego's outlook much, assuming Indrani is properly resurrected. I imagine it'll be like losing a limb and he'll struggle to function in its absence, but I expect him to set about restoring it in the same way he's always sought to improve it.

    ```
    He offered his crown if cat spared the saint.

    Also zeze saw with magic. He is now truly and double blind
    ```

    - u/JanusTheDoorman:
      ```
      Huh... that's... actually quite a coup for Cat if she walks out of this with a three month truce with the Dead King who's now got the knowledge to oppose to the Wandering Bard, a dead Saint and a Pilgrim whose influence in the Grand Alliance would presumably be undercut by forsaking his right to rule.

      Still, that trifecta would presumably require Saint to try and kill Masego to give Cat cover to kill her, which seems unlikely given that he's successfully rid himself of Neshemah. Still, 2/3 ain't bad.

      And yeah, I may have had my head up my ass about Masego returning to basically his old self considering he still has to grieve his fathers, his relationship with Indrani will have to evolve given what's just happened and the changes in her relationship with Cat, and also that he's now fully blind and without his magic.
      ```

      - u/panchoadrenalina:
        ```
        I dont think their relationship will evolve much. The best relationships imo are best buds that also fuck. They are already best buds and cat is taking care of the fuck bit. The will still be best buds that now know they REALLY like each other.
        ```

        - u/smaccookie:
          ```
          I don't know, there is a reason why friends with benefits are different from a relationship. Like a deeper level of trust, dependability and affection. I always imagined them as friends with different benefits. Or as lovers that outsource the physical part.
          ```

          - u/panchoadrenalina:
            ```
            i guess that depends in the definition of best buds, i was not thinking on idk, buddy cops and more thinking more on the line of sam and frodo from LotRs, that trusts each other and say that they love and are pretty much a couple without getting touchy. 

            and i think archer and zeze already behaved very close to that without the "i love u" part.
            ```

            - u/smaccookie:
              ```
              I guess there is, if at all, only a felt difference. But I think that acknowledging that which was already there will still change things, remove a few barriers. Plus, as the comment above said, that change is one of a great barrage of changes.

              Maybe it won't come to that and one or both die. But with this story, even that won't really be anything permanent.
              ```

    - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
      ```
      >He offered his crown if cat spared the saint.

      So does that mean he basically offered to let Cat kill the Saint?
      ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        Well, Cat promised to let the Saint be if she didn't try to kill Masego.
        ```

        - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
          ```
          but that was reached by Pilgrim promising to give up his crown, right? so if pilgrim is now saying he'll give up the crown for Kairos, whats going on with Saint?
          ```

- u/bipolargraph:
  ```
  Anyone thought about how traumatized Archer will be?
  ```

  - u/JustLookingToHelp:
    ```
    "Now that you're somewhat recovered from your near-death experience, have a taste of being *actually dead* for a while."
    ```

- u/PastafarianGames:
  ```
  My wild fan theory is that this is Bard's play to take a pair of threats off the board: Masego, whose powers are a threat to the playing board, and Catherine, whose goals are a threat to the game state.

  How? She takes away Masego's magic and dominos him a solution that involves blood sacrifice a-la our favorite half-Fae ex of Cat's. Killian coming full circle, as it were. And Cat saying no breaks the Woe, and everything devolves back to the status quo.

  But obviously A: EE is a better writer than me, so this isn't what's going to happen and B: if it did, Cat would find a third way.
  ```

  - u/NZPIEFACE:
    ```
    Still need to take care of the Prince of Night.
    ```

- u/thatsciencegeek:
  ```
  Fuck. Now only Neshemah knows the Intercessor's secret, and he can't follow through on his threat to make it public, since that would expose his escape. Masego will not be able to recover the secret from his mind. :(
