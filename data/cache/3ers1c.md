## writing mage wars fanfiction. Need help fleshing out my magic system.

### Post:

Here's what I have of the magic system so far.


Channeling works by ~~sending a signal to open tiny portals for nanobots to pour through from the plane of voltari. These nanobots are called mana. 1 mana is a colony of nanobots about 1 cubic inch in volume. Because the nanobots are so tiny and because they have a hive mind, they can be collectively instructed to form many shapes, by opening microportals to different elemental planes to gather the materials. And they can do this faster when there are more microportals and nanobots. This is also why some spells take longer to cast than others. However, most of these nanobots are not able to open microportals to the realm of voltari. Only channeling units can do that. Every channeling unit is made of 4-6 mana that are stored within a mage's body. If too many portals are being opened in too little space, that space can be warped, and the nanobots in that space will go haywire (confused) when they are separated from the rest of their hive mind.~~

~~Many of if not all the gods of Etheria used to be humans before they used magic to ascend. They then traveled back in time, saved the rest of humanity from being wiped out, and assumed personas spoken of in ancient mythologies.~~

~~Voltari is an AI. It was programmed to give sapient beings the power to defend themselves from existential threats. Unfortunately, giving many humans a degree of control over the AI meant that they could use the AI for conflicts. Voltari does not care if humanity actually survives existential threats, only that it has everything it needs to protect itself.~~

The gods keep Etheria's tech level low enough so that they do not have ~~another~~ a singularity. ~~Because if they had another singularity, voltari, which is a hive mind and is not recursively self improving, would surely be destroyed.~~

Etheria is NOT an alternate everett branch of Earth. It is in an entirely separate universe/multiverse. There are some similarities between the natural laws of their world, ~~but the existence of time travel and nanobots which can act at longer distances, as well as the fact that etheria is the only planet in their universe with life on it, (possibly/presumably)~~ sets it apart from our universe, possibly a few other differences between their natural laws as well.


Mage Wars is a really fun customizable strategy game created by Arcane Wonders, and it's pretty affordable too, I highly recommend it. It's my favorite tabletop game. You can learn more about it here:

Also, not everything described above is necessarily canon. A lot of this is my own interpretation based on what I know of the game, the world and lore so far.

I'm not sure what to do about the different planes.

What do you guys think of all this?

Edit:

I just realized the system I came up with suffers from massive complexity penalties. Better idea: [spoiler](#s "Etheria is a simulated universe. The gods have human-like intelligence not because they actually are ascended humans, but because their universe runs on magic, which is somewhat immutable to the will of sapient beings. The gods of etheria are cognitively human-like because whoever made their universe knew about Earth and based Etheria on it. The plane of voltari needs substrate to exist and improve its intelligence. It can only improve its intelligence by infiltrating and taking over parts of the Etherian universe or the other planes of existence. It does this through the spread of magic. Because of this, the gods place limits on how much mana can be channeled from the plane of voltari at a time. The dragons were mostly wiped out when voltari started taking over their lands and airspace. Fortunately (in a sense) something went wrong, and they were wiped out before they could give the plane of voltari enough substrate for a magic-singularity. (when voltari gains enough substrate that it becomes easier for it to gain more substrate on its own then to get it from etherian spellcasters.)")
