## Anyone willing to read Godel Escher Bach into an Audiobook/podcast format?

### Post:

Okay. . .  after many Googles, and please please prove me wrong, I cant find an audiobook of Godel Escher Bach.  I'd like to join in on the discussion, or at least try and catch up, because well. . math! logic! ect, but I'm ridonkuliously busy, as in full credit workload, plus research assistant, plus internship, plus relationship busy, because I was sane enough to get out of industry and go back to school.  I'm tempted even to put some of my meager dollar votes where my keyboard is, and I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who is looking for it. 

 Are you the person with free time, a sonorous voice and a desire to make this work available to those of us who mostly read during our commutes?

Heck if you like me want to read it but right now only have time while doing something rather mindless but requiring the use of your eyes please comment and boost the signal of the request.

    YouTube video then? Visual and audio elements together.

    Perhaps a computer game would be a better medium.

  I don't think a audio book version would work at all , but maybe a video one that could give animated examples and musical examples.

  Read the introduction in recent editions: Hofstadter does *not* want one.

  The diagrams are actually important, and there's a long series of strings in formal systems which are nearly impossible to express audibly.
