  Now I want to see a new pantheon of space-gods with Percy as God of Space Ships and Space Travel, Harry J.P.E.V. as God of Science and Magic, and Luminosity!Bella as Goddess of Immortality.

  Personally I like it. It's interesting to see the politics between pantheons and the portrayal of Percy as a lovable bum with extraordinary power is fun. 

  I was a bit surprised by your choice to make Percy bi-sexual though. Considering it's common both in fanfics and ancient Greece it makes sense but there weren't any hints in the books so there definitely needs to be a part of the fanfic where he...eh, rediscovers ancient tradition.

  This was an interesting read, but I'm not sure I'd call it rational. There are no real transhumanist themes in it, or puzzles to be solved. There doesn't even seem to be any overarching storyline beyond 'percy sails around.' There's no attempts to munchkin powers or optimize the world. Also, no one really paid attention to the whole "gods will spy on you having sex and then use that in political power plays later." 

  Let's be honest, the gods' constant awareness of stuff in their domain is Big Brother in a scary way. People go so far as to avoid saying Zeus's name because it would draw attention. Hell, Zeus would straight up kill a man because he decided to fly on a plane if he was born to the wrong parents jesus fucking christ that's not ok, it's illegal

  Now I'm imagining a re-write of the series with a rational!percy who gets freaked out by the gods and sets off to overthrow them. I mean, the gods literally are responsible for the holocaust in cannon if I recall correctly. It was a civil war, but seriously, there *must* have been better ways to go about it. And what happens when the muggl— I mean normal people find out? The American government would so not sanction divine acts of war in one of their cities. 

  I wonder how hard it would be for the camp to begin mass production of bronze tipped bullets, or to create a monster reserve so they only have to capture a beast once. And can we talk about how horrible it is that they're letting *teenagers* go on life-threatening quests because *glory*? They're too young to vote, let alone kill in self defense.

    This is almost a decade later but it has received a few more updates and now has an overarching plot. On your bit on how it’s illegal and not ok for the King of the Gods to act like that. Gods do not care about silly mortal things like ‘morality’ or ‘laws’. In actual myth gods would r*pe pillage and smite if a mortal had so much as looked at them funny or even looked attractive (especially the first). That to me makes the King of the Gods smiting children of his brothers for entering his domain make sense because gods can be fickle and temperamental (referring to the Father of Horses but the sea does not like to be restrained.)
