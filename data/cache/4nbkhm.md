  Mhh, yeah, so what? Mecha stories are unrealistic by nature, you're not proving anything we didn't alre... [HOLY SHIT I JUST WATCHED THE VIDEO THEY WERE LINKING TO THIS IS HILARIOUS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnbl9CZ9tOI&feature=youtu.be).

    Wait, this all started because of a retsupurae video. I was not expecting that...

    For all the other /r/rational viewers, take the time to feast your eyes also on:

    [Totally reasonable nanomachines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_1MPYda_KI)(warning, Metal Gear nanomachines are more reasonable than this).

    [Absolutely safe deathbed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXTSx0RvwEM).

    I like to think that the Dahir Insaat videos serve as a good example for cargo cult technology interpretations, but on the other hand they're patent trolls so... heh?

      Wait, what, Dahir Insaat are patent trolls that make videos with their patents for investors?

      That's an actual company? o.O

  tl;dr (edited for English):

  > Just by existing, [the funnel](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Universal_Century_Weapons#Funnel_and_Bit) disproves the entire military legitimacy of [mobile suits](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Mobile_Weapon#Mobile_Suit).

  > If you can pack the maneuverability and firepower to kill a mobile suit or a [battleship](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Battleship) onto something as small as a funnel, then there is no excuse for anything like a mobile suit to exist in the first place. Just build bigger funnels with more room for ammo and fuel, and send them on hunter-killer missions. If you still need [Newtype](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Newtype) control, you put that Newtype on a battleship protected by lots of armor and cannons, not on a robot he's piloting himself.

  > If you don't have the technology for funnels to be practical, they are worthless. If funnels are even remotely viable, then a [Hive Frigate](http://homeworld.wikia.com/wiki/Hive_Frigate) setup makes mobile suits laughably obsolete because they can deliver all of the offensive ability of mobile suits from a safe distance at a fraction of the cost.

  Oh my god YES. It's not often that I see people pointing out the flaws inherent in mechs. Mainly because I don't go looking for them and people (and me) usually accept mechs as part of the the suspension of disbelief. (I love Macross but hate the mech parts.)

  But I have this one friend that will defend the shape and functionality of battle mechs to the death. He'll proclaim that limbs with detachable weaponry provide superior firepower and coverage despite exposing more surface area, having more moving part complexity than a turret. He'll say a human-shaped hand acts as a great way to hot swap modular weapons instead of having universal hardpoint that, I don't know, actually connects the weapon so the vehicle can provide ammo or additional power.

  "You can't know that if technological progression will makes mechs viable" he says. MOTHERFUCKER, by definition a mech has unneeded moving parts and extraneous surface area to volume that would reduce the theoretical effectiveness a war vehicle could obtain.

  To be fair though, my dislike really only applies to Gundam/Macross style mechs where it tries to mimic the human form unnecessarily combined with long-term hover/flight capabilities. Exoskeletons get a pass because they're working at a human scale. Certain leg-using vehicles get a pass if they're using the leg part for terrain purposes and don't have infinite-hover/fly. Like mechwarrior is fine. They need the legs to traverse terrain, they don't have stupid fingers but actual hardpoints, and usually the cockpit is in the torso without extra random head parts.

  The "reasonable" explanation for arms on a spaceship is that it lets you vector all of your thrusters freely, which lets you point your main thrusters in any direction (which means you can carry as many thrusters as you need for your maximum desired acceleration in any direction, rather than separate fixed thrusters for every direction) and use your main thrusters for major attitude control if appropriate (lol). You mount them on lever arms instead of circular tracks basically because levers are mechanically easier to deal with. Mounting them on long levers additionally moves them further out, simultaneously giving you better attitude control giving you more freedom to move your thrusters around without burning your other arms off.

  With unlimited materials science and power engineering, the maximum-maneuverability spaceship would be... roughly the shape of your main gun, missile tubes, engineering spaces, whatever else you want to stuff in, with three-plus main thrusters mounted on tentacles with lengths roughly around to the diameter of the sphere, increasing with the number of thruster-tentacle pairs and decreasing with the sphericity of the ship.

  These conditions... start to go away as you reach more and more real-world-Tsiolkovsky-limited engagement ranges. If reality encourages year-long missile duels at light-hours of range, then this entire thing goes entirely out the window. If reality encourages laser duels at a tenth of a light-second, then maneuverability becomes paramount.

    The Gundam universes have a lot of interesting technologies. Depending on the suit and the era, many mobile suits and large ships are not limited by Tsiolkovsky's rocket equation.

    In the Universal Century timeline, and in shows that reboot it, there are Minovsky particles, which are the ultimate chaff. They scatter any frequency of electromagnetic radiation higher than the near ultraviolet, making radar and radio useless, and allowing interesting things with nuclear reactor designs. They're what make Newtypes' collaboration with Bits and Funnels so amazing: it's long-range communication without radio or lasers. 

    Some shows have autonomous AI-driven mobile dolls - these are almost universally deployed by the bad guys. And because of Minovsky-particle-constrained combat, there's not usually a way to issue a recall order. These are Unfriendly AI.

    If you want a realistic hard-sf Gundam show, watch 08th Mobile Suit Team.

    If you want ludicrous power, watch G Gundam.

    Anything else is in between.

  This is why Gunbuster is the best mech anime.

    That's a funny way to spell Gurren Lagann.

      TTGL is by far the most _fun_, but Gunbuster is just so much better overall.

  --I don't have any significant emotional stake in Gundam, but this prompts me to contemplate re: lasers and flux pinning (or maybe just something magnetic?).
