  Wooohooo! Starting the month off strong.

  As far as the Pokémon not existing, I guess the alliance marowak is ghost? In any case it definitely makes sense in terms of the original games story and the limitations of the games.

    ```
    Yeah they're going to bring up the Alolan marowak (guessing that's what you meant :) ) and I considered using it for a while, but it really felt cooler to lean into what made this encounter in the games feel unique.

      ```
      So it was a pokemon but pokeballs didnt work on it? Was it dome special technique or quality? Cause it deems like they are able to capture gaseous pokemon.

      I find the Ghosts in general kind of vague. They just spawn in places without observable procreation and possess surrealism? And dome can posess objects as a sort of energy being?

          ...and by sheer luck, it appears right in front of Blue, who cries out a warning even as his ball pings a lock, and throws with a surge of triumph—
          —that dies as the ball goes through it—
          —what—
          —an attack makes it disappear, and in the coldness of his calm he discards the confusion and starts looking again, taking another ball out as he waits for it to reappear—

  Like a lot of others I thought it was going to be a Spiritomb, and as Alolan Marowak has made a brief appearance already that ruled it out for new species. I thought it still worked really well though.

  This fic as a whole has done a lot of good for my mental-health by the way. A sincere thanks for that.

  Damn, for a second when they were talking about the very floor being the ghost I thought “Oh man, it has to be Stakataka then”. Good chapter, very spooky.
  ```

- u/Flavius_Belisarius_:
  ```
  Huh, so ghost marowak is capable of at least seeming to distort space around it with surreality? Combined with the unknown last chapter this only reaffirms my suspicions that somehow Giratina is involved or partially responsible. 
  Could be completely off the mark, but it’s my best bet. Though it doesn’t really answer some of the things Ghost Marowak can do, namely vanishing its victims.
  ```

- u/AKAAkira:
  ```
  * Given that the ghost marowak first attacked those two disappeared Rangers pretty soon after Blue Shadow Balled a wall, I think that's mildly corroborating evidence for the marowak posessing the floor after all, even if it wasn't actually "one-and-same" as the floor.
  * Just noting, this is the second time Leaf had to deal with dead babies, it's starting to be a thing with her.
  * Thought about this before, but now that it's relevant, how is the ability Truant interpreted here? The literal interpretation, that the pokemon only listen to every other command, is pretty much a death wish in this world. I was thinking that maybe the pokemon's stay inside the virtual mindscape of the pokeball would count as "loafing around", and once it comes out, it's only active for a certain while before starting get lazy? That'd make slakings a whole lot more useful in competitive battles with emphasis put on lots of swapping - though wild slakings would be somewhat vulnerable, for all its power, if it just can't be arsed to move when ambushed at a bad moment.
  * Nice thinking by Leaf to use the pokedolls creatively. I was wondering if using the containers themselves to block the way would've been better - but I guess they'd be more like obstacles to be broken, as opposed to hazards to trip over, and would break more easily under concentrated bashing.
   * By that line of thought though I'm kinda surprised no one carries around blocks of metal in container balls - surely someone, at some time, needed to block a passage where numerous pokemon were escaping through (e.g. here, and the Paras infestation on Mt. Moon), or drop/throw it as a distraction on a tough pokemon, or provide stable footing (e.g. Digglet cave), or double as a ladder in a pinch... It's looking to me like this hypothetical "pokeblock" is at least as useful as the average caterpie, and much more ethically expendable. Someone, give me an argument for why this can't be a potential business opportunity.
  * I kinda feel sorry for the denizens in this world - as if ancient super-pokemon waking up and wrecking the world in their fight against each other wasn't enough, there is now at least one kind of pokemon that can be pinged but not captured by pokeballs. This is probably reminiscent of what the sitation was like for their ancestors who hadn't even invented pokeballs yet.

    >I was thinking that maybe the pokemon's stay inside the virtual mindscape of the pokeball would count as "loafing around", and once it comes out, it's only active for a certain while before starting get lazy?

    I was thinking something like that, yeah, where it basically can only be commanded for a limited time before it starts to disregard commands.

    >It's looking to me like this hypothetical "pokeblock" is at least as useful as the average caterpie, and much more ethically expendable. Someone, give me an argument for why this can't be a potential business opportunity.

    The Rangers regularly carry this stuff, it's what was deployed around the hospital that Blue helped defend in Vermilion. Trainers in the field don't often bring it because most of the benefits can be gained from just using container boxes, and denser blocks would start to take up a lot of containers to get a large amount of them, each of which could be filled with other really useful stuff like more survival equipment or hell even other pokemon that don't fit on your belt. I can imagine that some people carry a few around at least, though, or maybe some groups designate one person in particular to carry a bunch.
    ```

    - u/AKAAkira:
      ```
      > it's what was deployed around the hospital that Blue helped defend in Vermilion

      Oh, good point. Thought those walls were a specific preparation made by Surge, but there's already a consumer supply for them? There goes my get-rich-quick scheme.
      ```

      - u/MilesSand:
        ```
        Seems like anything you use would be vulnerable to some kind of pokemon.  Steel blocks won't stop a charmeleon and become an additional hazard in the presence of magnetron. Concrete blocks might block those but have similar issues with fighting and ground/rock types, respectively.  Even trying to combine these concepts risks creating more hazards the moment something strong enough comes along.

        I'm sure there's a wagon you can buy that'll keep you prepared but a box full of pokeballs does the job 80% as well while only taking up 20% of the space you can now fill with other solutions.

        I bet there's a market for pokeball-zookas
        ```

        - u/AKAAkira:
          ```
          > Steel blocks won't stop a charmeleon

          That's probably arguable, based on whether charmeleon can put out temperatures higher than the melting point of steel or not. And even if it does put out high enough temperatures, if it's not *substantually* higher it can at least act as a delaying action. (I know we have precedent of Red's charmeleon melting the hide off of a magneton, but it's hard to say if its hide is chemically identical (or superior) to steel when it's part of a biological body, much like how onix aren't composed of actual rocks.)

          Besides which, as you said, if the opposing pokemon is strong enough, *anything* that's not at least as strong or has type resistance isn't going to be able to do more than slow it down (e.g. Viridian Forest shiftry vs. Blue's caterpie which got cut in half). My half-joking half-serious evaluation was more that a solid block of steel/concrete adds another layer of flexibility at a trainer's disposal that's probably worth as much as some individual pokemon on a trainer's belt (...and assuming that the storage of one block big enough to be of use takes about the same amount of resources than the average pokemon).
          ```

  Awesome! Always a great way to start the month. Spooky ending. They've won/survived but its unclear in what way. The implication is that the psychic pulse caused the creature to stutter, but then was it destroyed by all the attacks? Did it leave? If it left where did it go? Very interesting. I'm also curious if it did have pressure and this is just what pressure looks like when manifested by a ghost.
  ```

  - u/pochinha:
    ```
    >They've won/survived but its unclear in what way.

    My reading was completely different. It says that everything looks normal and that all the bodies disappeared. I'm not sure which bodies, but I'm guessing of the Pokemon that died during the battle, and maybe Gale's?

    Basically I thought Blue had been removed from the plane of existence where everyone else is, just like what happened to the two first trainers that disappeared. I.e., that from everyone else's point of view, Blue just stopped being there.

    Maybe there is not really any evidence to believe this and actually it makes much more sense that they just defeated the ghost marowak, but then what's the deal with the line about the bodies?

    EDIT: Ok, if Blue was alone I think he would notice and the text would reflect this. I still don't understand what the bodies being missing means. Actually, I don't understand which bodies are being talked about.
    ```

    - u/Thatguy3367:
      ```
      My reading of it was that it was attracted to leaf and red and took everything spooky with it. I.e. all the bodies that that have been buried there. It is a giant grave after all.
      ```

      - u/pochinha:
        ```
        > It is a giant grave after all.

        Oh, right. I thought it only contained urns, but I guess it can contain both urns and bodies. How would you notice it if all the bodies disappeared, though? Presumably they weren't in plain view.

        > it was attracted to leaf and red and took everything spooky with it

        This makes sense. Which is terrible, because the people down there are really not prepared for a ghost marowak attack.

    "I can't tell how they feel," Jason says. "The scream is too piercing, I could only tell they were not ghosts, and inferred the rest from what other pokemon are native to the area."
    "Even that's impressive," Red says. "Bringing my shields down at all feels like it would quickly overwhelm me."
    "I feel nearly the same," Jean says, putting what seems like a consolatory hand on his shoulder, probably because of the slight bitterness that he'd spoken with. "I'm afraid none of our gifts except Jason's will be of much help going forward."

  Another great chapter; I had to pause reading a few times from my itch to overanalyze things:

  The first big thing to jump out to me immediately was that Leaf & Red's plan to scare away the wilds with venasaur roars was a terrible mistake- If cubone/marowak have no predators which use sound, then they are likely going to be *attracted* to investigate the noise. If the venasaur roars weren't playing, the might not have even found their way to the stairs, or atleast they would've taken more time to come en mass.

  &#x200B;

  As for the ghost!marowak, I had an idea that wasn't really the ghost's true form: As another commenter noted, it only appeared to attack anyone after Blue attacked a wall, and, most notably to me, after tonnes of marowak were dying in droves just below. Perhaps the ghost!marowak was a sort of projection based on the pokemon dying nearby? That would help to explain why it couldn't be caught, despite pokeballs working on other semi-intangible ghosts. (Admittedly, this doesn't explain why the surreality stopped after the ghost!marowak was defeated, but...)

  &#x200B;

  WMG: Given the mention of suspicious people visiting the tower, it's possible that this ghost/phenomenon was artificially created/arranged/triggered. I can imagine that  possibly happening if those people were going around hiding shards of the red (or blue) orb throughout the tower, which I assume will be what mega-evolution keystones will be made from in this universe (given how the red orb reacted to Steven's aggronite and metagrossite). That sort of origin could also explain the surreality disappearing after the ghost!marowak was defeated, assuming it was only a projection, as the end of combat would cause a mega-evolution (or equivalent phenomena) to reverse.
  ```

    That...may be so? Wild animals in general are more likely scared off to loud noises than attracted - I don't know any animals that'll come running *to* you if you fire off a gunshot, for example - but we don't have the exposition on cubone/marowak psychology promised by Leaf yet, and though the Rangers' commander condoned the action, I think there is a slight chance he didn't happen to have that particular knowledge either, and made the wrong call.

    > Perhaps the ghost!marowak was a sort of projection based on the pokemon dying nearby?

(Admittedly, this doesn't explain why the surreality stopped after the ghost!marowak was defeated, but...)

    I don't know about that - it was the ghost marowak's "despair beacon" that drew those ordinary marwaks to the tower *en masse* in the first place. Whatever the ghost marowak was, it's most likely one and same as the Ghost presence Jason had been trying to communicate with before the ordinary marowak even came.

    (That said, I do agree after you brought it up that marowaks dying in droves might also have been a contributing factor to why the ghost marowak popped out of wherever it had been.)

    > I can imagine that possibly happening if those people were going around hiding shards of the red (or blue) orb throughout the tower

    I really don't know about this one. I'm thinking shards of the red/blue orbs would be *extremely* valuable research material right now, because of their link to Mega Evolution (and to the ancient super-pokemon). Why would anyone try to put them in a place they might not be able to easily access later?

    Those aforementioned suspicious-in-retrospect people probably are involved, but given the out-of-context feel the ghost marowak has (and also in part, how savage and destructive it ended up being), I doubt they *intended* to make it, at least. Let's see if any more light gets shed on it in future chapters.
    ```

- u/DavidGretzschel:
  ```
  Leaf and Red killing the ghost with kindness. That's kinda cute.
  Though I note that it's likely that the Ghost Marrowak is not dead.
  Leaf projected: "Live. That's all that matters. Live, live, live..." at it, after all.
  Seems like it would have teleported away, then?

  Though it probably wasn't suicidal in the first place, given that it acted anything if not homicidal. More like a predator using his own psychic projection to send out a message of despair. A cry for help (concealing the true intention of "help itself to a buffet", behind a partition).

  Leaf's psychic backtalk probably did confuse it, the same way a hunting lion would if you appeared out of nowhere and confidently gave it a hug. 

  \->” That wasn't supposed to happen....”

  Classic counter-surreality play. You show so much CONFIDENCE, that any lion or poor little ghost Marrowak would back the hell off, cause it no longer feels SAFE and IN CONTROL.

  Though really, Red and Jason's interpretation that it was sad/depressed/suicidal was absolutely harebrained. They trust their psychic senses too much when those were an attack vector!

  My boy Blue wouldn’t have made that mistake. Blue knows Pokémon are out to get him.
  Even the trees are out to get him!

  Anyway, really stupid idea.
  Consider that Zapdos itself is not feeling Pressured either.

  It was just having one hell of an electric birdo legendary fun time when it hit Vermillion.

  It didn't feel pressured to do so, it probably just felt like doing it. Probably was a Thursday. [pun only works in German, though]



  Maybe our ghost is back to some lab in Giovanni's org or whichever shady actor was behind its creation.
  Giovanni would make sense, looking to test another weapon against the Stormbringers perhaps?
  Could explain why the A-Team didn't show up if Giovanni delayed them or told them not to go.
  That’s more of a Resident Evil plot though...

  -> “No, Agatha. You can’t help, you remember my latest bio-organic weapon system, that I have been developing? 

  “Uhm.... you mean that creepy telekinetic kangaroo thing in a glass bottle?”

  \->”No.....that....... didn’t work out too well. This is Project Ghosty-Wak.”

  “Ah that one. Yes, would be interesting to know, if the Rangers can handle it. Very promising, indeed. I’ll be having a three hour delay..... because of...... hmmm....... Abra logistics issues on the Indigo Plateau.”


  Or maybe it's the sociopathic Pokéball hacker, that Giovanni pawned off to a stricter organization, that is the mad scientist behind it. Explains the delayed occurrence of it, after the shady people were gone? The inability to catch it?

  And/Or it's the advertised "new species" casino Pokémon.

  The sorta-kinda grotesque shape might suggest a Ditto transforming into an Alolan Marrowak. Ditto are failed attempts at creating Mewto siblings (“the others”), after all. Not sure if it was canon, or just implied by OoS or both.

  You can probably do all kinds of weird nonsense with Ditto. I know I can, at least in Gen 1.
  Creating a fake new Pokémon species? Sure, why not.

  Imagine promising your little daughter that you give it the main prize if you win, buying one casino ticket.
  And then you do actually win and you were really hoping it would be a cute little Pikachu-kinda deal, but now she's disappointed, because it's a homicidal fucking ghost Marrowak with an aura of despair and sadness, instead. 
  Probably could find someone to trade it for a Pichu though?

  Ah, what the hell.... make her train it. Builds character. She gonna be Champion one day!

  Why would there just be one Ditto, though?

  Maybe it's a renegade Pokémon and that could explain why the Pokéball didn't ping? Though that wasn't a problem in the Rocket Casion, IIRC.

  \->“Daddy, the ghosty-wak is just staring at me! How am I supposed to play with it? It’s boring and creepy!”

  “Ah, don’t be like that. It has a club, doesn’t it? Take it away and play fetch!”

  \->”Fine, fine, I’ll try that. But I still want a Pichu!”

  “That’s my girl!”

  I just wanted to say that it was a great chapter once again. I just have one minor problem with the story so far - it follows the games too closely. I have seen what you have been able to accomplish with the modifications to the games(battles, TMS, rocket casino, Mewtwo) and I think that the story would benefit more with a bit more breakaway from the games. Ik that u/DaystarEld probably has the story fully planned out, but incase some changes can be made, it might improve the story a bit more. This is just a suggestion and I would like to know everyone's thoughts on it. Other than that, the story is the best it could be in my opinion.
  ```

  - u/burnerpower:
    ```
    I don't know about that at all. It certainly takes inspiration from the games but I'd never accuse it of following them too closely. Take this arc for example. The only commonalities are the ghost Marowak and that Team Rocket is probably involved. The way things play out are very different, and this is one of the arcs that follows the games pretty closely. If you go back a bit Red apprenticing under Sabrina is completely divorced from the plot of the games. If you go back even further the Stormbringer arc is nothing like the games. Part of the fun of the story is how DaystarEld takes some absurd pokemon concept and turns it into something that fits in a rational world. I don't think thats a problem, I think thats playing into the story's strength as a fan fiction.
    ```

    - u/Mc54322:
      ```
      I am well aware of what you have mentioned u/burnerpower. It's why I want the story to go a bit differently. Since the story is going in the same overall direction of the games it is more possible to predict when something might happen or what might happen like when rocket casino takes place or that the ghost pokemon is indeed the ghost marowak from the games. Since u/DaystarEld is great at making up situations(like the team rocket stuff, vermilion city zapdos encounter and the other things u have mentioned), I am saying that maybe switching things like the order of the gyms might benefit the story more. But pls keep in mind that I have played make fire red run and rom hacks of fire red that I am somewhat sick of the story so it might just be my biases. Despite this I am very impressed and satisfied with the story so I will keep reading this.

        Sure the Casino happened, but in a way that was completely unpredictable. No secret poster, instead we are interrupted by Hoenn legendaries.

        We have some idea of what elememt comes into play, but how it interacts is completely shifted and new. That dissonance is pretty great.

        Especially since there are several original subplots intersecting.

        Going to a different town first wont really make the events of that town less predictable. Especially since at this point there isny much to shift the order.

        The canon order is Koga 5th and Sabrina 6th right? That is what I did at least. I didnt even realize you could do them out of order.
