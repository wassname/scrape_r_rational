## [Spoilers MoL Chapter 96] How he might have done it

### Post:

I made [this](www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/as4yqo/spoilers_mol_chapter_96_how_did_he/) post asking how Jornak could become Red Robe if he gets reset every month. And I think I worked out a plausible timeline.

1) Zach and Jornak meet. Zach tells him about the time loop, because that's what Zach does.

2) Jornak reports this to the Cult of the Dragon Below, because Jornak is an informant for them, usually reporting information on House Boranova

3) The Cult of the Dragon Below is trying to summon demons, but they can't, so they believe him. The information makes its way to Quatach-Ichl.

4) Quatach-Ichl meets with Zach. QI thinks the entire world is stuck in a time loop. Zach thinks that to end the loop he has to stop the invasion without anyone knowing about the loop. So QI gives Zach a way to tell him to cancel the invasion next restart, to see what happens.

5) Zach stops the invasion, gets information on the Gate. He decides to spend the rest of loop time productively. He starts preparing his case against his caretaker. He runs into a wall since everything disappears after a month. He contacts Quatach-Ichl to get his crown. Quatach-Ichl gives it to him in exchange for a marker, since it's the only way he might be able to sabotage Zach.

6) Quatach-Ichl manages to jailbreak his marker, and since he's such a nice person, does it to everyone else's markers too. Jornak helps Zach prepare his legal case with infinite time, but then realizes that he hates the government. Zach doesn't really want to change the world, but Jornak does.

7) Zach wants to get into the control room. Jornak gets him into the time magic research facility to take a look at the Gate, since he's a lawyer and it's Zach's stolen legacy. Quatach-Ichl helps him get in, since Zach doesn't have soul awareness. Quatach-Ichl then gets everyone else in with Zach, since he's such a nice person.

8) Panaxeth pops in to say hi. Jornak decides to make a deal with Panaxeth. He and Quatach-Ichl work together to screw over Zach. Panaxeth revokes everyone's markers, including QI's. QI consents to this so Jornak can get the information to make sure the invasion works. QI doesn't do it himself because he isn't stupid enough to make a deal with a primordial.

The first four aren't really necessary, but it would make sense.

So that's how Jornak might have been able to enter the time loop. Kind of complicated, so that might not be how it actually happened. But it's somewhat plausible. And it shows how Jornak is best positioned to actually be RR.
