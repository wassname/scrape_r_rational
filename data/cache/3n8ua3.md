## [BST] How would you best abuse the observe and examine system if you were a real life gamer?

### Post:

Like in my previous threads on abusing the [inventory](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3mjeic/bst_how_can_you_munchkin_the_item_box_pocket/) and [food](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3mvp8n/bst_how_can_you_best_abuse_the_food_rest_and/) systems this time I'm exploring what I consider the most powerful system so far, the observe and examine system. I'm interested in how these systems can potentially be abused partly because of curiosity and partly because I may write a rational The Gamer story in the future. Keep in mind that you can only abuse this system on its own. There will be more threads on other systems in the future.

The Rules:

* By focusing on an item, place or animal (including humans) you can get information (in the form of a floating window) on it that is 100% accurate even if no one else knows this information. This process only takes about a second.

* You can increase your observe skill with practice, allowing you to see more information. It becomes exponentially harder to increase your skill over time. This skill applies to everything you observe or examine.

* When examining items (which can include any object or plant) you will get a detailed report on its characteristics, durability, and uses. After practice you can glean more information from items such as value, how old the item is, and other more detailed information.

* When examining a place (which you can do by focusing on it at a distance) you will see information about it's uses, who or what lives there, danger level and other information. You will see more detailed information the higher your observe skill is.

* When focusing on a human or animal you can see things like their name, physical fitness, intellect, health, age, and skills. At higher levels you can see things like their mood, weaknesses and strengths, and even gauge what they are about to do (in general, not exact).

* Everyone, including yourself, has a nameplate above their head detailing their name and level (which is an abstraction of their combined physical and mental strength + their skills). You may be unable to examine powerful people unless you have a high level in your observe skill. If this is the case you cannot see their name, level or any of their skills or abilities.

* No one can see any of the information you see, when you examine something it will just look like you are focusing.

* Cameras, mirrors, binoculars and pictures will all work. You can observe things in pictures or videos, though there are some limitations. If you observe a person in a picture that is 10 years old you will get what they were like on that day, not what they are currently, same with items or places. You must also be able to see enough to accurately make out what the thing is. If an image is too blurry, or does not capture enough of the object or person to make them recognizable the observe will fail and you will get no information.

* You must be physically looking at something with your eyes to examine it, you cannot simply think about examining something.

* You cannot examine things that are intangible or imperceptible. You cannot for instance examine a scientific theory or a religious  belief and figure out if it is true. You cannot examine things like bacteria that you cannot physically see unless you are looking at it through a microscope.

  If you're starting out with a small amount of money you can use your skill to go to garage sales (and other things where people sell "junk") and buy things for cheap that are actually antique.

  I can't think of higher value example of where you can leverage information you know, but other people are uncertain of, to make money. I'm guessing this skill wouldn't really work on the stock market. I'm guessing this skill also doesn't work on lotto tickets (or at least probably not at the level where your easiest way to make money is shopping around for lotto tickets).

  After that you can likely use your skill on people to build a company of dependable people. I'm not sure what field, but it should be something that you can use your examining skill early on, but also something that you can hand off to others eventually.

  In a previous thread someone mentioned the Randi prize, this would also be a good idea for getting starting capital, but information is harder to leverage if everyone knows you can do it.

    You could gamble and look at the back of a card and see "ace of spades with the back showing", although that *will* get you thrown out of the casino whether they know what you're doing or not.

    You could go to a gold mine and analyze a sequence of "items" which consist of a column of rock a foot square and some large depth, and find where all the gold is.

    I already mentioned diagnosing diseases, engine trouble, and well, anything that needs to be diagnosed.  (Diseases are probably to be avoided because practicing medicine without a license is illegal.)

      This was my idea as well, which is why I think this is the most powerful power so far. The item power could make you a great smuggler or thief but with this power just by identifying where gold, gems, ore etc is you can easily become the wealthiest person in the world. 

      You could start a mining company (after you use the power to work your way up to a couple million bucks of capital) and find all the best people to run it. Then go around and start analyzing cheap land people think is crap. You'll soon find mines of all different kinds and then just buy the cheap land and start mining the crap out of it. Repeat and become the worlds richest person in a couple years. Best of all you can analyze your protection, friends, workers, and business associates to make sure they will never betray you. World domination isn't an outside possibility if you can leverage tons of money + knowing peoples weaknesses and strengths.

      Wonder if anyone can exploit this power more than I already have?

      The digital equivalent of diagnosing disease: you could presumably see software vulnerabilities pretty instantly by just staring at the source code. You'd be the Magic Instant Debuggerâ„¢.

    First thing that comes to mind: music producer or book publisher. Stare at a "slush pile" and instantly know which artists/authors are worth pursuing.

    Actually, wait, even better: go into venture capital. You might not be able to judge an anti-inductive system like the stock market, but judging businesses' investment applications shouldn't be nearly as fraught.

  This is subject to one of the exploits also used for the inventory version: what's an item?  ("I pick an item consisting of a visible spot connected to a one molecule wide corridor connected to a center section".)  What if I want to pick, oh, the tumor in someone's body (plus the one molecule wide corridor) and I don't know exactly where the entirety of the tumor is located?

  How do doctored images work?  If I have an image of a bald man with hair photoshopped on him, does it work?  What if I have an image of someone deaged?  What if I have an image of someone that is deaged, *and* that happens to be byte for byte identical to an image of the person actually taken at that age?  Do the results I get depend on the history of the bytes?

  What does it mean to get a report on something's "uses"?  Anything has a near-infinite number of types of use and probably different numbers of each one, unlike a video game where an object only has one use.  Do I get a reading of "1000 uses of this sword to kill things with, 100 uses if I use it to break glass windows, and 1 use when the use is melting it down for scrap"?

  "Imperceptible" is a vague term.  I can see a computer, but I can't see its program.  Would I be able to gain information about the computer that depends on what it's programmed to do?  You probably want to answer "no" to this, but you can't answer "no" without excluding a wide variety of things that you would probably not want to exclude.  I can't see microscopic threads in my shirt, but those microscopic threads may affect how long the shirt lasts; am I unable to get information on that?

  More generally, concepts like "item", "imperceptible", "uses", and such don't really divide reality at the seams.

  Also, I would ask if the difficulty of finding information through this system exactly matches the difficulty of finding it without.  If not, that can be used for exploits.  It's hard to diagnose a disease or a fault in an engine, but the window may say "has disease X" or "engine with broken piston".  Or "prime number".

  You could spend all your time looking at old photos trying to figure out if your ex ever really loved you.

  Detecting counterfeits, medical conditions, and industrial inspection (this is a flawed space telescope mirror) are industrial uses. You can also find spies, so the you could be interesting for espionage.

  Observe stars in the sky and see what you get. If there is life out there, it may be noted.
