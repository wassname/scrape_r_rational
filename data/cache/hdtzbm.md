## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  A while ago I asked for scifi/fantasy wilderness survival stories and got some suggestions. I've been looking around since then and I've found a few I'd like to mention:

  [Chimera](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20364/chimera): A monster that is vaguely human eats other monsters to gain some of their strengths. The writing isn't bad enough to get in the way of the story but the story isn't updated currently and was moving away from wilderness survival anyway.

  [Taint](https://lsdell.com/table-of-contents/): Girl gets trapped in a dungeon, spends several hundred years killing demons and forgetting social norms. Not really wilderness survival and also on hiatus.

  [Into the Mire](http://intothemire.com/): Absolutely my favorite in this list. Great characterization, great writing, interesting plot.

  [Eight](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26734/eight): Isekai featuring an older protagonist in a child's body surviving in a wilderness populated by fire turkeys and ice deer. Decent writing but moving away from wilderness survival after the first arc.

  In addition I also found a surprising amount of erotic literature in this genre, but nothing I would recommend. If you have nothing better to do and can stand the constant mentioning of ears and clunky prose while skipping half of the word count maybe you'll find something interesting but I've moved on in my search.

  Aside from the above I'd love any additional wilderness survival or isolated protagonist recommendations!
  ```

  - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
    ```
    Into the Mire is great. I absolutely loved the first book. The description of the swamp and those weird flesh-trees was great. The characters were great too.

    Eight is pretty good, but I found the >!ability to see ghosts weird and kinda coming out of nowhere given the previous themes of the story.!<
    ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    Is Taint any good? I read a few of the comments and it seems to be a cultivation/xianxia story. 

    I'd like to mention a few stories that have substantial amounts of wilderness survival/exploration, although they aren't primarily about that.

    * [The Snake Report] (https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/14396/the-snake-report) has the main character spend the first book trying (and succeeding hilariously) to survive. One of the earliest reincarnated-as-an-animal stories I've found that are written originally in English. Currently on hiatus, although I find that book 2 ends at a nice note.

    * [Paragon of Destruction] (https://www.webnovel.com/book/12311119706248305/Paragon-of-Destruction) doesn't start off with wilderness survival, but after a while the main character starts spending increasingly more time by himself exploring the wilderness. It's a generic xianxia story, but written well enough that the usual trappings of xianxia aren't present. 

    * Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash is a light novel series where a group of b-tier adventurers try and struggle to survive after being transmigrated. There's a bunch of wilderness survival, and the characters do struggle a lot to even achieve decency at their craft. I wasn't able to stick to it after volume 13, but ymmv.
    ```

    - u/ElectorEios:
      ```
      I read Taint a while ago. In my opinion, it was pretty great in the beginning, before she rejoined the real world, but started to fall off pretty fast afterwards.

      The "gimmick" of a character forgetting how to be a nice moral human as a result of centuries of isolation (and some biological change?) started to drag when she never really developed as a character (at least as far as I came before I dropped it, somewhere around Chapter 54 I guess). 

      She was a monster and acted like a monster, and the whole villain-protagonist shtick is difficult to get right. Light, from Death Note, is an entertaining one, but she wasn't imo. Maybe in part because Death Note framed Light as a villain from the start, while the story never really framed her as one, despite the monstrous acts she committed.

      YMMW
      ```

    - u/iftttAcct2:
      ```
      >Is Taint any good?

      I'd recommend both the stories that author has. Do be warned that the author seems to have fallen off the face of the earth as of a year ago.
      ```

  - u/minekasetsu:
    ```
    [The Iron Teeth](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/4293/the-iron-teeth-a-goblins-tale): A goblin got adopted by an old scout of a bandit tribe amidst unruly northern wilderness. Aside from the wilderness survival, my favorite aspect about it is how the mc is not at all concerned with being rational, being a simple goblin, which I suppose is an antithesis to this entire subreddit, but it makes for a good palette shift after you've read some particularly heavy things or just depressed.

    It had plenty of contents, but while it is technically completed, it kinda drags a bit and the ending is rather disappointing so you might want to stop before then.
    ```

  - u/Freevoulous:

    Im in the middle of writing one, should be done by November at the latest. It is low key sci-fi, hard on the wilderness survival part.

  [https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21844/i-am-going-to-die-in-this-game-like-dimension](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21844/i-am-going-to-die-in-this-game-like-dimension)

  The title is garbage but is a good read. Set in a different universe with different physics with a character from Earth and written by an author who actually knows physics(teaches it). Some fun alternate physics like objective meaning.

  &#x200B;

  "When mysterious portals start opening up around the world at large events, swallowing everybody, you’d think that would warrant some kind of danger pay when you have to sell hotdogs at a Comic Con, right? ‘No, of course not; what are the odds of that happening here, out of all the big events in the world?’

  Well, Emma was always pretty good at beating the odds when it came to shitty luck.

  Now she’s stuck in a strange dimension, where the normal rules don’t seem to apply, together with a costumed crowd who seem strangely happy about this whole thing.

  At least, until the first people start dying."

  Looking for more stories with non-Lawful-Good protagonists who are enormous trolls instead of being evil and vengeful.  Less "now that I have defeated my enemy, I will wipe out his entire family" as in CN light novels, and more "[now that I have defeated my enemy, I will propose marriage to his mother](https://pp8j2pd7t1dxg.36yqnzkx1y1xe.mangadex.network:44300/W8tPYIOs2Eo6uJhrSzeH-UNnnH6oZiEJ1o-P67hwns2zGwo9NErS0tbPImZySC2V4GOmYV-jnvBqXyCtq7ULcxQgplm8ov8qXCk2BpxkgdR5rilZ83cc717kBXcLRjFiPvC50RuSACdTOKq7md-PPPChLZ1SwYc3NCQI7pn_6gpoxtbjqI8w4p3nu9IzI92NFxQS-l7LCNoOOOg75sMwc06cBIM/data/f560d53cf616f71e01e35d5b6e20022e/t2.png)".

    ```
    Calvin from [Wake of the Ravager] (https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25878/wake-of-the-ravager) is definitely non-Lawful-Good, and also a troll... sort of. He's really enjoyable in an authentic teenager sorta way, as in he makes terrible decisions that pan out in hilarious ways, while also being authentic to his character. I recommend it for the slapstick humor.

    Takes until chapter 7/8 to really get interesting, but wow, it really is hard to match. Thanks for the indirect recommendation. What a lovably assholish main character.

    EDIT: Caught up, there weren't that many chapters. It's pretty refreshing, though not immune to a few unironic harem tropes itself, which is very disappointing. There's still fanservice and Convenient Protagonist Obliviousness fairly often.

    The SI protagonist in the Naruto fic [Plasticity](https://archiveofourown.org/works/16017161/) might qualify.

    From the start of the fic, she is stuck in situations where her fate is controlled by people much stronger than her. She maintains her sanity through acts of petty rebellion (trolling) that sometimes have hilarious, snowball-effect repercussions. Her entire existence becomes an escalating con-game balanced on making her enemies believe that she is more useful than irksome.
    ```

    - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
      ```
      That protagonist is definitely having a series of not-so-great days, and I'm still reading.  This is a beautiful case study in good writing through jeopardy - I had no idea how the protagonist was going to get out of the Chapter 1 dilemma, and the result didn't feel like an asspull either.

  I would like to recommend the only jumpchain fic that I liked apart from Companion Chronicles: [As A Consequence Of Your Action](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/as-a-consequence-of-your-action-jumpchain.845425/)

  Author summary:  *Most Jumpchains assume that your ROB is either absent or interested solely in their or your own entertainment. But what if a Jumper had a Benefactor with a... different agenda?*

  It is currently on its second major arc and updating daily. The characters are three dimensional, the plot is moving at a decent pace and so far there are no idiot balls. The main twist of this jumpchain is that there are no companions and that one of ROBs goals seems to be the SI's emotional suffering. At least that is the SI's current rational conclusion based on the available data so far.

  The setting of the first arc was Girl Genius. Currently the second arc is Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
  ```

  - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
    ```
    Started reading, then paused because I think I have to finally go read Girl Genius first. There was a time I was caught up on GG, but that, evidently, was very long ago.
    ```

    - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
      ```
      ...I forgot how incredibly funny Girl Genius was, in case anybody else hasn't gotten around to reading it.
      ```

    - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
      ```
      Same. I kept up with Girl Genius religiously for a long time, but after the timeskip it feels like it's lost something.
      ```

  - u/Makin-:
    ```
    I tried this one, but it's one of those fanfics that are absolutely impossible to follow if you don't know the source material. Zero explanation on anything.
    ```

    - u/WarZealot92:
      ```
      Personally, I enjoyed the Girl Genius arc despite knowing nothing about the source material. I suspect that I missed a lot of nuance here and there and especially in the beginning many times new things were introduced that felt like they come out of nowhere, but all in all I feel that enough is explained to make a complete story. 

      Put another way, after finishing the whole arc and looking back, I have a feeling like I understand what has happened.

      I cannot judge as to the second arc, because I am familiar with the BtVS fandom.
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I’d also reccomend https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/nowhere-land-jumpchain-multicross-horror.831104/ (SCP / Jumpchain), as part of a wider conclusion that Jumpchains don’t really work with a helpful benefactor or a jumper that can pick their own jumps. Either one of them completely bleeds out almost all of the tension very fast, and actively resist ways to believably add it. With enough work you might be able to manage a slice of life or power fantasy where these two don’t hold true, but nobody seems to try for the first and the second tends to just be disappointing ime.
    ```

    - u/AcceptableBook:
      ```
      > Jumpchains don’t really work with a helpful benefactor or a jumper that can pick their own jumps

      That's a good point. Thinking about it more, there's also the fact that most people would want to go to a relatively peaceful realm if they could get to choose. Like, what sort of person picks Warhammer 40k to live in over Star Trek? Apart from a slice of life or a power fantasy, the only alternative I can see is to have a protagonist who is insane/very deeply flawed i.e., one who constantly makes suboptimal choices

  In the post on [rational stories in a realistic setting](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/h7rkyi/considering_rational_stories_in_a_realistic/) I mentioned [The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goal_(novel)) as an example of non-genre or realistic rational fiction. Some people started reading it, so I thought I'd put a qualified recommendation in here.

  The book is designed to teach some very specific considerations in engineering management and logistics, specifically giving attention to the bottleneck parts of systems. That seems sort of obvious, but the book does a good job of demonstrating situations in which one is easily distracted from attention to a bottleneck. I've occasionally found the model useful in my own, mostly unrelated work (managing technical pedagogy). It was written in the 80s and some of the social mores are dated, though I personally like reading books from that era because they're in an interesting uncanny valley, really similar to us but odd in surprising ways. But a consideration if the background misogyny in that period really bothers you.

  [The Phoenix Project](https://itrevolution.com/book/the-phoenix-project/) tries to be The Goal for software development, though I haven't yet read it. I'd be curious to hear about more fiction in this explicitly pedagogical tradition, as it seems pretty rare. In the future I'll do a rec post on utopian fiction, or fiction specifically associated with how society is structured. Thomas More's /Utopia/ is the obvious here but I think the sub would be interested in, for example, /Looking Backward: 2000–1887/, which is a utopian vision of how society could be organized from the beginning of the 20th century, and there's a ton in that genre that would be of interest to some here.

    TPP is an interesting one, it’s more of a memetic weapon than a book.

    If you’re a dev or IT worker and happen to agree with the message, buy a copy for your manager/teammates/team leader and it will do the hard work of dragging them towards your viewpoint.

    It uses a whole bunch of tricks, like giving every type of reader a path to agreeing with it without having to admit more than a token amount of fault for their past actions.

    It puts you in the shoes of lots of stakeholders, teaching you to empathise with them.

    It tries to get you to stop think of departments as tribes, instead encouraging all the departments to form a super “us vs. the baddies” tribe.

    It slams you over the head again and again with an Umbridge-esque villain who you definitely wouldn’t want to think of yourself as being like, would you?

    It keeps you in a constant state of anxiety, making you want to keep reading until things get better. Like the first Endbringer fight in Worm, but it’s the whole book.

    All of that plus like a dozen other tricks.

  Hey, I'm looking for some litrpg recommendations, preferably web novels. The longer the better and pls only stories or translations with good grammar. If it's within the first 15 pages of RR active only ranking i've probably already read it.
  ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    I have a few webnovels that I've liked over my journeys across RR and various wordpress stories. There's a bunch of stuff here that's just meh, but there are a few good ones as well.

    * Delve and Ar'Kendrythist are both about equally good imo. They're the best in litrpg I've found in RR. Both have great three dimensional characters and interesting, crunchy magic. Ar'Kendrythist is much longer, and has a bit more slice of life. They both start similarly but diverge wildly from there.

    * Wake of the Ravager is sorta litrpg. Lots of comedy, makes me laugh most chapters. The use of magic is good too, and it's really interesting with the mutations.

    * Infinite Realm: Monsters & Legends is a well done fusion of cultivation and litrpg. Follows multiple main characters, all of whom seem to be well written, although most people seem to like Ryun the most.

    * [The Gamer](https://chyoa.com/story/The-Gamer%2C-Chyoa-edition.12004) on chyoa.com is an erotica inspired by the manwha of the same name. I recommend neo_kenka's route, since it's both long and tackles some interesting themes (for an erotica). I've recommended it before on this account [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/fw0ar9/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/fmnd23v/).

    * [Forged Destiny](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12044591/1/Forged-Destiny) is a litrpg rwby AU, but it's so alternate that imo it's better off being an original series, because there's nothing similar to rwby here other than character names and some concepts. Completed at 1.1 million words.

    * The Snake Report is one of the earlier original English raincarnated-as-a-monster novels in RR. Pretty good and funny, although on hiatus right now.

    * The Scourged Earth has one of the most interesting system apocalypses. Currently on hiatus.

    * Magik Online has some really cool magic, goes from street tier all the way to astronomical. On hiatus but ends at a nice note.

    * Friendly Neighborhood Necromancer has the mc transmigrate to the world of the mmorpg he plays as his preferred class. Really chill slice of life, with the occasional murderhobo rampage. Currently on hiatus.

    * Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash has a bunch of b-tier adventurers struggle to survive in a typical isekai world after being transmigrated. Sorta litrpg I guess? I didn't stick with it beyond volume 13, but it was decent.

    * Change: New World is one of the earlier system apocalypse stories. Abandoned, I think. 

    * Reborn: Apocalypse is also a litrpg fused with cultivation. First two books are awesome, third book was equal parts awesome and a letdown (in terms of pacing, although stuff does happen). Sorta like Death Note in a xianxia setting.

    [Trickster's Luck](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28049/tricksters-luck) is my favourite, and I don't *think* it's in the top rankings? (Though it should be; in my opinion it's extremely underrated.) VR LitRPG, quite long already and only promises to be significantly more so. Very detailed and well-written, very well thought out, with likeable characters and some extremely compelling mysteries. Can't recommend it enough.

  A while back I asked for recommendations regarding how societies fall apart and are put back together and someone recommended [Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/475.Collapse).  I finished it recently and I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in the environmental pressure points of how society functions.  He does a great job of laying out five key factors that can contribute to collapse.  

  1. Natural Climate Change
  2. Man-made climate disaster
  3. Friendly neighbors
  4. Unfriendly neighbors 
  5. The political ability of a society to diagnose and act to solve it's problems

  It was really fascinating to see those factors play out in societies I'd never heard of before.  From that perspective, it also wasn't a bad whirlwind history tour.  As a final bonus, it was written in the early 2000s, so there is absolutely no discussion of modern politics.

  On the flip side, I wanted to ask recommendations for/against [Legend of the Galactic Heroes](https://myanimelist.net/anime/820/Ginga_Eiyuu_Densetsu).  I've heard it's one of the most impressive space politics anime out there, with intelligent characters and complicated moral positions. Most people who watch it seem to rave about it.  On the other hand, it's very long, arguably dry, and somewhat hard to track down without sailing the high seas.  Anyone want to say it is or is not worth watching?
  ```

  - u/EdenicFaithful:
    ```
    Strong recommend, but I wouldn't oversell its maturity. It is relatively intelligent, but what LoGH excels at is inspiring characters and great conversations that are simply a pleasure to listen to. The quality of politics and strategy is inconsistent, though they do hit some notable highs that make it all worth it. Expect the occasional silly strategy and dumb politician to mar an otherwise great experience.

    I wouldn't describe it as dry. After the slow start its one of those things that one binge watches because he can't resist after the end of an episode. I would recommend watching at least until around episode 25. Tragedy, boldness and smooth storytelling come together pretty well.

  I'm looking for stories where the main character has a "tanky" build. This could be anything from being a tank class in a litrpg, or a guy with deadpool-like regeneration, or a mage with defense and healing oriented spells, etc. Basically, I'm looking to see how people with lots of self-healing ability use their powers well. Examples:


  * [ An Exercise in Stupidity](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13067349/1/An-Exercise-in-Stupidity) has a gamer mc that goes full tank/blood mage. Stupidly high health and regeneration, combined with some potent blood magic. Fun stuff.

  * Defiance of the Fall on royalroad has a character whose highest stat ends up being endurance, which of course leads to lots of abuse on his body. Fun cultivation stuff.

    You might enjoy the [Daniel Black](https://www.amazon.com/Fimbulwinter-Daniel-Black-Book-1-ebook/dp/B00KZ41LHM) series. 

    The main character gets summoned to an alternate Europe on the verge of Ragnarok to serve as a protector for one of the last worshipers of one of the Greek gods, who had been defeated by the Norse pantheon many years ago. The process of being summoned across realities allows him to gain access to several powerful magics one of which is a healing power, and he often ends up needing it. 

    I will say though, that while the fights are good and the world-building is interesting the books have (what feels to me) like a gratuitous amount of sex scenes and the author is a bit of an edgelord with some not-so-great politics. It wasn't enough to ruin my enjoyment of the series, but it did have me rolling my eyes more than once.

    * story focuses on the MC being a child, consequently dragging on without getting to a point where the MC can be really influential   
    * focuses on the sale of 'advanced' cosmetics; cosmetics become instantly popular without culture clash or going out of fashion   
    * (YMMV) love interest is a child the same physical age (but obviously not the same mental age) as the OC (it's no Mushoku Tensei, but still).  

    It's obviously wish fulfilment, which, fine, it's actually a bad thing, but if the novels are anything like the manga I wouldn't recommend it.

  Anyone have any rational first contact/alien appearance fics, particularly benevolent or ambiguous ones?

  Just caught up on the Last Angel and some friendly xenos not spreading omnipresent fascistic regimes would be nice.

    You might enjoy [Psi Effect](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/psi-effect-me-xcom-thread-2-rise-of-the-party-boat.307972/). It's a series of stories set in a Mass Effect/XCOM crossover universe.

    The basic premise is that Humanity encountered Mass Effect's Citadel Races *after* defeating the alien aggressors in the XCOM series. The storyline is mainly told from the perspective of the Citadel Races making first contact with a mysterious, possibly benevolent (but often terrifying) alien civilization - i.e. Humanity.

    In my opinion the author has a flair for exploring the culture clashes between alien races on both the personal and the broader societal level. The story also does a great job of demonstrating the strategic thinking of each side.

    Birds of a Feather is a .solid. fic w/ Hermione in Tom's year. Tom is slightly softened as a result, but still definitely on the eviler end of neutral, but that's kinda necessarily a consequence of rational evil doers? If you run with the whole: evil is less I want everyone to suffer, and more, I don't care if people suffer in the pursuit of my goals, sorta thing.

    I think you will be disappointed looking for stories like this, because there's very little story there that is accessible to our experience: The best explanation in this can be found in Iceman's cautions about writing from CelesteAI's perspective for optimalverse fanfiction.  Some stories that might  work, but without the HPMOR skin are:  Accelerando which points in that direction,  universal paperclips which has it as a plotpoint for it's infinite recursion,  the last question, and Death's End (third book of three body problem), and the Causaul Angel.  Pretty much all of these involve some fade to black, though there is some (very little) physics porn for the solutions in the last two.

    The Waves Arisen explores self-duplication wonderfully.

    Magik Online has an arc with this concept as a backdrop, not *that* rational but it was enjoyable enough.

  I read something called Super Minion which may not be that rational but is a rationalist work. The setting is broadly superheroish, clearly worm inspired but doesn't have the same themes. It's set in the future but might as well be an alternate world. Every few years an event called "Odd Summer" occurs, during the three or so months odd things happen with often world altering consequences, superpowers and mutations being the more reliable occurances. It follows an initially unnamed bioweapon prototype in a lab undergoing testing/training. It consists of a biomechanical core surrounded by nanite filled flesh, it's powerset could be described as being like Prototype but if Alex Mercer had to adhere roughly to the laws of physics and biology. The nanites aren't Von Newman machines by design and self destruct if disconnected from the core for more than half a second or so along with any cells. This weapon has a powerfull but very simple inteligence, over time it has reasoned from available information that since the tests have gone on for as long as it knows and show no sign of stopping that it will eventually die in one of the tests, it realizes something needs to change but that's the limit of it's capacity for abstract thought, it's incapable of coming up with entirely novel ideas like escape. With this in mind when it's contacted from an unknown source sending the file "human.exe" it accepts and runs it considering the high risk lower than the alternative not doing so and continuing as things are. I like how it justifies the MC's humanish behavior but simultaneously serves as a sort of deconstruction, it treats the brain as a tool of thought, an incredibly useful and powerful one but a tool nevertheless, for example at one point it has an impulse to tell someone trusted it's true nature but on the core level it decides against it as it's a purposeless risk and has no clear reasoning behind it to verify. I also like how it tries to generalize from known information and often reaches strange or flawed conclusions from limited information, such as spending much of the story modeling humans as a sort of eusocial insect. I also like the MC's endless confusion over the almost pathalogical obsession humanity seems to have with rectangles.

  Do any of you have recommendations for some decent Planswalker fanfics that are either ongoing or have at least one major plotline completed? I don't expect anything fully rationalist, but something a fan of this subreddit would enjoy that lacks most of the pitfalls like idiot balls, lack of understanding or care for the settings used and so on would be appreciated.

  I'll give one as well: [That First Step](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/that-first-step-si.5342/) (and subsequent books) by Hiver. An SI with a massive case of amnesia lands in the world of WarCraft. Slowly he finds out that his magic is very unusual.

  I actually never read beyond the first couple of books and the plot goes relatively slowly, seeming like more of a slice of life story at first. I still enjoyed it and felt like it did what it tried to do well enough.

    I almost hesitate to rec this because it's rough around the edges, almost explicitly irrational and often veers into [crackfic] territory, but it's enjoyable enough that I'm still following it, so here it is: [Kill Them All](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/kill-them-all-worm-gamer.830187/), A Worm/The Gamer crossover - when E88 gang members kill her father, Taylor decides to use her LITRPG powers to kill all 800 of them in retribution. 

    The reason it matches your request is that she can absorb a weaker version of any capes power after she defeats them, and eventually she gets the ability to planeswalk to different universes and they come to feature prominently in the story. The universes she goes to are all fictional universes and include(in approximate order) >!Silent Hill!<, >!Resident Evil!<, >!The Road!<, >!Hellsing!<, >!Marvel Cinematic Universe!<, and finally (and currently)>!Star Trek!<. I like that the despite Taylor's power level rising steadily chapter by chapter and her being able to wipe the floor with various big bads from aforementioned universes, she's still no where near close enough to beat most of the big bads in the wormverse. I dislike how it's full of plot holes(>!she can read minds and she still doesn't know about cauldron and artificial powers?!!<) and not very internally consistent(thus: proto-crackfic powerwank). 

    Verdict: nothing special, but a decent enough power wank that updates 3k word chapters almost every day.
    ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      From the description it doesn't sound like what I'm looking for. I am less interested in the power wank aspect and more in the disparate people dealing with the situation of being in a foreign universe and being confronted with inexplicable magical powers.

      Also by planswalker I kind of meant specifically the MTG variety, though if the story is actually good I'm also okay with other stuff.

        > I am less interested in the power wank aspect

        It's probably not your cup of tea, then, honestly. The last couple of dozen chapters have veered almost entirely into crack with the MC being entirely OP and fixing things *her way* rather than exploring other people's side of things.

  I know this is late, but I'm wondering if there's any interesting original fiction that's poly slice of life, that actually has intelligent characters who talk to each other, and doesn't have too much artificial drama. Suggestions?
  ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    What do you mean by poly slice of life exactly? 

    Spice and Wolf is an enjoyable but slow romance between a merchant and a pagan godess. Some artificial drama but it gets solved pretty quickly.

    A long way to a small angry planet and its sequel are both mostly slice of life, and have minimal drama. It's more about how sapients across different species can be nice to one another.

    - u/ramjet_oddity:
      ```
      A slice of life fic involving polyamorous romances.
      ```

      - u/CaramilkThief:
        ```
        Ah. The only thing I've read close to that is [The Demon Lord's Lover](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20243/the-demon-lords-lover). It's more a fluffy romantic comedy than say slice of life, but there is plenty of that too. 

        There's also The Daily Grind, although it's more action-y.

        Other than that haven't really seen much polyamory done in fiction.
        ```
