## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You are a team of hunters sent by the King to attempt to capture a powerful magical creature. 

  The Contrary Boar. The CB is in most respects a ordinary boar, which is dangerous enough on its own, but what sets the CB apart is its magical ability. The creature will use sympathic magic to forge a link with the mental model of itself in the heads of any creature within half a kilometre. It will then proceed to do something unexpected. This means for instance that if you attempt to ambush it will not walk into the trap, you shoot arrows at it it will dodge. If all options are covered by people within its range, then it will take the option that is most inconvenient for your plan. The boar is capable of both outrunning a person and outfighting most as well, unless you are prepared for that scenario. 

  Unfortunately, the forest elves who live in the area are willing to let you hunt the CB but you must ensure that any trap will not hurt other wild animals and they would prefer you do this by monitoring it.

  The abilities of the boar are not well known, and you can hire other hunters to carry out any plan you conceive. So, how do you  capture the boar
  ```

    ```
    Obvious: Its a boar. Leave tranquilizer laced truffles or other pig favored food in wicker baskets. Wicker wont stop a boar, but it will stop most other animals (and if a bear eats your trap, it wont kill the bear) Leave the area. 

    Now there is noone there for the boar to be contrary at - baskets dont think. So it will eat one. Walk back in, check baskets, haul sleeping boar out. To guard against the boar being extra clever, dont tell the basket droppers why they are dropping baskets.
    ```

  - u/jaspercb:
    ```
    Set up some crazy Rube Goldberg-style trap that relies on continued and improbable action from the boar - something that relies on the boar navigating a maze, then solving a puzzle, some chain of events that nobody in their right mind would expect the boar to complete. Then (being sure to keep everyone aware of the plan outside a 0.5km radius) hire a hunter who isn't aware of the boar's magical properties and tell him that he's there to note if any wild animals complete the challenge successfully. Keep him there until the boar, being maximally contrary, completes the challenge and is trapped.

    You probably have the time to build this trap within a 0.5km radius of the boar, so build it somewhere else then, again, give a solitary hunter reason to believe that he can keep the hunter away from the maze. Evict everyone else from a 0.5km radius. Let the boar do its thing.

    Alternate solution: Depending on how suggestible the boar is, hypnosis might be useful?
    ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    Here's the least-efficient plan, so people can think of smarter ones.

    I put a sizeable bounty on the boar's head. The boar is capable of outrunning and outfighting individuals, but eventually it's going to collapse from exhaustion. Plus, I can use the local peasantry for the plan, which is likely cheaper than hiring hunters.
    ```

        Well they're not animals (as the elves would define it), so I'm sticking to the letter of the law, if not the spirit.

    What i would do is to make a bet with some people, so I'll say that i can make a bear walk into a cage on its own, and I'll bet some money, the other people who bet i cant do that, I'll bring them to within range of Bear, where their belief that the bear will not (should not, please don't) walk into the cage, lo and behold, the bear walks into the cage. Note that the people should bet money on the Bear not walking onto the cage, and as it does that, they'll reinforce the Bear as they wish that it not walk into the cage.

  First time doing this and posting on this sub (long time lurker though) sorry if my post doesn't follow any unwritten rules.

  You are a low level Empath, you can see people's emotions and have the ability to persuade at least 2 people into doing anything you want at least once every 3 days (can be the same person two times, but that's your limit), requests must be relatively simple (no more than 2 'actions' per request). The downside of your power is that social interactions that become overwhelmingly negative or cause a lot of unrest take a toll on your mind/body and since you don't want to be an outcast you have to try and deescalate these situations. Also, keep in mind that people absolutely should not know that you're an Empath.

  You're at a birthday party, you are very close to the host. Over the course of the party you start to feel the downsides of your power even thought everything seems to be relatively normal at a single glance. However upon paying more attention you notice the following scenarios:

  * You are outside the house, talking with the host and two other close friends. There is also another group nearby, consisting of 3 females and 7 males, since you don't really know them and they all seem to know each other, you leave them be. As soon as someone comes outside (a female close friend of the host and yours) you see the group go inside the house, this action is prompted by one of the females of the group and everyone seems to follow her. Your power tells you that there is a certain enmity coming from that one girl, and frustration from the other. This 'interaction' seems to repeat every time one of them goes inside/outside the house.

  * You feel 'dangerous' emotions coming from three other guests that aren't particularly talking to anyone, they talk to other people every once in a while, but mostly keep to themselves. However, whenever the host is nearby these emotions of anger seem to increase.

  * A couple seems to be arguing at the back of the house but no one at the party wants to do anything about it. Your power tells you three things: The first one is that whoever pays attention to them has feelings of indifference (but this you know, due to hearing comments like 'they're at it again'). The second one is that every once in a while a faint feeling of danger comes from both people. The third one is that even though you can only see two people arguing, your power tells you that there are three people over there and no one (other than you) seems to be aware of this third party's existence.

  How would you "fix" this birthday party without disrupting it, given your somewhat limited powers?

  Things to keep in mind: Age range is between 20 and 25. This is a small party between people that (barely) know each other, so no hard drugs or the like are involved. Avoid violence at all costs and anything too outrageous like setting the house on fire unless you don't mind being mentally crippled for a few years. Also this should be obvious but the requests/suggestions must be things that people are actually capable of doing, you are only manipulating their feelings and their disposition towards you, it's not real magic. People will remember any requests you make, so be careful (or at least not too obvious).

  Bonus Round: Three days before the party, you made two requests from one of your close friends that will also be going to the party. You made these requests because the host has a somewhat eccentric personality and there is always some kind of drama that must be deescalated.

  What requests do you make and how can they help you with "fixing" the party?

  Things to keep in mind: Conditional of the request takes one of the two action slots (In three days you will... swim naked in the pool) also you can chain a request from another request but it takes an action slot too. You can activate previously set requests at will if the conditional is fulfilled. Close friend chosen can't be the female one from first situation (let's just say she's not around before the party, gotta keep it fair).

      I know you meant it as a joke, but I think this stereotype is harmful to the rational community. Sure, some of us are proverbial neckbeards living in our proverbial parents' basement, but most of us are normal, well-adjusted adults. 

      An example of the sort of damage that the stereotype does: I used to be extremely active in the atheist community and towards the end of my high activity (~2013) we started to really struggle to get women especially but people in general interested because the neckbeard / fedora / anti-feminist stereotype became so entrenched. And we were a campus atheist club that had a leadership panel full of dyed in the wool feminist SJWs. It got to the point where we put a "no fedoras" sign on our stalls to stop people making fun of us.

            I mean, do you have a citation or something? I wouldn't count myself as a normal, well-adjusted adult, but maybe some survey says otherwise.

            - u/MagicWeasel:
              ```
              My experience in the general rationalist sort of community has been as much. Some weirdos but no more than I encountered in say, Roller Derby. A subreddit-wide survey would be interesting but the slatestarcodex and lesswrong surveys are also pretty good sources. The aggregate data of those seems to indicate that the average person is an adult and reasonably well-adjusted, FWIW. "Normal" in the context I used it here meant, basically, "not an autistic neckbeard stereotype" rather than "completely average in every way". 

              Yeah, the rational community is more intelligent and atheist and maybe more autistic than average but we're not... like, even 10% of the way to being aliens trying to understand the human emotion called love.

        I wanted to ask, since I have never done much research about it, do atheists deny the existence of any higher beings? or only the existence of higher beings that were invented by us like the christian god and the like?

        Do you deny the existence of life that could perhaps be capable of creating universes? what about beings existing in a higher plane or dimension than us? or is it that you merely won't accept their possible existence until there's any tangible proof of it?

        What about the theories of life as we know it being merely a simulation inside some kind of supercomputer? From your point of view is that hypothetical supercomputer the same as God or an higher being?

        Sorry if these things seem obvious or evident, i'm a bit ignorant when it comes to anything religion related. My brain tells me that you simply don't 'believe' in things blindly and until we don't have proof of something it simply does not exist. But is something whose proof of existence we don't posses necessarily not real? I mean, there's more to the universe than the "light" that reaches us, it's not like the universe stops at the edge of the observable universe... but then again we don't really have much proof of that either.

        >It got to the point where we put a "no fedoras" sign on our stalls to stop people making fun of us. 

        This will sound a bit fallacious (and might come out wrong) but would these people that can't get past stupid memes and stereotypes be of any use to you? I'm not trying to rationalize or comfort you mind you, i'm just merely saying that if someone can't get past a shallow concept like stereotypes, then they might be even less prepared to change their way of thinking and/or their beliefs.
        ```

        - u/MagicWeasel:
          ```
          >do atheists deny the existence of any higher beings? or only the existence of higher beings that were invented by us like the christian god and the like?

          Depends on the atheist and your definition of higher being, I guess. I don't think any atheist I know would deny that there are likely aliens with better technology than ours (and I know *quite a few* from being highly active in the community  from ~2006-2013 and moderately active since---I've been to two "global atheist conventions", organised and spoken at student events including one where celebrities such as Daniel Dennett and Richard Dawkins were special guests, attended creationist talks, etc).  

          > or is it that you merely won't accept their possible existence until there's any tangible proof of it?

          Basically, yeah. But I want to be very clear: many christians will jump from this to saying "since you think it's *not impossible* that an alien in another universe created the earth, then it's totally reasonable to believe that [violence exists because people listened to a talking snake once](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_and_Eve#Eden_narrative_(the_Fall\))". 

          Also, the word "higher dimensions" - what do you actually mean by that? My husband's a pure mathematician who is interested in higher dimensional geometry and the word "dimension" as used in science-fiction basically... doesn't have any sort of "real" meaning.

          > From your point of view is that hypothetical supercomputer the same as God or an higher being?

          The hypothetical supercomputer didn't come into being [after another supercomputer assembled the parts of her murdered supercomputer husband](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horus), so no.

          > But is something whose proof of existence we don't posses necessarily not real?

          No, just like the platypus still existed before Western scientists had a stuffed specimen sent to them. But of all the strange beasts imagined in mythology, the platypus was not one of them, and it was the strangest beast that turned out to be real. 

          But there's a huge difference between "maybe we're in a supercomputer isn't that interesting" and "i can't know everything therefore I am going to [name my child with a name starting with the first letter of the first page i open the holy book to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhism#Ceremonies_and_customs)". 

          >  would these people that can't get past stupid memes and stereotypes be of any use to you

          Maybe we could be of use to them? 

          Besides, the "no fedoras" sign was to appeal to people like myself: people who are interested in atheism, science, and skepticism but who are afraid of joining a group that is on the "wrong side" of the "we-need-feminism/feminism-is-no-longer-needed" divide. It's signalling where we fall, that we a sense of humour, etc.

          It was also to be funny and because passers by the previous year had jeered fedora jokes at us. May as well laugh with them, right?

  How would you extract a human from a hostile earth?

  You: in the asteroid belt with plenty of mass, energy, and manufacturing capability, but no fusion torches. No new physics.

  A human: about 60 kilos of meat and gristle. Usual problems with acceleration, temperature, and pressure. Location/identity known to you but not hostile groundhogs.

  A hostile earth: 1g surface acceleration, couple hundred klicks of atmosphere, modern tech. Locals wish to shoot you, but can't strike past LEO. They will settle for shooting your human if they identify them.

  Hard mode: no threatening the civilian population.

    What do you mean with "plenty"? Can I build a few hundred thousand modules capable of landing, taking on board one passenger and returning to the asteroid belt (possibly refueling both on ground and in orbit from yet more modules)? I.e. a bit like a one-man version of Elon Musk's BFR, with off-road landing gear.  

    And then send them all at the same time, essentially saturating Earth's defenses (bundled up in a black-painted radar-deflecting stealth shell for the approach to make it extremely unlikely to be detected until days or weeks before landfall). 

    The landers would carefully spread out across Earth or at least the continent to avoid identifying "my" human, and to make sure that all the known defenses are busy shooting down nonessential pods. They would all land and take off, just like the one carrying "my" human. There are no weapons, just flares, radar jamming, etc on the pods. The only damage to Earth is the wrecks shot down, and possibly brush fires started where pods land, although dry areas will be avoided when possible.

    Once the human is secured in orbit, the remaining pods would return with it, acting as decoys (or shields) to prevent any rapidly developed or unknown weapons from reaching the human.

      You can build all the modules you want, but remember that a chemical rocket that can even make orbit from Earth needs to be a thing the size of a skyscraper with the mass fraction of a soda can, at the point of leaving the surface. The BFR plan works for Mars because Mars is much smaller, needing less than half the dV you would on Earth to get to orbit. Aerobraking and soft landing something the size of an orbital rocket from a flyby trajectory would be extremely exciting.

    There is no stealth in space is the main problem, with the secondary problem being that your extractee is squishy and easy to shoot. So.. Sending a lander that can take off is just going to be way too obvious, which makes rendevous dangerous. Uhm. Okay, lets keep it simple: We drop something valuable. A *small* lander will not trip the meteor warning systems the way a full spacecraft would. 

    A high-quality fake painting, 70 kilos of gold. Whatever seems best for not being obviously "cash transfer from the sky".  Also in care package: 
    High-grade Fissiles. Now we build a *fission* torch ship.

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fission-fragment_rocket.

    Using a fission fragment reactor to heat reaction mass will let you build a high-thrust engine with ridiculus isp. It does not even have to expel the fragments - you can convert the output of the reactor to (a gigawatt of) electricity and use an electric arc to heat reaction mass to ten-thousand  kelvin with no radioactive release to the environment. This is a single-stage to earth-escape velocity design, and the best part is? Noone will flag most of the stuff you are buying as rocket parts. You are obviously doing a bunch of work with plasma and magnets, but that should not raise flags
    ```

    - u/buckykat:
      ```
      On the one hand, there's no stealth in space. On the other hand, every few months NASA announces they discovered a new dino-killer class asteroid just as it whipped by closer than the moon.

      A fission fragment rocket would be able to do the launch, but you won't just be obviously doing a bunch of work with plasma and magnets, but also obviously doing a bunch of work with fissionables, which is one of those things that draws international attention real quick.

      Unfortunately, running a fission fragment rocket in someone's atmosphere is pretty fucking threatening. And electric arcjet rockets sacrifice TWR for their high Isp.

  You cannot see into the future, instead, you taste into the future. Any food you eat can be tasted exactly 5 seconds before it enters your mouth. Food currently in your mouth has no flavor because the flavor is sent back in time.

  The future is not predestined, so if you taste spoiled milk while bringing a cup to your face, you can choose not to take a drink and the flavor will go away.

  What do you do with this?
  ```

  - u/ben_oni:
    ```
    Step one, increase the time messages can be sent back.

    1. Think of a yes-or-no question you want answered. Something to which the answer will be available in an hour or so.

    2. Prepare two different things to eat, say Hot Tamales and Sour Patch Kids. Hot means "yes", Sour means "no". Commit to eating one as soon as you taste it (less than five seconds later) *or* as soon as you have the answer to the question from part 1.

    If your careful, you might be able to send messages back up to 12 hours. And once you have an answer to one question, you can immediately commit to another question, allowing you to get any number of answers from 12 hours in the future in a very short time.

    ---

    Suppose we are searching for some very large number that satisfies some condition. We'll write it out in binary. We'll use flavored lollipops this time.

    Every five seconds, we'll write out one of the digits of the number.

    * (*Acceptance*) If we taste Hot, write a '1', if we taste Sour, write a '0'.
    * * In either case, check the previous digit. '0': eat Sour; '1': eat Hot. (Ignore this for the first digit.)
    * (*Rejection*) If we don't taste anything, check the previous digit. '0': eat Hot; '1': eat Sour. Write a '0'.

    When we've finished writing out the number see if it satisfies the condition. If yes, check the last digit: if it's '0', eat Sour, if '1' eat Hot. If the number does not match the condition, eat nothing.

    We now have an efficient method of cracking encryption, passwords, etc.

        I wouldn't work too hard on that rant if I were you. Anything concerning time-travel and time loops is absurd, by it's nature. The rules only exist for narrative purposes. If you want to develop rules for a proposed story, the Worldbuilding Thread is over there, somewhere.

        In a single consistent timeline system, any message received from the future must eventually be sent back. In such a system, I'd agree that I'm optimizing for the wrong thing. Maybe instead of tasting one of the pre-determined signals, I'd taste blood, be so surprised that I bite my tongue and start bleeding. What's that signal supposed to mean?

        But the proposed system is for a multiple time-line scenario. I'm not optimizing for self-consistency: I'm actually brute-forcing a search by branching the timelines until I find the solution.

        I admit that I'm making an assumption that wasn't specifically stated: I assume that every time I put something on my tongue, it sends the taste back five seconds, thereby branching the timeline. I'm not sure that's how it's actually meant to work, but it's my best guess.

    One question I have for you. If I put food in my mouth and have it in a container which I could break harmlessly with my teeth could I extend the future predictions for as long as I keep it in my mouth?

    One somewhat useful ability is that you can detect any poison with a taste, which makes it slightly harder to poison you. 

    A second option would be to have a container in your month that would break if you are attacked. Then you have a few seconds warning 

    The issue with this is that while you could carry around a number of essences with notably different tastes to make a language, you can only send information 5 seconds back in time. The best option I can see is find some gambling that pays out in five seconds with quick betting, have something noticeable to eat that has a distinctive taste and precommit to swig if you win. Its better if a taste means bet because if no taste means go you might get a false positive if something stops you drinking. Try disguising it as drinking a glass of alcohol in celebration
