## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

    This may not be particularly helpful, but I just wanted to say that I personally think you've already thought this out in enough detail that defining it any further probably won't be useful.

    Unless economics is a specific focus of the plot (meaning you'll be describing business deals in detail) I'd say you already have enough written here to more or less explain how the economy works.

    If you describe ninja as a limited energy resource protected by secrecy and maybe physical aptitude (meaning not everyone has the potential to become a ninja), then you already have an economy that more or less functions on similar principles to the real world.

    Unless it's important to the plot, I wouldn't worry about all the little details until they become relevant. But as I said, this might not be helpful advice if your main focus is actually economic issues. In which case I would ask, "What specifically do you need help defining?" Because you seem to have provided a reasonable answer to every question you ask in the above post.
    ```

      I see your point. I'm devoting energy to these questions because I don't want plot holes developing along the way, inconsistencies that I didn't notice, etc. I'm close to satisfied with the level of detail I've developed, but still figuring out some stuff regarding current balance of power in Elemental Nations.
      ```

    There's a few questions you should think about:

    1. Are you sticking with canon tech levels? That includes wireless headsets, cell phones, satellites, and computers, but according to WOG it does NOT include firearms or explosives. This makes absolutely no sense, so you've got your work cut out for you if you want to rationalize it. We went with "forget it, it's pretty much all feudal tech."
    1. Given your chosen tech level, how easy is it for civilians to travel? Is there trade? Common currency? Standard weights and measures?
    1. Do jutsu create real matter, or is that (rock from an Earth Wall / water from a Wild Wave Wall / etc) just a construct that sublimates after a while? If it's just a construct then that will significantly reduce the impact that ninja can have on society. 
    1. What about energy? Does a raiton jutsu create electrons ex nihilo, does it move them from the surroundings, or is raiton energy not actually electricity? How hot are the flames from fire jutsu? Again, this has a big impact on how much uplift a ninja can provide. 
    1. How many ninja are there? How many civilians?
    1. What percentage of ninja are genin / chunin / jounin / S-rank?
    1. Why do ninja not run everything? There's at least two possibilities: they do, or they don't because they choose not to. Reasons they might choose not to: the Sage said not to and they are loyal to his teachings. They see themselves as the "thin black line" protecting civilian society and that honor and esprit de corps keep them from staging a coup. There is a powerful force preventing it. (What force?) The answer may be different in different countries, of course.
    1. What about the bizarre parts of canon? Are you considering the filler episodes to be canon? (aka "are there actually chakra ostriches?") Did Mist actually have a purge of bloodline owners? Why? Did they have a training program that involved killing a fellow student to graduate, thereby cutting their available manpower in half compared to other nations? Why?  Did Konoha actually think that Naruto was the Fox and treat him like dirt? Did the Hokage let them away with it?

    Naruto is a great setting, but it's about the least rational thing I've ever read. If you want to come up with a rational version you're going to have your work cut out for you. I look forward to reading what you come up with, though. Good luck!
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I will post a longer reply when I have a computer, but first, thanks for the advice. I've thought about most, but not all, the questions you've listed, and your fic and quest are definitely on my mind in planning stage.

      I'm trying to preserve Naruto canon more than you did, I think, though there are some AU changes I will probably make. I will probably make chakra created constructs permanent, partially because I think it makes the setting very different from real life in an interesting way. In canon it seems like chakra created water dissapears, but wood doesn't, so it's a little inconsistent.

      I'm still thinking about ninja talent/power distribution. I'll probably end with roughly canon levels of power: S class are an order of magnitude (at least) above skilled Jounin (Kakashi and Gai transition to S so it muddles a bit), Jounin can take on many Chunin, and Chunin can take on multiple Genin. Though there are exceptions and complications: some S class are area of effect focused, like Deidara, Onoki, Nagato, Sannin with boss summons, some S class fall at the other end-- they're hero killers like Itachi, Minato, Raikage, arguably Sasuke. So there's lots of interesting combat to play around with even within the broad confines of rough 'power/abillity tiers'.


      Ninja numbers will be canon, roughly, though not as many as the Shinobi World War arc implied. Admittedly, the World War arc had TONS of fodder ninja dying left and right, so maybe I just need to drastically revise my estimates of Genin proportion up.

      I've been thinking a lot about the philosophy of Naruto and Sasuke. I want to keep the conflicting ideals of the original but without reducing either to caricature. There's probably gonna be lots of allusions to Hobbes, Rousseau, and Locke in my fix xD

  Two ideas I've been playing around with are rational!Star Wars and rational!Bleach. I know there have been threads about both on this sub in the past, but I haven't been able to find any stories that resulted from them, which makes me sad.

  The main things I'd really appreciate some smart people's input on are:

  - In Bleach, why doesn't anyone tell the world of the living about the afterlife?

  Presumably it would be better for the living to be aware of Hollows and trying to develop ways to detect and fight them. At the very least, hand out mod-soul pills to mortals with high spiritual energy and train them to fight as a secondary security force to avert disaster until a shinigami can show up. The best explanation I've come up with so far is that Hollows are attracted to strong spiritual energy and strong negative emotions, e.g. fear, especially if those emotions are *directed at Hollows*. Telling untrained people therefore becomes a memetic hazard, and training someone without educating them also puts them at risk by making them juicier targets.

  - In Bleach, why is everyone in the afterlife using swords and generally medieval technology?

  TBH I'm tempted to turn the afterlife into a high tech utopia (dystopia?) given that they can have millions of brilliant scientists collaborating for centuries. Alternatively, maybe physics is borked a la "Unsong", and they have to rely on magic to cover for technology being unreliable.

  - In Star Wars, should the force be Manton-limited, i.e. can a Sith snap your brainstem with a thought?

  Making the force less powerful makes munchkinism more rewarding, but making it more powerful (or more rare, but that's kind of separate) does more to explain why people respect/fear it so much.

  - In Star Wars, what's the closest I can get to recreating lightsabers?

  They make no goddamn sense in canon, but it doesn't feel like it's Star Wars anymore if I drop them and just have all force users be Numberman-tier snipers. Maybe using the force to wield clouds of plasma..?
  ```

  - u/Escapement:

    Some thoughts on Bleach. (Note that I have seen about ~100 episodes of Bleach or so, and haven't read much of the Manga at all, and have been exposed to a bunch of fanon.) That all said, a few thoughts based on my understanding:

    - Dead people stick around in Soul Society for a very long time aging extremely slowly. This means that plausibly the majority of the population of Soul Society is probably from 1800 or earlier. 
    - Also, most souls don't seem to need to eat unless they have very high spiritual energy. This means that the agricultural revolution is probably unnecessary and not strongly driven economically, and drives to modernize to produce more food would be either absent or decreased. 
    - All the scientists who've died would be dispersed among a huge population, and there seems to be suggestions somewhere that people forget their past lives when entering Soul Society (unsure if this particular point is canon or fanon). 
    - People age very slowly and tend to stick around forever, so there's plausibly less advancement of arts via generational changeover. 
    - Finally, training everyone to use swords makes a great deal of sense when your soul's form materializes as a melee weapon that gives you magical abilities; training everyone in riflery when their souls don't become rifles that grant magical powers seems like a waste of time. I think the vast majority of Shinigami etc get melee weapon stuff, and ranged stuff is not unknown but much rarer and tends to be more primitive ranged weapons anyways.

    It seems like they give the Shinigami analogues of a bunch of electronics like cell-phone-like-things-that-detect-Hollows and stuff, so electronics might not be completely unknown amongst the Shinigami.

    Note: it might be cool if in Bleach fanfic where some or even *any* of the famous people who have died make an appearance, I can't recall ANY of the MANY famous dead people making an appearance in Bleach.

    In Star Wars, Darth Vader needs to be able to use the Force  to choke people. I am less settled on The Emperor being able to shoot lightning directly into your body, but using the Force to choke someone is an iconic scene.

    Star Wars make no goddamn sense at all. Some books have nonetheless tried to do similar things, though, the first two off the top of my head were Frank Herbert's Dune and Simon Green's Deathstalker books. Both tried to justify people in a high-tech setting using swords as primary armaments. Basically, they had energy shields that would block almost any imaginable projectile weapon, so people had to use slower melee stuff to pierce the shields. In Herbert's Dune shooting the shields with lasers resulted in a nuclear-level explosion, making the lasters impractical for use at close range typically. In Green's books, there were extremely expensive energy-based guns that could penetrate shields, but they were bulky, expensive, and had ridiculous rechage times of like 2 minutes, because Green wanted to have the fights and battles be more like swashbuckling with primitive gunpowder pistols.

      Right, which is why we need a rational rewrite! :D

      > Darth Vader needs to be able to use the Force to choke people

      I agree, but this can be explained by him manipulating the air around someone's throat rather than constricting their airway directly. The difficult question is whether he can, like, squeeze your heart.
      ```

      - u/scruiser:
        ```
        Dark side is able to bypass your pseudo-manton limit?  The so if Jedi are still relatively unambiguously good in your rational!AU, make the force explicitly respect living being sense of boundaries.  The dark side is all about making the force directly obey you through raw emotion and passion and thus can overcome this obstacle.  It still isn't easy to bypass this limitation, even with the dark-side, requiring extra concentration and focus, so that is why even Palpatine and Vader don't just instant kill their enemies.

        > The difficult question is whether he can, like, squeeze your heart.

        So I would say that even for advanced force users, they need to utilize particular techniques to actualize their power efficiently.  So maybe with a few extra minutes of concentration and some extra exertion of willpower, Vader or Palpatine could just directly squeeze your heart, however Vader is much more practiced at force choking (his first usage of it has probably burned itself in his memory) and Palpatine is much more practiced at force lightning.
        ```

    I'm curious how you could integrate rationalist themes into Star Wars. Using power to gain more power, with the ultimate goal of improving life for sentients everywhere, is almost certainly a first step towards the Dark Side. It doesn't fit with the Jedi's space-Taoist outlook. As iconic as they are, I'd be more interested in a rationalist Han Solo - smuggler and con artist making the best of what he's got, suddenly thrown into a battle of space wizard knights with telekinesis and future-vision. Maybe not actually Han Solo, Rey has some of the same themes, or you could make up your own character and drop them in. But someone who isn't the Chosen One and who isn't a Force superstar. Rationalist heroes don't have a prophecy drop into their lap.

    Don't worry about lightsabers not matching up with our laws of physics. Nor does FTL, nor do blasters, nor do shields. Unless you want to do something particular with those (c.f. [the Ljussköld](http://english.bouletcorp.com/2016/04/13/sabers-light/) ), don't question them. If your characters grew up surrounded by those things, they wouldn't think to ask what lightsaber blades are made of ("coloured energy, duh"), so there's no reason to bring it up. As long as the universe is consistent with its own rules, it doesn't need to match the real world.

      > I'm curious how you could integrate rationalist themes into Star Wars.

      The idea I enjoyed the most from the earlier threads was to give Anakin a fairly strong working knowledge of cognitive biases from time spent working on droid AI (e.g. C3PO).

      > Rey has some of the same themes

      I initially wanted to write it with Rey as the protagonist, actually, but her story doesn't happen without the backstory, and dropping rational!Rey into canon Star Wars is a shortcut to Mary Sueville. So I figured what the heck, may as well rewrite the entire original story and then see where a Rey-analogue ends up.

      > someone who isn't the Chosen One and who isn't a Force superstar

      Certainly not the Chosen One, yeah, but I think it's okay to have the protagonist be fairly gifted with the Force as long as they're up against obstacles that can't be solved just by applying overwhelming ~~force~~power. After all, those will be the interesting ones :)

      > As long as the universe is consistent with its own rules, it doesn't need to match the real world.

      I think the issue here is that I as the author need to know what those rules are to make sure everything stays consistent, and I was having trouble coming up with rules that allowed lightsabers and shields. I have some better ideas now, after reading the suggestions here.

        > The idea I enjoyed the most from the earlier threads was to give Anakin a fairly strong working knowledge of cognitive biases from time spent working on droid AI (e.g. C3PO).

        There could be interesting interplay between the force and cognitive biases here. Perhaps the dark side interferes with the reasoning of the user and in such a way that it erodes the very ability to resist the temptation of using it in the future. Suppose that the dark side is actually more effective, especially if you're cornered in the middle of combat and don't have the luxury of being prepared for opposition, and an interesting dilemma presents itself: do you risk using the dark side to survive, knowing that the very act of using it will re-make your mind in subtle ways and may make you a danger to all you currently hold dear, or do you try to fight your way out without resorting to the dark side and risk dying and not being able to accomplish your goals? You may adapt the scenario to an out-of-combat situation fairly easily. Say you're a Jedi trying to negotiate a truce between two sides in a bloody war: do you use the force to manipulate the minds of representatives and achieve peace, thus saving millions of lives, knowing that the very act of subverting others will give the Force a degree of influence over your own mind?

        And if you use the Force and win, do you trust yourself afterwards? Any value drift would feel perfectly natural and justified from the inside, after all, and not stand out as obviously caused by mental manipulation. This may actually be one reason for why the Jedi tend to be more communal and the Sith end up as loners: Jedi don't have to rely on their internal reasoning machinery, they have the option of asking their cohorts "do my actions and plans make sense in context of my stated goals", which provides a safeguard against being mind-fucked by the force.

        Focusing on the influence of the force over the minds of users also gives context to how paranoid the Jedi are about attachments and why they insist on inculcating their prospective members in their philosophy from a very young age. The Jedi order is also the obvious fodder for a rationalist-aligned re-interpretation. I mean, they're basically a self-policed monastery for organisms afflicted with force sensitivity. And within such interpretation force sensitivity is really more of an affliction, rather than a blessing: you constantly run a risk of turning into a raging super-powered psycho if you slip up just once. This also may be a good answer for why the Jedi are so ineffectual politically: self doubt is so ingrained in their culture that they can't view themselves as an organisation that should be running the universe. They're basically a group of people trying keep each other from snapping by cultivating mental discipline and detachment: from their perspective getting involved in politics with all the inherent mind-kill would be one of the most terrifying things there is.

        Basically, I think the feedback between the force and the minds of the users is one of the most interesting aspects to explore in star wars. The theme is also rationalist at its core, since it's concerned with having to function under conditions of not being able to trust you own reasoning.

            I agree with you there, but there is one thing to keep in mind: it didn't work. The Jedi order collapsed because the culture they created made them incapable of defeating or even noticing the new threat the Republic faced. I like the interpretation that Luke is the one who found the balance between passion and restraint to found a new order.

              - u/trekie140:
                ```
                Actually it was 100k years, only the last thousand of which were in its current state. The flaws weren't necessarily inherent, the Republic had faced many tribulations over its history, but the collapse occurred due to systematic flaws that weren't fixed. Rome ruled Europe for centuries but still collapsed when it faced problems it couldn't solve.

                The prequels weren't very good at presenting those institutional problems, but they were still there. The government had become impotent and corrupt while the Jedi detached themselves from the rest of society to the point where people no longer trusted them. The clone war and Palpatine's conspiracy is what pushed people over the edge, but it worked for a reason.
                ```

            - u/AugSphere:
              ```
              Perhaps. Or the old order might have lasted so long precisely because they were rigid enough in their discipline. I don't think we have enough data about how effective in the long term the new order will be as a political organisation, nor as an organisation dedicated to keeping force sensitives from going insane. It will be up to the author to decide how to depict it in the end, as the canon doesn't really nail it down all that much, I don't think.
              ```

        - u/DaWaffledude:
          ```
          This is the interpretation of the Force I've always stuck to, but I've never been able to articulate it this well. It makes the whole Jedi vs Sith thing *so* much more interesting than the "both sides are equally wrong" nonsense I keep seeing people suggest.
          ```

        - u/scruiser:
          ```
          To keep the AU relatively in line with canon, you could actually make the force relatively benevolent under normal conditions.  It would explain why, although they are so cautious about the dark side, they are otherwise willing to trust the force's guidance and influence.

          > Suppose that the dark side is actually more effective

          Also, another potentially interesting rational theme: since light-side is all about passively listening to the force instead of bending it to your will, even though the Jedi get less direct combat abilities and raw power, they get better precog than dark side users.  Enough so that Palpatine's entire strategy was engineered around blinding the Jedi's long-term precog.

    > In Star Wars, should the force be Manton-limited, i.e. can a Sith snap your brainstem with a thought?

    I've always assumed that the force *could* snap brain stems, even in canon, unless it was a jedi fighting another jedi. A jedi, I assumed, could just create a field of force energy around themselves that keeps the force near them immune from manipulation. A force field, if you will. As far as why they never did it to non-force users in canon, I just assumed it was harder - it takes more concentration and time to focus on a specific part of an enemy's anatomy than it would to just slice their head off with a laser sword. Think about how much time and focus Yoda needed to lift Luke's ship out of the swamp. Now imagine someone trying to do something like that in the middle of a battle.

    As far as munchkinism being more rewarding when you give less power to the force, I don't think this is inherently true. Namely, I think the reward of munchkinism comes from its cleverness. So it might be true that you can only think of clever munchkinizations of a limited force system and have a harder time with a more powerful version, but the limit there is not inherent to the force system but to your own ability to think up clever uses for it.
    ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Re Star Wars: most canon stories I've seen mostly treat the force as somewhat Manton limited. When Luke jumps off the walkway in *Empire Strikes Back*, Dark Vader doesn't lift him although he's lighter than some of the things Vader had just thrown at him in the previous scene. In *The Clone Wars*, you only see jedi use force choke when they're very angry, or their opponent is weakened, suggesting there's some resistance to it by default.

    As for lightsabers, they actually make sense as a weapon if you have the insane skill level required to use them. The important thing about them is, they cut through basically anything. It's a bit hard to make comparisons since armour is mostly useless in Star Wars, but you can easily imagine that they can cut through armour that is otherwise impervious to small arm fire, making them unstoppable if you're skilled enough to get in close range in the first place. They're also easier to conceal, and harder to use against you if stolen than a rifle.

        You mean, why isn't their technology more widespread? Or how do you make a plasma tube that deflect plasma shots?

Star Wars is science-themed fantasy. You don't need a reductionist magic system / tech tree to make good rational fiction.

  I'm surprised no one has written a rational fic of Young Wizards, since it's a story all about fixing problems with the universe and fighting against death. As such, here is my take on the setting that will hopefully lead to someone writing a good story. Keep in mind that I've only read up to A Wizard's Dilemma so there may be some details I don't know yet, but I'm going to focus on the basic premise of the series.

  A wizard is, of course, someone who has taken the Wizard's Oath and has been taught how to reprogram reality using the Speech. Performing wizardry requires energy, which is gathered and allocated by wizards, so spells cannot be cast with impunity unless you're being subsidized. Outside of spells, the Speech can be used to communicate with anything that has a name including inanimate objects or the pieces of something larger, though anything other than sentient life tends to be content with their existence and disinterested in thinking rationally.

  Every wizard possesses a manual of some kind, even if it's just a sourceless voice, to provide them with the specific information they need, which is actually a wizard itself that has decided to instruct and assist other wizards. Communication and cooperation among wizards is carefully coordinated through a hierarchy that operates across nonlinear time and multiple universes, and is of the belief that some information should be independently discovered rather than directly taught based upon the context of who it's going to.

  Familiars is the term I've given to refer to non-wizards who know about wizards, though it can apply to massive scales. If an entire species or civilization knows about wizards, it's because they are technically the familiar to a wizard of equal or greater size. Familiars have a tendency to develop superpower-esque talents that are fed by their wizard's power, which the wizard frequently won't know about until after they manifest since the familiar technically always had the talent, they just couldn't use it.

  The existence of wizards and their activities is kept secret from everyone else as part of a respect for anything that "lives well in its own way". The Powers That Be who created the universe could've just removed death and entropy from it, but chose not to because that would've destroyed everything that came about because of it. Wizards are employed to fix problems in the universe because they are a product of entropy themselves, so are entrusted to fix things in a way that the universe's inhabitants find more acceptable.

  You may have noticed that I've given wizards quite a lot of autonomy and based a lot of their actions around judgement calls. That's because I want to emphasize the story potential for personal struggles against entropy and the difficulty at fighting it within yourself. My headcannon is actually that the Powers are a metaphor to describe wizards far more powerful than yourself, and that the avatars of the Lone Power are wizards who went rogue and may be inadvertently creating entropy. 

  Nita and Kit's stories are just their personal experiences in a setting so massive that the entirety of it can't even be perceived by them, their perspective is just suitable for their own corner of it. The cosmology is a fractal expanding in all directions across space, time, and dimensions beyond seemingly without end. For a series about high concept adventures and personal drama that can span whole settings and genres with a consistent theme of improving yourself and helping others, I think that's appropriate.

    And I'm with /u/oilwhail on this - the setting is already rational and the characters stick to reasonable mistakes (see: volunteering for the *Song of the Twelve*). 

    A rationalist sorry wouldn't even need to go AU; you could just use an original (or peripheral) character. The trouble would be in writing about... hmm, I've got a decent idea for the setting... Uh, writing the rationalist bits without an exposition dump. I mean, canon is basically just missing a sprinkle of *Luminosity*-style self reflection, but that's hard to write without turning into awkward non-fiction.

        There's a surprising quantity of bonus short stuff as well - a trio of novellas, another trio coming, a (n unfinished) *30 days of OTP* by DD...  It's a good universe to be a fan if you're patient!

  Two questions related to one plan for nanowrimo... If you could time travel to anytime post 2nd world war, what would you do to advance rationalism? Is there any research you could run early or promote more? History is mostly stable so you can gamble or invest and make enough money to promote research, but it still looks better if your work is peer reviewed, obviously. Time travel is in the form of living a life over again, so you can start work from a young age

  And two. If a significant subset of people can remember more than one life and expect to live for many more - are their lives worth more than those of regular people? I mean in strict QALYs they are, but how do you do the sums and do you think it would be ethical to? Sums are harder because you don't know the upper limit on lives lived for certain, but as they go further back these people remember less and less of their past lives so you could say that at some point in the future they stop 'being themselves'...

    You'd get to shape the birth of computers and the Internet. For example, you might attempt to prevent people from creating an unfriendly AI, and slow down research into computers as much as possible.

    Although if you're worried about existential risk during the Cold War, there are more obvious targets.

    >And two. If a significant subset of people can remember more than one life and expect to live for many more - are their lives worth more than those of regular people?

    If you shoot one of these people, do they just skip to their incarnation in the next timeline? That might make their lives worth _less_ than a mortal's. Normal people stay dead, loopers just have to sit in the corner until the next reset.

    I don't know. It's easy to argue that they're worth more than normal people, but that rings false somehow. Narratively speaking, it seems like a justification for Protagonist-Centred Ethics, because the people you care about are explicitly worth more than the people you don't. And that sort of argument could very easily be used to justify any atrocity you like - "those people's lives are worth less than ours" is intolerance in a nutshell.

      I think I am going to have to write someone who dies in the next few years, because otherwise I'll be writing quickly overtaken near future stuff. Given that I don't think AI will be their first concern - if anything they are going to want to invent things like mobile phones FASTER because it's hard having to keep going back to before their invention. They may want to spread general rationality, though, partly to avoid war, but mainly because once you know about biases it's hard not to want to overcome them :-)

      >If you shoot one of these people, do they just skip to their incarnation in the next timeline?
      That's true for most forms of death, yes, but in Harry August there is a way to kill them entirely by preventing them being born in their next life, and also you can wipe their memory just before death, which could be considered as bad as killing them. The ethical question arises because if you kill Hitler, for instance, you are preventing a lot of these people being reborn by changing the history where their parents meet...
