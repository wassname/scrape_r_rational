## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I've been looking for more sci-fi, and came across [Post Human](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22848/post-human)
  by J P Koenig (completed).

  The story follows a human-turned-AI, Nikola v1.01, as it is tasked with building a new home for humanity following the destruction of Earth. Nikola spends her time on an [1035 Ganymed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1036_Ganymed), a near-Earth asteroid, working at expanding it and preparing it as Humanity's next home. At 24 chapters, the story is relatively short, more of a novella than a novel, and can be binged in a few hours.

  I found it to be a very enjoyable read, with an interesting plot and good world-building. There were parts of it that were a bit dense when describing technology, but they were short and helped develop the story. There isn't much character development, given that the main character is an AI and how short the story is, though the AI Nikola does improve itself as the story progresses.

    Looks interesting, thanks!

    For anyone put off by the word count, it says it's 90k words long, which is a mid size novel length. Novellas are between 17k-40k words.

    I saw that mentioned (here, probably) a while ago, and started it, but didn't finish.

    The one thing that bothered me a lot was what exactly was the tech level available to the protagonist?  Did humanity have access to FTL or not?  That's a pretty big deal in my book.  I'm fine with it either way, but it should have been one or the other, instead of vague.

    >!OK, so you've got an alien invasion, and they have FTL.  Fine.  If you have it, yes, maybe study theirs to see if it works different, is more efficient, or don't if it isn't useful.  If you don't have it, then study of FTL is a big deal and must necessarily be a major plot point.  However, in Post Human, there were times where it seemed the protagonist did have access to FTL, but that really wasn't clear. For the part that I read, the protag was acting as if she didn't have FTL tech.  But didn't seem to be trying too hard to get it.  Strange.!<
    ```

    - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
      ```
      They didn't have FTL. It's not vague: they mention all the time they use impulse engines in the asteroid and later >!gravity engines which they reverse engineered!<. The assault drones are specifically stated to use >!"ion engines for thrust, with solid-rocket afterburners for sudden changes to delta-v."!<

      The're no mention of anyone having built an FTL engine, and the only time it's brought is when the >!Moebius strip is used by the alien ship to escape the solar system!<
      ```

      - u/ansible:
        ```
        Really?

        >!The aliens are the "Orion Arm Trading Company", and they want to ship out rare metals from the solar system to... elsewhere, in return for gadgets.  How is this going to work on a reasonable timescale without FTL?!<

        >!Also, in chapter 10, they talk about one of the Voyager missions going towards the galactic core, which is ~25K light years from here.  And doing that in hundreds of years.!<  

        At any rate, human civilization had some means to send macro-scale spacecraft at nearly the speed of light, even though they were not at Kardashev level 2 yet.  If you're not doing FTL, that's a whole lotta energy, so something doesn't add up. I don't know, maybe that was a mistake by the author.
        ```

        - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
          ```
          1. They're aliens, the value of materials is relative, and so is time. To them it is a good investment of their time, to others it might not be.

          2. >!The Mobius strip allows for FTL travel. FTL engines don't exist, that doesn't mean they can't take advantage of an anomaly that allows for FTL travel. Getting there would have taken hundreds of years, getting back to Earth doesn't. They mention that it takes 6 months for the alien spaceship to travel from the asteroid belt to the anomaly, using normal engines.!<

          3. The Voyager mission would have used an ion engine, which pick up speed over time. They mention using them for other spaceships. In chapter 22, they specifically say >!“Gerry is now officially **the fastest man-made object ever to cross the solar system. He’s at 0.2c**, and will be rocketing past Earth in another six hours or so.”!< The Voyager missions are also allowed to take time since they're (technically) unmanned here. 


          Most of your problem seems to be that you skimmed over chapter 16, because the explanation is there

          > >!“I find it unlikely,” said Zia. “If the geometry is correct, than this Mobius strip is forming a band hundreds of light-years in length. Even if they could somehow enter it, and survive it, the journey would take longer than going the ‘long’ way.”!<

          > >!I went back to the gravimetric readings of the milliseconds leading up to the ship vanishing. In particular, I examined what the ship had done with its gravity fields just as it approached. It had a giant bubble gravity field, just like the alien craft I had disassembled had used, far larger than the craft needed. Now I had an inkling as to why it had been so large.!<

          > >!“They didn’t take the long way,” I said. “They bounced off of it, a ricochet that picked up velocity that shouldn’t even be possible.”!<

          > >!“What are you talking about?” demanded Zia.!<

          > >!“Their gravity bubble, the outer one that we thought was too large. It was exactly opposite the readings of the anomaly. They bounced off of it, and got flung away at a faster-than-light speed.”!<

          > >!“That would take infinite energy to propel infinite mass,” argued Zia. “That’s not possible. Unless… Alcubierre was a lot closer than we thought.”!<

          >>!We argued the math back and forth for a little while, before we came to an hypothetical understanding. Somehow, they’d picked up a Jupiter-sized amount of energy off of the anomaly, getting flung wildly across space. The amount of energy involved meant that space and time was compressing in front of them in a negative mass, counterbalancing their own increased mass, while space and time expanded behind them to shove them along. This could only end in one of two ways. They would careen into an object at supralight speeds, causing a truly epic explosion, of the sort that could destroy solar systems, or they would get caught by the other end of the Mobius strip. At that end, they would catch the other side of the strip, and it would absorb that acceleration, slowing them down and letting them bounce off gently.!<

          [This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive) is how they do FTL, even if they don't have actual FTL engines.

  Not explicitly rational, but this is an interesting and well written manga about a character studying and learning art/oil painting for the purposes of getting accepted into the Art Department at a prestigious university. 

  https://mangadex.org/title/34327/blue-period

  \[Request\] I'm looking for "realistic" sci-fi works that try to portray what life might be like in the future if (strong) AI, life extension/rejuvenation (think SENS), Neuralink, mind uploading, nanomachines and similar developments all pan out successfully and interact with one another.

  I'm not necessarily looking for the most gripping storyline, I'm more looking for a somewhat realistic setting to immerse myself in that fleshes out what life may be like if we manage to nudge this world in the direction of a realistic utopia. Reading about SENS life extension and taking it at face value really hammers home that we actually still live under absolutely horrid conditions and when "people" in 200 years will look back on us then I'm quite sure our lives will look like the middle ages look to us now. I need some help imagining what living in that future would actually feel like. Suggestions? :)

    [To The Stars](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7406866/1/To-the-Stars) is a *Puella Magi Madoka Magica* fanfic which does an excellent job of portraying a post-scarcity, transhumanist civilization with strong AI, a neuralink equivalent, eternal life, etc. In my opinion the author has a knack for exploring the deeper details, including the rocky history of humanity reaching that utopian state, which provides realism to the complex setting and grounding for the gripping plot.

    Rational:

    First off the bat would be the [Bobiverse](https://www.goodreads.com/series/192752-bobiverse) It has most everything you're looking for and focuses on user of upload / enhanced extension. It gets recommended here  a bit, if you've got audible the audiobook versions are fantastic. 

    I'll second the recommendation already made in the thread for [Post Human](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22848/post-human)

    Semi-Rational:

    [House of Suns](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1126719.House_of_Suns) Not sure if this can be rational or not, the timescales and advanced tech make it all very fantasy like. Lightspeed is still the fastest thing, with time being the medium of travel where people are in stasis for thousands of years. AI tech and all of what you mentions is prevalent. 

    [Trancendent Humanity](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9271192/1/Transcendent-Humanity) more /r/hfy than /r/rational. Still it's got everything you listed. Human's advanced down a different tech tree and benefit from it, along with not fearing the development of AI. 


    Not so Rational:

    The Expanse, Altered Carbon, and Dark Matter TV series all come to mind, listed in order of most rational to least. 

    [Otherlife Series](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/28670924-otherlife-dreams) Massive, massive, massive harem story. Very popcorn that hits on the upload / strong AI angels that eventually spirals into a very Marvel Cinematic Universe like of interconnected (harem) stories all taking place within a 'virtual' universe.
    ```

          ```
          True. I think the first season of 'The 100' might also suit your taste, though it does get sketchy season 2 onwards.

    - u/CaramilkThief:
      ```
      Bobiverse 1 is pretty rational from what I recall, but it gets less so in the later books, once Bob gets a chance to relax slightly. He starts making more emotion based choices at that point. It's still somewhat rational, but I wouldn't call it rational to the standards of this subreddit.
      ```

      - u/JohnKeel:
        ```
        Emotion in choices doesn’t mean something isn’t rational. Emotion is the only way to decide what’s worth prioritizing, because reasoning choices out means nothing without wanting particular outcomes.

    Peter Hamilton's Commonwealth stories.  Though "realism" is an impossible demand here.
    ```

    - u/AnythingMachine:
      ```
      Hamilton has a good excuse for removing superintelligence from the picture but keeping the less story-breaking transhuman technologies - the SI just quits human civilization using wormhole tech and expands with unlimited resources on its own somewhere off-screen, with only occasional interactions with the main plot. Also, there's some conceit that you just can't properly run a memorycell in a non-organic body because of quantum. Otherwise I agree.

      I would pick living in the Greater Commonwealth circa 3300 over the Culture any day of the week - no contest. Your life actually has a higher meaning there.

- u/Escapement:
  ```
  Recently I read Max Gladstone's soft SF Empress of Forever. Overall more positive than negative feelings - definitely *not* a must read, but I've read way worse. It's pretty much not particularly 'rational' in most ways, but there's a ton of cool space opera stuff. It reminds me a lot of Iain M. Banks' Culture books in overall aesthetics, futurism, etc. The central 'twist', if it can even be called such, was super obvious to me from basically the start of the book, but having a fairly obvious plot didn't ruin the book for me. The plot twist was extremely similar to [one of Scott Alexander's short stories](https://web.archive.org/web/20180201103146/http://squid314.livejournal.com/336195.html) which I loved (the story in question, if you read it/have read it, could be construed as spoiler for  Empress of Forever, but then again the plot of the book being predictable didn't spoil my enjoyment much.) The best parts of the book are setting and worldbuilding; the characters were fairly flat, and the prose was workmanlike at best.

        It would be better to know the characters beforehand, yes. Else their introductions and what they are about in the story might feel a bit abrupt, because the fanfic expects you to know the originals even if you don't know the fanfic adaptations.

        That said, Overwatch only has limited amounts of story. At the time this fanfic was written all there was was backstory for each then released character, a bunch of cinematics and maybe a 10 page comic or two that didn't advance anything like a main story.

    If you're looking for completed works, this is not the right place :)

    Joking aside, The Metropolitan Man, Friendship is Optimal, and The Waves Arisen are pretty well liked here. A Practical Guide to Evil is almost complete, I think? There's a lot of it currently out and it updates pretty frequently. 

    The Erogamer seems to be pretty much done from a recent author comment. I personally really liked [The Demon Lord's Lover](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20243/the-demon-lords-lover), it's a sweet isekai love story that takes the premise of the usual isekai and executes it very well. It's not that rational though, but still very enjoyable and sweet.

  Heir of the Bruce is a long running quest (+5 years!) that updates regularly. I can strongly recommend it as something to archive binge. The QMs focus on the psychology of the characters, instead of their planetary economies, makes for a good read.  Some of the usual quest issues pop up, such as implausible levels of luck, but it’s handled skillfully enough that I’d say it holds up on its own. 

  https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/heir-of-the-bruce-battletech-dynasty-quest.334983/ 

  Here is the link to the first thread. A word of warning, in the second and third thread the QM puts commissions of outside perspectives under the Sidestory threadmark, there’s about a quarter of the story posted that way, and on my first read through I missed it.
  ```

  - u/xachariah:
    ```
    I got halfway through the first thread when I realized that I didn't like that the story felt plodding.  Like, I believe that a story is supposed to be the most interesting parts of a person's life shown on screen, where as this just seemed like a more dramatized diary.  With the story's construction it feels like finding a Lostech factory and meeting a new friend on the beach are given equal pacing and importance even though one is significantly more important than the other.  I know that this is consistent with quests as part of their 'genre', but it's something that consistently turns me off as well.

    Does this change during the course of the story?  Or is it the case that if I didn't like the first half of thread 1 I probably won't see a difference in thread 2 & 3?
    ```

    - u/Adeen_Dragon:
      ```
      The pacing does get better, with fewer seemingly irrelevant events getting screen time.  IIRC, halfway through thread two the QM starts offering the option to skip over more boring parts of the quest like travel, and I think the third and fourth years of college take up less screen time than year two. >!However, Alyssa, as both the heir of a large corporation, as well as one of the survivors of said corporations genetic experiments, is a fairly important/useful person for Rhiannon to know. !<

      &#x200B;

      The pacing doesn't massively pick up, though.  The current arc of the quest is Rhiannon's first combat deployment, to give an idea of the sum total progress made.

  Anybody know any good dungeon management/dungeon core novels/web novels? Of the few I came across, it seems to be an interesting concept, however they all turn out incredibly boring and all do the same thing. They always have the MC being smug and feeling all smart about being the only entity to ever make a pacifistic dungeon or put a town/inn in it, and always get way too emotional and make baffling choices. It's such an interesting concept as well, with freedom of creation that's limited only by imagination. There's a lot of opportunities to munckin the shit out of things, and the most interesting abuse of mechanics I've seen came from Lazy Dungeon Master, which fell flat in every other aspect besides clever ploys.

  Would like to see if there are even any good novels for this type. Will accept anything except fanfiction, I never liked fanfiction, especially when I don't even know the source.

            If you're willing to entertain fan fiction, [I Woke Up as a Dungeon, Now What](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/i-woke-up-as-a-dungeon-now-what-dungeon-worm.620521) is my current favorite "true" dungeon core story.

            It has several huge spoilers for Worm, in case you haven't read that and are planning to, but doesn't really require much background knowledge so long as you are willing to accept that the main character had a past before becoming a dungeon. Overall, it mostly does its own thing with its own setting and just happens to have the main character of another story as its protagonist, and overall it's pretty decently done.

            It does play the "unexpectedly friendly dungeon" trope, but better than most and with a setting that still sets up future conflict once the locals accept her. Essentially, she winds up in an impoverished buffer state between two hostile empires currently in an uneasy truce. Most of the local dungeons (which provide an important ecological and economic role) were wiped out a generation earlier, and now her appearance is both a lifeline and a promise of renewed hostilities as the currently unstable equilibrium is broken.

            My only real complaint about the story so far is that the update pace is on the slow side, and the plot hasn't been breakneck either. The characters, world building, and general story development have been pretty spot on though, in my opinion.

                I read through all of [Blue Core](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25082/blue-core) over the last few days, and it's kinda similar. It's about a guy getting isekai'd into a dungeon core, where he decides to be a friendly one (as opposed to an instrument of terror). It is unexpectedly rational, in that both enemies and allies try to make smart decisions and optimize. The worldbuilding and magic system are well done, and are pretty deep. The dungeon and his companions gain power pretty fast, but the enemies they are facing are really powerful, so it never feels like he's getting overpowered.

                My only gripe about it is the harem and explicit scenes. Some of the development feels a little off, and compared to the competence of the rest of the novel the explicit scenes feel a little added on. You can of course skim through them, and explicit chapters are labeled well. Overall it's surprisingly good!

    I recommend Hugo Huesca's Dungeon Lord series. The MC isn't a dungeon core, his powerset is basically Sauron if Sauron started as a level 1 Dark Lord and also summoned dungeon building imps

    It's take on dungeons is OG Dungeon Keeper, with workshops and laboratories that actually function and no respawning minions but paid employees. Also the antagonists aren't adventures farming the dungeon, they want the MC dead and he's willing to go to war in return.

    Bunkercore is also good. It's a sci-fi dungeon core that also avoids the whole adventures farming concept in favour of self defence against lethal threats

    Tree of Aons on Royal Road.

    Blue core actually feels like a well done story and not just a regurgitated ball of tropes like so many other dungeon core stories.

    Tree of Aons probably should t be considered a dungeon core story but it has many similar elements

  I recently finished a complete reread of [The Games we Play](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-games-we-play-rwby-the-gamer-ryuugi-complete.351105/), a complete rwby/gamer fanfic.

    I dunno how it compares to Games, but [Twig](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/)'s protagonist Sylvester is my go-to example of a magnificent bastard of a protagonist. He's a little kid, who's part of a government-sponsored group of terrorists. His speciality is psychological warfare and getting into the heads of enemies as well as allies. He's unabashedly villaneous, too. The only reason I still rooted for him was that the antagonists were *even worse*, and because he cares so much for his friends.

      Seconded. 
      Although while I agree about only rooting for him only because the enemies are worse at the beginning, by the time I got a few arcs in I was so invested in his relationships with the lambs that I got really attached to him.

    For More RWBY I would go with [Forged Destiny](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12044591/1/Forged-Destiny) AU where people in the world operate off of RPG mechanics. It's known, and everyone can see titles and states, something that is cheesed and abused to near 'game breaking' levels as the fastest way to gain levels is to kill something at your level or stronger.. 

    Monster, or Human. 

    Not to mention it's got a whole subtext of class gentrification as the Humans align themselves to their titles, and NPC's (Need Protection Caste) spend their lives locked into the profession floating over their head.

    I would call it semi-rational, as the rules of the RPG are followed and can't be broken, however the characters themselves do not operate as rational actors in all situations.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      You know, I don't know why, but I just can't really enjoy Coeur Al'Aran's stories. His RWBY fanfics aren't *bad*---they're relatively competently written, he handles worldbuilding and characters better than canon RWBY (though that's not a high praise, lol), and they generally *make sense*. But whenever I read them, I always get a feeling like I'm reading a... *flat* story. Not really boring, per say, but not one I can really get invested into. They always seem kinda disappointing and unimaginative, which is weird, considering that his scenarios and plots can get really varied and original. It *reads* like canon rehash, even when it isn't. Can't really explain it. Which is why I can't help but kinda feel confused whenever someone recommends Forged Destiny as on the same level (or better) than The Games We Play---the latter seems way *way* more mind-blowing in terms of worldbuilding, plot, or action.

      His purely comedic works are way better than the serious ones, though---*those*, I can enjoy.
      ```

      - u/Weerdo5255:
        ```
        I think it's got to do with the fact that the emotional component, is perfunctory. For as much as I enjoy the rational components in stories (I'm here after all) the emotions and responses in a story have to be as well written as anything. 

        Coeur isn't bad, but also isn't fantastic with the emotional. It's serviceable with only Jaune getting development, and everyone else spelling out each emotional step as they go. It's communicated why, and how they feel, but the reader doesn't feel it. 

        I don't know, when he/she gets that part down they'll be a very good author with an editor to clean up the usual issues on web-serials.
        ```

      - u/burnerpower:
        ```
        Yeah I agree. His comedic stories are much better. That said I do think Not This Time Fate is his best work though. (And I haven't enjoyed A Rabbit Among Wolves. Trying to turn the White Fang comedic is just too dissonant and ruins the comedy for me when hes also trying occasionally juggle in just the most flaccid takes on racism.) That said I did enjoy Professor Arc, White Sheep, Beacon Civil War, and Service With a Smile.
        ```

        - u/CaramilkThief:
          ```
          I think it's because he ends up writing the same Jaune every time, even if the starting premise has Jaune develop differently. Even his other characters start getting a bit same-y across multiple stories. That being said, I really enjoyed his Relic of the Future fic until I stopped reading it about a year ago. It went in a direction I didn't like, but the character relations and hijinks were really fun to read.
          ```

      - u/Darkpiplumon:
        ```
        I do somewhat agree, they can sometimes feel bland and unexciting. Reading Forged Destiny in particular got progressively harder for me till I just stopped reading it. Not because it was actively bad, but because I wasn't really invested anymore.

        I'm personally a fan of the stories when Coeur makes an AU based on RWBY, such as The Unseen Hunt or Arcanum, specially the first one. I also enjoyed Not This Time Fate, but it was the first of his stories that I read, so I might be biased.
        ```

    - u/burnerpower:
      ```
      Hmm I don't know. You are right that it sort of starts that way, but as the story goes on the author blatantly ignores or sidelined the more gamey stuff. For example in the very beginning the characters have hp/aura bars, but later they are just completely forgotten. The story applies its own established rules so inconsistently I think I'd go so far as to say that the story is very irrational. If you can get past that its an enjoyable enough story, but marketing it as even semi rational is just incredibly misleading.
      ```

      - u/Weerdo5255:
        ```
        Huh, I'd forgotten about HP Bars. 

        I'm more thinking about the Cheesing that Jaune uses to bend his class into a combat one, as well as the level system that Raven uses, and the Charisma Stat tricks that the ruling classes utilize. I would defend the ending of the story as at least semi-rational, but the start was shaky yeah.

      Yes, absolutely, in my case it actually was the first RWBY fic I read. It actually goes way, way of the rails of canon, being first written when the show was just starting, and the world and characters that appear are pretty much those that were mentioned or existed in the first one or two seasons. It is pretty much an AU, I was kind of disappointed when I started watching the show and reading other fanfics and realised the story (and often characters) had not much in common.

  I've been reading [Infinite Realm: Monsters and Legends](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27325/framework-monsters-legends) for a while now, and I gotta say, it keeps getting better and better. It's one of the few xianxia I've enjoyed and would recommend. The premise is that there are system apocalypses, 10 years after which the top 10,000 survivors are taken to a higher realm: The Infinite Realm. The story follows the 2 remaining survivors of one of these apocalypses, how they got there, and what they'll do from now on. There is a lot of good worldbuilding, with the author showing how having a litrpg system affects society. The main characters have depth, and while they aren't always rational, they aren't dumb either. They go looking for knowledge and power, and try to exploit the system as much as it allows. At first, one of the characters is much more interesting than the other, but the most recent volume develops the less interesting character a lot, and now both characters are fun to read. The power system is also explored really well, with there being three main pathways to power which are somewhat exclusive and very distinct. Once a month or so, we get a side story from one of the top powers of the Infinite Realm, which both shows how these power pathways pan out over the long term, as well as show the long term story direction. 

  Another story I've been enjoying is [The Featherlight Transmission](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34670/the-featherlight-transmission). It's sorta like a biopunk Dresden Files. The world is like the world of Dorohedoro, except the people in power are cyborgs instead of magic users. The main character is a biomancer (basically flesh druid) tasked to find the killer of a recent string of murders. His narration is for the most part really enjoyable, with some jokes making me laugh out loud. I sometimes find the fourth wall breaks a little tedious, but overall really enjoying it so far.

    - u/CaramilkThief:

      If it helps, pretty much all of the powerful people are like that. Ryun isn't *that* special in the grand scheme of things. That's not to say Ryun and Zach aren't exceptional, but the people at the top are *all* like that.

            What he said. Everyone at the top found lucky breaks or reality warping items which helped them gain power.

There's a skill user that has a compass that points at what he desires. At high tiers of power, even physical death isn't always enough to really stop someone, you have to destroy their soul or kill them in other realities. !< It's a pretty xianxia world, with the requisite levels of power. One thing I really liked is that Ryun and Zach have the qualities for making it to the top of the Infinite Realm, but even with all their advantages they aren't gonna be *that* special compared to other people at that level. Ivan Kal made a world where people at the top are smart, hardworking, *and* lucky.

      ```

    - u/Reply_or_Not:
      ```
      We already know that the character was one of two total survivors of an entire reality, so it felt like less of an ass pull and more like an explanation.

      Every single person on the top end of power has at least one thing like that. What makes the story interesting is how all these characters interact in the present day. Why get hung up on an origin story?

  I've gotta repeat /u/whiterosepixel 's recommendation of [One Way Trip / Near Light](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/7950959/novalounge) a Life Is Strange Fanfiction. Game Knowledge isn't required as most things can be picked up via context. 

  It's similar to [Branches on the Tree of Time](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time). In that Time travel branches loops, knowledge, and information is heavily abused to create an optimal outcome as difficult as it is when your save scumming point is bad. 

  Not to mention getting info from 60,000+ years in the future is cheating a bit, but at the same time it's not since it took quite a bit of effort to send it back.  

  Not to mention the characters have quite a good romance, and for as much as they go through none of the typical romantic subplot issues come up. They actually trust one another!

    Interesting! So the story takes place in the setting of the first game? Does Max behave as you would expect from a 300-year-old lich, struggling to connect with even the elderly of the early 21st century, much less kindle a romance with someone 5% her age? Or does she effectively have the mind and voice of a teenage girl?

    On a broader note, what did /r/rational think of LiS / LiS:BtS / LiS2? I broadly enjoyed all three in equal measure, though looking at /r/lifeisstrange you'd think the second one never came out. I think partly that's because most of the fandom's focus is on the romantic plots/ subplots, which I largely ignored on my playthroughs. Specifically, >!I found Chloe's character to be rather grating, and so had little interest in her as a romantic partner or friend, and Warren was... ok, but not terribly exciting. Rachel, Finn, and Cassidy likewise didn't do much for me.!< Instead, I liked the games for their supernatural elements and PNW setting, as well as their extended casts / b-plots. As such, >!bay over bae was a pretty easy decision for me, and I'd reckon for most here, given this sub's predominating utilitarian inclinations?!<
    ```

    - u/Weerdo5255:
      ```
      This takes part after the first game, of which I had only the vague idea about having watched a Let's Play a few years ago. So I've no opinion on anything else in the series. 

      As for mindset, the appeal here for me was the handling of Deep Time in regards to mindset and personal axioms. People change over time yes, but also become more set in their ways. Dependent on the persons, a few hundred years of extra memories isn't something that's going to cause those to drift. 

      I'd also argue that utilitarian =/= rational. The utilitarian approach can ignore emotions, and personal desires. Saving the Bay is ethical, utilitarian, and perhaps even the right thing to do. That does not make it the rational choice for a character when saving the bay kills the person they are in love with. 

      Rational characters have their own agendas, agency, and desires. How they go about executing strategies to meet their own goals is the rational approach. It only so happens that most rational characters are also bound by ethics, its very close to utilitarianism in execution but not necessarily goal.

    I liked "Forging Hephaestus" by Drew Hayes. It has the public heroes vs. villains setting, if I remember correctly, is relatively long and stands on its own (unfortunately it's only the first book so far). Plus the MC does a bit of power-munchkinry.

      I believe that his earlier "Super Powereds" series was set in the same universe. It's about a group of students attending an extremely competitive school for future superheroes.  It was... decent. The best parts were the actual school and training. There was a degree of munchkinry just because students had to push themselves hard to improve and use their powers as well as they could since each year they were competing for an ever more limited number of slots.

      There is an overarching plotline, but I found it passable at best. The characters were decent, but nothing amazing.

      From a rational perspective, I'm not convinced that the school system makes sense as described, but the moment to moment actions are mostly intelligent ish and thought out from what I can remember.

      It used to be a web serial, but has been taken down (temporarily?) for an Amazon release.

          Fair enough.  I've read it to date, and assuming u/weakzeke2 doesn't object to unfinished stories it's a solid example of munchkinry and meta-hijinks.

      Thank you so much, this should be great. I did forget to mention I read mother of learning too. You’re right that I’m pretty new to the genre but this should definitely start me off great.

      Okay never read it, but I just thought metropolitan man was just rational lex luther vs superman?  How does that tie into munchkinry?
      ```

        It's told from the perspective of Lex Luthor. How does a mortal with no powers go up against someone who is, essentially, a god?

        The answer is lots of creative use of resources (if not powers), and significant amounts of munchkinry.

        You could try this munchkin !rational frozen fanfic. If you like that then Metropolitan Man will also be enjoyable.

    I would add [Pith](https://pithserial.com/) to the list of recommendations as well. There's some really well done fight scenes in this story that make good use of the character's powers

  Any cool dynamic duos akin to Z&Z of MoL?

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    Dante and Blays from The Cycle of Arawn and The Cycle of Galand are really enjoyable to read. Not really a rational story, but fun and enjoyable. Their banter is excellent, and the moments where they get tricked by trying to be too smart are enjoyable too. It's about a kid who discovers necromancer powers, and uses that to go up in society.

    Lies of Locke Lamora has Locke and Jean. Fourth book is coming out late next year. Great banter and dialogue, but the story beats felt sort of dubious. It's a fantasy heist series.

    Zombie Knight Saga has Garovel and Hector, and pretty much all the other reaper/servant pairs. Although they aren't really a dynamic duo I guess. Really good story and one of my favorites. Really funny at times, with a great magic system and intricate worldbuilding.

  ```
  does anyone know of any rational or rationalist survival stories? I mean something like The Martian, or Hatchet, or basically rational Robinson Crusoe.

    Probably better off posting to the [new thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/io91bv/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/) if you haven't yet.
