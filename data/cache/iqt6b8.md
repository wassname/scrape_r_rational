  I read around two-thirds of the first book before dropping the story. I felt that it was *bad* writing, but couldn't exactly put a finger on the reason. And now I get it, I think.

  It has no inner monologue. Even the worst fanfics took their time to convey how the PoV character feels and what they think. There's nothing like that in the story, it's all words and actions (MC *says* how he feels). And this utter lack of insight into MC's thought process leads to two main problems: firstly, I'm completely not invested in the black box of a main character, and secondly, it gives an impression of incoherence even despite obviously thought-out setting and plot. 

  There are other problems, but this made a strong enough subconscious impression for me to stop reading.

    It’s been a long time since I tried giving this a read; but I recall that as of a later book, the character explicitly hired a “live-in therapist”, and spoke with them at length, pretty much all the time. It’s actually very well justified; they *were* going through some shit at the time. But the therapist character’s presence in the story outlasts the MC’s body dysphoria.

    I didn’t think about it at the time, but in retrospect it was certainly a way to expose the MC’s thinking. Said therapist character is essentially a Watson.

    Which is to say, I think S.I. was written to follow *screenwriting* conventions. In screenwriting, *all* thinking has to be done in the form of a conversation (because, if it isn’t, you end up with the dreaded *voice-over narration*, ala the eleventh-hour directorial patch-up of *Blade Runner*.)

      >I think S.I. was written to follow screenwriting conventions.

      This definitely *feels* more like a screenplay than a fiction story, but I've read my fair share of screenplays, and this work is different from them in subtle ways (other than format, of course). But yes, *script* is the first word that comes to mind now.

    Hm interesting.  I consciously put this restriction on myself as I write, in an attempt to get me to write more specific and meaningful descriptions of what people are actually physically doing to convey the same information, as a sort of hyperapplication of "show, don't tell".

    But truth be told I'm not sure if it works.  You may feel the same way about my writing.

      That would've been perfectly fine, but *S.I.*'s author doesn't usually write descriptions either, at least when it comes to the main character.

        Ah I see.

        Thanks for the review.  Between what everyone has said in this thread it sounds like a pass to me.

          I'd say give it a try anyway. I read enough for me to drop it in under two hours, so it's not a huge investment or anything, and I have a record of hating stuff the majority enjoys.

            I read a small bit.  I think I agree with you that the writing is "bad" but I have different opinions as to why.  It seems meandering and frequently off topic.

            Further, I'm not in love with the premise as I understand it, and the inclusion of in-line furry porn to demonstrate what the MC's new body looks like (on the official site), while it didn't particularly offend me, leads me to believe the goals of the author won't align with my goals as a reader.

    I'm not sure how this is supposed to indicate bad writing. Old-style epics almost never showed any insight into the MC's head, and it's a legitimate style to imitate (see: Lord of the Rings).

    The prose could use an edit pass for the occasional typo, but it's very readable. The plot clips along fine, the dialog is followable. The only quip I might have is that sometimes the scene transitions abruptly, but as I get older I find myself preferring that over taking too much time meandering between scenes.

      Not comparable. Old-style epics have vivid descriptions, including those of character's *visible* reactions to something, allowing to paint a picture in the reader's head. Here, the prose is strictly utilitarian, which doesn't mesh well with the lack of inner monologue.

        Hmm. Well I'll keep a look out, but I haven't had any issues visualizing what's going on.

  OH! I remember this one! Can't recall how far I got through it at the time, though...

  And yeah, 'weird' is a bit of an understatement. I'll admit it's the first story I've read anywhere that has Pepsi Convoy show up as an actual character.

  oh man I remember this from years ago, it was weird and interesting, I'll gave to give it another go

  I was always sad that Wierdtopia didn't go anywhere, but this story seems to take many similar ideas and funnel them in the general direction of a plot.

  I'm only somewhere in book 3, but I am so far delightfully pleased with the wierdness. I particularly enjoy the alien societies; the human settlements are depressingly human with a dash of apocalypse, but the squids and the spirits show how morally compatible a group might be without actually being, like, socially compatible. If that makes sense.

  So far, I'd highly recommend this to anyone who was a fan of Wierdtopia, and to anyone who enjoys the alien portrayals in Animorphs: The Reckoning.

  "then, things start getting wierd" is very much an understatement.

  Would recommend, introduced me to some interesting concepts.

- u/OnlyEvonix:
  ```
  Something that confused and interested me about the story is that the MC is at best faux-rational, using it to justify their reckless behavior yet there's reasonable(as far as such a word can be applied) consequences despite it being an SI which implies a degree of self awareness that otherwise seems to be lacking. I would not call it a rational story but it has some good ideas at points, the author pulls on weird fetishes for shock value and weirdness but I find this ultimately limits their creativity.

  I would reccomend reading it to marvel at the writing rather than the story in and of itself.

  When did this last update?

  ```
  A bit late to add a comment, but I just found this story by accident the other day, read through the entire thing, and was saddened to see it discontinued; atleast on SV and SB.

  So, I just wanted to thank you for posting a much more complete version of it. Really, thank you *very much* :)
