## Harry Potter Plot Bunny/Fan Theory [TH] [BST]

### Post:

-Dementors are actually creations of “magical friendly AI” 

-True role is to absorb the personalities of people and then simulate them in virtual environment for eternity for maximum good

-However somehow the coordinator of the dementors was destroyed and so they started to follow their simply programming of seeking out more souls for inclusion in the simulated reality

-When dementors were first created a “do not consent” spell was crafted, this was of course the Patronus

-The absorption of good thoughts is so that those already inside the dementor can know that their friends or family are coming to join them soon. The feelings of negativity are simply an unfortunate side effect, but hey, magic is like that.

Just something thrown out for general use if anyone is interested/Possibly interesting take on HP Universe

  Good concept. That means that, thanks to Azkaban, digi-heaven is full of psychos and criminals who have been effectively de-psychoed by having their negative thoughts and memories left behind in the physical world while their good sides get uploaded into immortality.

  This reminds me a bit of the TNG episode "Skin of Evil" where they encounter a manifestation of the residual negativity of an entire species that ascended to a higher state of existence.

  Cool concept. You should run with it.

  I suppose my question would be how the Ministry would keep them from following their programming and attempting to absorb the personalities of the Azkaban prisoners.....I guess outside of the Ministry actually being able to control them and just letting everyone assume dementors are evil creatures, ooga booga, support us so we can protect you from them.
