## Brainstorming for original fiction.

### Post:

I'm brainstorming for the world building of an original fiction piece I'm toying around with. The major background element is that at some point, around 14 years ago, for a short period of time (likely an hour) anyone that said "I wish _____" had it come true.

I'm not sure if it's going to play a major role in the story, but the point is to give myself an interesting playground to write in.

What I'm working on right now are just brainstorming some of the impacts this would have. Probably a few people miraculously healed, maybe a handful of people with various kinds of super powers, probably a couple of people with way too much power.

Then there's the less direct things, like people would probably be very careful and deliberate about even thinking "I wish ___", and I'd imagine that wishing harm on someone would be extremely taboo if not some sort of crime given wishes at one point verifiable came true.

So I thought I'd see what kind of world building elements the people around here would expect to crop up as a result of this divergence in history.

    I disagree with the "there are multiple presidents". Instead, there're a sudden rush of random people being placed in the position of company president. there are now four or five presidents of the USA. (most people say i wish i were president, not president of the USA. The difference is pretty big.)

    This wrecks even more chaos on the stock market, ofc.

  I wonder what kind of limits you would impose on this kind of thing?

  What if someone wished "I wish I was the only person who could speak" so that they were the only ones to be able to speak. If someone were plausible, and thought it out, then they could rationally conclude that speaking the i wish.

  This means that in the background, you'd need to place some kinds of limits on the wish, because some could be extremely dramatic and universe-level altering.
