  Thanks very much for writing this! Things I appreciated:

  * Fast pacing
  * Disney references ("Olaf has a genie now?!")
  * Exploration of the consequences of an intelligence explosion and self-replicating technology
  * Real-feeling motivations and dialogue for Elsa, the Duke, Jack, and Olaf

  Reminds me of Friendship is Optimal in the emotional effect it had on me. Bravo and thanks again :)

  I'm spacing out the updates a little bit so that I can edit the chapters one by one as they get put up, but this is complete - the full story should be completely up by next Monday.

  Hope you enjoy - comments, criticism, or reviews are welcome. It's not a complete "optimize the world and exploit everything" fic, mostly because I find it really hard to make a story that can actually survive that, and I'd rather write a story than just an exploration of ideas through conversation.

      New chapter is up - you can post the link if you'd like, but I don't want to self-promote too heavily. You can also set fanfiction.net to send you e-mails for the stories/authors that you follow, which I believe is the preferred way to do it.
      ```

        Yeah, but then you have to get a fanfiction.net account, leading to the following internal mental exchange.

        Me: It'd be awfully convenient to get an account, so I can have it list the last update for all the stories in one place.

        Me: But then I'd be the sort of person who has a fanfiction.net account.

        Me: You're no virtue ethicist! Go with what optimizes future enjoyment, which you already agreed is signing up!

        Me: OK, I'll do it. Maybe this practice will help me become a better utilitarian.

        Me: You're REALLY not getting it, are you.

          I use the unofficial [android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apps.webreader).

        Ah, fair enough.  I've had alerts up for a while, but recently switched to a different pseudonymous email address and it seems to be having trouble.  

        Also new headcanon (until next chapter):  something goes wrong, and eventually the snowpeople end up as Luminosity!vampires - it explains the cold and sparkly skin, the obsessive love, and a fair bit more besides...

  Making Olaf smarter?

  Yep, they're all gonna die.
  ```

  - u/PeridexisErrant:
    ```
    *Or* they'll all live happily ever after, since Olaf and his successors can maintain the ice economy indefinitely if they're Friendly.

    Thanks for the catch!

  Oh man! You update fast! It's refreshing. 

  Congrats on finishing it! It was an enjoyable read. (Though I think Olaf's semi-Friendliness maybe came a bit too easy.)

- u/mynoduesp:
  ```
  Just finished... brilliant, loved it. Thanks!
  ```

- u/Anderkent:
  ```
  This was awesome. Thank you for the moderately happy ending :P

- u/bbrazil:
  ```
  Olaf has a copy of a bit of Elsa. When does Olaf a) no longer have to worry about the sun and b) start creating creatures of his own?
  ```
