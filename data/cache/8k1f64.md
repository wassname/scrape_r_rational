## [Challenge Companion] Memoir

### Post:

**tl;dr: this is the companion thread to [the biweekly challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8k1avm/biweekly_challenge_memoir/), post ideas, recommendations, chit-chat, etc. here**

Personally, I'm a fan of stealing from my own life as much as possible, both because of the authenticity that it lends to a work, because it's generally pretty easy (since those things actually happened), and because I generally care about the things that have happened in my life.

Writing to pen pals and making blog posts about what was going on in my life was my primary outlet for prose for a number of years; I had a lot of pen pals, and when I wasn't writing to them, I was writing something close to a memoir, which was essentially an attempt at framing and reframing life events as a way of bringing order and meaning to them. In the same way that we can look at a work through different lenses, I think it can be helpful to look at our own lives through different perspectives, and writing from those perspectives can be helpful as an exercise, or for general fiction writing.

I was going to share some memoir stuff that I wrote in high school, but most of it makes me itch to edit it, or makes me want to slap my past self in the face, or both, so I'm going to skip that. (If you're reading *Worth the Candle*, which I write under a different name, you're getting occasional adaptations from the mass of memoirish writing I did in high school.)
