  That scene with Uriel and Moses may be my new favorite scene in the story. I'm not sure it quite manages to beat out Aaron and Ana's first meeting, but it's at least close.

  (Also, this is Chapter 17, not 16.)

    Uriel just keeps getting better and better.

    Maybe Uriel, when looking for an alternative to divine light, tried to [run the world on frogs](http://mspaintadventures.wikia.com/wiki/Genesis_Frog) before he abandoned that for mechanical computation?
    ```

      ```
      Good call there, it's hard to run so much as a[ sorting algorithm](http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2831) on frogs.

  Sohu confirmed as the Comet King's daughter (Cometspawn is a strange name for them).  We know that she's the youngest, but is she the most recently born?  She has been eight years old for about ten years at this point, and it was written that she's youngest *by virtue of* her agelessness.

  For reference, most of this takes place one month before the discovery of the Vital Name.  Sohu's part was almost six months after she was made immortal.

  ```
  Apparently animal sacrifice was established in the Temple in a misguided attempt to make sure Teh Gays don't break the universe.

  Of course.
  ```

  - u/ulyssessword:
    ```
    Well, the Gale-Shapley Algorithm *is* an abomination.
    ```

  ```
  I really hope we get more chapters with Moses and Uriel. One of my favorite sections so far.
  ```

- u/NeverSitFellowWombat:
  ```
  Okay, I think this chapter sets it: the world we're being shown is a simulation. Uriel is an admin for this world, though it was created by someone else ("God"). All the programming terms Uriel is using are funny, and I may be able to laugh them off if it turns out to not be a simulation, but by this point it just makes more sense.
  ```

  - u/FeepingCreature:
    ```
    "A simulation" implies there's a reality that is being approximated. I think this is just a computational world that happens to be configurable at a low level.

    If this is a simulation, then the territory is a map of itself.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      > If this is a simulation, then the territory is a map of itself.

      That is very kabbalistically appropriate, then. The entire cosmic architecture, self-referential through the form of Adam Kadmon.
      ```

- u/LiteralHeadCannon:
  ```
  Calling it now: the Comet King had a limited precog ability that he figured out how to munchkin into solving P=NP problems.
  ```

  - u/wtfbbc:
    ```
    I feel like Uriel would really not be okay with precogs
    ```

- u/MaddoScientisto:
  ```
  I'm pretty surprised, I didn't expect that song I heard ever since I was a kid was actually based a Jewish childrensâ€™ song, but in the version I know the goat was a mouse
  ```
