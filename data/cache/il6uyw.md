  > “I’m okay,” she slurred in my voice, a surreal sound.  “I’m okay,” she repeated with illusions.

  I like the irony of Ana acting like Wes usually does while she's in his body. 

  > Lorne Daventry leaned over the edge of the rooftop, smiling down at us.  The edge of his pinky finger touched the molten metal.

  You dumbass! Don't monologue at the heroes, shoot them while you can!

  Also, I wonder if Wes is going to try to play Ana's role in this conversation to keep up the deception.

  > Hi all. Shorter chapter today. Just a fight scene, basically. For me, this is a lot easier to write and edit than someone’s continent-spanning backstory of moral struggle and identity loss.

  I usually prefer the moral struggle, but this was a really good fight scene!

    Huh, I'm not getting anywhere NEAR Pact anxiety, although admittedly that's a hard bar to reach. I guess I'm just not getting the feeling that every chapter is nearly guaranteed to make things worse, which was the feeling I got from Pact. Additionally, the main characters have had time to just breath and relax, and the *lack* of that in Pact made it much harder to read for me.

    Although, if we're on the topic of Wildbow comparisons, I've been seeing a lot parallels to Twig (although admittedly that might just because I'm in the middle of a Twig reread). >!Our main characters are a group of people too young for the job doing black ops on behalf of an imperialistic and authoritarian regime that's rife with human rights abuses and derives most of its power from an academy that teaches people to perform miracles (which also doesn't have a great track record with human rights). They're doing this work for personal reasons rather than anything ideological, though if pressed they'll defend the ruling regime. There IS a group (led by an unusually brilliant figure who has taken a personal interest in the heroes) opposed to the ruling regime and working towards ends that the reader would see as good, though they employ methods that are almost as bad as what they're fighting against and that makes it hard to want our heroes to join up with them. Despite that, the heroes are now forced to break with the regime and strike out on their own, now facing the ire of both the rebels and the powers that be. Oh, also, the main character has a looming expiration date they've been contending with since early childhood.!< Yeah, there are some differences, and some of those differences are pretty major, but there are a LOT of similarities.

      Well when you put it like that...

    Yeah, every chapter increases my dread (in a similar way to Pact) for the characters’ well beings. I just want them to be happy

  By the way:

  > And while Lynde was focused on blocking the shotgun, turning his back to me for an instant, I separated two pieces of paper, unflattening a grenade behind the small of his back.  It exploded, throwing Lynde forward with a splash of red.
  >
  >Adam Lynde dropped, bleeding from his back and arms.  The concrete blocks dropped with him.

  I think our protagonists are being a lot more lethal than they assume.

  >The body armor stopped the first shot.  The second one blew holes in it.  The third and fourth ones reduced the knee to a red mush.

  IRONY.

    I'm not sure that they are being lethal. It's been pretty well established that as long as the Pith remains intact enough to perform a transfer and there is a spare body lying around, projectors can survive a LOT. Pretty much every projector death we have seen has been a situation where they weren't able to swap out bodies for one reason or another.

- u/Mr-Mister:
  ```
  Hey, Wes managed to mentally spell out her real name. Is the mind-censure from being ousted tied to the ohysical body?
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    I think it's more that she can't think of it as hers. So if she looks for her mother's name, no problem. If she tries to remember her own she gets a block.

    (also "Weston" is not her original name)
    ```

    - u/Mr-Mister:
      ```
      Oh, my mistske; when she mentioned Lyna Wethers, I mistakenly attributed that to be her own name, forgetting it was the love-inducion whisper specialist.
      ```

      - u/CouteauBleu:
        ```
        Yeah, I completely forgot her real name too.
        ```
