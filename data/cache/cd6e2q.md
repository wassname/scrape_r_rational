[Proposal for a Vampire Diaries Quest with the end goal being world domination](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/all-of-eternity-at-your-fingertips-concept-thread.9985/).   
  
&nbsp;  
Tl;Dr, I'm trying to gauge/raise interest in a Vampire Diaries Quest where a non Original (because that would be totally playing on easy mode) vampire munchkins they're way towards global ~~domination~~optimisation. My ideas about the quest and the rationale are in the above linked thread. The quest is intended as a vehicle for a rational story.

Thoughts, feedback, criticism, etc welcome.

  I think this could be pretty interesting. I think the road to world domination would lie in a mix of witch magic and compulsion, and honestly I think we can do this without being capital Evil.  

   I vote for us starting with very little, as those stories are the most personally compelling to me. Perhaps with a compulsion from our master that we have to circumvent?  

   Locate a wealthy person close to death and make a compulsion to give you their fortune after death. Do this a few times and we now have a sizable sum to work with. Spend the money to buy stakes in some big companies so we can A) continue growing our power and B) control decisions. We can then hire investigators to research the occult which hopefully will lead us to witches. Then we want to hire scientific researchers to understand witch magic until we can use it to fight Originals without dying or turn ourselves into something with the same power/stronger as an Original. Or something.

  Most improtant Question, would the main charachter be from our world and know about Vampire Diaries? Or would the quest just be about a random generic vampire who was freshly turned. Because one has a lot more advantages than the other.

  I also think depending on when this takes place the best thing would be to would be to fully disregard the canon Vampire Diaries plot(beyond things that happened before, and those that are inevitable like the existence of  dopplegangers). Because it absolutely made no sense how Vali changed so many things to the point that his followers controlled the governmentfor generations, and yet not only turned human society out to be excatly the same, the entire setting of mystic falls was the same with the same people being born with with same names, ages and personal relationships.

  Actions like what Vali did in the past should definetly have consequences, that should render the Setting pretty much unrecognizable a thousand years later.

  There is also the existence of Michael limiting the amount of attention a vampire can direct uppon himself without geting him to visit and burn down the place you live in. Vali only got away with it because he was Michaels favourite son and the only one he didnt hunt. Like sure its easy to think of doing things like compelling rich powerful people and using vampire blood to wipe out diseases and have people worship you, but any number of witches can and would take you out, unless you start turning vampires to increase your numbers, but even their loyaltly isnt guaranteed and their action would probably draw the attention of Michael who is extremly hard to beat. Thats why I think the best time would be

  Of course you could still try, but this really seems like any attempt to munchkin the setting as a non original has a high chance of killing you. Otherwise you could have the quest take place shortly after Abby takes out Michael, but that would only give you a little above a decade before canon starts and a bunch of factions try to enact plans that could destroy the world.

  I would honestly be interested in reading this, but I think it would be rather hard to write and I really doubt that it would be viable as quest wihout the players choices causing the MC to die(players in Quest usually choose things that sound cool, instead of doing the reasonable thing).

    Not much opportunity for munchkinry if the MC doesn't know world history.

    I agree. The butterfly effect is very real.

    You didn't complete this part? But I like that Michael is there. He creates many plausible failure modes, and adds tension to the story.

    That's intentional. :V

    I agree. And as a quest master I would be perfectly okay with writing a bad end.

    I agree, and I've actually written a [post on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/cdiql5/quests_and_the_intelligence_of_hiveminds/).

      There is a certain advantage in just being a inteligent person who is not controlled by tropes, like the only attempt to use science to enhance vampires in the series showed [great results](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Augustine_Vampire)(even if it was used against vampires), but was never mentioned again.

      >You didn't complete this part?

      I think I accidentally deleted it, but now that you confirmed that ths is a SI(kind of), Id think that the best time would be the 1800s since we actually know enough about the plot and locations of important charachers in that era so the MC doesent die, its also not that long ago that you cant make some prediction about how things could turn out, and there is enough time to make reasonable preperations for threats to come, its also one of the earliest times where you have a chance to get a daylight ring(but I suppose it would be interestng to read something where the vampire actually has to stay out of the daylight).

      >He creates many plausible failure modes, and adds tension to the story.

      I suppose so, but I think that even without Michael there is still enough tension with the challenges a ambitious generic vampire would face like,

      1. securing a regular source of human blood without drawing attention and killing too many people
      2. dealing with the vampire weaknesses like sunlight, vervain, or needing to be invited to enter a house
      3. Witches generally disliking vampires and being hesistant to work with one and interfering with plans
      4. Werewolves seem to hate vampires quite a lot and until receently there seem to have been quite a lot of them.
      5. Vampire Hunter magicaly enhanced and mundane ones, considering the amount of weaknesses vampires have any group of humans who know about vampires pose a real threat, and are likely to oppose a vampire expanding their power near them
      6. Other vampires(especially older ones and large groups) who want to take control, eliminate a potential threat, or merely live and behave reckless.
      7. Spirits actively limiting what kind of magic can be used

      The problem with Michael compared to the others is not only how hard he is to kill, but that even if you kill him you not only risk the wraith of the original family(he was still their father after all), you also removed the reason why the Original had for not settling down and expanding their powers. Like the first thing in canon Klaus does after he killed his father, is to create an army of hybrids.

      >I agree. And as a quest master I would be perfectly okay with writing a bad end.

      Which is perfectly fine, but I think there needs to be something to be improve the odds, like having the MC be part of a already established groups of vampires, or maybe a mortal background that gives them some power like being the child of some politician/noble or maybe be related to witches and acess to their Grimoire.
      ```

      - u/DragonGod2718:
        ```
        The issue regarding Michael is that the only way to make him less of a threat is to set up the MC as an Original but if you do that, the journey becomes trivial. Either the MC is an Original or they're not, and that difference represents a discontinuous jump in difficulty. Frankly, I'd prefer the non Original version. That said, I'll look at progression mechanics to perhaps lessen the difficulty.
        ```
