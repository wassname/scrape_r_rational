  First post after a while. As I explain in the end notes, I've been busy and all sorts of stressed out due to the pandemic and that has affected my writing. It turns out having to commute with nothing else to do to work and back every day was a really key part of the creative process for me. Also, I've been doing some work connected to pandemic modelling myself, which took precedence and had me really focused for two-three weeks. I hope to start posting again, more or less slowly, though I don't think I'll be able to achieve my original one chapter every two weeks objective (not that I've really managed that most of the time either).

  But the fic's not dead, so that's the good news.

    I love that this is one of the exact examples in the Sanderson lectures on the front page of this sub, when he was talking about tapping into your creative process.

    It's great to know that you're okay. As someone who has also been doing work at home, I agree that it has additional challenges.

    Also, the chapter was great. There were so many good parts it's hard to pick just one. Black was Good, Bulma was good, Goku was good, the end chapter reveal was great. Somehow everything made seemed to make more sense after reading it. Also, the general strategies you tend to have skilled but tech focused enemies use against  conventional martial artists is great.

      Thanks! The work from home in itself wouldn't be that much trouble for me (I don't have children so it's not like the house makes it hard to focus), and I already used to work from home once in a while since I only need a computer anyway, but I guess not having a sharp cutoff makes it harder to get "out" of the work mindset? In practice I ended up spending most days unable to do anything vaguely creative at the end, and in fact often working for *longer* than I usually would. It doesn't help that it's been a legitimately busy period.

      And yeah, I have a lot of fun writing those sort of fights. In fact I'd say having the chance to do so was one major reason why I thought up this fanfic to begin with.

  Glad to see this story's alive and kicking, and that you are too.

  So just making a wild guess
  Between how hopeless Bulma’s survival looks (though there are ways out probably) and the ox king dying, I’m betting on more deaths with a dragon ball revival, as often happened in cannon.

    I'm betting on Bulma's survival, if the rule about Shenron not granting the same wish twice\* remains in play.

    \* this rule apparently includes wishes made in conjuction with other wishes, since for all intents and purposes it was used to try and make resurrection harder. The Namekians breaking the balance at the end of Z was really annoying, and felt like Toriyama had written himself into a corner and couldn't, Idk, wish for Shenron to come back early or something (there is precedent whenever Shenron / the Kami experience mortality difficulties, and Buu *did* blow up the—wait, I just remembered I'm not using spoilers.)

    The Youtube review series DragonBall Dissection pointed out an opportunity to use the "no repeating wishes" rule without it being exclusively for resurrections, which would have made a really painfully stupid plot point much better. I've kinda wanted to combine that with some of my ideas and try to squeeze something resembling a ratfic into the gaps filler weirdly ignored, but I somehow don't see myself ever getting beyond summaries. And it would be irrelevant to tOWP, because this story has already strongly implied that the catalyzing events will differ dramatically, if even happen at all.
    ```

    ```
    I kinda hope so, I like Ox King and would hate to see the character exit the story forever. 

    On the other hand the whole, "eh we can just wish them back." Tends to make the whole thing seem less meaningful.
    ```
