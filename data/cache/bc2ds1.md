  This power (along with sufficiently advanced analysis devices) essentially gives you the ability to "diff" humans by checking what's different before and after a "healing". Imagine what we could learn by effectively using such a power:

  * Brain scan before and after healing mental ailments: allows researchers to find the genetic, structural, or mechanistic underpinnings of those mental ailments which can lead to development of new treatments.
     * A brain before and after being cured of depression (or other mental ailments believed to be related to structural or chemical imbalance-related neurological problems within the brain) would provide far more precise information than comparing two *different* brains, one with depression and one without.
     * A detailed psychological profile of a person before and after being "perfectly healed" of PTSD (or other mental ailments believed to be purely or largely *psychological* rather than *neurological* in nature) would provide "perfect" examples of a re-adjusted person after overcoming psychological issues. It doesn't tell us how to achieve it, but knowing the start-point and end-point would be extremely valuable to developing therapy and treatment plans.
  * Discover the causes/mechanisms of various idiopathic diseases and ailments that we still don't understand by doing a "diff" (a before-and-after-healing comparison) of people with those ailments. What changed? Can that knowledge be applied to developing preventative measures or effective treatments?
     * A huge amount of diseases fall into this category: Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Autism, various autoimmune disorders like Arthritis and Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Asthma, Gulf War Syndrome, Multiple Sclerosis, Narcolepsy, IBS, etc.
  * Discover/affirm the various factors affecting cell senescence (aging) by looking at various types of cells before and after the "age reversion". Can help us develop means of extending human life without "magic healing".
     * Might be difficult to isolate only certain factors, but at least the changes associated with aging and lack of health would *absolutely* be reversed after a healing, which would allow us to exclude anything that doesn't change as irrelevant and to ensure that the factors we believe to be related to senescence actually *are*. Would also allow eventual (admittedly borderline-) ethical human studies that intentionally induce certain factors related to senescence to see what happens.
  * Allows ethical usage of "knock-out"-style studies on humans.
     * "What happens when a human is missing \_\_\_\_\_\_?" - A certain gene, a certain part of the body, etc. As long as the person won't die within 5 minutes of losing it, anything can be removed without worrying.
  * Allows (again, borderline-) ethical usage of high-fidelity but destructive full or partial brain scans (and any other inherently harmful analytic methods) on living people, because they can be healed afterwards: can allow researchers to understand structural changes in the brain in response to various experiments involving learning, memory, and consciousness.
  * Given the premise that the person is "fully" healed to the point where they are no longer predisposed for a relapse or reacquiring the ailment, it would allow researchers to answer many questions of "nature vs nurture" and "genetic or acquired" that right now can only be partially explored via twin studies.
     * "Is this disease genetic or not?" - After healing, check to see if DNA has changed, if there are changes to gene expression, or if there are any other unexpected changes to the person's physiology.
     * Try healing horrible criminals (especially sociopaths and other "criminally insane") and see what happens and what has changed in detail. - Were their dispositions curable? If so, then what's different before and after? Can this information be used in prevention or rehabilitation? Do we need to change our ethical positions based on the answers?
  * I would predict quite a lot of "accidental discoveries" to come about just from healing a few people with each known disease, doing a detailed before-and-after comparison, and looking for commonalities. 
     * For example, maybe after healing 5 people with disease X, we find that every one of them had a detectable change in serum concentration of a certain protein, hormone, or prostaglandin that was never thought to be related previously. That would open up a new avenue of research.

  It would also allow us to learn other things like:

  * What happens to a human mind when it ages well past the original limits of the human body? What is a mind with 200 years worth of memories like? (Obviously a long-term project, but it would prepare us for dealing with the psychological effects of broadly-available life extension)
  * Do people in various types of vegetative states have any conscious awareness? Just wake them up and ask them! If so, we may need to change our policies on long-term life-support for people in these conditions.
  * What happens when we "heal" people with savant's syndrome? Do they lose their abilities? If so, what changed in their brain? If not, did any of the downsides of savant's syndrome disappear? What changed in the brain to make the mental superpowers available without the side-effects? Can it be reproduced or does it teach us anything new about the brain?

  This was a fun thought experiment.

    Add to the list healing trans people. Would their mind or body adjust?

    - u/Cuz_Im_TFK:
      ```
      Oh, that's a good one! 

      Especially because it would help you learn more about how the power works and where it's drawing its definitions of "healed" and "defective" from. 

      I'm sure there are probably more creative tests that could be run to better figure out the rules (for munchkin purposes of course).

      I'd say their mind. Dysphoria requires conscious thought.
      If their body shifted, it would indicate that the power somehow queries you yourself for what you consider your ideal state. Next thing you know you "heal" someone whose ideal state (in their mind) is a monster. Or you can use it to shapeshift, if you figure out a way to trigger dysphoria artificially.

      Funny thing, in general it's not actually clear if healing someone without their consent is actually moral due to how the power works.

      In general you need a better definition of sickness to make sense of it, and you need to know which definition the "power" is using.
      ```

    - u/Sonderjye:
      ```
      This relies on the notion that transness is a disease which, aside from being medically inaccurate, is part of an attitude that literally kill people. I'm down for having no sacred cows but we should keep that in mind when having these kinds of discussions.

      As to the actual question it depends on what the power recognizes as what 'healing' consitutes. Does it have a uniform idealized version that it returns everyone to? Does it depend on the mental idea of 'healing' of the healed, of the healer, of the average of a demographic of the population, or some idea independent of humanity?

      In the first case I would expect the body, though as /u/Kuratius points out this would also mean that a small fraction of people would gain inhuman bodies. In the second case it would depend on the healers attitude. 

      I find the third case to be particularly interesting since for many people the gender that they ascribe to other people are based on appearance and if you have been on any dating app you'll know that appearances doesn't necessarily match gender. So in this case I would predict that if someone dressed up(including appropriate clothing, makeup, whatnot) then they would get the body of the gender they were presenting as. However in the case of someone not presenting as within the gender binary I would predict their mind to change, which I know for some people counts as being killed and replaced with someone else.

        Since you seem to have a strong opinion on the topic, how does being transgender differ from normal body dysmorphic disorders? For example, compared to people who are convinced their limb doesn't belong to their body, which seems superficially similar.

    Worst case scenario: It's magical enough it allows little to no research. It could just magically produce and enforce a healthy phenotype, making healthy enzymes, cells and etc. spontaneously form while harmful ones disappear for example. It doesn't change your DNA, or any indirect biomarkers we can measure it just magically makes it happen. Imagine it healing heart attack damage just by making new heart cells replace the scar tissue with no observable cause for example, it's a cure but doesn't tell us how to replicate it.

    This could still be used for a bit of research though, purposely causing damage and studying the effects without killing anyone like you said. Non-manmade would be less useful for research than most people would expect since it heals everything all at once, confounding causes, effects, and correlations to diseases. It would be the equivalent of trying to study a car by having every part replaced at once whenever one thing stops working. Engine running rough? New engine. Alzheimer's? New 21 year old brain.

    - u/Cuz_Im_TFK:
      ```
      So you're treating it as a magical healing/regeneration of obviously damaged parts + the implanting of a magical regulator/omni-organ to fix/maintain health going forward? That would indeed make many of my ideas not work, but it feels like a much stronger superpower than the one my post was based on.

      My post allows the "healing" to be as magical as it wants to be, as long as the end result of the healing is no longer inherently magical and is the result of fixing the "problems" with the current body so that it can continue functioning normally as a body. Those are the only constraints that I was working with.
      ```

      - u/RetardedWabbit:
        ```
        I'm proposing that a ongoing magical healing/regeneration effect is a possible mechanism that prevents most research. Given that it keeps them 21 and perfectly healthy apparently permanently some ongoing effect is confirmed.

        I think your constraint is larger than you think: any steps that are magically enforced prevents study of any steps before it. We don't really need to study the end results so that's the worse case scenario, we pretty well know what we want just not how to take it happen and this magic wouldn't help us study that. Any steps the magic doesn't physically change we won't be able to study, and I'm just saying that allows for healing magic that doesn't help research.

         The best case scenario is that the magic is acts in one shot: it acts to create a human body that doesn't require further magic to remain 21, healthy, and obeys physics. This could be with massive DNA rewriting to code for a robust, redundant, and healthy body along with some magic to make that express itself immediately after taking effect. This would be hugely useful for research since all we would need to do is to apply that DNA rewriting non magically to help more people.

  Imagine yourself in the shoes of a billionaire for a moment - one of the world's thousand richest men, who can buy anything that is for sale. You have a mansion on every continent and more private jets than you know what to do with. You can make or ruin a life on a whim. Laws are things that your lobbyists rewrite for you.

  But you'll still die. Soon. No power known to medicine can keep anyone alive long into their second century. Your life's probably been stressful too, so you'll be lucky to make it past 80. You have everything else you could want, but there is absolutely nothing you can do to stop a brain tumour.

  Until now.

  On the one hand, each person only needs five minutes. Some of them will be reasonable. They can pay for preferential treatment, if that's an option. If there's a lottery, surely some winners will agree to sell their tickets.

  But the richest, most powerful, oldest and most desperate men in the world... didn't all get that way by asking politely. Somebody will try to kidnap her, to keep her for himself and his family. Somebody else will stop the kidnapping, or try to take her back.

  The military will intervene to ensure her safety. Another country's military will intervene because they can do a better job. War will break out.

  A plane that was carrying her to a secure location will be shot down and crash into the ocean. Perhaps she survived - her power works on herself, doesn't it? Surely it does. Everyone wants to believe that she's OK, that she somehow survived the impact for long enough to heal herself, that she swam to safety, that the corpse eventually recovered was somehow faked. They'll hope she's gone into hiding. Perhaps they'll even be right.

  In grand total, less than 50,000 people will be healed - by the draw of the lottery, by coercion and force, by lucky circumstances that put her near them for long enough. Some of them will become minor celebrities. Scientists will try to recreate the Healer; snake oil salesmen will spring up like mushrooms. It will be remembered as the greatest humanitarian failure of all time.

  The cheesy advice would be to focus on researching how exactly the power works and trying to replicate it with classic science. No healing she could do herself would be ever comparable to the good coming from even partially successful research.

  Even if the process itself is impossible to replicate the science can still, potentially, benefit greatly from studying the effects.

  If, however, she has a good reason to believe that the healing is truly miraclous in nature and no research would ever produce any results - then it's a question of ethitcs, not rationality. Utilitarianist, pragmatist, deontologist - they would all have different answers.

  I'm purposefully leaving out other factors, like governmental and criminal response to the discovery of a real-life superpower. The answer "keep your power hidden if you don't want to be abducted and enslaved" is too boring, even if likely correct.

  Heal the rich, in exchange for massive payments of money used to help the poor, if I'm trying to maximize philanthropy. Any free seats are used to heal those closest to death, once we hit the point where money is not the limiting factor.

  Alternatively, heal those closest to death first. 

  It takes too much time to actually obtain the information to judge who is most "worthy" of life. Also, mild biases can result in massive damage.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Priority advice would be to move somewhere safe, from which she could still work effectively. In situations like this, there is probably, almost definitely going to be someone crazy/extreme enough to try and kill her. That, in my opinion, is the true traffic jam; not that deciding who to heal is hard, but that not everyone is going to react to a messiah healing figure (or, more likely, being rejected for healing by a messiah healing figure) positively. 

  If she can only heal 100 people in day anyways, and each healing only takes 5 minutes, than there is plenty of time to properly vet and check every patient for ill intent. The most pressing priority isn't figuring out how to use new Jesus most effectively; it's making sure this savior doesn't end up nailed to a cross like the last one.
  ```

- u/DoraTrix:
  ```
  Suggest she prioritize people holding public offices, in descending order of number of constitutents.  *Guaranteeing* that all world governments are run by people who are mentally well I suspect would produce a far more massive positive effect on humanity than the rest of the 100 people per day.

  Side-effect: A lot of the people she treats get out of government, because they were only there due to personality disorders, and it takes longer than you'd expect to actually stabilize with people who are mentally healthy and still want to do the job.
  ```

  - u/Argenteus_CG:
    ```
    Alternatively, selectively heal only politicians who make certain policy decisions you support, in order to incentivize all but the most principled-yet-wrong politicians to do what you want in the name of self-preservation. You might not be able to get everyone converted over to full socialism right away, but smaller-yet-vital changes like campaign finance reform, universal healthcare and drug legalization should be possible.

  I haven't seen anybody mention the fact that this superpower makes cryogenics *massively* easier. All those desperate people just need to be frozen solid, and she can work through that backlog whenever she gets time. (In order to prevent this from leading to a population explosion, a prerequisite for this procedure might be an agreement to undergo sterilization immediately afterwards.)

  This service could be divided up so that perhaps she heals 25 charity cases a day-- thaw, heal, repeat, first-come-first-served-- 25 research cases like /u/Cuz_Im_TFK mentioned (whose ticket is paid by agreement to undergo some dangerous or lethal medical research), 25 participants to be selected by lottery daily, and 25 patients who are either personally selected by the healer or who agree to pay, say, ten million dollars (enough for her to live extremely comfortably and more than enough funding for the massive cryogenics facility and attendant medical personnel.)

  The cryogenics option works even better if neuropreservation is sufficient for her healing process to do its thing. Just a huge warehouse of frozen heads, we'll get to them when we get to them-- the majority might even be revived by the medical technology gleaned from the research study participants.
  ```

  - u/Argenteus_CG:
    ```
    It's unclear if that'd even work though. Who can she bring back? I'm assuming she could save someone who's heart had recently stopped, but would cryonics work? If cryonics would work, why wouldn't some random skeleton you found buried in a graveyard? The loss of information that cryonics normally prevents clearly isn't an issue here if she can completely cure alzheimer's.

    If she CAN bring back the dead, it seems like an immediate priority should be bringing back some of the great scientists and engineers.

    If her power works on herself, it seems like her best option is to stay in hiding, bringing back scientists and engineers along with their loved ones in an effort to accelerate research into FAI or other means of immortality and health, along with working behind the scenes to ensure as many bodies as possible have well-recorded locations (this shouldn't be that hard; even in hiding, when Alan Turing and Einstein come back the benefits to doing so should be clear), so that she can work through the backlog and eventually bring as many people as possible back.

  Could 10 people go around her and touch her hands for 5 minutes and be healer simultaneously? If so, she could heal the 100 people in 50 minutes or less and be done for the day. This would give us 3.000 cures a month without putting too much burden on her.

  Going with this scenario, what I would do is to set up an clinic in a nice, central country with hired security and easy access to an airport. People wanting access to the healing would be required to already have a complete diagnostic of the problem's severity. The queue for the 3.000 "slots" would be ordered by each case's severity.

  One single slot a month would be reserved to the highest bidder in an auction, with the condition that it's still a critical health problem. One single slot a month would also be reserved for a separated queue to be filled at the request of governments all around the world, payed on a fixed rate (something a country can field easily but still considerable), also based each case's severity. Finally, one last slot a month to be used by the government of the country the clinic is set up in as they please (same rate as the others).

  This would give us a good relation with our current place of residence without being at their mercy and a mutual interest on both keeping us there and defending us from external meddling. The other countries would still have a privileged queue for cases like prominent figures and leaders, so we would cultivate a positive relationship with every country. Lastly, the auctioned slot should bring us money to run the place independently and invest back.

  The investment money would be used for: more professional security and facilities. doctors to run our own triage, mobility such as planes and helicopters we can use to move critical patients and research budget to study her special gift and see if we can learn something from it.

    You're the only one who states thing other missed: immediate consequences. Greed is great mover of the world, that's a belief I subscribe to. And the advice to this magical girl should be go on an exile, in the darkest of the night, to where nobody could recognize her. Once she successfully hid herself in a cave (or concrete jungle) somewhere, find out the extent of her ability. Self-heal should be the first to ascertain.

      You can manage a deadlock, but you need to be careful. I believe the trick is to creates a situation where the benefits of leaving her alone outweighs the risk of going for monopoly. She needs to be alive, awake and willing to heal so even the threat of a contingency should be enough to make everyone hesitate. As for the carrot, you just need everyone appeased and looking forward to their next go at the miracle.

  the solution is obvious

  auction a certain number of slots (say 10 every day) where the elite can guarantee their access

  then for the rest set up a 'heal or not' site where people can post their sob story and everyone votes on who's most worthy

  First, this is a little suspect because then the magic would have an opinion on what a "perfect" brain state is and what "brain damage" is. One has to wonder what kind of a personality change and what thoughts the magic considers "wrong."

  Second, I'd advise the healer to change her name and move to a different country and never do any actual healing. Because if the US government gets ahold of her, I think she'll become a strategic military asset and disappear.
