  Incandescence and his Orthogonal trilogy are even harder. :) (He pretty much wrote an entire physics textbook for the Riemannian universe. (Orthogonal's premise is a universe with positive definite metric, ie, a universe that's almost the same as ours with the primary difference being that time and space are fully symmetric with each other. As far as Incandescence... well, a general relativity textbook could be counted as a spoiler (or a reader's guide) for Incandescence. :))

  (Do not read unless you've already read _A Fire Upon the Deep_ and _Permutation City_)
  Read to part II

  Belated note: I love this book because it serves as a really good primer for Mathematical Universes. (By being flawed enough to leave people still wondering, but simultaneously introducing the concept)
