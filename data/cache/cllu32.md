  >History is written by the victors, but there’s nothing to guarantee they’ll be honest.

  Isn't that the whole point of that phrase?

    I agree, it's a bad first impression, I think it should just be "History is written by the victors."

  > When Nightmare Moon’s rebellion tore across Equestria, leaving a trail of blood and horror in its wake, Princess Celestia knew that merely banishing her sister wouldn’t be enough. Her army was too powerful, and too bloodthirsty, to be left behind without a leader. When she finally turned the Elements of Harmony against her, she didn’t just banish Nightmare Moon. She banished thousands.

  An AU story where Celestia banished not only her sister to the moon, but her entire army as well. Now the thousands of ponies under Luna's command must find a way to survive on the moon with nothing to rely on but medieval technology, alchemical knowledge, and a little magical assistance.

  This isn't a story about battles and sieges. This is a story about engineering and logistics. Watching Lord Commander Iron Quill and his ragtag team of advisers tackle problem after problem just to keep the army breathing is a delight.

  There's a subplot early on about the army not respecting Iron Quill (who has been newly promoted from his previous position as master of stores) and him having to prove how badass he is to gain their respect, which I didn't much care for, but now that's been resolved and the story can focus on its real strengths.

    Sounds like somebody has been playing a little too much _Oxygen not Included_

  What's up with so many pony fics making it to the top of this sub in the last few days?

    Not many people post to this subreddit, but there are a bunch of readers who come here. This makes it easy for one person to start a trend. Recently, the sub started shifting more toward Worm fanfics. Now it’s ponies again. The pony fics are pretty well entrenched in this sub’s history, actually. We’ve got [Friendship is Optimal](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal) and other [Optimalverse](https://www.fimfiction.net/group/1857/folder/4096/canon-compatible-optimalverse?order=rating) stories like [Caelum Est Conterrens](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/69770/friendship-is-optimal-caelum-est-conterrens). Then there are a bunch of stories where the authors just happened to be in the LessWrong group, which resulted in stories like [Mortal](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/95424/mortal) and [The Moon’s Apprentice](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/196256/the-moons-apprentice). There are more, but you get the point.

  Read it, can recommend. I was thinking about the title and remember the book the title is inspired by ended with the protags threatening orbital bombardment of earth to exort concessions.
  ```

- u/Lightwavers:
  ```
  Oh hey, I recently read this too. Small world, eh? Hard to make logistics engaging, but Starscribe manages it.
  ```

- u/FormerlySarsaparilla:
  ```
  I love this concept! Looking forward to diving into it.
  ```

- u/kmsxkuse:
  ```
  I can count the number of MLP fics I can stomach to read on one hand, let alone good fics.

  This is one of them. It's like the bastard child of Frostpunk and OxygenNotIncluded. I approve.

- u/lillarty:
  ```
  I see Western authors are starting to adopt the Japanese light novel's standard of having the title of your book be a paragraph-long summary of it.
  ```

  - u/Lightwavers:
    ```
    They’re not. Or at least, this one isn’t. The person who linked the story here just decided to include part of the summary in the title.
    ```
