## [Final Biweekly Challenge] Endings (Results Thread)

### Post:

Last time, the challenge was [Endings](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/agsoca/final_biweekly_challenge_endings/), and our winner is /u/Nagadac with their story [Brains of the Operation](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/agsoca/final_biweekly_challenge_endings/eej2cop/). I've also given reddit gold to everyone who participated.

A complete list of past challenges, along with their winners, [is available on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

If you're wondering why the weekly challenge is ending, it's a combination of time commitment (I am perpetually short on time) and somewhat anemic participation (which I would write some thoughts on, were I not perpetually short on time). There will probably be challenges in the future, but they'll come as unscheduled bounties, rather than as a weekly/biweekly/monthly thing, which might help with the aforementioned participation (and with visibility).

So long, and thanks for all the fish!

  You might be right that the frequency of the challenge sort of... cheapens it? Like, you always know there's going to be one next, so if you don't much feel the theme, you'll simply think "oh, I'll work on the next one" instead of thinking a bit harder about it. It's also possible that having more sophisticated prompts and themes, or optional elements to include in the story, could bolster creativity. Personally I actually find that I work better with constraints than I do without. Perhaps a reason why I enjoy writing fanfiction more than original works.

  Another idea that comes to me from r/fanfiction: length. On that subreddit they give daily prompts for extremely short works (usually 100 to 500 words). It's easier to write on impulse something of that length than it is to plan and find time to write a longer work. Stories that short can also be directly copy-pasted, read and commented in here. I think it could be fun to occasionally have 'flash contests' of that sort, for rationalist drabbles or similar.

  Someone should write a eulogy for the challenge, it has been such a long standing part of the subreddit. Though maybe since it whimpered along not ending with a bang isn't a surprise.
