  So "girls" is a gender-neutral pronoun for a mixed group (when Twilight addresses Fluttershy and Tinder together). Interesting choice; it makes sense in-universe.

  > *She realizes she's yelling and crying onstage in front of a crowd, and slumps down onto her rump, eyes wide. She's too afraid to glance to the side to count the ponies listening. She sees the twinge of magenta clouding the upper fringes of her visual field, and finds she's charging a teleport.*

  Oh god. I'd want to teleport away too.

  Thus far you've been introducing characters and following canon fairly closely. These next couple chapters I feel are going to really make or break the story. We've seen the changes you've made to everyone, and now it's time to see how that changes what happens.

  I should mention that it's kinda strange to have an interlude the chapter before the end of an arc, but considering the events that ended the arc I can see why you wouldn't really want an interruption.
