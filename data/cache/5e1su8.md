  Is it my impression or the author have no fucking clue about what is behind the wall and is trying to stretch the time as much as he can?

    Wasn't already showed when the mother communicated with the aliens? It should have just a radio station plus all the children dossiers.

      I think /u/hoja_nasredin is referring to the wall that surounds the orphanage/farm, not the hidden room.

      They're implying that the author doesn't really know what the kids are going to do after they escape, so they're stalling for time by stretching out the escape as long as possible.
      ```

      - u/munchkiner:
        ```
        Oh, *that* wall. Yes, I can see that happening.
        ```

    Well, in this chapter Emma said there's a field followed by a possible forest. The binoculars should help figure out what's immediately outside the wall. For the world, apparently they're going to use secret messenges from that author to figure out what to do.

    So I assume with these things being mentioned this chapter, the author has some idea of where the story is going to go after they escape.

    ```
    Well it's a pretty standard shounen formula.
    ```

      ```
      and most shonen turn really bad after one amazing arc. Some does not even go that far.
      ```

  ```
  Dang, you beat me! I just had to read it before I posted, hah.
  ```

- u/GlueBoy:
  ```
  Is the art getting kinda wonky or is it just me?
  ```

  - u/ghost-pacman4:
    ```
    I don't really see it, but the cover page probably took a ton of time and effort. So the rest of the art might've suffered for it.
    ```
