  I'm somewhat surprised Red and Blue are on speaking terms so soon, I thought you'd make that a story wide rift that matched the in-game rivalry.

  But more importantly, nice _fucking_ going Heonn teams. Maybe Rayquaza will bail their asses out.

    I feel like if Mewtwo isn't ready for the stormbringers he's definitely not ready for those two, Zapdos affected a single city, Groudon is collapsing this building from another country.

      I was going to correct you that they're both at least based on Japan, but the regions they're based on are on opposite sides of the country (~1000KM apart). Scary stuff!

    I like how Leaf at this point low-key likes it when she does things that makes Red blush or stammer due to his feelings, and occasionally acts in a way that will induce that reaction intentionally.

    We have name for this, Leaf: its called flirting.
    ```

    - u/ArcFurnace:
      ```
      Alternately, a specific sub-definition of "teasing". Which ends up meaning basically the same thing in the end.

      They're all young, it's fair if they don't quite realize what they're doing yet.
      ```

      - u/Memes_Of_Production:
        ```
        Oh for sure, this is not at all meant as criticism - just that if you like flirting with someone, its decent odds you like-like them. (not 100% of course)

  I love Groudon quakes being what reveals the Casino basement, the second the gang is back together.
  ```

- u/Grasmel:
  ```
  I could feel the tension building the whole chapter. Earthquakes, strange weather, the gang in one spot again and gathering at the casino, a team rocket hideout in the games. If the translation from game lore to OOS lore is what I think it is, that means there will be encounters with renegades. Exciting. 

  But now I really want to know what happens next. Curse you and your month-long cliffhangers!
  ```

  - u/ArcFurnace:

    > If the translation from game lore to OOS lore is what I think it is, that means there will be encounters with renegades.

    "Renegades don't wear shirts with a giant red 'R' on them!"
    ```

    - u/MilesSand:
      ```
      >"Renegades don't wear shirts with a giant red 'R' on them!"

      That kind of still matches the games.  You don't find out they're team rocket until the battle starts,  except if you're infiltrating their hq or some operation. It just looks like some random hiker in Mt Moon and then the battle starts and they have an R. If you take their overworld sprite as what they're actually wearing and the battle sprite as a metaphor for who they really are it fits.
      ```

    - u/Radix2309:
      ```
      But they are branded with an R arent they?
      ```

      - u/Grasmel:
        ```
        Is the branding a literal branding? I thought it was mostly metaphorical, since renegades are executed anyway.
        ```

        - u/DaystarEld:
          ```
          It is metaphorical :)
          ```

      - u/VivaLaPandaReddit:
        ```
        The casino logo is an R though 😉
        ```

- u/Memes_Of_Production:
  ```
  Extremely disappointed they won't be finding a switch behind a poster, instead relying on a legendary team-up to open up the basement Rocket base for them - that's overkill guys! Its one poster, how hard could it be?

  Also Blue/Red talking, woo! I expect that things won't actually be as easy as Blue hopes, in that they can resume friendship without digging into it - I still think Blue only even partially understands what went down even now (imo, how bad of a friend he was at that time, a partly-different topic he has yet to apologize for). But I guess it might not matter, as their stances on what to sacrifice in a dangerous situation are about to be dramatically tested; nothing better than life-or-death situation to put things into practice.

    Maybe the next chapter will be a POV interlude from May or Brendan (or both) as they're climbing the sky pillar to awaken RayRay. Could be cool just as a "what if" sorta thing, since presumably the plotlines of those games are happening simultaneously to this one.
    ```

    - u/Electric999999:
      ```
      Somehow I doubt it's going to be that easy, just wake another legend up and it all gets sorted. Then again if it doesn't get sorted easily this could go really badly really fast with the endless quakes.
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    If we go by various Pokémon canons, you can stop Kyogre and Groudon via:

    Rayquaza

    Red / Blue Orbs

    All three Regis, albeit not permanantly

    Certain machines, very temporarily.


    So my guess is Mewtwo will have to step in, as most of these as solutions aren’t available given the worldbuilding. Rayquaza is a possibility though.

  ```

  - u/ECUIYCAMOICIQMQACKKE:

    I think this situation will cause their rift to repair though, not widen... Blue can see that Red isn't a coward, and Red can see Blue isn't obsessed with his image.

      It almost definitely refers to the Seafloor Cavern, south of Mossdeep City (where the Space Center is) and east of Sootopolis City (the city built in the white-stone crater), but west of Ever Grande City (the eastern-most island associated with Hoenn, where their Pokemon League is).

- u/melmonella:
  ```
  Just finished catching up, assorted reactions:

  1) they just developed this tulpa mind technology, and we know that the way it works, one mind can be affected by a mental effect while the other one is free to act(see: red's merger with egg pokemon). We also know that red's second mind feels like something that encompasses the first, like a bubble within a bubble, to both red and other psychics(see: red's examination by the psych doctor). Further, Pressure is very likely a mental(or well, emotional) effect, mostly because I don't think there is anything else that they wouldn't have thought of guarding against by now(e.g. weird sound beyond the range of human hearing would show up on recording devices, and would be possible to fend off against with good sound insulation)

  my hypothesis thus is: can you guard against Pressure with a tulpa by just dumping the entire mental effect into one mind and subsequently ignoring it

  A thing you'd need to test before testing this if you can kill a tulpa, since you probably don't want a pressured insane mind inside your noggin.

  2) Blue can get dabbed on with his non-risk-management ethics. Here is me, dabbing on him: \o\

  3) I strongly suspect red could have made the whole storm night much safer by spending some % of that 150k bank he has on purchasing pre-trained pokemon. Given how shitty their world is, having more stuff to put between yourself and whatever is trying to kill you really seems pretty essential. A basic flier, some easy to catch pokemons with status effect attacks, something like a Tauros for the sheer bulk - surely all of those should be cheap due to supply being very significant. I can't really buy that glorified cattle would be expensive to raise in a world where you can make them follow all orders unconditionally by just putting them on a shelf in a pokeball for a week.

  A shock suit would have helped greatly too, and he was thinking of buying one all the way back in chapter 7. That whole Magnemite fight had a lot of close calls, and being immune to electricity would sure have helped. 

  All this to say: what are the chances that at least one of the common-sense purchases red could have made in order to prepare for *general* threats before that night would have helped with the whole fire hospital fiasco? A pokemon that can prevent the roof from crushing you, some firefighter suit? Hell, just a basic construciton helmet, thing fairly useful for keeping yourself alive when things fall on your head?

  I do not think assigning lower odds to this than 5% is justified, so red has at the minimum directly murdered 5% of Aiko by being insufficiently prepared for threats and not utilizing his monetary advantages.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Pokemon that are better at battling than the average trainer can capture and train themselves within a couple months are \*very\* expensive in this world, since, as you say, supply and demand. Tauros are not just good at battling, however, they're actually super rare, hence the Safari Zone nature preserve. 

    For trainers to buy their own powerful pokemon, they have to believe they will need it NOW rather than just collecting powerful pokemon for later. If you've ever played a video game and not purchased some good gear from a vendor because you might find gear just as good or better on your own soon, I'm picturing the same mentality.

    All that said, yes, underutilizing their money to gain advantages in survivability is a mistake that they made. Red in particular has his money bookmarked for other things that might help in his research, but as the end of this chapter showed a hint of, they have all definitely updated on that mistake.
    ```

    - u/R1C3M4N:
      ```
      Wait but isn’t tauros steak a thing? And I’d assume that it’s not that uncommon either, for a ball version to be made.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        It is, but it's expensive, as I don't imagine any are being raised specifically to be eaten. Sometimes they die in captivity or in battles, and selling them for meat is an obvious thing to do (especially considering how easy it is to store and transport).

        Your second comment confuses me, since it being uncommon seems like the best reason for a ball version to be prioritized, to me?
        ```

        - u/R1C3M4N:
          ```
          Really? I would think that more common foods would be turned into ball food for familiarity and comparability, since these are basically sellers giving out free samples.
          ```

          - u/DaystarEld:
            ```
            Oh there's that too, but the boat isn't exactly full of the "common folk" ;) But also, if you can generate "fake" meat that's in high demand otherwise, you can sell it for a lot more.
            ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    I doubt that tulpas are sufficiently distinct and independent to be killable, at least without substantial harm to the entire mind.
    ```

  - u/gamerpenguin:
    ```
    Tauros might he expensive because of the sheer bulk. Cattle are fully grown after 18 months, vs rats at 6 months. That would take a lot more effort and food

      a couple of extremely quick and un-thorough googles tells me a heifer cow sells for about $130/100lbs., and usually weigh (alive!) about 600lbs, for a very rough price of $780. This is probably in USD. Not cheap, but both useful and affordable.

  Oh man, when Leaf saw the quakes originating from Hoenn and I realized Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald is hitting the climax right now, I got *so* excited. I love that you’re incorporating that chronology here! And it’s how they find the rocket base! Soooooooo cooooooool!

    I've actually only played generations 1, 2, and Pokemon Uranium. Anything in particular I should know?
    ```

    - u/The_Magus_199:
      ```
      The Hoenn games (gen 3) take place at the same time as the Kanto games, and in them Team Aqua and Team Magma fight to try and awaken Kyogre and Groudon respectively, in order to try and expand the sea or the land respectively. In the climax, one or both teams succeeds, causing natural disasters (storms for Kyogre, a drought for Groudon, or the two alternating in Emerald where they both are woken up and fight each other) until the player intervenes by either defeating the woken legendary in the cave of origin, or in Emeral, waking Rayquaza so that it can stop the fighting.
      ```

- u/coltzord:

  I do have to wonder, are the player characters from the Hoenn games canon to this universe? Like, maybe they're not catching legendaries and stuff like that since this is a pretty realistically grounded series, but I guess what I'm asking is, do they exist and are they actively taking a part in helping stop the situation in Hoenn?
  ```

  - u/Electric999999:
    ```
    Not sure how active, but given what we've seen so far I wouldn't be surprised if their names pop up.
    ```

    - u/writersfuelcantmelt:
      ```
      I would love to see them, whether as actual characters with their own chapters, as brief cameos or even just in passing on the news. But then, maybe this even is what convinces them they aren't safe at home and sets them on their adventure?
      ```

  - u/Ceres_Golden_Cross:

    I wonder how strong/famous are they by know. Following the games chrology, if both mons are awaken... They have 6-7 badges, which is quite a bunch.

- u/EdenicFaithful:
  ```
  Guess we'll be seeing more of the inner workings of Team Rocket. Very interested to know more about them broadly, especially the less-sinister sides of them. Come to think of it I don't think we've seen a picture of what a low-level member's work would look like.

  Nice to see the team back together. Hoping for some Red/Blue alone time. I found Blue's perspective fascinating and they really need to hash this out.

    I've just recently become obsessed with the 2004 cult classic 'Evil Genius', where you build a lair full of mooks and henchmen, so I'm obviously an expert at this subject;   


    1. So first off, your general purpose raw man power to buy furniture, dynamite caves out and set up rooms, pick up the briefcases full of money, set up cameras and traps... the odds and ends.   


    2. You get your hospitality industry; the friendly front behind which you operate your shady business. The restaurant, hotel, resort, whatever. They'll also be at shell corporations making your business look good and profitable and stable and not at all money laundering.  


    3. Then of course the guards are trained in fighting, and can do gigs as terrorists, mercenaries, guns for hire, security, kidnappings, whatever.   


    4. The iconic researchers and technicians will run your computer systems monitoring the global situation (where can we deploy soldiers too? Who needs a fake charity to boost our image?), as well as to research new and interesting things (You know, a camera with a laser on it is basically a motion sensor, right? And this furnace we're shoveling coal into, well it's in the basement, and we could just open the floor up to it. We'll just tell everyone that works here not to step right HERE, and when the bad guys break in, they fall into the flames!)  


    Obviously all of these mooks could level up from basic grunts to karate masters or sharpshooters, from lab techs to quantum physicists, etc.   


    Don't forget, the only way to turn a henchman into anything other than a henchman is to have him kidnap a maid or plumber or something and strap them into a chair and interrogate them. Usually with Michael Jackson moves, sometimes cymbals.

    Leaf says the first earthquakes are off the east coast of Hoenn, while the seafloor cavern in the games is south of Hoenn. I guess you indended it to follow the games, and just forgot the Hoenn map is rotated 90 degrees from Kyushu IRL. That or the quakes are just very widespread, or you intended for the first one to be near Mt Chimney rather than Sootopolis. It's hard to tell what was intended here.

  Loved the chapter! I'm glad to see the team back together again, if tentatively to start with, what with them not having addressed the split itself. But it seems that may be forced to the forefront soon, or maybe even put on the back-burner while they escape (explore?) the underground rocket base.   


  Also tentative is my rising hope for Red and Leaf! We may have nudged in the right direction in this chapter, though it's still a bit shaky.  


  I must admit, the first quake I didn't connect to the showers indicating it was the Hoenn pair going at it, but it clicked a bit after. It'll be interesting to see the reaction both there and here, and I have to wonder how Giovanni will try and solve it, since he is closely related to both parties I assume he will.

This could lead to redefining themselves together, or being too different to work together, or any combination of giving up other goals to get back to adventuring or giving up adventuring because OHGODDANGER....

  - u/shankarsivarajan:
    ```
    The world is extremely well-built, as are the characters. Some scenes are so visceral that every thunderstorm, I find myself thinking of a line from the chapter with Zapdos.

    At times the characters' thoughts could stand to be a little more "show, don't tell," but this is intended as a "rationalist" story, so that's a stylistic choice. I really dislike the "therapy" chapters (basically entirely told, not shown), but they're few and far between. There's also a fair bit of woo-woo psychology, some of it taken seriously.

    I've been reading this story every month for more than five years, so let that inform how you take my critique.

    I think you've read so little that you've only seen the story's weaknesses. You should give it another shot, reading at least a few more chapters; once the cliffhangers start, I expect you'll be hooked.

    Also, I vaguely remember that the first few chapters were being rewritten. They might be better now; I haven't reread them.
    ```

  - u/stale2000:
    ```
    The big different between the early chapters, and now, is that, the characters have grown up.  


    Early on, the character truly felt like 11 year olds (which doesn't make for a great story), and now, after going through quite a few significant ordeals, and after years of in story time, it feels like the characters have grown up quite a bit.
