  Archer threw up about 70 death flags at the end there. I'm pretty afraid for her.
  ```

  - u/Weebcluse:
    ```
    Hmm, I think Archer is safe. There wasn't any declarations of love, just casual sex. Archer starts it after Cat admits that she doesn't know how to stop thinking about narrative. Looks like a calculated move on Archer's part to force Cat to unwind.
    ```

    - u/soonnanandnaanssoon:
      ```
      Hmm I took the phrase "Just for tonight" they mentioned at the end as a death flag because if Archer dies in the battle, they'll technically only be sleeping with each other for that specific night and never again.

      &#x200B;

       I also interpreted the sex scene as part of a trope in stories where protagonist & love interest beds each other the night before and on the next day the love interest gets unsuspectedly murdered, which becomes a pivot for the protagonist. Considering that they've mentioned this is a Below-backed story, this could potentially be a pivot point for Below to empower Cat.
      ```

  - u/BaggyOz:
    ```
    Wasn't there an interlude where a similar thing happened between Ranger and Black early on in their careers? So I think Archer is safe, especially if this was all planned by her, which it might be. I can easily see her doing this to tune Cat up for the coming fight and maybe lay the groundwork for Cat to get a sudden level up during the fight when Archer is in danger/injured.

    While it might be a death flag in the meta, in the meta-meta (this is getting weird) it would be weird for Masego to lose both his parents and then Indrani.

      In the meta-meta-meta, this is not really a happy story.

    - u/Dent7777:
      ```
      In the Meta Meta, that could be a part of a move towards bringing Masego out of his shell. Whether he'll be anyone's ally after the related emotional trauma is unclear.
      ```

- u/Iwasahipsterbefore:
  ```
  Huh. Even if Maseago did figure out that he has a girlfriend, I don't think he'd mind sharing all too much. The entirety of the woe is ***his***, the particulars wouldn't matter much. He'd view the hangups as petty mortal morals.
  ```

  - u/AntiChri5:
    ```
    He isn't the jealous sort, loves Cat, and has absolutely no interest in sex. Probably be happy someone else is taking care of all the wet squishy stuff so he can study.

    I mean, there *was* a chapter where those three curled up in bed together.
    ```

  Well that was a long time coming. Such a long time coming in fact that my prediction went full circle and i ended up thinking it never would.

  This chapter gave a lot of much needed explanation for prior events and some even more needed sense of import and scale to this whole arc. It's starting to feel a bit more meaningful and less contrived now.

  > It’s wasn’t impossible to throw around the kind of workings I’d seen fae royalty employ, it just wasn’t possible without going fucking crazy.

  Here's our explanations for both why a) Cat struggled against a lesser tier Mighty and b) why abandoning the Mighty in Arcadia was actually dangerous to them. An Insane Winter Cat could steamroll any Mighty and when the Mighty were left in Arcadia insane fae royalty were what they were exposed to.

  My main question now, is..
  >  if I’d led the army I currently commanded against Diabolist at Second Liesse we would have ripped her to shreds. Hells, unless the Lone Swordsman had a very good story at his back Urulan would have torn through the poor fucker in an hour’s work and gone for a drink afterwards.

  ..if this is true then why hasn't Cat gone back to Callow with her OP Drow army? Yes, she stands to gain more but she is also taking a gigantic risk by trying to topple Sve Noc. Her current army is a huge power boost and is, most importantly, far stronger than she would have hoped to find when she entered Drow territory in the first place. I mean she has 10+ Cat-equivalent-power Mighty alone and there is no way she was suspecting to gain that much when she arrived. The potential benefits from the dwarf deal surely aren't worth the risk.

  Have i missed some prior reason given for why Cat isn't just cashing in her winnings and gating out? Has she constrained herself in some way with her Dwarf bargain or Drow oaths?
  ```

  - u/signspace13:
    ```
    Because she made a deal. Remember, the deal with the dwarves was that she would be allowed to recruit so long as she killed the Sve Noc, leaving it alive would break the deal, something Cat isn't physically capable of. That extra power gain is also worth it in the end as well.
    ```

    - u/greiskul:
      ```
      Even if she could break the deal, it's a deal with the dwarves. You don't want to betray the dwarves was a pretty clear thing. The only race more scary then the dwarves in this story is the gnomes.
      ```

    - u/Malek_Deneith:
      ```
      Actually...

      > "You need the Sve Nocte removed and the Gloom lifted. I believe I can deliver this."

      That's the wording I could find in the chapter they were making the deal. While this does *imply* killing Sve Noc, I feel like this could be weaseled out off byt making Sve take the oaths, then ordering her to remove the Gloom and take her to Callow, therefore *removing* her from Everdark.
      ```

      - u/GeeJo:
        ```
        I don't think the dwarves would even consider this weaseling. 

        They don't really care about Sve Nocte at all other than as an obstacle to territorial expansion, and they care about the surface world even less.
        ```

    - u/sparkc:
      ```
      Re-reading the Dwarven negotiations it appears you're correct (though the specifics are a little vague, frustratingly). I don't agree at all that the power gain is worth the risk considering that without protagonist armour Cat is 50/50 *at best* up against Sve Noc, though ultimately it's irrelevant because she has made oath.
      ```

  - u/haiku_fornification:
    ```
    It was made fairly clear in the fight against Urulan that Cat wasn't going full out. She hasn't used her domain nor did she link in with Akua to use greater workings. People (and Cat herself) use it to make a false equivalence between her power and what the drow can dish out, when in reality she did half of what we've seen her do against Skein, and even that would be sufficient is she fought smarter. She struggled because she was an overconfident idiot.
    ```

    - u/sparkc:
      ```
      So i'm willing to buy that if Cat fought at the level she did against Skein then she would have dealt with Urulan. What i dont buy is that the interpretation the text is selling to me is that it was clear she wasn't going all out and that Cat is mistakenly making false equivalences. Here is a quote from her fight with Urulan:

      > I realized, dimly, that if this went through entirely I might actually die. I’d treated the Everdark like a training exercise, sometimes almost a game, but I’d been swimming in the shallows of this sea. There were monsters in the deeps that would make these look like imps. I close my eyes and let Winter loose. Frost formed all over my body, rapidly thickening and then shooting out. They had a globe of Night, I had a globe of ice. In a pissing contest of raw power, I’d bet on me every time. The Night ate into the ice but I kept pouring out Winter, its delighted laughter sounding softly in my ears. At first it devoured quicker than I made, but I dug in my heels and truly let loose. It became even, and I felt my blood turn cold as I dug even deeper. 

      By no means does that indicate that Cat is holding back (though i agree that information we know from the Skein fights may suggest so). After this fight against Urulan we have:

      - Cat mentioning again how she almost died

      - Akua talking to Cat about the fact she almost died and needs to use Winter more like a mage (not, 'fight like you did against Skein')

      - Cat mentioning how she doesn't think she could take the high tier Mighty in (insert whatever name Drow city she was in)

      - Cat mentioning again in this chapter how strong the Might are compared to herself and how she could beat them but would need to let Winter loose more

      If interpretation A is that i am supposed to read this and go 'ah, Cat is making that same false equivalence and erroneous judgement again that she has five times in as many chapters' and interpretation B is 'inconsistent writing' then i'm sliding down Occam's razor and going with B.
      ```

      - u/haiku_fornification:
        ```
        I think not using her domain is fairly indicative of holding back, or at least not going all out. We've seen her unleash it on all the significant opponents so far (Skein, Saint, etc.) and I would argue its use signifies the kid gloves are off. The fact she almost died is pointing to how overconfident and ineffective she was rather than making a statement on how powerful the drow are. That's how I interpret it anyway.

        Don't get me wrong, I expect the drow in Holy Tvarigu to be more powerful than her. However, nothing I've seen from the sigil-holders in her cabal leads me to believe they could survive her domain or even match the level of destruction she's capable of.
        ```

        - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
          ```
          Yeah, Cat has been banging it over our heads (EE as well) that Cat was cocky and didn't take the Mighty seriously. She keeps mentioning how Black would've smacked her upside the head if he saw that fight.
          ```

  - u/tavitavarus:
    ```
    >The potential benefits from the dwarf deal surely aren't worth the risk.

    I suspect breaking her word to the Kingdom Under would be a very bad idea.

    Besides the rewards for killing Sve Noc will provide her with leverage against the Crusade and gold to pay for supplying all the drow she's gathering. Without that she'll be hard pressed just to feed them all.
    ```

  ```
  >“And he is an irredeemable madman,” Indrani murmured. “To think like you do, it takes… something. Stepping out of yourself, of who you are, and making a story of it. Like all the world is a stage. How strange it must be, to always act like there is an audience. I can hardly imagine the weight of it.”

  It's going to be hard to pretend to be shocked when the Priestess is revealed to be a drider. So I guess it's going to be revealed that all higher-level drows are in fact driders. And the 200 killers from that cabal are going to come crawling down a hole in the ceiling like that Moria scene in LoTR.

  I liked this chapter. Cat and Idrani sitting around, talking about the important issues, and advancing their character arcs. I'm a fan of this series mostly for the characters and the world building, and this was a good chapter for both. Acknowledging some of the inherent shittiness of what they're doing, talking about their place in the game of the Gods,speculating about Sve, discussing future plans (if somewhat opaquely) and of course their relationship. Good stuff.

  There was also talk on what stories are in play, which I appreciate. I feel like too often the story, at least recently, is left as some vague, nebulous, and yet all-powerful force that you can't really guess at. If we don't know the shape of things in advance, then there are too many tropes and archetypes to really narrow down which ones are at play, and (at least for me) it can feel somewhat arbitrary when it's revealed in hindsight which ones were at play. So yeah, I enjoyed the story talk.

  (Although I did find it kind of funny, how Cat apparently missed the narrative forming around them and then not even a minute later Archer talked about how strange it is that Cat pays so much attention to the story)


  It did revisit the plot problems I had with the last chapter though - where the seven sigil-holders of Lotow completely gave up all of their resistance to being enslaved after a day (or up to a week, which is hardly any better). Again, Cat hyped up Urulan, comparing him both to her now (as one of the top ten most powerful beings on the continent), to Will (who Urulan would have put down without issue), and describing what sort of destruction he'd carve through the Procer/Callow. She even specifically said how a cohort of Drow that powerful would take half the heroes on the continent to put them down. But a cohort of Drow entered Arcadia and started rethinking selling themselves into slavery not even 24 hours later? This does not seem like the Arcadia we saw in Books 1 through 3. Whatever, I guess I'll write it up as first draft weirdness and try not to think about it too much.

  But there was also (more) confirmation that Night can be harvested from those who do not already have Night, which I personally appreciated, as I've been arguing this point for something like a month now.
  ```

  - u/tavitavarus:
    ```
    >She even specifically said how a cohort of Drow that powerful would take half the heroes on the continent to put them down.

    I strongly suspect Cat is wrong about this. I'm nearly certain that the Heavenly Light will turn out to be a near perfect counter for the Night.

    Not to mention a bunch of subterranean monsters coming to the surface, slaughtering innocents to gain power, is setting themselves up for a heroic story. Even more so with the Grey Pilgrim on the heroes side to nudge things the right way.
    ```

    - u/Agnoman:
      ```
      I can definitely see a Light-Night interaction happening. Hell, from a Watsonian perspective it's probably needed just to keep narrative tension and stop Cat from steamrolling the continent. (Assuming some pesky Hero doesn't develop an aspect that lets them 'Free' the Drow from their oaths or some such).

      But I'm not sure the heroic story impacts Cat's analysis. I think we can count on Cat "I'm always thinking about the story and it weirds out my friends" Foundling to have thought about the story implications. Hell, she explicitly factored the story into her Urulan vs Lone Swordsman calculations.

      I also don't think that any of this hugely impacts on my broader point in that paragraph, which is that it's weird that seven Drow (who Cat thinks could tear threw the continent and destroy one of the more effective heroes we've seen without effort) would spend an afternoon in Arcadia and then decide that they should sign up for that slavery thing. Arcadia doesn't have Heavenly Light. Maybe there was an interaction with whatever Summer is now? Although that's a bit of a stretch, as they were dropped on the edge of Winter.

        They need to eat bud. And they presumably were in the part of winter that bordered the new court, so the weather didn't really go well for the drow either. You should be surprised that some even held out for 7 days when there was no food, no shelter, surrounded by hostile fae, and I presume having the effects of night cut off since they were in a different realm?
        ```

        - u/Frommerman:
          ```
          Arcadia is full of old monsters, and the reason Cat wasn't crushed by them last time is because she is uniquely suited for manipulating Arcadia's physics. Stories are the law, there, and Cat is constantly aware of the stories she's spinning. Coupled with her human Free Will (TM) and it's a wonder she had any difficulty at all.

          Arcadia is the perfect place for Cat to conquer because the relative power differentials between her and her foes don't matter when she can make a story to beat them. Mighty of the Everdark don't have that advantage. The story foisted upon them was of the displaced generals, tricked into imprisonment on a faraway and hostile world and beset on all sides by incomprehensible fiends. It's no wonder they lost so fast, with a story like that, in a world where only stories matter.
          ```

          ```
          >They need to eat bud. And they presumably were in the part of winter that bordered the new court, so the weather didn't really go well for the drow either.

          Explicitly not an issue, pal:

          >Nodoi and Vasyl had held out for three and five days, respectively, finding no trouble living off the land but no way back to the Everdark either

          Not to mention that these things have never been issues for anyone else who's been in Arcadia, ever.

          >and I presume having the effects of night cut off since they were in a different realm?

          Big assumption with nothing to back it.

          Remember, the first time we met Drow was outside the Everdark, and they had no issue doing their Night tricks.

          And then this chapter Cat is imaging what the Drow could do outside the Everdark, and she's very clearly imagining that they would have the power of the Night on their side. After months and months amonst the Drow, with Ivah to explain how Night works, you'd figure she would know.
          ```

          - u/cyberdsaiyan:
            ```
            Hmm, in that case, then it's likely that the Night urges the holders to remain in the Everdark. Considering the Sve Noc didn't want/couldn't let any of her followers leave the Everdark, I assume that being in a different realm for them was stripping them of their purpose? Which may be why defeating Sve Noc is required for Cat to actually *get* her army, and not just slaves who keep getting urges to go back into Everdark.

            Or perhaps they were concerned about what happens to their home when they weren't around? Who knows. We don't have a POV from them, but something about not being able to return to the Everdark had them throwing their pride away. Combined with Cat's hypothesis that the bargain of duration is not a problem for the Drow, it builds a clearer picture, though still somewhat vague.
            ```

            - u/Agnoman:
              ```
              >then it's likely that the Night urges the holders to remain in the Everdark

              This is supported by absolutely nothing in the text.

              > Which may be why defeating Sve Noc is required for Cat to actually get her army, and not just slaves who keep getting urges to go back into Everdark.

              Defeating Sve Noc is a requirement because of the Dwarves.


              >Or perhaps they were concerned about what happens to their home when they weren't around? Who knows

              Yeah, not the vibes I got from them. Signing up into a life of slavery were they had approximately 0 autonomy wouldn't solve this problem anyway.

              > but something about not being able to return to the Everdark had them throwing their pride away. 

              Not just throwing their pride away, but deciding that their vow to kill cat for what she'd done, and their utter disdain for the idea of signing away their free will and living under the threat of death in a slave-army pointed at the heart of the Everdark, which will then be used to enforce the Liesse Accords in what's presumably a fight against anyone and everyone on the continent.

              All this in under a day.

              (Also, just for the record, if the Drow's goal was to get back to the Everdark and remain there, signing oaths that give up all of their free will and involve protecting Callow seems like a very inefficient way to go about it)

      Yeah, but the other story - the one Cat is telling - is of a fallen people saved at the last moment from complete annihilation, then participating in the defending the land that took them in from the same fate.

      Gonna be a great quip slug fest over this, I'm sure.

    >But a cohort of Drow entered Arcadia and started rethinking selling themselves into slavery not even 24 hours later? This does not seem like the Arcadia we saw in Books 1 through 3.

    I think you might just be forgetting some of the more impressive feats we saw from the fae nobility in book 3. Just off the top of my head, there was that one guy who lifted up most of a lake and turned it into levitating walls of water twenty feet high around the entirety of a port-

    >There was a Count in there who had water sorcery, and the prick had been cautious enough so far we hadn’t been able to reach him. When I’d gone to lead the charge he’d surrounded the entire port in a wall of water twenty feet high, and while I could have probably forced my way through that I was unwilling to exhaust myself on a second stringer.
    ****
    >Hierophant’s arms were held up and shaking as he dealt with what looked like a small lake of levitating water. That was a lot bigger than I’d thought it would be. 

    Or the Duchess of Restless Zephyr, who destroyed entire formations of soldiers and created localized earthquakes with a single blow, and had a cool desiccation power-

    > I moved before the thought was finished, and that was the only reason I survived. The hem of my cloak was caught in the area where her power surged, and the cloth thinned and dried instantly. Considering the amount of water there was in my body, the thought of what would have happened to me if I hadn’t moved was chilling. 
    ****
    >I struck down with my sword and the ball of winds followed, smashing into her and detonating. Dry winds howled all around as the arm she brought up to shield herself was ground out of existence, her tall silhouette plummeting down like a gold of old had kicked her back down to Creation. My control over the winds was beginning to wane, and I hurriedly forced them down to follow the Duchess. She’d fallen in the back of the lines of golden fae, the ground heaving at the impact, and that was where the winds unleashed the fullness of their fury. Fae were scattered like insects, the hurricane my opponent had meant to destroy me with blooming life a flower in every direction.

    Or the Lady of Cracking Ice, with literally the lowest rank of fae title, still being able to make a guy just shatter without any visible projectile or spell-

    >“Who are you to-“ the soldier began, before a fracture line ran along the length of his body.

    >His eyes widened, then he fell into a shower of shards.

    >“I am bored with this interlude,” the Lady of Cracking Ice said. “Shall we proceed?”

    Not to mention that fae travel in hunting parties of four or more, meaning that even if one of the Mighty might be a step or so above the average fae noble, he'd be facing down multiple peer-level opponents with abilities he's never seen before-

    >About an hour in we ran into a hunting party. Not in the sense that they were hunting for us, but in the way that Callowan nobles hunted deer and rabbit. There were a dozen fae, all mounted on too-perfect white horses, but among those only four mattered. Two men and two women, colourfully dressed where the others were in drab blue-grey and armour. The nobles – for I was relatively certain that was what they were – immediately took the lead and diverted their party towards us.

    Personally, I don't think it's at all ridiculous that the Mighty would have a hard time in Arcadia, especially since there's no indication that they have any idea how to manipulate the narrative in their favor, which is a pretty huge disadvantage against these opponents.

      >I think you might just be forgetting some of the more impressive feats we saw from the fae nobility in book 3.

      I appreciate you grabbing quotes, but these examples really don't hold up against the Mighty. Urulan alone and in two minutes pulled out a list of powers that went something like this:

      Dissolving matter, shooting laser beams, preventing Cat's immortal construct body from healing, physically binding someone made of mist, shattering Winter-made ice with a gesture, transmuting mist into acid, flying, seeing through glamours, and causing matter to explode.

      and fought a Faerie Queen to a standstill. Yeah, Cat's not at full Queenly strength, but she's a damn bit more impressive than those lesser nobles.

      >Not to mention that fae travel in hunting parties of four or more, meaning that even if one of the Mighty might be a step or so above the average fae noble, he'd be facing down multiple peer-level opponents with abilities he's never seen before

      Meanwhile the fae would be facing a group of seven being stronger than fae, who have abilities they've never sen before, and who grow stronger with every kill.

      Limit the Drow to just stronger than the average Fae noble... and they still don' t have a huge reason to sell themsleves into slavery inside of 24 hours.


      >especially since there's no indication that they have any idea how to manipulate the narrative in their favor, which is a pretty huge disadvantage against these opponents.

      First off, I'm not sure why you're assuming that these Drow, who re full of Secrets, would be ignorant on the basic physics engine of the world. Stories are hardly obscure knowledge. Add to that that the drow actually know about the Fae and Arcadia,  or the 'Splendid" and "the garden of the Splendid" as they call them.

      Secondly, stories in Arcadia are the sort of thing you can fall into *accidentally*, and the Drow were given one hell of a set-up, after Cat went Classic Evil on them, with a monoluge about how inevitably they would become her minions, walking away from the trap she'd put them in, and them vowing that they would kill her for what they've done. Arcadia has to follow the script, and we've seen what follows when someone says "you'll never get away from this".
      ```

      - u/paradoxinclination:
        ```
        >and fought a Faerie Queen to a standstill. Yeah, Cat's not at full Queenly strength, but she's a damn bit more impressive than those lesser nobles.

        Well, not really? In both cases- Urulan didn't fight Cat to a standstill, he lost without even driving Cat to use her domain, despite having multiple advantages (centuries of experience, time to observe her before battle, two powerful rylleh) and Cat fighting significantly under even her current potential. 

        And secondly, Cat hasn't really pulled out any feats that are more impressive than a middling-tier fae noble yet. In terms of raw power, by far her most impressive feat so far was picking up half a lake to throw at the crusaders, but that was only while Akua (who has significantly more skill with manipulating magic and a greater ability to control herself through the effects of principle alienation, effectively giving her access to more power) was in control, and even then that only makes her roughly the equal of a single fae Count. 

        Cat, despite her theoretical power ceiling being very high, doesn't actually have access to most of that power, and isn't terribly skilled at using the power she *does* have. Things will change after she has access to a full court of nobles to shunt her principle alienation off to, but right now I wouldn't rank Cat as much more dangerous than a fae Count or Duke. 

        >Meanwhile the fae would be facing a group of seven being stronger than fae, who have abilities they've never sen before, and who grow stronger with every kill.

        Except the chapter made it pretty clear that the drow *didn't* stick together. The Mighty all split up into ones and twos and basically did their own thing- how could Mighty Orelik just disappear if he was literally standing alongside six other Mighty? 

        >First off, I'm not sure why you're assuming that these Drow, who re full of Secrets, would be ignorant on the basic physics engine of the world. Stories are hardly obscure knowledge.

        They actually kind of are. Cat had a pretty damn good education by the standards of most Calernians, and she had absolutely no idea that narrative force was an actual thing that Named had to deal with. Worse, the drow have been isolated for centuries in an environment were there are no Named. Any knowledge that remains after all this time will be broken up into pieces and mostly disregarded as useless even beyond that, because it actually *is* useless to the drow. 

        >Secondly, stories in Arcadia are the sort of thing you can fall into accidentally, and the Drow were given one hell of a set-up, after Cat went Classic Evil on them, with a monoluge about how inevitably they would become her minions, walking away from the trap she'd put them in, and them vowing that they would kill her for what they've done. Arcadia has to follow the script, and we've seen what follows when someone says "you'll never get away from this".

        Thing is, and I know I've already argued this with you, the Mighty are not heroes. The narrative doesn't automatically settle into one that's favorable to them because this is a villain versus villain fight, and you can be basically as nasty as you want in those. I'm pretty sure one of the recent chapters said almost literally that. In fact, it's more likely that the Mighty were *already* in a narrative when they were dropped into Arcadia, that being 'arrogant nobles are humbled by a powerful outsider.' In which case, Arcadia would probably be just that much deadlier and more unpleasant for them, and the fae would be riding a strong narrative in any battles.

      Not very good one's though. Check out the impact of the story she used with the Duke of Violent Squalls:

      >It wasn’t handing me the victory in a handbasket – the fake prophecy hadn’t been well-crafted enough for that – but I’d touched the story just enough I could twist it. That there was a *chance* for me to win. 

      and compare it to what she said about Urulan and Will:

      >Hells, unless the Lone Swordsman had a very good story at his back Urulan would have torn through the poor fucker in an hour’s work and gone for a drink afterwards.

      So Cat, back when she was still just the Squire with only two aspects to her name, beat a Winter Duke at the centre of his power using a shitty story. The Lone Swordsman, who was roughly comparable to Cat when she was this powerful, needed a very strong story to even stand a chance of winning against Urulan. It's pretty clear that Urulan is a more powerful figure than the Duke.

      And the Duke was one of the biggest boys in town - a Duke is essentially the highest rank of nobility outside of royalty. This puts Urulan near the top of the Arcadia food-chain. There were seven Drow, all stronger than it. What was going to braek them in a day? Sure, the king/queen could have wiped the floor with it, assuming they were hanging out at the edge of winter and immediately jumped into a fight with them, but then the Mighty would have died, instead of signing themselves into slavery.

      For added fun, Will survived running around Arcadia for six months while being hunted by the Wild Hunt. If we say that he was backed by a very good story (which makes sense, he had that pattern of three running in the background), that puts him as roughly comparable to Urulan (or, at least, at the point where Urulan doesn't "tear though him", but let's be generous), then any one of these Drow should by all rights have been fine. And there were seven of them. And they started accepting slavery in a day.

        Arguably, there being seven of them is a drawback in this case. Perhaps the two who were the first ones to sign up did so because otherwise the rest would have murdered them, what with them being put in a nice position outside of the support of their sigils.

        what story does Urulan bring to the table against the Fae? Is it even possible for him to think story-wise, considering his life in a kill or be killed culture? Fae power is extremely high, but balanced by the fact that they have to conform to the story, no matter how much of a fickle connection it is. Would someone like Urulan even be capable of thinking from the perspective, considering how he got to where he is?

        Also Will had a lot of support and had an external story running, which meant that the Wild Hunt had really no way of killing him there. It was functional immortality and he abused it to get some harsh training in.

        Stories are very much a part of Fae balance, so what Cat is implying is that Urulan could have killed Will even with the powerful story backing him, because he's a mortal, and only confined to stories on a small to medium level. And so, a bunch of more powerful than average people are stuck in Arcadia with no food, harsh weather and Fae surrounding them. Fae that are definitely trivial for them to defeat **IF** they even have a sliver of story backing. Once again, consider whether the top dogs from a "kill or be killed" culture can *think* in any terms other than martial might, and you will understand why they had to yield.

          Not Urulan - the seven drow who were locked in Arcadia.

          How about the one where a villain monolouged at them about her nevitable victory, locked them in what was meant to be a death trap and walked away, told them how soon they would join her side, and then they viewed how they would kill her for this?

          That's more of a hero's story? Doesn't really matter in Arcadia, Cat commented on that literally the first time she entered Arcadia.

          > Is it even possible for him to think story-wise, considering his life in a kill or be killed culture?

          ???

          What does this have to do with stories?

          >Fae power is extremely high

          Also on average it's way, waay below Cat, who is self-describedly one of the top ten most dangerous Named on the surface of calernia. And Urulan, who was a peer of these guys and explitly weaker than them, was able to give Cat a close fight.

          >And so, a bunch of more powerful than average people

          Yeah. This is an understatement to the point where it's disingenuous. You just read the bit where Cat marvelled at the strength of Urulan, right?

          >no food, harsh weather

          Not an issue: "Nodoi and Vasyl had held out for three and five days, respectively, finding no trouble living off the land" (Book 4, Chapter 69: Peerage)

          >Fae that are definitely trivial for them to defeat IF they even have a sliver of story backing.

          Or without. Urulan's fight scene was more impressive than the Duke's by  country mile, and Cat just got finished describing what a group of Urulan-equivalents would be capable of. Spoiler: It's more impressive than anything a fae who wasn't royalty did.

          >Once again, consider whether the top dogs from a "kill or be killed" culture can think in any terms other than martial might, and you will understand why they had to yield.

          They weren't the top dogs. Not by a long shot. Cat in this chapter called one of their peers a "second-stringer by Drow standards". They ruled a city, but that city was a relative hole surrounded by much, much stronger Drow.

            Cat has the well of power but cannot use it like a top tier Fae would without going insane.

            What story do they have that could possibly help them in fighting Fae? Cat had to actually cook one up to beat the Duke, and even in trying to get *into* the heart of winter, she had to deceive the Fae and play on them being strictly tied to narrative, and often winning fights by forcing monologues while her backup arrived etc etc.

            I'm asking whether anyone of the 7, considering the culture they grew up in, could have the mindset to actually do something like this?

            >Or without. Urulan's fight scene was more impressive than the Duke's by country mile, and Cat just got finished describing what a group of Urulan-equivalents would be capable of. Spoiler: It's more impressive than anything a fae who wasn't royalty did.

            The problem is, Cat can't really draw the full power of Winter without properly shunting it's influence on her mind. So it wasn't really as much Fae royal vs Mighty drow, than Fae royal able to use only a small amount of her power while underestimating her enemy.

            "they’d only changed their minds after Mighty Orelik vanished without a trace. Sooner or later, those treading the domain of the fae were found by them"

            It makes sense that the Fae are a whole new enemy for them, they haven't encountered their kind before, they don't know what Fae can do, they don't have their sigil with them, and they are in enemy territory without proper food shelter or backup, all of which were locked by Catherine. For a culture where survival and rising in power is prized above all, it would also be trivial to choose survival over the possibility of imminent death.

              Cat was also orders of magnitude weaker than any one of these Drow individually.

              And her narrative twisting against the Duke amounted to very little, not handing her victory but giving her a "chance" in a contest of skill and power, which she then won 

              >I'm asking whether anyone of the 7, considering the culture they grew up in, could have the mindset to actually do something like this?

              Why would their culture lock them out of creative thinking? If anything they'd be *more* likely to prize thinking of creative ways to kill and gain the upper hand in fights.

              I said this in my first reply, but Cat with only a fraction of her power is still in the top ten Named on the surface of Calernia, able to take on a good half dozen heroes and win.

              >It makes sense that the Fae are a whole new enemy for them, they haven't encountered their kind before, they don't know what Fae can do,

              Couple of things here.

              1 - the Far also have no clue about the Drow or the Night, as far as we are aware.

              2 - the Drow *do* know about the Far and Arcadia. They call them the "Splendid" and "the Garden of the Splendid" respectively.

Now have the queen of winter, cat, feeling actively hostile towards the drow in her realm.

        That's because Will would have to fight Urulan in Creation, where the story can be undermined by the earthly practicalities (like the acid dissolving him faster than he can Rise). Cat also essentially had the King of Winter on her side (both by story and by intent), which gave her an opportunity to partially be empowered through a narrative time paradox.

        Also, keep in mind that the fae would have the number advantage and actual familiarity with their powers, both of which Cat lacks. Top it off with stuff like drow's first instinct when in danger being to harvest each other, Slaus risking most of all and the pressure of having been separated from their sigils, and the terms of the victor (only somewhat more strict than usual) start looking reasonable for them.

          "Narrative time paradox"?

          Anyway, we saw the sum total of the story manipulations - I quoted it up above.

          >Also, keep in mind that the fae would have the number advantage and actual familiarity with their powers, both of which Cat lacks.

           I don't think saying that Cat is weaker than the fae really holds water, when even unfamiliar with her power she's happy to call herself one of the "ten most danerous Named on Calernia's surface". A point Cat herself raised when discussing how strong Urulan was, and how strong a group of Urulan's would be.

          Do you think all but ten or so Named would be weak enough that entering Arcadia would be so mentally scaring that they decide to sign away their free will in a day?

          Like it or not, Cat's one of the bigger fish in Arcadia now, and Urulan, who was weak and alone when compared to these seven, was someone who could give her a run for his money. There's not much that could have threatened him in Arcadia, let alone seven stronger versions of him. Let alone challenge seven stronger versions of him to the point where they decide to sign away their free will inside of a day.

          And fae that are weaker than them would have (a) provided a meal that increased their power, and (b) offered a way out, assuming they could make gates.


          >Top it off with stuff like drow's first instinct when in danger being to harvest each other

          The chapter they got thrown into Arcadia was literally the same chapter we got introduced to cabals.

          >Slaus risking most of all 

          Do you remember what Slaus' last line was before being dropped in Arcadia? Because I do:

          >“Obedience is not our way,” Mighty Slaus said. “The terms must be changed.”

          they really don't like cat's demands. And these demands are, I quote, "not their way".

          >the terms of the victor (only somewhat more strict than usual)

            ```
            > "Narrative time paradox"?

            In the sense that she would "have always had" the signet ring giving her a claim to the Duke's power, and the King's "promise" to empower her. It didn't actually give Catherine the title before she killed Auster, but it *did* put her into situations where their powers could be matched (the duel without champions on the Duke's side vs. Urulan's rylleh blowing Cat up for half of the fight, the fae going into close quarters and allowing Cat to track him vs. the drow just spewing acid onto her general vicinity, generally gloating and temporizing vs. shutting down everything she was trying to set up). Duke of Violent Squalls had survived, if anything, more hits, but kept coming for the opponent fated to slay him, while Urulan made only one major mistake - approaching the "corpse" - but it killed it almost instantly.

            If you want to see how fighting a fairy without a story actually looks like, go back to the Rider of the Host - who had been essentially wiping floor with Cat until she realized she has the narrative to turn the tables on him.

            > Do you think all but ten or so Named would be weak enough that entering Arcadia would be so mentally scaring that they decide to sign away their free will in a day?

            No, because one of the core qualities to a Named is will, and that matters in Arcadia. Unlike those, the Mighty also have assets and followers left in Creation that matter almost as much as personal power (otherwise they would have been with the Longstride cabal) - assets they would lose even should they find a way out on their own.

            > Like it or not, Cat's one of the bigger fish in Arcadia now, and Urulan, who was weak and alone when compared to these seven, was someone who could give her a run for his money.

            Cat also, you know, didn't fight him in Arcadia. The reason only the titled fae can cross into Creation on their own is that they lose much of their power in the process. Nor did Urulan fight alone: he lost almost as soon as he had noone to keep Cat away from him.

            > And fae that are weaker than them would have (a) provided a meal that increased their power, and (b) offered a way out, assuming they could make gates.

            She dropped them in Winter. The Unseelie wouldn't have shown themselves without ensuring they had a drop on a lone Mighty. That said, I suspect you're right about Orelik being the grain of sand that will send the whole thing tumbling down.

            > they really don't like cat's demands. And these demands are, I quote, "not their way".

            More their way than being harvested, I imagine. A cabal doesn't really work against the enemy who'll be gone with all of your posessions by the time you find and subdue a fae powerful enough to bring you back.

            > "you will obey every one of my commands, follow all of my restrictive rules, or the magic I put in your brains will instantly kill you"

            Not sure if the terms of command were extended past the time of war, actually:

              This fight is still less impressive than Urulan's. If Cat had been literally anyone else, she would have been dead after the first exchange. And then dead several times more before the fight was over. The Rider, however, did not land anything that would have been a death blow.

              >No, because one of the core qualities to a Named is will and that matters in Arcadia

              This is true, but being individually somewhat equivalent to the faerie queen who's one of the ten most dangerous people on Calernia is *also* important, in Arcadia and everywhere else.

              Especially when you can eat Fae you kill to gain even more power and knowledge.


              >Nor did Urulan fight alone: he lost almost as soon as he had noone to keep Cat away from him.

              If your argument is that Urulan was actually unimpressive all along, then Cat disagreed with you in this very chapter.


              >More their way than being harvested, I imagine. A cabal doesn't really work against the enemy who'll be gone with all of your posessions by the time you find and subdue a fae powerful enough to bring you back.

              If keeping their possessions was the goal, signing themselves into slavery did not accomplish it.

              >Not sure if the terms of command were extended past the time of war, actually:

              Thanks for pointing me towards this quote.

              This was one of the problems I had with skipping past everything to do with Lotow, actually: there are important details we can only guess at.

              But if this is a temporary thing, it certainly makes it more palatable.

              Although it still involves the Drow deciding to head back to the Everdark, for reasons, to fight in a slave army heading towards Sve Noc, who's perhaps worse than the Faerie monarchs and certainly a bigger fixture in their minds.

              EDIT: Actually, wait, the oaths involve (amongst other things) a term that says:

              >you will follow the orders of the Sovereign of Moonless Nights without intent to subvert or pervert the spirit in which they were given,”

              which says to me that the oaths can be used to further force more oaths (or other bindings) with the simple task of ordering them to do it. So a short time frame (assuming that they got a small time frame which we don't really know) still sucks to about the same extent.

                Yeah, that was what I was saying. And, more importantly, Cat *knew* she had a shot at victory, while the Duke only yelled in surprise when it turned out she can damage his armor.

                >The Rider, however, did not land anything that would have been a death blow.

                But he was a non-titled knight that still made her armor a sieve, recognized how her powers work at a glance and didn't kill her only because he made an (otherwise correct) decision to exaust said powers. The fairies in this case also seemed to make a correct decision to not show up until they can isolate one of the intruders (though we don't actually know how that ended up, even if we know that drow don't have a good way to deal with glamour and flight).

                > This is true, but being individually somewhat equivalent to the faerie queen who's one of the ten most dangerous people on Calernia is also important, in Arcadia and everywhere else.

                I wonder how accurate Cat's assessments actually are. Some of our low expectations of her come from her doing stuff like walking into a fight with an unknown opponent with only infinite regeneration to keep herself going, but then there's the fact that there seem to be either remote (horned lords, elves, giants, monsters in the Waning Woods and Brocelian forest, some god in Greywood that Akua couldn't manage to capture despite her entire dynasty living right next to it etc.) or subtle (the Wandering Bard, Grey Pilgrim, Tyrant of Helike) powerhouses spread all over the place. Catherine tends to take into account and prepare only for threats she saw deployed before. I fear this is going to end with an “and so Triumphant wept, for she ruled but a fraction of the world and knew it to be vast beyond her reckoning”.

                > If your argument is that Urulan was actually unimpressive all along, then Cat disagreed with you in this very chapter.

                No, my argument is that martial power isn't some kind of absolute parameter independent of the circumstances, and that it can be made irrelevant with right preparations for specific circumstances.

                > If keeping their possessions was the goal, signing themselves into slavery did not accomplish it.

                Again, is this actually slavery? Yes, the tightness of the bindings makes that uncomfortably close, but they kept their sigils and right of command over them. What Catherine dictates is the manner of military response - evacuation instead of harvest and (presumably) long and bloody guerilla warfare. She's not asking oaths from the drow she doesn't give weapons potentially dangerous to herself - which, while still a dick move, is understandable to sigil-holders in question, and preferrable to being harvested by the other ones stuck with them or being ruined by those who took the deal, respectively.

        Have you considered the story lost in Arcadia and eaten/enslaved vs lost in Arcadia and tricks thier way out?  The drow's whole behavior set is high on arrogance and posturing, which is sorry fuel for getting smacked down. Cat's oaths are a milder version of small errors causing you to be enslaved for ages.
