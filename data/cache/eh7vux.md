>“Tell me yourself, I challenge you—answer. Imagine that you are creating a fabric of human destiny with the object of making men happy in the end, giving them peace and rest at last, but that it was essential and inevitable to torture to death only one tiny creature—that baby beating its breast with its fist, for instance—and to found that edifice on its unavenged tears, would you consent to be the architect on those conditions? Tell me, and tell the truth.”

PB is (for want of a better label) a "hard fantasy" serial set in a terrible world where a magic disaster strikes every four days.  Life has adapted to survive under these precarious circumstances, but somebody has to come out on the bottom.  Thanks to all my readers for following Rammash so far!

  Great as usual, and I love that Ram still isn't backing down and taking it, even though he's now with the people supposedly 'on his side.' One note:  


  > Shimrun paused his story, looking at Ram. “I’m sorry, I don’t understand. What mistake?” 

  This section reads a little bit like Shimrun is the one who doesn't understand, which confused me for a moment. Might flow better if Ram speaks first, then Shimrun pauses on a separate line?

      I don't know, at times she seems like a revolutionary. She sure as hell cast off the chains society put on her.
