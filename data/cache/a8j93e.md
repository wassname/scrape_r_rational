  I have largely enjoyed with this ring. There's a lot of good stuff and rational usage of powers and the smug 'all according to keikaku'-SI masturbation is within tolerable parameters. I find it a little weird that the MC keeps refusing power for no apparent reason but I can attribute that to a plausible character trait.

    I'm not sure what you mean. The Paragon timeline decided against using Venom Buster, but I think the Renegade timeline makes it clear that that would not have been a simple upgrade; it would be a shift of direction.

    He recently integrated a bunch of demon magic into his soul, which would have allowed him to wield demonic magic (unlike earthly magic, which he doesn't have the right arcane bits to use), opening up new opportunities. However, given the clear emotional and mental drawbacks, I think ditching it at the first opportunity was entirely understandable.

    OTOH, he has collected a whole bunch of mundane and arcane technology. His power armour has phase shifting, invisibility, kinetic barriers, alchemical healing potions, and harnesses for several arcane rifles and a god-killer sword. He has specialised ammunition for fighting magic users, demons, force fields, or for non-lethal attacks. Not to mention the variety of constructs he uses.

    I'm not sure what kind of power he's refusing?

      Question : I sort of stopped reading once he left Earth for the Space Adventures.  Not only am I less familiar with the space stuff for comic universes, especially DC, but it seemed like the primary conflicts of the narrative had been resolved.

      &#x200B;

      Has it gone anywhere interesting?

        He got turned into a demon, stole a Fruit from the Garden of Eden, and finger-banged a giant spider. Not in that order.

        It has been fairly "...?" in terms of what we should care about, yeah. A lot of things that feel like the time-wasty sort of filler. The story is currently on his second Christmas in the Earth 16 universe, fwiw.

        I'm mostly wondering if that bit of foreshadowing involving the Indigo Lanterns will ever be followed up on.

        We have gotten the JL members' thoughts on the Nabu situation, for the most part. They're pretty spread out, though.

          I mean, yeah.   So the main character keeps getting more powerful but what compelling conflict causes you to want to read the story?  Spacebattles has a hundred power wank fics with no conflict, what makes one want to read this one?  The pattern is typically : SI gets inserted into some world of fiction, usually worm.  SI has an absurdly broken power that is good from the start.  SI in secret builds an ever vaster empire and has no meaningful setbacks.  Author quits the story.

            He actually doesn't do tremendous amounts of getting stronger, considering it's over two million words.

            There's much more about gathering allies, connecting people who can help each other (like KordTech and the Greek gods who can make room temperature superconductors).

            Which is not really how with this ring works or what it is about. It is almost never about Paul trying to win some fight. He almost always has a trump card which we learned from the after action report with ophidichan -- that wasn't even his last resort if aliens we're about to wipe out earth. 

            His concerns are larger. Usually winning fights within some parameters say no civilian casualties and convincing the opponent their philosophy is flawed. 

            But I think the real wtr idea is that super powers aren't being applied properly. That if the super tech was being used right humanity would be uplifted. The pieces where he talks to the Belle reve prisoners are a great example esp Leonard snart. Snart could have made millions fixing global warming bit he Rob's banks -- poorly. And that's what makes this chapter so interesting. We find out that some angelic(?) Entity has been deliberately stopping Earth's tech level from increasing which is exactly opposed to Paul.

              I don't remember this part.  But yeah, finding out the cause of the absurdity of comic tech levels would be interesting.  Since, you know, they don't obey anything like the rules in our universe.  Where Tony Stark and Batman can develop in secret absurdly advanced tech only other supervillains can access, instead of every major government.  That the batmobile doesn't just fail to work from 100 different software bugs that would never be found in testing on just 1 prototype and however many coders you could have working in total secrecy.

                  Well I have a long backlog.  Once he established his own central power battery it seemed kinda like it was "mission accomplished" and the rest of the fic would just be a meandering power wank.  Also I don't read the DC comics so none of the space characters I had any knowledge of, which you generally need in order to appreciate fanfic.

                    I don't read DC comics at all, and have not found it to impede my appreciation of the fic. I understand this to be true for a large chunk of its readers, 20% minimum.

                      I'll put my hand up here. Knew almost nothing about DC before reading WTR, still know very little about anything that's different to Young Justice, except that I did watch the recent Justice League movie and was very disappointed by some of the things they got horribly wrong - like their depiction of Mother Boxes. But I've read the entirety of WTR at least three times and really enjoyed it.

                    I mean you read a few million words of this author to get that far and you decided he was going to fuck it all up there? You got through the almost a threesome, the Kon romance, the maybe hitting on zatarra, the part where everything turns into a Greek play and that is what gave you pause? Zoat is not afraid to experiment with things that might annoy the readers which is a p big deal compared to most authors and fics I've read. He's developed something that makes me stick around for the Long haul. 

                    In any case, I get the feeling you don't read a lot of fic and that's ok. But for an author that you like, if they're good, they'll make it easy to understand what the characters are. Zoat helpfully provides links to comic books in many chapters when introducing new characters. I've learned more about DC from him than in the shows I've watched. But if you are getting started in the fic hobby you might want to give fics where you trust the author but don't know the fandom a chance. That's how I got into Naruto stuff. I had watched the show but not that far. I read enough fic to understand what happens for the rest of the plot. And it opened the door to more fic and more crossovers.

      I'm talking about authority specifically. There's been a lot of times he could have had half an army under his command and chose not to. Examples include >!making an army of superstrong/fast gods, hiring scientist to work for him instead of Luthor, the g-creatures, the superhero department in the US and the lantern corps. !<

              Why do you call them by those names? I'm just reading the story without comments and I haven't seen those referred. The only cue of different timelines is in the text font.

                Those are the canonical names. The big blue symbol and red symbol that pop up, occasionally? If you looked at the image name they would be labeled "Paragon" and "Renegade". This is also discussed in the FAQs in the first post of the thread. (It remains to be seen whether anyone has *ever* read the FAQs in the first post of the thread.)

                Something to do with Mass Effect, the game had two separate morality system for your choices in game so rather than one slider where both good actions and bad actions affects the slider, in this case being renegade and selecting paragon choices would not reduce your evil/renegade reputation and vice versa. In this case, just because the renegade does more good than evil does not affect the red timeline's  reputation as he's established himself as evil. That's how I understand it, I have never played the games though.
                ```

                - u/VorpalAuroch:
                  ```
                  Paragon/Renegade is much more law/chaos than good/evil. Paragon is the path of playing nice with others and cooperation, Renegade is doing your own thing and damn the consequences to your reputation. Cooperate/Defect in the Prisoner's Dilemma sense is about right.

                    ```
                    Another way to consider it is: the Paragon character has two orange rings, reflecting his greater mastery of his own desires and how they fit together into a larger picture. The Renegade, by contrast, has an orange and a yellow. He too has goals, but he often achieves them by being big and scary.

                    Professor Quirrelmort is primarily attuned to the yellow, I think.

                  Renegade is more loose cannon than evil, in the games.
                  ```

              - u/xThoth19x:
                ```
                That's what the symbols mean. And the threadmarks denote the timelines as paragon and renegade at some point. It may have only been in one of the older threads back when it was still on SB.

      >I'm not sure what kind of power he's refusing?

      More serious transhumanism, for one. He's making slow changes, but he's being a lot more conservative with it than I would. I mean, he's still got nearly baseline human cognitive capabilities! If I were in his position, I'd be spending nearly all my free time on (ring aided) research into human neuroanatomy and cognition, so that I could safely re engineer my brain piece-by-piece to become a superintelligence. Really, no matter WHAT your goals are, that's a sensible decision, since being more intelligent will help you achieve them.

      From a Doylist perspective, it makes total sense he wouldn't do so, since writing a superintelligence well is nearly impossible without being a superintelligence yourself. And from a Watsonian perspective, I can write it off as him just being much more afraid of who he is changing than I am. But it's certainly not the choice I'd have made, especially now that he has a soul.
