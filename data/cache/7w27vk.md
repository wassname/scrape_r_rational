## [Challenge Companion] Infighting

### Post:

**tl;dr: This is the companion thread to [the weekly challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7w05pl/biweekly_challenge_infighting/), post recommendations, ideas, or general discussion of the topic below (but especially as it applies to prose fiction).**

A lot of infighting in fiction is of the political variety, but in my opinion, it's of the less interesting variety, where two people are, e.g., competing for the governorship and both care more about winning than they do about governing, or both crave power rather than wanting to do good. *House of Cards* is replete with infighting, but very little of it is because there are fundamental philosophical disagreements. Instead, the infighting happens because the terminal goals of the actors within the organization are completely at odds with one another.

The *more* interesting version of infighting (to me, anyway) is the Good vs. Good variety, where "good" here might be defined as "in the interests of the organization". Two people might work at an animal shelter and have a pitched conversation about whether or not it should be no-kill, both of them with their own perspectives but both at odds because of their personal viewpoints, ethical frameworks, etc., even if both have the same terminal goal (at least with respect to the thing they're arguing about).

(From a prose narrative standpoint, I think that the second type is more complex and harder to pull off, even if the two principals are morally gray and in more open conflict with one another.)
