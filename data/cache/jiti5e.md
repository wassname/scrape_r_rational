## Specific Rational!Dresden Request

### Post:

In "Dead Beat", Harry Dresden has a conversion with Kimori where she encourages him to consider "defeating death".  In canon, Harry rejects the arguments for optional mortality.  Is there any rational(ist) fiction that considers either following Kimori in the canon, or persues a Dresden that is convinced by the arguments for optional mortality in an alternate universe -- either joining with Kimori or not.

### Comments:

  I am not sure if we can consider Dresden rejecting Kimori to be irrational given that he has access to a lot of evidence indicating that even minor compromises with Dark Magic can cause serious psychological problems and that every attempt to use Dark Magic in pursuit of some noble goal has invariably ended horribly. It seems perfectly rational for Dresden to assume that Kimori (someone openly serving some ridiculously evil people) is simply trying to find a way of justifying her horrific actions and plans.

  &#x200B;

  A more "rational" take on Dresden would probably involve him finding a career other than detective and building on his strengths as an artificer. This seems like it could actually lead to a very interesting story that provides worldbuilding on the life of Wizards who are not Wardens or actively involved in the highest levels of White Council politics. This is something that is pretty much entirely neglected in Canon.

    Well, this is before he was a warden, so his personal experiences with the negative effects of Dark Magic are not too many.  Of course, he has been exposed to be White Council's propaganda, but he has personal experience that breaking the laws doesn't mean you are irredeemable.

    That said, it's also before he's used necromancy successfully (?) in pursuit of a noble goal, too.

    I can understand "career other than detective", but his primary skills aren't in artificing.  Sure, he's had to re-make his staff, rod, rings, and bracelet multiple times, but they are far from the coolest devices in the series, and mostly just let Harry do more of what he's good at -- redirecting energy.

    I can recommend the "Arcane Ascension" series for a magical protag that _is_ a powerful, specialized artificer.  It's an even more fantastical world than even the Dresden Files, though.

    As a bit of a magical "brute", I think Dresden's career makes _some_ sense.  I'm sure there's plenty of "failure to multiply" in how small and personal his cases are, but his "brutish"ness is a fit for combat magic.  Immediately after becoming a member of the council, he's not going to be accepted among the wardens, and he certainly can't use magic in the rigid procedure of police work, or the rigid discipline of military service, so he becomes a "private cop" and does the PI work.

    It's not _entirely_ clear, but it does seem like magic in the Dresden Files universe can violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics, so I'm sure a purely rational actor would just do that at industrial scale, and optimize energy production.  Heck, while there's certainly claims in the text that the 1st law of thermodynamics is followed / energy is conserved, there's plenty of Dresden spells that feel like they are breaking that one, and that means free energy!

      I beg to differ. Dresden gives himself a hard time and calls himself a brute regularly and I think it's easy to buy into that view. Especially since when it comes to delicate control of fine magicks in a combat situation, he is regularly outclassed by others with more experience. But when it comes to his artificing work, there is solid evidence that he is top of the class. The gear that he creates is regularly on par with devices made by wizards double or even triple his age, nd even Bob was impressed with Little Chicago. I doubt even most of the High Council could pull off that one.

      whenever people want to use personal magic for energy production my line of thought just jumps right to the horrific factory-farmed end

      I suppose then the interesting story comes from someone escaping/breaking that

        [Raven's Mark](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33916060-blackwing) series has mages of low skill / talent being coerced by the government into doing work that amounts to power generation. There are excuses, humans are at war with cthulhu gods, so it's not quite slavery but conscription. More specifically immortal human mages with so much power they are worshiped as gods warring against cthulhu gods and their empires of mindcontrolled monsters.

  Hmmmm. . . I think you are missing the fact that the Dresdenverse very explicitly has afterlives and souls; challenging death might not make sense.


  Furthermore the Dakhallow a worse moral tradeoff than a horcrux costing hundreds or higher exponents of lives to make a immortal (god) but it's a world where there is continuity of personhood after death.  We only explicitly see non dismissible continuity, instead of ghosts or dreams, for presumably normal-ish cases after "Dead Beat" (I'm thinking of any allies relative in Ghost Story and someone's daughter in Skin Game), but given people actually do go somewhere else arbitrated by *powers* does fighting to defeat death, in the dresdenverse, make sense?

    The fact that there is an afterlife doesn't mean that it's a good one for everybody or even a significant amount of people.

    Given that the Christian God is a pretty big deal in the Dresdenverse, it's entirely possible that the majority of people actually go to hell to suffer forever, in which case immortality would be even *more* important then if there was no afterlife at all.

      Things we know about Dresdenverse afterlives:

      1. Deities can form their own. We see this with Hades and the Greek Underworld.

      2. There was somewhere for the Angel of Death from Dead Beat to shepherd Father Forthill to.

      3. Murphy's dad exists in some kind of between-place, ostensibly at Uriel's behest.

      4. There is a Southbound Train. We have no idea what's at the terminal station. Uriel won't say, and won't say why he won't say.

      5. It's not possible to do much to a soul without its express consent. It doesn't need to be informed consent, but outright refusals seem fairly ironclad.

      6. There is something fueling Hellfire. We have no evidence that it's tormented souls. It could well be some kind of corrupted angelic power, given that Uriel has the capacity to unmake galaxies. The difference between Hellfire and angelic power appears to be that angels can only act to counter supernatural intervention and with the consent of those being acted upon, while Hellfire requires only the consent of the one using it.

      7. The White God, also known as the Abrahamic deity, does not appear to be the malevolent bastard depicted in its holy books. None of the agents it empowers are bad people, its artifacts straight-up disintegrate in the hands of people who would misuse them, and the only time it flexes its power is when mortal free will is at risk of being curbed through supernatural intervention.

      8. Satan is not mentioned. Fallen Angels exist, but their ultimate goal appears to be fighting Nemesis, in much the same way that Winter's goal is manning the Outer Gates.

    > Hmmmm. . . I think you are missing the fact that the Dresdenverse very explicitly has afterlives and souls; challenging death might not make sense.

    Eh, sort of.  I mean Dresden _later_ has some fairly direct evidence after "Ghost Story", but until then there's not lot of evidence that's any stronger than what we experience.  Even Mort makes it clear that ghosts aren't actually souls and doubts that Dresden is actually present during most of "Ghost Story".

    It does seem unlikely that Uriel would exist without at least some people experiencing an afterlife, but even Sonya admits that the angelic beings may or may not correspond to the White god's afterlife.

    Oh, absolutely, I'm not saying Dresden would not stop the Darkhallow.  Kimori and Cowl both state that it would be better for it not to happen at all, Cowl just doesn't think that's very likely and seeing himself performing the Darkhollow as the least bad option.  If Dresden and Kimori (and Cowl?) team up, it would mean they'd work together to stop the Darkhallow.  If Kimori or Cowl can't modify their goals that much, Dresden will still go it alone.

    With Cowl and Kimori on defense instead of smacking him over the head, it's theoretically possible that The Erlking could have been imprisoned until dawn!  (Unlikely, eventually Gravain and/pr Corpse Taker would try to break the Erlking out, and if both of them and their dummers came by "Team Dresden" would be outnumbered on the wizard count.)

    > given people actually do go somewhere else arbitrated by powers does fighting to defeat death, in the dresdenverse, make sense?

    I think it does.  Optional mortality is basically always an improvement.  Even if the afterlife is always very much better than life, it's not _strictly_ better because you lose the ability to interact with the living in significant ways.  Optional mortality would let you decide when the afterlife experience is worth the things you'll have to give up, if there is an afterlife.

    At the very least, Dresden's experiences in "Dead Beat" _should_ have had him collaborating with Mort more, so that he wasn't so inexperienced during "Ghost Story", even if he never drew from necromantic energy after ceasing to animate Sue.

  I don't think we have seen the end of the Kumori/necromancy plot lines yet, so I think there's going to be more happening from there. That being said, it is official canon from the author that breaking any of the Seven Laws actually does do permanent damage to the user's psyche and has lasting consequences. It's also a WoJ that Dresden is going to break all seven of them before the end of the series, so I guess that wouldn't mean that an alt!Harry couldn't go down that path of following Kumori but I would expect it to be a very dark path indeed.
