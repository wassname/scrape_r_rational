## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Most people have here have probably already heard about it, but [The Flower That Bloomed Nowhere](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28806/the-flower-that-bloomed-nowhere) is an ongoing Fair-Play Whodunnit.

  It draws some inspiration from Umineko no Naku Koro Ni, with in-text-but-out-of-story characters vouching for certain rules and viewpoints in the story. 

  Initial blurbs for the story touted it as a time loop mystery, but the time loops are probably not integrated in the story in the way you are imagining.

  The most common criticism I hear is that it has a slow beginning, which is fair. There is a lot of setting up the characters and the setting before we get into the meat and potatoes. If you are not into that this might not be the story for you.

  The setting is very unique, but to explain it more would be spoilers, so I won't.

  On the story's discord server we have at least three people making timelines tracking events and characters to try and "solve" the mystery.
  ```

  - u/EdenicFaithful:
    ```
    I've fallen way behind in reading this, but I'll just add that what most impressed me was the way that the characters spoke as if they lived in a genuinely diverse and hopelessly complex world. There was some real depth there, coupled with an excellent writing style and a prominent voice.
    ```

  - u/SpeakKindly:
    ```
    I really liked the slow beginning, but somehow I dropped it once the meat began stabbing the potatoes. Maybe I should pick it up again.
    ```

  - u/tjhance:
    ```
    Seconding this one, easily one of the best stories on the sub right now. Besides the mystery element I wanna point out its got some really rich worldbuilding, with really out-there magic sci-fi concepts integrated into the setting. (Here's a little mini mystery for anyone who picks it up: try to figure out what the "prosognostic events" are before the narrator explains them) and society with tension along generational lines due to the median human lifespan being 500 years.
    ```

  Looking for stories about worlds / universes colliding. Not necessarily in armed conflict, but not a fusion fic. Two worlds that had up to a point been separate before colliding. 

  For a mix of stores along the vein, although I can only claim partial rationality for all of them, and I'm listing them in order of opinionated rationality. 

  [Reunions are a Bitch](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/reunions-are-a-bitch-chapters.141609/): Stargate and Battlestar Galactica (2003) meet before the Cylon attack takes place. The 12 Colonies are even more religiously fanatical than the series proper, and want to 'liberate' the Stargate Earth as heathens. Also, want the Earth's resources. Conflict ensues. If I'm piecing together internet apocrypha together correctly a decade after the fact, this spawned off a whole spat of similar stories of this crossover. 

  [Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach](https://archiveofourown.org/works/6765496/chapters/18613333): A very long story, and for as much as I've gotten through fairly well thought out. It's greatest strength, is also what to my tastes is its greatest weakness. Harry Potter is caught on video fleeing Death Eaters in footage that is used for a commercial played during the biggest American Football game of the year. 

  The story then goes from character to character, not at all limited to the magical world. Going from college students, marketing executives, world leaders, Harry Potter Characters, to everyone in between, to play out the scenario for the Statute of Secrecy falling.

  I got perhaps 100K into this before losing interest, which is a shame because this is the type of story I very much want to read, Muggles doing it better than the Wizards, but told in the format of new characters every chapter, perhaps getting back to an established one in another four chapters, it's hard to keep invested in my opinion. 

  [GATE](https://www.crunchyroll.com/gate): Anime, the Japan suddenly has a gate to another world open in the middle of a city. This other world is a standard fantasy one, and it turns out bullets that are a half-century old still do plenty of damage to plate armor. Standard anime tropes apply, and the portrayal of actual Earth politics is somewhat, lacking.
  ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    There were some really solid Gate-themed Real World + Westeros fics, but they never lasted long. I love this genre (two completely different worlds actually meeting, in particular when one of those worlds is the real world) but it's hard to find completed examples.

    MLF:FiM is, strangely enough, the only fandom I know of that's an exception. Here's what I've got on my favorites list:

    https://www.fimfiction.net/story/120686/misunderstandings  
    https://www.fimfiction.net/story/301668/negotiations (this is a conversion bureau fic, and the genre as a whole is exactly what you're looking for... assuming you're willing to tolerate oodles and oodles of ponywords, anyways.)

      I'll admit, the MLF:FiM fandom is one I've avoided if only because it's My Little Pony. 

      Not sure I'm willing to breach that barrier, still something to look over see if anything does catch my interest.
      ```

      - u/GaBeRockKing:
        ```
        Yeah, I get the hesitation lol. But the fact that the fandom is primarily occupied by a older, male demographic is both it's greatest weakness because of how weird that naturally gets, but also its greatest strength because the natural audience for creative works is that same adult male demographic, which is uncommon for a fandom and influences what kind of works tend to get written.

            Evangelion has 3k fanfics on AO3, while MLP has ~5k... and AO3 isn't even MLP's primary fic repository by a longshot. Quantity has a quality all its own.

            (Plus, Evangelion isn't as good of a worldbuilding sandbox as MLP given that it's just "alternate future earth" essentially.)
            ```

        If you only ever read one, [MLP: Friendship is Optimal](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal) is the one to try.  It has spawned a whole series of fanfic based upon it.

    I recently read some Spider-Man fanfics that might fit your request:

    **[From the Top](https://archiveofourown.org/works/17228525/chapters/40513307)**

    This fanfic pics up from the end of the animated movie [*Into the Spider-Verse*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/) (which is a surprisingly awesome film that might also fit your request), but you don't need to have watched it to enjoy the fic. At the end of the movie, middle-aged Peter Parker from Marvel Comics canon is supposed to be sent home to his own universe.

    In this fic something goes wrong, and he lands in the post-Thanos Marvel Cinematic Universe instead. What follows is an action packed romp with more than one character crossing universes and having to cope with how different (or similar) their counterparts are. At the heart of the story is Peter and his sometimes troubled relationship with the Avengers, especially his mentor Tony Stark. In my opinion the author does an excellent job portraying all of the characters, including the quick wit that Spider-Man is famous for.

    **[Dark Matter](https://archiveofourown.org/works/30153540/chapters/74285358)**

    In this fic, rather than >!dying during the Snap!< in *Infinity War*, Spider-Man absorbs the Soul Stone and lands in the DC universe. There Peter must survive day to day with no support network in the most crime-ridden city in the USA while trying to find a way home. Complications arise while he learns to cope with his connection to the Soul Stone, meets the "Bat Family" and Gotham's local villains, and everyone gets drawn into Thanos's cross-universe meddling to reclaim the Soul Stone.

  I've got an itch for some popcorn fiction. Although it's not a *requirement*, I've found that the general feel that I'm looking for is most common in fanfiction. With that in mind, I'm looking for reccomendations of long, complete fanfiction. Ideally, they would be somewhat obscure, since I've already read many of the more commonly reccomended ones, and ideally they wouldn't require knowledge of the original work. With that said, though, I'd prefer to get a lot of reccomendations for stories that aren't quite what I'm looking for, rather than miss out on a few that I would have enjoyed, but that didn't quite fit the criteria.

  What are some rational works that heavily explore cults, political extremism, and/or fanatical worldviews? 

  Ideally they should feature fanaticism as more than just a physically antagonistic force for the protagonist(s) and deconstruct the concept in a deeper way, even to the point where the work *justifies* fanaticism. I'm already familiar with *Dune* and how works influenced by it have justified authoritarianism and devout religion by practical necessity.

    In order of most to least fitting your request:

    [The Traitor Baru Cormorant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23444482-the-traitor-baru-cormorant) - Exactly what you're looking for, I think. The themes deal intensely with the psychology of culture, assimilation, fanaticism and imperialism. The first book is lighting in a bottle, just amazing. Sequels are OK. 

    [Kings of Paradise](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35994830-kings-of-paradise) - While it does fit your request, I recommend it mostly because it's an amazing series that is severely underrated. The second and third books go deeper into themes that might interest you, but religion and belief play a role from the first page. For a better appreciation of just how much love and attention the author gave this trilogy, as you read try to note the extensive parallels and contrasts between Ruka and Kale, the two main characters. 

    [Master Assassins](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35437058-master-assassins) -  A story about two brothers bungling their way around and away from an ethnic/holy war that threatens to engulf the entire continent. Fantastic worldbuilding and characterization.

  This is something I've been wanting to recommend for a *long* time, and finishing my second rewatch this week feels as good a time as any.

  Bojack Horseman.  One of the three shows I've ever given a SSS rating to.  You know how some shows try to philosophize their dialogue trying to make some grand commentary on the human condition, and end up throwing a bunch of vacuous platitudes at you (Dark being a particularly bad offender, for example)?  Bojack tries the same thing, but what set it apart was that it *succeeds*.

  Even when a character said something deep I disagreed with, it was something that felt like it had real thought put into it.  Like, thoughts that real people would have if they put thought into it, instead of what a screenwriter thinks smart people sound like.  And more surprising than that, it sometimes says things that I think are actually the right answer to complex social situations, which is rare.

  Topping it all off, the show itself is hilarious, with some of the most high-concept episodes, humour, and plotlines I've ever seen, as well as the best character arc/deconstruction since Breaking Bad, in Bojack himself.

  I have heard it from a couple of friends that for a certain kind of person this show is way too difficult to watch ("too real" is how they put it).  I didn't overly empathize with any of the characters, so I guess YMMV with how much you enjoy this show.
  ```

  - u/NTaya:
    ```
    Seconded, thirded, etc. My favorite show of all time, by a long shot. Several episodes broke me for days.
    ```

  - u/ProfessorPhi:
    ```
    I don't know how to recommend this more. In some ways the discovery that Bojack was more than a Family Guy clone in season 1 made me feel like I knew a secret that no-one else did. I'm really glad you recommended it, I never recommend anything in these threads, and having seen comments like this and the Outer Wilds ones, I really wish I had!

    It's rightfully earned it's acclaim in the years since it released, and frankly deserved more awards than it got (like my dear Sunny in Philly). 

    Funnily, I don't know if I've watched it since the pandemic began (I did a rewatch of everything in the leadup to each season), partially because it tied things off in a very Bojack way, but also because I don't feel like I have the emotional health to watch anything too heavy in between the various covid strains.

      >I did not find much deep about it at all though.

      It's possible we're using different definitions of deep.  I was just referring to times when it felt like some mix of complex and resonant in a way that the implications of what it's trying to say feel aligned with the show itself.

      Things similar to it in the flavour of not-throwing-platitudes around - I think a lot of good rationalist fics do this, so like HPMOR, The Metropolitan Man, anything you might not have read already.  Apart from that, maybe [Strong Female Protagonist](https://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-1/page-0/)?  Community does it sometimes, but more commonly it satirizes the idea with Jeff being a trope-aware lawyer who explicitly uses platitudes to his advantage.

  Sorry I don't have more direction, just looking for fun reads and feeling like I've checked out all the most common options. Preferably not fan fiction, on the lighter side, and no chapters entirely dedicated to LitRPG number crunching.

  I've browsed through like, 20 pages of RR Best Rated (feel free to recommend any hidden gems I might have missed), I'm cool with translated novels too though after CCG, My House of Horrors, Kino's Journey and LotM I've been struggling to find good ones. Familiar with TopWebFiction, haven't been super impressed with it though.

  My ideal story would basically be another TUTBAD type, other favorites would be 12 Miles Below, Perfect Run, MoL, Super Minion, Journey of Black and Red, Virtuous Sons, Forge of Destiny, Re:Monarch and Only Villains do That.

  Basically, I'm just listing a bunch of stories I like and hoping someone with similar taste will have recommendations that I may have missed. Sorry it's such a rambling mess lol

    Well, if you're up for a medium switch it might be worth hitting Webtoons. 

    Three of the more serious, and semi-rational,

    [SEED](https://www.webtoons.com/en/sf/seed/list?title_no=1480) - A somewhat realistic take on what an emerging AGI might do.

    [The Gamer](https://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-gamer/list?title_no=88) - Very Long, MC is granted the superpower of having a body that is a video game character. Stats, HP, MP, etc.

    [UnOrdinary](https://www.webtoons.com/en/super-hero/unordinary/list?title_no=679) - Everyone Has Super Powers, except the one student who does not.

    Less serious but more fun. Most of these are romances. 

    [Nothing Special](https://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/nothing-special/list?title_no=1188) - Least 'romantic' if only because the two fall in love and have a healthy relationship as magical shenanigans go down. 

    [Mage and Demon Queen](https://www.webtoons.com/en/comedy/mage-and-demon-queen/list?title_no=1438) - Very very gay, a magical world that complies with the standard fantasy isekai. With an isekai character running around in the background but not the main character. 

    [Always Human](https://www.webtoons.com/en/romance/always-human/list?title_no=557) - Completed, Beautiful art, utopian future, a society of casual body modification and what someone who can't participate in that might find love. Honestly, a nice comforting happy thing. 

    I sound like I'm promoting the site, but honestly there are a few dozen gems I've found here and the mobile apps not half bad.

    If you’re the type of person that can enjoy and handle the somewhat lower quality of translated novels, I’d recommend the xianxias written by Enlightened Master Crouching Cow. Forty Milleniums of Cultivation(yes I know it Milleniums isn’t right but that’s the title) and Oh my God! Earthlings are Insane! What I like about them is that they take the junk foody feeling of xianxias, and make them more palatable. The author likes to blend cultivation with sci fi, which generally makes them more interesting. In FMoC cultivators can basically fly around in Iron Man suits and fight in cultivation mechas, and not to mention starships and high tech.

    I remember years ago there was a post or comment here saying FMoC was a relatively rational take on xianxia, and while it’s certainly not perfect if you’re looking for fun I enjoyed these ones. The villains are really competent and the breakthroughs and scheming are real cool. The characters aren’t just caricatures either.

    If you’ve read Lord of the Mysteries, I’d suggest the author’s newest novel Embers ad Infinitum. It’s a really unique novel in that the MC is legitimately crazy and it’s more narrated and framed as a group perspective instead of solely the crazy MC’s perspective. The “power” system isn’t some defined linear thing and the way it’s handled is really cool and well done. It’s not like the MC is crazy in a bad way either, he just...thinks differently, which is surprisingly useful and interesting in the given world and power system.

    And lastly something you might or might not enjoy. One of my favorites is the Japanese light novel series “So I’m a Spider, So What?” Probably my all time favorite isekai, there’s a lot about it I really enjoy, as well as being imo the best monster isekai, and monster MC in general.

      I strongly rec 40k, and moderately rec OMGEAC.

      The former is *amazing*, and by my lights *highly rational*, with a intelligent (albeit flawed in his inability to tolerate the need for lesser versus greater evils) protagonist, and one of the few stories I've read that made me shed tears dozens of times as well as nearly choke to death from laughter. Also, as a big Warhammer 40k fan, the nods to the setting were fun Easter-eggs, albeit it really doesn't do more than pay homage to it.

      Sad it's stuck at Chapter 2761 in the English translation for ages, but anyone reading it for the first time shouldn't let that stop them.

      OMGEAC is good too, but feels considerably scaled down in terms of scope and excitement, but it's actively updated and is holding me over till 40k gets back on its feet.

        Earthlings doesn’t pick up later? I stopped at around 600 or so. It was pretty good so far, but I was thinking that it was going to be like FMoC where it’s alright for a bit and then completely changes and becomes amazing, like when the Flying Star Sector arc happens. I thought a twist like that was being set up in Earthlings with the hints about the Other World being a lot more than it seems.

        And yeah, FMoC is really good. It’s surprisingly deeper and more complex than you’d expect from a xianxia, with great characters and villains.  Like Long Yangjun, she’s such a phenomenal character, it was great seeing her pop out throughout the arcs to troll and knock the MC down a peg or two. I like the MC, since personally I’m so tired of selfish evil mass murderers in xianxias, which is why FMoC is such a nice breath of fresh air. Also why I really liked LotM.

    > The series follows Ginko, a man who dedicates himself to keeping people protected from supernatural creatures called Mushi. 

    Set anywhere between 1700s - late 1800 Japan; it's a slice of life mixed with supernatural (which could get somewhat dark at times but it balances those aspects extremely well). I would recommend the anime since I haven't read the manga.

  I'm trying to find a story that I think was originally posted on HFY. Almost all I remember is that the oceans had somehow been transformed into giant world spanning forests full of deadly creatures. Anyone happen to remember it?

    [Found it](https://www.reddit.com/r/FormerFutureAuthor/comments/2ugc7q/forest_part_one/). Looks like the author was able to get it published too, which is nice to see. You can still find all of the parts as they were being written on their subreddit: /r/FormerFutureAuthor

  Hi! I'm looking for audiobooks similar quality of HPMOR audiobook project. I've listened to worm, which was fine, but less good. I'm struggling through Pact. do you have any other recommendations?

    In case you don't know, there are other audiobooks on the HPMOR podcast feed including The Metropolitan Man, Cristal Society, Three Worlds Collide, and many other short rationalist stories. 

    Of far lower quality, there's the [Unsong audiobook](https://unsong.libsyn.com/). 

    Of a bit higher quality, there's the [Mother of Learning audiobook](https://www.audible.com/pd/Mother-of-Learning-Arc-1-Audiobook/B09MXJQG1Z?qid=1642112058&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=W0W0KWWCQSN88GDVA9VP).

    Generally Ao3. Once you get used to the tagging system you are able to sort out most of the pure garbage, and then sort by comments.

      >sort by comments

      That's an interesting tactic; I've never seen someone recommend that before. Why do you prefer that over sorting by bookmarks?
      ```

      - u/jiffyjuff:
        ```
        Comment count is approximately proportional to length × quality, so it's also a length filter, which takes out most one-shots, and therefore a large fraction of porn, is one logic, I suppose.
        ```

      - u/ironistkraken:
        ```
        Generally I find that stories with invested audiences are better.  Bookmarks is also a good way of sorting, but then you will find more one shots like sorting by kudos.

    The darklordpotter forums has a few pages dedicated to recommending fanfiction, got a few stories from there.

    I browse ao3 and ffnet sometimes, and usually you can get some decent stuff by sorting by favorites or kudos. Obviously doesn't work as well if the fandom has less than 100 fanfics, but what can you do. 

    Spacebattles / SufficientVelocity / Questionable questing are much more difficult to search well though. For those it's just search by tags or by name, and see if any of the things that come up are good.

      I've found good results on Spacebattles by sorting by "first message reaction score". I ended up reading a lot of good fics in fandoms that I had never tried before.

    Here you can find dedicated recommendation threads for all kinds of fandoms. Most threads have recommendations threadmarked. If not, just search for 'rec'/'recommendations' in the thread.

    https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-best-damn-fics-youve-ever-read.23098/

    This one compiles all the completed fanfics that the users feel are the best works, and others vote on it. There is a huge list of all the successful recommendations in the very first post.

    It's parent forum is also similar to the above linked Index from spacebattles.
