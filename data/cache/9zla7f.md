  Oh boy. Cat's locked herself into a 50-50 narrative with an already ruined goddess who can go all out as an opponent. This is really not looking good, Winter will have to be released in full, and that will have consequences. Cat's looking more likely to have to tear up another piece of herself in order to win this.

  I’ve been largely dismissive of the complaints from this subreddit about power creep. But here I think we see the consequence of making average Mighty credible threats to the Winter Queen. For the entire time that Rumania was speaking, I could practically taste the conservation of ninjitsu concentrating down around them. The reveal that they are the oldest being except the dead king has a neat contrast with the Elf she fought in Keter. Even the delay for the hyper-competent team of Longstrider killers works out as a ploy to make it a fight of three equal forces (cat/Rumania/Longstride cabal)

  But instead I’m left wondering how 3000 years of collecting Night wasn’t enough for this guy to overthrow the entire Dwarven kingdom. If he has had so long to build power, how can he possibly have rivals with the other (younger) sigils. And how can Cat possibly keep up in a fight?

  Answer: we’re immediately going to see the payoff shards of winter in her soldiers as she finally cuts loose with the winter mantle. This will be a premature burn of a potential growth asset which lets Cat overcome a short term existential threat.

  Of course she can’t collect an army of mighty. If Callow ever stops being the underdog then Cat’s role as avatar of the Callowan redemption arc would end. And the gods really want Cat to win.

    Technically, they're not a match for the Winter Queen. But Cat holds back because of the alienation, so she's never actually gone full Winter Queen so far. She's able to ramp up gradually what she can do without changing her personality by shunting off the influence, first to Aqua and now to the Peerage, which will probably increase as she conquers the Everdark, allowing her to power up to match the scarier Mighty in the inner ring.

    It's also been foreshadowed in this chapter that she can probably channel the Winter influence into drow who are merely sworn to her, instead of full Peers, but that will probably have a nasty backlash.

    Putting both of those together, my prediction is that when she actually goes toe-to-toe with Sve Noc, she will have to bring all of Winter to bear in the fight, and her Peerage won't be enough - she'll have to use the other drow. The backlash will end up de-powering her and the drow enough that they won't be absolutely gamebreaking when they get back to the surface, as they would be in their current form.

    Probably the reason he's alive is that he was not agressively collecting more Night. Seems like the drow would gang up on whoever was becoming too powerful.

  Interesting she fell for a story trap. The villain used her belief in monologing to get her to hold still.

  I wonder if she sent a frost construct instead of her "real" body? She knows they are going to ambush her and has been visibly flitting around the field as a juicy target...so why not make two of her so they can blow their trap? Plus Akua is in reserve, plot still in motion.

      Right? This could be a turning point in a lot of ways. She could finally step away from the hellgods and join the game as fighting for an in between.

      Edit: by in-between I meant Neutral. Was tired, not sure why I didnt just say neutral

      - u/RiOrius:
        ```
        As I understand it, Gods Below are only letting this play out without interfering because they win no matter which side comes out on top. If Cat chose this battle to come out against the gods, they'd jump onto Sve's side of the scale.

        Going against the gods is on the horizon, but there's no way Cat has enough juice to pull it off now even without the Drow demigod opposing her.
        ```

      - u/tavitavarus:
        ```
        Why do people keep expecting Catherine to become a good guy? She's a villain. She's done a lot of truly evil things. She's a sympathetic protagonist, not a hero. Not even close.
        ```

        - u/TaltosDreamer:
          ```
          I didnt call her a Hero or a Good Guy and I do not feel either title fits her. I said she could step away as an in-between. She takes actions that are both heroic and villainous, but she leans villain hard enough it isnt a contest.

          Specifically her world lacks a concept of Gods-Of-Balance. Considering her Mantle is neutral and she thinks both sides are a pack of dicks, I see no reason why Cat couldnt grab a few minor godlings and form her own faction. A faction dedicated to flipping the bird at Above and Below on behalf of mortals.

          If she did so, I don't think either side could act against her directly because she wouldn't be standing for either side. It would mean every act against her would give the opposing side a chance to make a power move. Even heroes wouldnt be able to act with a story on their side, since there is nothing heroic in attacking those standing up for free will.
          ```

          - u/Nimelennar:
            ```
            So, who do you think the Gods of Balance would be?

            I think Dead King, Bard, Black Queen, Ranger, Hierophant, and Hierarch are the most likely contenders, although I doubt that all of them would end up in the same pantheon.
            ```

            - u/TaltosDreamer:
              ```
              Thats pretty much the same as mine, though IDK about Bard and Ranger. I suspect Bard is something different than we realize.

              The Pantheons are currently Above and Below. I don't think Neutrality would need to all get along with each other.
              ```

          - u/tavitavarus:
            ```
            Sorry, it's just that whenever she does something Good or a hero does something questionable the comments are full of people saying she's going to become an anti-hero.
            ```

            - u/TaltosDreamer:
              ```
              I understand. She had a point very early on where she could have turned hero, but it is far too late now. Honestly, I am glad she didn't and I hope she never tries.

              I just can't see her going full Evil either. So some Neutral path seems likely. She is ultimately too stubborn to submit to anyone.

            I'm sure all these hereditary dictatorships have *plenty* of stories about heroes putting down peasant rebellions, actually. Free will is a privilege of the rich and powerful.

          It's not like the "good guys" haven't done evil things. The Pilgrim created a plague that wiped out several innocent villages as collateral damage in wiping out part of Black's army. Procer and their crusade are planning on wholesale genocide against the entirety of Praes. "Good" and "Evil" in this world just defines the set of gods they draw their powers from and the things those gods expect in return.
          ```

          - u/tavitavarus:
            ```
            >Procer and their crusade are planning on wholesale genocide against the entirety of Praes

            No, they're not. A small but vocal minority of Levantine leaders are arguing for outright genocide. The rest of the Crusaders want to partition the Empire into puppet states. And honestly, given how often Praes goes insane and commits acts of mass slaughter, can you blame them?

            The nasty things the Good side in this story have done don't even come close to the horrific deeds committed by the Calamities and the Woe.

            What the Pilgrim did was horrible, but let's not pretend he didn't save far more innocent lives than he took by stopping Black. Black is likeable and very cool, but even his closest friends admit he's a complete madman who has orchestrated the deaths of tens of thousands of innocents.

            No, Good and Evil are not just different religions. Evil literally glorifies murder and betrayal, and even the most rational and reasonable villains in the history of Evil conquered a neighbouring Kingdom and practiced suppression and institutionalised murder. 

            Good on the other hand preaches justice, honour and mercy. Yes, they don't always live up to that and some of their leaders and heroes are take ruthless actions. But you can't argue that Cat is justified in taking extreme measures for the sake of her goals and then condemn the Pilgrim for doing the same thing for what is frankly a far more clear cut greater good.

            Oh, and according to Erratic Errata Good and Evil really do more or less correspond to good and evil respectively.

            I'm not condemning Cat. I like her character. But calling her a good guy is just silly.

          I was more thinking the end game would be having the Gods sort it out between themselves and thus neutralising both. Or at least not fight over Callow.

          I mean, Cat did use an angel's power to get a 1-up despite being a villain. You may say "tricked" but can you really trick a God?
          ```

          - u/tavitavarus:
            ```
            >You may say "tricked" but can you really trick a God?

            Catherine specifically said in that chapter that the angels aren't gods, they are bound to the narrative at least as much as mortals.
            ```

            - u/Rice_22:
              ```
              Angels follow the will of their creator, though. And Gods are the narrative.

                “You can’t cheat me,” I laughed. “You’re not the Gods. You’re part of the story too. You have to follow the rules.”

                -Chapter 47: And Justice For All

                What makes you say the Gods are the narrative? We were told in the very first chapter what the narrative was: grooves in Fate, patterns that repeated themselves until they became more and more likely to reoccur.

          Such as?

          She encouraged and then crushed a rebellion for ethically dubious reasons; and she committed perfidy a bunch of times (eg letting archer shoot a guy she promised safe surrender to), but that's about it.

          Almost all the violence she committed was against military targets who attacked first. All the decisions she took since becoming leader of the Council were within what you'd expect for a head of state whose country is being repeatedly invaded.
          ```

          - u/tavitavarus:
            ```
            How about the time she forced a woman to choke on her own tongue just to make a point? She was a smuggler, sure, but does that warrant summary execution? 

            Or when she crucified hundreds of people for the same reason? Granted, they were complicit in mass murder, but she killed them to create fear among her enemies. She used their deaths in exactly the same way she condemned Praesi for practising human sacrifice: she used their lives for her own benefit.

            Or her strategy at the Battle of Dead Dawn, which she herself admitted removed any delusions about being a good person.

            Or her current campaign, where she's using the threat of death to force entire cities into slavery. Again, the drow are already an absolute abomination of a culture, but that doesn't make it any better.

            Or maybe we should judge her by the company she keeps? Her father figure, an inhuman monster who has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths in the name of his personal pissing match with the Heavens. Her best friend and her general, who view honour and morality as worthless and have to restrain themselves from eating people. Her other close friends: a madman detached from reality whose only objection to human sacrifice is its inefficiency, a narcissist interested ony in finding good fights and strong alcohol and a thief obsessed with revenge against her people's enemies.

            Or the fact she's willing to unleash the 'original abomination' upon millions of innocent people rather than accept the idea she might be wrong.

            Now, there are rationalisations for most of these. Many of them are even valid. But the fact remains: Catherine isn't anywhere close to being good.
            ```

            - u/CouteauBleu:
              ```
              I'll give you the "choking a smuggler" one (I don't remember exactly what is was, but I don't think killing her was super necessary), but otherwise, nope, that's a stretched interpretation.

              The fact is, Catherine has shown on average to be extremely restrained and mindful of civilian lives. She has a professional army, unless Proceran nobles who throw conscripted, untrained peasants into meat grinders.

              Executing hundreds of mages, and making a display of their corpse? That's really not extreme by medieval standards. William did the exact same thing on a lesser scale, for the exact same reasons. Sacrificing part of her army for a tactical advantage? That's war, and not doing it is insane and leads to losing the troops you want to preserve and the country you're trying to defend; Cordelia certainly isn't above doing that; see also her plan for trapping Black's army in a city full of burning civilians.

              Seriously, I can believe that there are ideological differences between Good and Evil that go beyond the aesthetic, but saying that Catherine is a bad person is ridiculous. She did everything she could to minimize the loss of life when confronted with external pressures by murderous schemers, and there's little she could have done to preserve more lives except "murder the bad people sooner".
              ```

  ```
  > The drow softly laughed. “And I believed myself to be ruthless,”

  I really don't get lines like this. The Mighty have already shown that they *do not give a crap* about their underlings' lives. They kill so casually that "getting killed by your boss for no reason" is part of their culture, to the point people are pissed at Cat for saying "you're not allowed to murder your colleagues anymore".

  Soln should be praising her boldness, or her risk-taking, or her military efficiency. Him praising her ruthlessness makes no sense.
  ```

  - u/haiku_fornification:
    ```
    Soln is lying to her face. His plan to damage Losara Sigil was completely intended and when Cat disregarded it and told him what to do he laughed it off with a stupid compliment because he realized he wasn't caught. That's my take on it anyway - Soln is Treacherous Lieutenant #1.
    ```

    - u/HeWhoBringsDust:
      ```
      Nah, 

      Larat is Treacherous Lieutenant #1

      Ubua is Treacherous Lieutenant #2

      Soln is Treacherous Lieutenant #3

      And the rest of the Titled drow fill up the remaining spots. At this rate, Cat might pull an Irritant and survive by virtue of so many attempts to betray her colliding with one another
      ```

- u/Agnoman:
  ```
  >It didn’t quite feel like I’d be breaking our bargain if I did that, but somehow I suspected it was close enough I wouldn’t like the ensuing backlash.

  This seems to imply that Cat has some sort of restrictions to what she can do with her Drow. I really, really want to know what the hell this refers to.

  None of the oaths we've seen suggest anything about Drow rights - one of the oaths is essentially "do anything and everything Cat says to do, exactly the way she wants you to do it, or immediately die". This does not indicate limitations on what Cat can do with her slave army. There's (seemingly) nothing stopping her from just ordering them to accept the alienation.

  I mean, hell, this chapter alone has Cat sacrificing her troops for the sake of tactical expediency. This "bargain" really does not leave Cat with any responsibilities or restrictions, outside of whatever this one is.


  >“There are only a few of us left, Losara,” the Mighty said. “Those who knew this land before Night fell upon it. 

  This whole section, with the story of the Everdark and the Night anf the fall of the Drow, was kind of awesome. "The only sin is death" indeed. Not to mention why Sve Noc are the "Priestesses" of the Night. 

  >And the slaughter isn’t a mistake or an unforeseen consequence, it’s the entire point. Every kill is a sacrifice. Willing. Eager, even. Merciless Gods, Archer was right – this entire realm is an altar.”

  I'm still not sure why raiding parties aren't more of a thing. Sacrificing as many Ratlings as a group of Mighty can get their hands on seems like it would certainly help pay back their debt.

  At the very least, I can see why it's seen as a huge task, sacred enough to redeem any disgrace.

  >the Longstride Cabal entered the fray.

  And now Cat has to deal with the Longstrides. This could be an issue for her, considering none of her plans are in play here.

    > I'm still not sure why raiding parties aren't more of a thing. Sacrificing as many Ratlings as a group of Mighty can get their hands on seems like it would certainly help pay back their debt.

    The opening quote partially addresses this:

    > “There is more power in blood spilled willingly than unwillingly. The latter is simply a great deal easier to obtain.”

    > – Dread Emperor Sorcerous

    I think it's a little bit of the above and a little bit of the risk associated with losing Night. Less Night would mean fewer drow, which means the altar for the Below is smaller for potentially hundreds of years. I agree with your point though. If they had weaker neighbors raiding would become a cultural standard.
    ```

- u/Frommerman:
  ```
  So all of the Night is a sacrificial ritual to put off paying back a debt long in default. The Priestesses of Night are holding the entire Drow race together. Once Cat defeats them, that probably ends, and the rest of the debt comes due.

  Cat is coming out of this mess with only what she bargained out of the Nerezim. Without Night, every Drow will wither and die. That was the knowledge the dwarves withheld while bargaining.
