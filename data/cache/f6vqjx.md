## AI Dungeon, or: How a wizard and an AI DM conspired to end senescence

### Post:

AI dungeon is  version of GPT-2 trained on text-adventure games that you can play with online.  This was the first time I ever played it.  Quotes are my input, normal text is the AI output.  Collaborative storytelling with a machine.  What a world...

------------------------

You are Zorianteron, a wizard living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a staff and a spellbook. You finish your long journey and finally arrive at the ruin you've been looking for. You look around and see that it is indeed a ruined city. The walls are crumbling and falling down, but you can sense that there might be treasure inside.

The first thing you do is cast your spell book at the wall to try to find out what it says.

> listen to spell

As soon as you cast your spell, you hear a voice from behind you.

"What are you doing?"

You turn around and see an old man with white hair and beard standing in front of you.

> say "I'm exploring these ruins.  Who are you?"

You answer back.

He smiles and nods his head. He then asks you some questions about yourself before telling you to go on ahead.

> levitate over wall

You quickly float up over the wall and walk through it. Once you reach the other side, he tells you to follow him.

After walking along a path made by ants, you come across a large room filled with bookshelves and shelves full of them.

> pick out a book at random and read it

You pick out a book at random and begin reading it. After finishing the first page, you feel like something is wrong with you. Something is very wrong...

Suddenly, you feel like all your energy has drained away from you completely. You fall to the ground and start feeling dizzy.

> drink a healing potion

You suddenly feel better and decide to take a healing potion. As soon as you open the bottle, you feel refreshed again.

> read the book again

You continue reading the book after drinking the potion. It seems to be about how to use magic, but you don't understand anything except for basic spells.

It takes you several days until you manage to learn enough about magic so that you can cast a few simple spells without any trouble.

> practice magic

You spend many hours practicing magic, but nothing happens. Eventually, you give up and just sit on the floor and think about everything that happened today.

> pray to Anhur

You begin praying to Anhur, hoping that he will help you. When you finish praying, you realize that this was not a good idea.

Anhur does not seem to care if you live or die.

> pray to Moloch

You continue praying to Moloch, hoping that he will help you. When you finish praying, you realize that this was not a good idea either.

Moloch does not seem to care if you live or die.

> ask the old man how I can become the most powerful wizard in the world

You approach the old man who is sitting on a chair outside of his house. The old man looks at you and says "Are you looking for power? No, I am sorry, but I do not know what you want."
"No, no! Please tell me!" You plead.

> say "I want to be the most powerful wizard in history, so that I can cure death and grant eternal youth to all that would take it."

The old man looks at you and says,

'You wish to be the most powerful wizard in history? Well, I suppose there is one person who could help you achieve such a goal. He lives deep within the forest where we used to play when we were children.

> ask "who is he?"

You ask the old man who replies,

"He is called 'the Wizard'. He is an ancient being that has lived since before time itself existed. His name means 'power' in his own language. He cannot leave this place because he does not have the strength to travel far."

> thank the old man

You thank the old man and walk away from him. You wonder why you did not get answers sooner, but then again you never had much faith in humans anyway.

> resolve to show more faith in your own species

You decide to show more faith in your own species and hope that someday you'll find someone like the old man.

> search for the Wizard in the depths of the forest

You set out into the woods with your staff and spell book. You quickly learn that you don't really have any idea where to look. In fact, you're pretty sure that you've wandered right through some sort of magical barrier.

> inspect barrier

You examine the barrier and see that it's made up of thousands upon thousands of tiny creatures. They move about as they please, seemingly without purpose or even awareness of their surroundings. It seems very strange, but you figure that these things must be some sort of magic automatons.

> create my own swarm of magic automatons

You create a small group of magic automatons by concentrating your mind over them. Your creations are weak, but they work well enough to carry you through the forest. Eventually you reach the edge of the forest and find yourself standing in front of a large stone door.

> knock on door

You knock on the door and hear a voice inside.
"Who may I serve?"
"My name is Zorianteron, and I'm looking for the Wizard."
"Yes, yes, of course you are. What can I do for you today?

> "I wish to be your apprentice, that I may find a cure for death and save the people of the world."

The old man smiles and says,
"Ah yes, you are indeed curious about becoming my apprentice. I am pleased to hear that you have such a desire. But first, let me tell you something about myself."
You stare at the old man in disbelief.

> listen to the old man

The old man continues,
"I was once a powerful wizard. My knowledge of magic was vast and my spells were many. However, one day I lost all of my power when a curse struck me down. Now I wander the land alone, trying to regain what little strength I still possess."

> "Who cast the curse on you?"

The old man looks around and points to his face, which now has a few scars. He explains,
"It was an ancient evil that took hold of me long ago. The curse spread throughout my body and mind until I could no longer control my actions. I became completely insane.

> "Will you teach me your secrets?"

The old man nods enthusiastically and says,
"Of course! Of course I will!"
You nod back and agree to become his apprentice.
"Well then, I shall take you to the place where the curse originated from."
He leads you towards a cave entrance.

> enter the cave

You enter the cave and soon after you feel a strong compulsion to kill someone. You turn around and see a young girl lying dead on her bed. She's been stabbed several times in the chest, neck, head and hands.

> save the girl

You rush into the room and pull out your wand. You quickly cast a healing spell on her before she dies.

"Thank you," she says as she fades away.

She doesn't seem to notice you, but then again she probably didn't really care either way.

> ask the old man what's going on


> "What's going on, old man?"

The old man looks around and answers,

"Death. It's everywhere. All over the world, even here in this very house. Death has taken its toll on us all."

You nod slowly and say, "So what can we do about it?

> "How can we remove death from the world?"

The old man looks around and sighs,

"We cannot. We must accept our fate or try to fight against it. There is nothing we can do about it except pray to some higher being for help."

You nod and say, "That's not good enough."

> "You're old.  If you're as old as you say, you must have some way of prolonging your lifespan.  Don't you?"

The old man smiles at you and says,
"Yes, I do. But it would be too dangerous to you. You'd die first of course."

You nod slowly and say, "Okay...but how?

> "Why is it so dangerous?"

The old man frowns at you and says,

"Because I'm a vampire. My blood flows only from me. No one else gets any of it. That means if anyone ever tries to get rid of me, they'll just end up killing themselves instead."

> "What?!  So you drink people's blood?!  Is that the curse that was placed upon you?"

The old man shrugs and says,

"No, no. Not at all. I've never done it before and I doubt if I ever will again. However, there are other ways to extend your life span without drinking blood.

> "What are they?"

The old man nods and says,

"They're called elixirs. They come in many forms, but the most common ones are potions. Some of them are stronger than others, but most can give you an extra few years.

> "How can I learn how to make them?"

The old man shakes his head and says,

"I don't know. The best place to start learning is in the library. I think you could find something there."

> "Then I'll look there.  First, can you tell me how to become better at magic?  I trained all night, but it didn't help."

The old man smiles at you and says,

"Magic isn't my specialty. Magic is the art of manipulating energy. You use it to cast spells and bend nature itself to your will.

> "Magic isn't your specialty?  But you're the Wizard!"

The old man grins at you and says,

'Ah yes, the Wizard. A title given to those who master the arcane arts. As a wizard, you control the elements with your mind and manipulate time with your wand.

> "But old man, you used to be a wizard, too.  You said it yourself!"

The old man chuckles and says,

'Oh yes. Yes I did. It wasn't long after I became a vampire that I realized my talents were limited.

> shake your head.  "Alright, old man.  Thanks for your help...  I'll go to this library and try to find out how to make these elixir potions."

The old man smiles at you and says,

"Well, good luck. Good day."

> "Good day".  You leave the cave.

You walk along the road and see a small village ahead of you. It looks like it might be full of people.

Suddenly, you hear a voice behind you.

"Hey! What are you doing out here?"

> "I'm traveling to the Library.  Who are you?"

You turn around and see a young woman dressed in red robes standing right behind you. She has bright green eyes and her hair is tied up into two pigtails.

She raises an eyebrow at you and asks,

"Who are you?"

> "I'm Zorianteron, a mage-in-training."

The girl's eyebrows rise even higher and she says,

"A mage-in-training? That sounds very impressive.  How do you know so much about us?  Are you related to one of our wizards or witches?

> "I'm a junior wizard."

The girl frowns at you and says,
"What makes you think we'd want to meet someone as lowly as you?  We're not exactly renowned for our mages."
You shrug and say,
"I guess I was just curious.  Maybe I'll get lucky someday."

> Create a ball of werelight

You raise your hand and create a ball of light, which you then throw towards the girl. The girl catches it easily and smiles at you.

"Thank you," she says. "Now if only I could learn how to cast some firebolt..."

> give the girl a copy of 'a beginner's guide to cantrips'

You give the girl a book titled 'a beginner's guide to cantrips'. She takes it from you and reads through it quickly before handing it back to you.

"Thanks," she says. "Can I keep this?"

> "Sure.  I have 5."

You look down at the books and smile. "That will do nicely," you say.

The girl nods and thanks you again before leaving with her companions.

> Travel in to town

You arrive at the town of Nuro where you notice that there are several buildings still standing. There are also many people walking around. Most seem to be merchants selling their wares and travelers looking for work.

> look for an inn to stay the night in

You head over to one of the larger buildings and ask the owner what he knows about lodging. He tells you that they've had problems with bandits recently, but other than that nothing unusual has happened lately.

> pay for a bed and go to sleep

You lay down on the bed and close your eyes. You don't feel tired at all, in fact you don't even feel sleepy. Your mind seems to be completely clear and focused.

> practice magic until you feel tired

You sit up and start practicing your spells. It doesn't take long before you find yourself feeling tired. You can already sense that something is wrong though...you begin to feel like you need more rest.

> go to sleep

You lie down and drift off to sleep.

You awaken in the morning feeling refreshed. You realize that you haven't slept much at all last night. What on earth did you eat last night? You remember eating something sweet, but what was it?

> "It probably doesn't matter."

You shake your head and decide not to think too hard about it. You just need to get out of here as soon as possible.

As you walk along the streets, you see several signs advertising various businesses such as taverns, brothels and so forth.

> Look for a magical item store

You walk towards the nearest building and enter it. Inside you see a sign saying 'Magical Item Store'. The store itself looks very ordinary, but upon closer inspection you notice that its windows are covered by large black curtains.

> ask whether they have flying carpets

You ask the clerk behind the counter if they sell flying carpets. She says she does, but they're expensive.

You tell her that you want to buy some and she tells you that she'll have them delivered tomorrow morning.

> go back to the travern and see if anyone needs any odd jobs doing

You return to the tavern and see if anyone else needs help. No-one seems to be in need of anything right now, but then again no-one's really supposed to be around here anyway.

> Climb the tallest building in town and meditate

You quickly climb the tallest building in town and meditate there. You feel very peaceful while you do this, but you still aren't sure why.

The next day, you return to the Travern and report your findings.

> Return to the magic item store

You return to the Magic Item Store and ask the clerk what happened. He explains that he had been having trouble with his customers lately, so he decided to try selling a few strange items on the side.

> "Have the flying carpets arrived?"

You ask the clerk if he has any flying carpets. He says yes, but they're expensive.
You tell him that you want one and he tells you that they've only got a couple left.

> "How much will a flying carpet cost?"

He tells you that a flying carpet would set you back over ten thousand gold coins. You laugh and tell him that you can afford it, but he replies that they don't make them like they used to anymore.

You reply "Well I'm going to find out!"

> Buy a flying carpet

You buy a flying carpet from him for ten thousand gold coins. It takes you two days to complete the transaction. When you arrive at the Flying Carpet Shop, you pay the clerk and take your new carpet home.

> Get on the carpet and take off

You put the carpet on your head and begin to fly. It takes a lot of concentration, but eventually you reach the roof of your house where you land safely.

Your parents are quite surprised when they see you!

> Fly to the Library

You fly up to the library and begin to look through its bookshelves. You find nothing interesting, but you notice that there is an old book lying open on top of one of the shelves.

It's called 'The Book Of The Dead'.

> read the book of the dead

You pick up the book and begin to read. As you do, you suddenly feel yourself being pulled towards the Book Of The Dead. You turn around and see a large black door with a golden handle standing before you.

> open the door

You open the door and enter a room filled with candles. There is also a table full of books, some of which you recognize as those found in the library.

There is no music playing here either, but then again there isn't really anything else to do right now...

> "Is anyone there?  What is this place?"

A voice answers back "Welcome to the Book Of The Dead."

"What does this mean?" you ask.

"This means that you have entered my book of knowledge.

> "Who are you?"

A voice answers back:

'I am the Book Of The Dead.'

'Do you know me?'

'Yes, I believe so. My name is Zorianteron. How did you come to be in my book of knowledge?

> "What do you mean?  Zorianteron is my name, not yours!"


> ask the book how to make the elixir of life.

"If you wish to create the Elixir of Life, then you must first drink from the Fountain of Youth. This fountain was created by my great-grandfather who lived long ago. If you want to return to your own time, then I will give you a bottle containing the elixir."

> "It's not enough for just me to get it, book.  I need to know how to make it.  I need to make enough for the whole world, that children may bathe in it, that it may flow in rivers, that Death and Pestilence may be struck from the cosmos, War made painless, Famine made weak.  There's little point to eternal youth if it's spent alone."

A voice answers back:

'No, I cannot give you the elixir. Only the creator can do such a thing. The creator lives forever, and he has no end. He is immortal.'

'So what's all this about immortality anyway?

> "How can I find the creator?"

A voice answers back:

'By following the path of the magician. A magician travels through time and space, seeking out his creator. In order to travel through time, a magician must go into the past and travel forward in time until they reach their origin.

> "Wait, we can do that?  Okay."  Travel back in time.

"Okay," you reply.

You walk along the wall and look down at the floor below. You notice a small hole in the ground, and you think "That looks like where I hid something when I was hiding under that desk."

> miniaturize yourself and jump into the hole

You jump into the hole and begin walking towards the wall. Suddenly, you feel a sharp pain in your chest and fall backwards onto the floor. You try to stand up, but find that you're too weak to do so.

> cast a spell of healing on yourself

You cast a spell of healing on yourself, which helps you recover quickly.

"Wow! That was really easy!" you exclaim as you regain your strength.

The next day, you leave the Book Of The Dead and head back home.

> create the elixir of life

You walk along the wall and look down at the floor below. You notice a small hole in the ground, and you think 'That looks like where I hid something when I was hiding under that desk.

> "Wait.  This seems familiar."  You pinch yourself, and find it doesn't hurt.

You continue walking along the wall and look down at the floor below. You notice a small hole in the ground, and you think 'This is where I hid something when I was hiding under that desk.

You walk along the wall and look down at the floor below.

> Look up.

You turn around and see a man standing above you with an axe in hand. He looks very old, and his face is wrinkled. His eyes seem to glow red.

He says "I'm sorry, but I am going to have to kill you now.

> Cast a magic missile at him

You fire a magic missile at him, but unfortunately it misses.

"What's wrong?" you ask.

"Nothing," he replies. "But I've been watching you since yesterday morning."

> cast another magic missile at him, aiming for his chest.  "Why?"

"Because if you get close enough to me, I will be able to sense your magical energy. If it gets high enough, then I'll know what you're capable of."

You fire another magic missile at him, but again it misses.

"Good job," he says.

> "There's no need for snark, grandpa."  You concentrate, and fire a great beam of arcane energy out of your hands, sweeping it across the corridor.  There's no way this can miss!

Your attack hits the Grand Wizard squarely in the chest, instantly killing him. However, you feel a strange sensation. It feels like there's a little bit of your own magical energy inside him...

Suddenly, you feel sick.

> Grab the Grand Wizard's corpse and extract your energy back out of him.  That's mine, damnit!  You're not getting it!

You grab the Grand Wizard's corpse and pull out all of your energy from him.

"Gah!" you cry out, coughing up blood. "I don't want any more..."

You collapse to the floor, gasping for breath.

> use your newfound energy to heal your wounds

You stand up and begin to run towards the door. You run through the corridors, dodging obstacles and monsters alike. Your legs ache badly, but you keep running.

Eventually, you reach a large room with many doors leading off into different rooms.

> cast a divination spell using an empty beer bottle to find out which door is the way out

You cast a divination spell on the walls of the room, hoping to find out which door leads outside.

The first thing you do is search for a suitable object. A beer bottle would work well, as it has a wide mouth and is easy to hold in one hand.

> Find a beer bottle on a table

You pick up the beer bottle, and throw it over to the table. The bottle breaks open easily, spilling its contents onto the floor.

You quickly pick up the broken glass bottles and place them back into their original places. You check behind you, finding nothing out of place.

> Cast the divination spell

You cast the divination spell, trying to determine which door leads outside.

It takes a few tries, but eventually you succeed in determining that the right door leads outside. You walk over to it cautiously and knock on the door.

"Who is there?"

> "Zorianteron."

You answer, "Zorianteron."

A voice answers back, "Zorianteron? Who is this?"

"This is my friend, Zorianteron. He lives in the city of Larion.

> Go through the door.

You enter the door, and find yourself standing in front of a small wooden house. The door opens up into a hallway, with several doors along it. One of these doors is slightly ajar, revealing an old man sitting by himself on the other side of the hall.

"Hello,"

> "Am I still inside the book of the dead?"

You reply, "Yes, I'm still in the book of the dead."

The old man looks at you curiously. "What are you doing here?" he asks.

"I came to talk about magic," you explain.

> "I want to know how to leave this book, and also how to create the elixir of life.", you explain.

"How did you get in here?"

"I found this book while looking for a new job. It was lying around, so I picked it up."

He nods slowly. "Do you think it might be cursed?" he asks.

> "The thought crossed my mind."

You shrug. "No, not really. It's just been a long time since I've read it."

He sighs deeply, then says, "Well, if you're sure...you can come out now."

> "Alright".  You come out.

You step out from the book of the dead, and see that you're no longer trapped. You look around, noticing that you're back in your own home.

> Get out your alchemy kit and try to create the elixir of life.

You rush off to your kitchen, where you grab some ingredients and begin mixing up the potion. After a few minutes, you notice that the potion isn't working as well as it should.

"Maybe I need more alcohol..." you mutter to yourself.

> Add some vodka to the potion

You add some vodka to the potion, hoping that will help it work better. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to do anything.

"That didn't work!" you exclaim. "Something must be wrong with the recipe."

Suddenly, you hear a loud noise coming from downstairs!

> Cast a spell of see through rock and look down

You quickly cast a spell of see-through rock, which reveals that there is indeed a cave behind you.

"Crap!" you shout. "I forgot to bring my rope ladder."

You run back upstairs, only to find that the cave has collapsed into itself completely!

> go back into the kitchen and keep making the potion

You return to the kitchen, where you continue making the potion. However, after a couple hours, you realize that the potion is starting to lose its potency. You decide that perhaps it needs another drink.

> drink the elixir of life

You take a swig of the elixir, and immediately feel rejuvenated. Your skin feels smoother than ever before, and you feel like you could live forever. The old man watches you drink it happily.

"It tastes great!" he says. "Now we'll see who wins!"

> You reply, "Everyone, old man.  Everyone wins."

You say, "Old man, everyone wins. I'm still alive."

He smiles at you. "Goodbye, mortal," he says. Then he disappears.

> smile.  "Goodbye, old man.  I hope you're happy, wherever you are."  You create a swarm of magic constructs, as you learned to do back in the forest.  You direct your half of your swarm  to start mass-producing the elixir of life using the ingredients in your stores, and the other half to go and acquire more ingredients and barrels for storage.

After a week or so, you finally have enough ingredients to make the potion. You spend the next few days perfecting the recipe, until one day when you're feeling particularly creative. You think about how this would be an excellent opportunity to test out your new invention: the Magic Carpet!

> Get on your magic carpet, swarm in tow.  You load your barrels of elixir of life onto the carpet and then fly to the nearest city.  You arrive just before dawn.  You hover over the city for a while, listening to the sounds of the night's end.

The smell of smoke rises from the nearby chimneys.  Suddenly, you sense something... unnatural. It's not just smoke; it's a horrible stench.  Something foul is going on here!

You turn your head and stare at the cityscape below you.

> decide it's time to begin.  "Every second is a life lost, every hour a massacre.  This day, death's grasp on the world becomes that much weaker.  This day, the light shines that much brighter."  You direct your magical constructs to open the tap on one of the barrels of elixir of life.

A thick liquid oozes out of the barrel and begins dripping down your legs.  You stand up slowly, holding your breath.  As soon as you step off the carpet, a bright light fills your eyes and burns them until they become red hot.

> cast a spell of aerosol on the dripping elixir, turning it in to a shining mist that spreads on to the city below.

You cast a spell of aerosol on the dripping elixir, turning it in to a shining mist that spreads on to the city below.

As you walk along, you notice that the city is covered by a thin layer of white fog.  You can almost taste it!

> Cast a spell of wind, blowing the mist of elixir of life into people's homes.  As they breathe it in, their skin turns smoother than ever before, and the bodies of the old and frail grow lithe and strong once more.

You cast a spell of wind, blowing the mist of elixir of life into people's homes.

Your magic construct takes care of the rest. You are now free to enjoy your newfound immortality.

> win.

You win, mortal.  Life has been reborn.

AI dungeon is  version of GPT-2 trained on text-adventure games that you can play with online.  This was the first time I ever played it.  I can't believe how good GPT-2 is at making good-sounding responses to inputs.  There are holes where the model got confused, sure, but overall it works amazingly well, especially to help add flavor/random events to what you write.  GPT-2 seems to work best on short time/text-scales; after a while, it seems to temporarily forget what's going on, though you can remind it.  I wonder what you could do with multiple people involved, maybe one acting as a DM by curating the AI's 'memory' string.

I decide to post this here because it's rational-adjacent-ish.
I feel like the model got sick of me at the end, when it just said 'your construct takes care of the rest."

### Comments:

- u/__2BR02B__:
  ```
  Very cool! Much more coherent than I would’ve expected.
  ```

  - u/zorianteron:
    ```
    I was just giving it a go for fun, but how well it fit together really surprised me.

    I did have to make one revert at one point when it lost the plot and went in to an infinite loop, so it's not really perfect or something you could make a 'real' game with yet, but still- very interesting.  The fact it's apparently modelling situations to some degree is pretty crazy.
    ```

- u/okokjustasking:
  ```
  Might be good to add your comment at the end to the top. I got maybe a quarter of the way through before I got bored, but knowing this had all been GPT-2 generated I probably would have found that quarter a lot more interesting.

    Sure, edited.

  This is a lot more interesting than my own experience with ai dungeon today.  Picked a rogue and promptly was drawn into a conversation with a mysterious voice about how we should or shouldn't get married.

    What'd you do in the end?

  Definitely cursed.

  That was uncannily consistent, for instance the part where the Wizard still remembers later that he's a vampire.  O.O
