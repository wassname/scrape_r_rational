  Having read through the Calling Card portion, this seems like a retread of *Worm* in pretty much every sense except she happens to be a Ward now. Maybe because I wasn't enthralled with *Worm* to begin with, but that's not enough for me to want to keep reading. Is there something more that *Cenotaph* brings to the table?

    She doesn't actually end up as a Ward. The author's endnote suggests that the original purpose of writing was to show that she very easily could have ended up a Ward. Then, after the first chapter, he turned it around to show that even if it looks like she was going to become a Ward things could change again. The underlying idea was to show that small events can have disproportionate effects on life outcomes, I guess.

    Not really. It's been 3 days since the last post on /r/rational, and that means it's time for me to find some new content.

    Eliezer recommended cenotaph in the april author notes.

    I liked it because it felt like reading Worm again for the first time.  If you weren't a big fan of the original then no, there's not much here for you.
