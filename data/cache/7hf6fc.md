  Who also thinks Black is going to be like Voldemort now? 

  Cruel, cold and practical with a central flaw in his thinking. A flaw his enemies will capitalise on?

  Malicia's words are evidence that The Black Knight is on his way out. If he had kept his composure, his cold practicality, his distance, he had a good chance of finally flipping the tables of the story. But the Bard and Fate knew exactly where to hit him to knock him off his game. 

  And the Knight is off his game. Mistakes will be made.

  The era of the Calamities is at an end. The Woe that arises from the ashes will devour Creation whole.

    In the best Praes style of nicknames, the Woe:

    - The Black Knight, "The Last Ducess of Winter"
    - Her Adjutant, "Deadhand"
    - The Hierophant, "The Glass Eye Beholder of Miracles"
    - The Archer, "The Ashokani Magekiller"
    - The Thief, "Sunstealer"
    ```

    - u/zhaomeng:
      ```
      Sunstealer is a reallly awesome nickname to be had. True story too! =D
      ```

      - u/DTravers:
        ```
        > Sunstealer

        Sun*yoink*er
        ```

    - u/Oaden:
      ```
      Would be kinda surprised if Cat actually became the black knight though.

      Like, the rest of the party is neutral, the black knight seems oddly villainous.
      ```

      - u/everything-narrative:
        ```
        Oh my god.

        Cat is the last Duchess of Winter.

        She's the Vicequeen of Callow.

        She's going to become the White Queen.
        ```

    > Voldemort  
    > practical

    You mean HPMOR Voldemort, right? Because canon Voldemort...isn't.
    ```

    - u/TheEngineer923:
      ```
      But of course. My bad for not being clearer. Illusion of transparency and M.P. Fallacy is still a bit of a bother for me.
      ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      > HPMOR

      ???
      ```

      - u/NotACauldronAgent:
        ```
        Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. The flagship fanfic for this genre, and one of the most debated about, people have strong opinions, both for and against, it. Presents a competent and dangerous Voldemort.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          you just gave me a new thing to read, thanks.
          ```

          - u/Cariyaga:
            ```
            Feel free to talk about your thoughts on it in the OT/Rationality threads!
            ```

          - u/Ardvarkeating101:
            ```
            First four chapters suck, btw, don't let them discourage you!
            ```

- u/paradoxinclination:
  ```
  I really have to give the author credit for managing to make Malicia so damn scary without even using any overt threats. Every time Cat starts giving her lip my heart gets a little stutter-y.
  ```

- u/Nihilvin:
  ```
  Calling it now. Book 4 is gonna be the Woe vs Calamities while setting up whatever plan the bard and tyrant have for praes.

  Also, does anyone else think Malicia's deterrent isn't Still Water but Diablolist's superweapon? Still Water will trigger a crusade and she seemed to disapprove of it. You need something scary enough that even a Crusade is out of the question. If Still Water could have been that deterrent Malicia would have started work on it herself.
  ```

  - u/Yes_This_Is_God:
    ```
    Yes. Not a difficult call--Malicia has literally stated this.
    ```

- u/MoralRelativity:
  ```
  What is Malicia up to?
  ```

  - u/nick012000:
    ```
    She told Diabolist's mom in one of the extra chapters a while back: she wants the Diabolist to create a super-weapon that she can use to threaten the Principate into never attacking Praes with.
    ```

    - u/Oaden:
      ```
      Which obviously won't work. It a plan divorced from the realities of the narrative of the world. 

      A villain can't expect to point a doomsday device in any direction, and expect it to last. She even expects it to be used by Akua, and her to keep it after. Its like her cackling at the top of her lungs "No one can stop me now! Not even the lone hero!"
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        > She even expects it to be used by Akua,

        This is why I came back around to fully hate Malicia, I'll enjoy her fall.
        ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Isn't that the classic supervillain mistake though? Assuming a single powerful weapon can make them invincible? Sounds like both Black and Malicia are developing classic blindspots.
      ```

      - u/DTravers:
        ```
        According to Malicia the Tower has four, plus Still Water.
        ```

    - u/MoralRelativity:
      ```
      I had totally forgotten that. Thanks for the reminder!
      ```

      - u/TheEngineer923:
        ```
        Hope said weapon does not double around and cause Cordelia to call for a Crusade.
        ```

- u/MultipartiteMind:
  ```
  "Iâ€™d needed Hierophant in the loop to have a chance of this ending in the ruination of Callow. Which, in all fairness, it still might.":  'ending without' rather than 'ending in'?  Or perhaps a missing 'not'?  Whichever the case, this made me smile!
  ```
