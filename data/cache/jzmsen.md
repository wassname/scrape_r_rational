## HPMOR: Ch 59

### Post:

Going through another reread of HPMOR after recommending it to a new friend.

For the first time in this readthrough I realized why Dumbledore said this after Harry's escape via rocket powered broomstick:

> "Who's behind it?" shouted Amelia to the broomstick flying a pace away from her.  
>  
> "One of two people," Dumbledore said back, "I know not, at this instant, who. If the first, then we are in trouble. If the second, we are all in far greater trouble."

I'd glossed over this many times before, not really grokking what Dumbledore was thinking.  I gathered of course that he suspects Harry and Voldemort, but had never really settled in my mind why one was "far greater trouble."

I think I had assumed on first read through he thought Harry's involvement would mean trouble because it showed his recklessness or unsuitability as a hero, and Voldemort would be worse because it shows he's watching Harry's actions and copying his use of muggle technology, which is a new and terrible threat.

But now I think it's the other way around.

"Trouble" is voldemort.

"Far grater trouble" is Harry - because it would indicate that Harry is NOT a "good" copy of voldemort as he seems, he's a true evil copy of Voldemort and has been playing Dumbledore for a fool.  In this case they are ROYALLY SCREWED, because the prophesied hero is actually the villain, and they have no chance at all of defeating two Voldemorts without the help of prophecy.   The World is doomed, Dumbledore's game with Time failed; he placed all his hope and trust in Harry saving the people of the world somehow, but if he is evil, there's no hope at all of a happy ending.

  I read it as Voldemort being trouble and Harry being far greater trouble, but not for that reason. It's simply that, if it's Harry, that means he thinks he knows better than all of Magical Britain what's best for them and is unwilling to compromise, bow to politics, or consider slower or less revolutionary solutions to things he observes as problems. In essence, it's what Quirrel said at the end of that arc: if Harry does conquer Magical Britain, overturn the aristocracy and democracy to institute a Harryocracy, and begin to optimize the world as he wishes, he will be their Dark Lord whether or not the magic he uses is actually Dark.

  Basically, Dumbledore is deeply concerned that it was either Voldemort, or a far smarter, more dangerous, and more self-righteous Grindelwald. The only advantage to the Grindelwald option is that he's just 11 at this point...but how much of an advantage is that when 11 year old Grindelwald has already invented two incredibly powerful magical techniques which should have been impossible, under a year after discovering that magic even exists?

    I think at the very least, Harry's uncompromising stance is only part of Dumbledore's worries.  From Chapter 61:

    >"In any case," said the Potions Master. "I looked within Mr. Lestrange to see if he knew anything of his mother's escape. He has heard nothing. But the instant he learns, he will conclude that the person responsible was Harry Potter."

    >"I see..." Albus said slowly. "Thank you, Severus. That is good news."

    I think he's more worried about Harry actually being giving in to his Voldemort tendencies and corrupting his motives.  Dumbledore would still strongly oppose a plan to break into Azkaban even to save an innocent person, purely on the grounds of maintaining the peace, but the other side of that argument would not alarm him nearly as much as someone who possesses the intellect to defeat Voldemort giving in to the dark side.

    And the other problem with that is that only being 11 is a temporary condition.

    I think Dumbledore was imagining something more direct in this case.  His main thought about why someone would free Bellatrix was the horcrux, and I think this indicates he's afraid of harry now, not in the future, as he'd have to be aligned with voldemort to do this.

  ```
  Dumbledore  ransacked the hall of prophecy and assassinated Harry's pet rock to force an unbreakable vow not to destroy the world on him. If the only one who can guide the world through the tiny path that allows survival is evil, that is bad.
  ```

    ```
    Yep, exactly
    ```

- u/Evirua:
  ```
  Not to sound like a d\*ckhead \*proceeds to sound like a d\*ckhead\* but that's how I interpreted it on the first read. The chosen hero being the villain is obviously a far worst outcome than the expected villain.
  ```

  - u/wren42:
    ```
    right, I just hadn't thought about the implications to Dumbledore's long term plan, and the mechanics of how Harry might be evil.
    ```
