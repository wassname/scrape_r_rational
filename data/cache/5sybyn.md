  Just a heads up to everyone that the month's [bonus chapter](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/02/08/reign/) is out as well, focusing on Malicia
  ```

  An ever growing possibility is that Squire and her supporters, and possibly the calamities , are going to end up as the anti-divine-game faction. As evidence I point out: Masego's ambition, a new kind of evil in Praes which judging by the Tyrants statements in this chapter is not to the gods below's liking, the involment of the keeper of stories whose title and abilities suggest that she's there to keep the story (which seems to be the meat of the gods' "game").
  With all of this I can't help but think that there's a significant possibilty that a lot of characters will go this route or at least be involved with it in some way.

    I highly doubt anyone anywhere knows what gods below like and don't like.

  - u/ATRDCI:
    ```
    Though no one really knows exactly what the Gods Below want, I'd think they'd be at worst neutral and more likely at least somewhat supportive of the "new brand" of evil. Unless I just horribly misunderstood things, the grand debate between the Gods Above and Gods Below wasn't about what was good or evil, but about whether or not people should have free will. And it is only in the context of this argument that Black/Catherine/etc. are "anti-divine".  They are perfectly willing to be morally "good" when it suits them but loathe being controlled to the point they refuse to be "Good".  And the subversion/destruction of roles, of blowing up the formed stories that control people's actions, rob them of free will to at least some extent, should sit well with the Gods Below. Is this not what Black's dream is? To make it known that the story can be broken? That hundreds of years later, people will still remember the time that simply being a hero fighting a villain wasn't enough?  That someone had risen above the ruts society has been driven into to make more for themselves than what destiny granted?
