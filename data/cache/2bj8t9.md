  Repost, but I don't think it got nearly enough attention last time.

  It's damn good cyberpunk, written by a programmer. An actual honest to gods programmer. Which puts the technology a head above most cyberpunk, which is a weird sort of dystopia fetishism.

  I don't think I'd be spoiling it if I told you that AI was the central conflict of the story. But he does a very good job deconstructing the "[A.I. Is a Crapshoot](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot)" trope.
