    I've listened to a lot of worm, but I don't get how that's \*rational\* fiction. Can anyone explain?
    ```

    - u/The_British_Gov:
      ```
      It's not explicitly rational fiction, just an interesting and well written web fiction.
      ```

        Thx, British government! Now please get your shit together!

      *Worm* tackles many different issues. One of them is at least rational-adjacent: how do you create a universe with standard superhero conventions -- which were originally developed for children -- and make them work for an older audience? After all, secret identities, masks and costumes, non-lethal confrontations, "deranged supervillains", mad scientists and other elements common in classic superhero comics are not something that you would expect to arise even if some humans suddenly obtained superpowers in real life. *Worm* goes out of its way to create a universe where comics conventions sort of make sense.

  Recommendations:

  [A Bad Name](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-bad-name-worm-oc-the-gamer.500626/) is a gamer-fic done well. The game layer is actually explored as the protagonist progresses, and it actually shows character growth when it’s linked to an improving intelligence stat.

  [Friendship is Optimal](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal) is a look at an almost-perfectly programmed A.I. and the resulting singularity, with added ponies.

  [Friendship is Optimal: Always Say No](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/91933/friendship-is-optimal-always-say-no) follows someone who has refused to upload when most of the world already has. The A.I. always wins in Optimalverse stories, but they’re about the journey more than the destination.

  [Friendship Is Optimal: Caelum Est Conterrens](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/69770/friendship-is-optimal-caelum-est-conterrens) another Optimalverse story, this one endorsed by Yudkowsky himself. The title translates to “Heaven is Terrifying,” and that really says it all, doesn’t it?

  [Mortal](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/95424/mortal) is a more traditionally “rational” story. When you have a way to defeat death, *why not*? Contains ponies.

  [The Moon’s Apprentice](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/196256/the-moons-apprentice) is basically [HPMOR](http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/1) but ponies.

  [Message in a Bottle](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/368986/message-in-a-bottle) is a sci-fi story where a probe from Earth hits an alien ring world which is also a superintelligence. But with ponies.

  [A White Mare](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/260906/a-white-mare) is something that seems almost made for this subreddit. An alicorn from another world with the talent of ruling a nation pulls out all the stops to return home, and also keep the friend she made on Earth while deprived of her powers. Contains ponies and memetic doomsday weapons.

  [The Longest Day](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/429190/the-longest-day) is literally HPMOR but with ponies. It’s a crossover, and a well-written one. The author is also something of an artist, and made a comic strip to supplement the story.

  [Binary Suns](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/232796/binary-suns) is only one chapter in length, but it rationally explores what happens when an immortal ruler wakes up to find there are two of her.

    What's with all the ponies?

  [Unsong.](http://unsongbook.com/)

  It's by Scott Alexander ([slatestarcodex.com](http://www.slatestarcodex.com)) and I cannot recommend it highly enough.
  ```

  - u/_The_Bomb:
    ```
    Ok, I’ll bite. Why? What makes it so good?
    ```

    - u/boomfarmer:
      ```
      Puns.
      ```

    - u/TacticalTable:
      ```
      It's hard to summarize how Unsong is incredible, because typing it out just makes it sound a bit boring. I've typed and retyped this comment five times now trying to find a way to describe it that doesn't sell it short. You'd be best off just starting with the prologue.

      http://unsongbook.com/prologue-2/

      It's a perfect intro to the setting, which defines most of the story.

  ```
  [Lord of the Mysteries](https://boxnovel.com/novel/lord-of-the-mysteries/): Chinese webnovel set in Late Industrial Revolution Steampunk Europe with Lovecraft elements. It’s obviously translated from Chinese to English but it’s readable, and the mindset of the Main Character is different from that of other protagonists recommended here due to cultural differences.

  - u/iftttAcct2:
    ```
    Any idea, in the latest chapter, how the MC was able to cast illusions? I don't recall that being one of his powers.
    ```

    - u/Rice_22:
      ```
      It's part of his Magician's bag of tricks, which he kept (and improved) as Faceless.

      >Illusion Creation - Able to change the sound, smell or colour of the environment or items.
      ```

      - u/iftttAcct2:
        ```
        Ah, thanks! I guess I've forgotten about that.
        ```

        - u/Rice_22:
          ```
          Yeah, it's kind of crazy the variety of powers Magician granted him. But it fits the theme, I guess?
          ```

    - u/reddithanG:
      ```
      You mean the paper figurine power?
      ```

      - u/iftttAcct2:
        ```
        No, the illusions he cast to make his clothes appear different (and the paper he used as a pass - the paper dolls can turn into anything, now?)
        ```

        - u/reddithanG:
          ```
          Maybe it the result of an upgrade when becoming faceless
          ```

          - u/NotEnoughSatan:
            ```
            No he got this from Sequence 7 Magician, he just doesn't use it very often. Its the same power he uses to hide his gun from the police occasionally.

  Is it worth the candle actually worth it?

    Worth the Candle is great. If you don't like character development getting in the way of your progression fantasy, it might not be for you, but otherwise I'd strongly recommend it.

      ```
      Thanks. It is *GREAT*. :bow:

  - u/water125:
    ```
    It's one of the best if not the best story I've read from here.

    It's almost to LitRPGs what Evangelion is to mecha.

  Rational reads has some stories that aren’t in the Rec threads or tv tropes page.
