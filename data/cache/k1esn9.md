## Have any of you GM'ed a rational Table-Top RPG campaign?

### Post:

The thought came to me and am curious what that would look like. Especially in settings other than DnD's.

  I've DMed a homebrew campaign before. It's a lot of work building the setting, but that part is manageable with extensive prep time. The hard part is improvising the story while keeping things rational. I've found that a lot of the time what is rational isn't always going to be fun for the players, and for personally, I found it more important that my players actually enjoyed themselves. 

  Another issue with improv is that you don't have the time to consider the greater ramifications of whatever it is that you are creating. For example, you simply don't have the time to consider whether it actually makes sense in the setting for your AI dungeon custodian to accompany the players on their journey in a small and compact chibi form in order to continue to watch over the dungeon relics that the party had looted.

  I haven't GM'd but I have played a few that felt very rational. The feeling came from that the GM had spent a lot of time considering first and second order effects of the setting, and that the actions of my character succeeded or failed based on (the GM's fair interpretation) of their merits rather than on narrative convenience.

    Yeah, thats how I DM too. tbh not sure if calling it a rational TTRPG is quite apt, as that seems to imply something in particular, but what I do is basically write down some major events to create a narrative around, and give the NPCs involved their own agenda and interests, consider how and why people would be involved (which implies a lot about the economical circumstances of a location) and just set the players loose in that. It works pretty well for my group, but to be fair my players like social challenges like that and don't mind going a session or a few without any combat. It took a bit for them to get used to my style, but they do have taken to it and enjoy the depth of the world around them. \*Really\* depends on the group though.

  I'm not the GM, but I'm in the process of playing an [Empiricist](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/investigator/archetypes/paizo-investigator-archetypes/empiricist/) [Natural Philosopher](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/investigator/archetypes/paizo-investigator-archetypes/natural-philosopher-investigator-archetype/) in my current Dark Sun campaign (both [Investigator](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/investigator/) archetypes stack). He's an excessively educated man in the middle of a desert apocalypse, which serves as a pretty delightful contrast to the rest of the band of murderhobos I've fallen in with. 

  * [Precise Treatment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/traits/magic-traits/precise-treatment/) + [Healing Hands (Conduit)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/conduit-feats/healers-hands-conduit/) (and soon [Signature Skill (Heal)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/heal/#Heal_Unchained)) has obsolesced the cleric, show-casing the power of secular healing.

  * Empiricist + [Student of Philosophy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/traits/social-traits/student-of-philosophy/) allows most conversations to focus on facts and evidence rather than Charisma.

  * Natural Philosopher helps fix the fact that otherwise I'd probably just die in the desert by giving me survival skills and better alchemical crafting abilities. Given it is such a low magic setting and we're mostly going to have to build rather than buy, this has been a godsend.

  In terms of the meat and potatoes of combat-focused gameplay, because you still have to survive: He's mostly battlefield control using Combat Reflexes w/ a longspear and cestus, which lets me fumble for extracts and still maintain reach. The cestus will go obsolete as higher rank extracts come online and I spend more time under Alter Self or Monstrous Physique I. Longarm offers good battlefield control, Expeditious Retreat is used mostly to run around and cut off retreat, when combined with reach and combat reflexes. 

  Plot shenanigans gave me a jumping spider familiar (Novelty!), who chomps an occasional [Adhesive Spittle](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/adhesive-spittle) infusion to great effect.

  There's lots of cheap alchemical toys that help fill in for situational benefits. Powder to find invisible creatures, silver weapon blanch to hit undead, smelling salts to get the brawler up, nepenthe to offer said brawler extra saves when they inevitably get mind controlled, smokesticks when too many things start sneak attacking or shooting arrows at squishier party members.

  At 5th level Signature Skill comes online, the brawler gets [Resilient Martyr](https://aonprd.com/TraitDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Resilient%20Martyr), and the cleric dips a level into [Vitalist](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/classes/vitalist/#Collective_Healing_Su) for collective healing, and Healing Hands becomes a couple hundred hp a day, spread over the party wherever we need it to go, and it just keeps scaling. The doctor is in.

  There's also something to be said for being the skillmonkey/face, as you get forced to choose the direction of the party for a lot of things.

  The campaign itself isn't particularly rational, but the doctor has been very fun to play. 

  Now I just need to figure out a way to stop all of the sorcerer-kings, fix that whole death thing, and restore Athas.

    Ha, I was expecting those to link to [Dungeons](http://dresdencodak.com/2006/12/03/dungeons-and-discourse/) & [Discourse](http://dresdencodak.com/2009/01/27/advanced-dungeons-and-discourse/)

    Slight pushback on this: priding oneself on 'secular healing' in a setting with obviously functional magical healing, making a Mother of Learning reference with your familiar and being Int-based instead of Cha- or Wis-based are all not particularly rational - that's just taking surface level features of rationality as it manifests itself in the real world and inserting it into the game world. Which isn't to say that the character isn't rational in other ways (the fact that they're using reach weapons to avoid getting into melee combat, practicing self-sufficiency and environment-appropriate skills, trying to foresee their future needs and acquiring supplies that will satisfy those needs and identifying the magic-induced environmental collapse of their current planet as a serious problem all point to a character for whom reason takes the wheel), or that you're playing the character wrong. It's just that those specific examples aren't really good examples of what a rational character in Dark Sun (or any other D&D setting) would actually do compared to the other things you could have been highlighting.

      Strongly agreed on all fronts about the mixture of superficial and actually rational elements in play.

      Re: my overly glib comment on secular healing: He observed that his ability with the Heal skill was just barely keeping up with the party's needs. It supplemented the cleric, but an hour out of combat to Treat Deadly Wounds? Where do you ever get that much time? At the time it was basically just a good investment of a couple of skill points on a character with all too many for yet another skill check that can't fail due to stacked bonuses. Spending a couple of levels talking to the thri-kreen cleric about the nature of religion, (which in athas focused around elements rather than gods) and after witnessing a rapid series of plot-driven events involving a huge outpouring of energy from the dark sun version of the elemental planes, I was able to justify that he had an idea. Healing Hands is a form of directly channeling positive energy, so it acted as a sort of entry point to trying to figure out how to directly manipulate mana. At the same time it offered a sort of in-game munchkining of diverse systems to keep everyone around me alive at the expense of the usual party structure. Now the others are getting into it: the brawler is getting very good at power-napping, because I heal in combat as if you got a full day's rest. The cleric has been able to focus on being a full-fledged combatant, and is losing a level of spell progression to maximize the ability to spread that healing around, because it'll have way too much overflow healing to make efficient use of the resource. Between it and working on how to manage overlapping field of reach with the rest of the party it pretty much tripled the CR of the encounters we were able to handle. I meant to focus on this aspect, but it was lost a little when I dropped into info-dump 'talk about your character' mode. Splitting off the bit about the actions the others are taking made it feel a bit disconnected.

      Mechanically, the familiar exists primarily because she helps with my AC (+2 from Bodyguard before boosts). The choice of spider was basically to maximize dex for the number of uses of Combat Reflexes for taking Bodyguard actions, which is the highest for a stock familiar, and she will act as a hitpoint well at 5th level via Shield Master, covering for my poor starting CON. This is the same level the cleric dips vitalist, so her hitpoints and mine become _mostly_ interchangeable. Both help compensate for potentially fatal weaknesses to the core character build.

      As for other things I can be highlighting the game hasn't had long enough for me to accumulate enough exploits. There's also the balancing act unlike when playing a CRPG between munchkining and optimizing for other players' fun at the table, which has left me with building abilities that primarily enhance the rest of the party's effectiveness, while trying to steer our overall course in a way that yields progress towards his goals.

      Right now, he is trying to figure out ways arcane magic can be used without defiling, which mostly focuses on trying to figure out what is true past a huge pile of cultural biases. Here is where his efforts have shined through the most: The familiar and a mending cantrip (shockingly useful in a land of bone weapons) are about the extent of his direct dabbling in the arcane, but his initial progress focused on extracts, infusions and alchemy were a more effective experiment. He is exploring what it means to infuse things directly with energy from the planes, which led to his style of healing, and provides a logical progression to the next step on the character's path.

  I've tried something like that a few times. It's a significant increase in effort from the already high level of effort that running a custom campaign already imposes, because unlike a story, you can't control where the players go, and at the table, you need to be able to ad lib things as they come up.

  The notion of GMing a rational TTRPG is absurd. The rationality of the campaign is not up to the GM in any meaningful sense. You can make a campaign setting with verisimilitude, and you can reward clever thinking, but if the players *want* to do the rational thing or don't know how to figure out what the rational thing to do would be, you're not going to be running a rational campaign.

    he's probably talking about the world that the GM creates behaving in a rational way. in that respect, the rationality of a campaign is solely up to the GM. for example, if a player finds an exploit that gives infinite salt, he can't use it to make infinite gold because either that would crash the price of salt, someone more powerful would come and try to take it away, or this discovery is already in use and the price of salt actually reflects the price of refinement/transportation/taxes or whatever other factor beyond just obtaining the salt itself.

    a rational campaign is, to the best of the GM's ability, a living world instead of just a bunch of rooms with mindless monsters that throw themselves at the players with no thought given to why they are there in the first place. the players don't really have to ask why the goblins are in that particular mine, but what makes it rational is that the GM knows why, and if he is a good GM there will probably be some natural reward for the players for finding the answer.

  This is sort of the default way that my group runs things. We will sometimes dip into more campy Exalted type stuff, but for the most part we try to carefully ensure that things that happen in game follow whatever appropriate in-universe rules (with most second order effects thought through, exploits either house-ruled away or NPCs also exploit them, etc). Honestly, even the Exalted stuff generally faithfully follows its own vaguely narrative-driven variant of physics/metaphysics. I think that rational pen and paper games are the natural result of just sitting and thinking through the world that you are creating or running.

  On the other hand, pushing things into Rationalist territory, we have found, tends to have mixed results. Rationalist villains can be fun, but need to be kneecapped somewhat or they will murder the party most of the time. If I use an actually capable Rationalist as a villain, they are almost always lower level than the party, physically/magically crippled in some lasting way, or sport other disadvantages that the players don't have. Also, since playing this sort of villain means you are actually trying to be convincing, I have to ensure that his purposes are sufficiently opposed to the players', otherwise they will just switch sides and join up (which is fun once in a while, but not for every game). You can also have two or more Rationalist villains in direct conflict to make sure the player ends up against at least one, but I personally find this tricky to do. I am not good enough to consistently and convincingly run two different Rationalist characters at the same time, especially in encounters where I have to run both in real time.

  On the player side of things, Rationalist PCs tend to be either terrible, or at their very best fun for only a little while. The best result my group has was a Rationalist wizard focused on divinations and item crafting. Having a dedicated support caster plus massive information superiority let the other players punch waaaaay above their expected weight class. The DM had to escalate wildly, but ultimately he wasn't able to find something appropriate to stand up to us before we crushed what was supposed to be the primary source of conflict in the campaign. It was neat, but ultimately probably less fun and satisfying than if the campaign had run longer. At the beginning it was fun to be one step ahead, and have the power to make the GM give us extra information, but by the end it just felt like powergaming, but as a support character so it didn't annoy any other players. I guess playing a Rationalist is just powergaming but with the appropriate in-universe explanation for doing so, so I would personally recommend against it.

  I'm running a pretty successful rationalist character in one of my games. 

  Our party is a group of college students who have been dropped into a high-magic homebrew fantasy world. We are running the game in GURPS, and our GM is running it mostly open sandbox with factions and actors with their own motivations doing their own things. When we did our session 0 and character creation, all the players agreed that we wanted to focus on solving mysteries and exploring themes of culture, technology, and power dynamics more than combat. I got sign off to make a character that would want to poke the world at its seams. (I think my exact request to the GM was something like "Can I make a character who will try to hack the world from the inside?") GM-player collaboration is especially important when playing a game that involves scientifically studying magic. We've had a lot of out-of-character conversations about how magic works beyond the game mechanics and how to close loopholes or explain why our characters would be the first to notice certain exploits.

  My character, Gwen Arroway, is an extraverted nerdy former girl scout who was pursuing a CS degree and following all the rationalist blogs and had the career goal of being a science communicator. After adjusting to being isekai'd into a fantasy world, she has made a printing press, has started teaching math classes, made amateur radios, has started work on getting support to upgrade the city's water system, and has nearly gotten the whole party killed by correctly inferring a secret the gods of the world want to keep hidden. Just last session she was leading the party and NPC allies through a goal and planning workshopping session. (We frequently joke that we aren't playing GURPS, we are playing "minutia simulator." But hey, now we have a solid goal that the whole party can agree to.) Her end goal is to make a transhumanist utopia, naturally.

  Another character in our party, Ivan, is inspired by the mad scientist archetype. He isn't really rational, but he is an excellent materials engineer. He has made chlorine gas bombs, a rifle, nylon armor, and bicycles. His motivation to uplift the world is purely so that he can have good lab equipment again to better investigate magic. Or he would like to fight and take the place of one of the gods so that he can skip needing to interact with other people. Whichever is easier.

  Our third PC is Iris, a pre-med student who wants to eliminate illness and cure the veiltouched (people who have been changed by the Dead God's magic).

  Last but not least, the PC who keeps us all in check: Libby, the "ethics committee." Libby is an anthropology student who has to periodically remind the other PCs to listen to the NPCs and to think about the implications before, say, soliciting blood for iron distillation in a world that is conspicuously devoid of iron ore and were "iron" is a strong swear. (I'm talking to you, Ivan)
