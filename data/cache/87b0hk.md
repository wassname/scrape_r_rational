  The premise of this story is really interesting and very well executed. I'm excited to see where you take part 2.

    Glad you think so! Though I'd be the first to admit that a few of the characters in this chapter aren't being all that... *rational*. Vash was always supposed to be the rationalist hero and Jan the traditional hero to contrast the two. Part 2 will hopefully start in the next couple of weeks.
