  Fargo has been recommended here recently, but it's so rare for a lengthy fic to be completed (my own included) that I thought I might make another post anyway.

  The story is well-written, albeit dark at times even by Madoka Magica standards. The summary is this:
  [Post-Rebellion] In the frostbitten American Midwest, ragged Magical Girls vie for territory to survive the unforgiving landscape. One such girl is Sloan Redfearn, who wastes away in Fargo, North Dakota, nursing a grudge and watching her hopes slowly die. But when Kyubey approaches with a unique opportunity, she becomes embroiled in a conspiracy that threatens to topple gods.

    Recommended course of action for readers who saw Madoka Magica years ago and haven't engaged with the world since?

      Its... mostly just understandable?
      Its well written, and you can really get it even if you aren't anywhere near as obsessive as I am. 

      If you go in paying attention you'll be fine; everything is explained. You'll miss out on some of the context with the Mitakihara characters, but they don't really appear until later.

      It's post-Rebellion, so you could watch that movie first if you haven't yet and you feel like it.

  Just wanted to chime in and say that this is one of the finest examples of writing on a technical level that I've seen... characters are vividly written and complex... Author is a professional writer who wrote Fargo in his/her free time.

  IMO, Arc 1 is great, Arc 2 is amazing, Arc 3 is great but a tad bit scattered.

    Which professional writer though? I doubt that they are (despite the assertion in their profile), but if it's true I'd quite like to read more of their work.

  I just finished it and I'd definitely recommend it. It's a really solid story and does a lot of excellent world building. I'd still say it's second to /r/ToTheStars though.

  American Meguca? Hell to the yes.

  What a wild ride, the ending is happysad but yet satisfactory, the ride was great, it's the madoka fic I enjoyed most along with to the stars.

  Sloan's narration was really something precious that the universe lost forever.
