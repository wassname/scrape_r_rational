## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  An oddball question - I'm a regular here, but using a throwaway for obvious reasons.

  I recently wrapped up my PhD and received an extremely prestigious award -- essentially "best PhD thesis awarded this year" from a very high ranking technical institute. Obviously, there is no such thing as "best PhD", but I'll take it.

  Obviously, this affords me unprecedented opportunities - simply having it on my resume will give me better job offers and salaries. However, I suspect that taking maximum advantage of this will require more creativity.  The obvious answers include putting extra effort into building up my contacts, as well as making sure that website+linkedin+resume work together to streamline people becoming aware of it, but I'm sure that I'm missing something. Thoughts?

    Use it as an excuse to meet and network with previous winners of the award. It's very useful to have more connections with people who are very skilled in their field (even if they won the award for something that's completely unrelated to your field).

  How should I talk to irrational people? In particular I have difficulty talking to someone who has power over me (eg. boss, parent), who seems to be convinced they understand me and treat me according to their models. When I try to point out their errors, they accuse me of using my arguments against others and not myself... [when that appears to be what they have done](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AdYdLP2sRqPMoe8fb/knowing-about-biases-can-hurt-people). My belief that they are the less rational party comes from prior experiences, with one particular case where I showed them that their model of me was wrong, but they continued using it.

  They do not like being questioned, contradicted, the usual stuff. But I still require their good will, and I wish them well; they are a good person in general.

  How can I communicate to them effectively so they do not feel antagonised by me when I suggest something they don't like? Any general tips for how to communicate well would also be appreciated.

    Consider reading Dale Carnegie's *How to Win Friends and Influence People.* It has a lot of tips about optimizing your conduct to appeal to others, many of which boil down to friendliness and empathy. 

    The key to persuading others is to understand how they communicate and what they value, and then demonstrate their values in their own language. This can be tough, but it yields lifelong benefits.

      Thank you very much, and I definitely read the book.

    Hmmm. Can you give a suitably anonymised example of a typical interaction?
    ```

    - u/causalchain:
      ```
      My memory is poor and and I should actually make notes about my interactions. I'll give you what I can.

      Situation a: Instruction.They would tell me to do something which I do not want to do or cannot do. I would either explain what is wrong or offer an alternative which I think solves their intention. Sometimes this is enough, but other times they would insist on it. Attempts to ask why are rejected. If I continue to try and argue it, they will get frustrated with me.

      Situation b: argument.Either when I continue to refuse an instruction that I cannot do, or if we get frustrated at each other for any other reason. Since they have power over me, I must avoid offending them, but they do not hold back so much. Their arguments are based on their model of me, which while mostly right, also has many divergences which create "wrong" arguments which I reflexively refute (habit I need to control). The arguments rarely achieve anything.

      This isn't comprehensive, if there is any questions you can think of then feel free to ask. I would also love general communication tips!

        You're talking about bosses and parents. These people do have the authority to instruct you to do things which you do not want to do (you can negotiate, which as you point out does work some of the time). Ultimately, however, unless you have a moral objection along the lines of "I'd prefer to get fired" or you're asked to do something outright illegal, you are expected to either do as your boss requires or, if it is impossible, to get as close to his request as possible - whether or not the boss explains why.

        > Their arguments are based on their model of me, which while mostly right, also has many divergences which create "wrong" arguments which I reflexively refute (habit I need to control).

        This will be particularly frustrating - someone tries to tell you to do A, happens to mention B, and you reflexively refute B which has nothing to do with A. You've probably noticed this already.

        Now, I don't really know how your arguments tend to progress, but one suggestion I can make in general - when arguing with anyone, for any reason, *do not interrupt*. Close your mouth and *wait* for them to speak their *entire* argument without interruption - and only once they have finished present a summary of your counter-arguments. (Exception - if there is something urgently time-sensitive, e.g. the room at the back is on fire, then interruptions are acceptable).

        Finally, see if you can join a local Toastmasters or Agora Speakers club - they're all about teaching people to communicate effectively and you'll learn a lot more from them in-person than from me over a text-only interface.

          Thank you for your response! I'll do my best to listen to let them talk and finish their argument. I'll see about joining a Toastmasters or Agora Speakers club, that sounds like it will be helpful.  


          On another note, I've noticed that my poor attempts at argument have created general counterarguments that they can use against me. Eg. "if you respond that means you haven't listened to what I said". This is probably my biggest mistake, as these communication blockers get in the way of us resolving any disputes we have.
          ```

            Hmmm. The first idea that occurs to me to resolve this is a simple modification of the strategy I suggested earlier - after waiting and hearing out their entire argument, summarise it back to them. I'd recommend using a phrasing along the lines of "So, to rephrase your argument, <summary>. Is this correct?" - then, if they say 'no' you can ask for clarification, while if they say 'yes' they can no longer legitimately claim that you were not listening and you can go ahead and present your counter-argument.

            I hope this works out for you.

    I was going to second the recommendation of [How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People), but I see that you've already read it. In that case, I would recommend reading it again :)

    That said, it bears remembering that, in general terms, humans do not default to being explicitly rational in the sense of epistemic or instrumental rationality. Instead, we are adaptation-executors, with adaptations pertaining to social status (external) and self concept (internal) being extremely prominent. Based on a combination of our own feelings and the reactions we perceive from others, we form a narrative. In that story, we play a role that we find plausible and appealing in some way -- rebel, leader, hero, victim, listener, communicator, student, teacher, etc.

    Stories need contrast or conflict to be interesting. So while you might in some cases appeal to a common enemy or upcoming calamity to establish the need for an alliance, this doesn't always work. Instead, people often look to distinguish themselves from whatever role you are playing so that they can play a separate role.

    Thus, while you are playing the role of the truth-seeking rationalist, assuming you do it well, it can produce pressure for others to respond with a visibly contrasting role -- pragmatist, perhaps, or faithful believer. This pressure basically continues until rationalism fades into the background and becomes a common cultural assumption instead of an individualistic trait. A possible solution to this would be to break the frame of the role they are playing by assuming an aspect of the role yourself, for example if they try to play the nutty flat earther as comic relief foil to a dour Spockian rationalist role you've fallen into, you might use logic based humor as a way to make the comic role redundant and thus less appealing.

    Another issue to consider is simply cognitive miserliness. We tend to go with what needs less energy to process. So models that seem simpler and easier to process, or things we are instinctively attuned to (such as stories instead of math) tend to take prominence without any effort. In this situation it may make sense to pick a time when the person has extra energy (like on a day off when they are well rested, instead of right after work when they are exhausted) or motive to spend energy (like when considering ways it might be crucial to survival or one's reputation) on considering the correct model.

      Thanks for your comment, this is a really interesting way to model things. Indeed, I have considered an issue of mine which rings in a similar way. I find that in interactions with people who have an expectation of me, I have this compulsion not to break their expectations (or as it really is, what I *think* their expectation is). The feeling is quite similar to not wanting to admit to lying.

      An example would be when someone is trying to convince me of something. Often I find that I  come to agree with them, but my physical response lags behind, acting like someone who is slowly being convinced. I'm not sure if this is similar or completely different from your model of roles, but if you have any insight then I would be very interested. 

      I (think I) get the gist of your model but I don't see it in real life. I definitely have experienced unwittingly playing the devils advocate and rudely awakening to realise that while I mostly agree with the person I'm talking to, they don't know that since we've only discussed things we disagree on. I don't yet see this role-fitting on the more general scale, so I would be intrigued if you have any examples and elaborations.

      For the case of my superior: Unfortunately, I don't think I play the rationalist role very well, and probably appear insolent more than anything; I suck at applying rationality to *actually doing things* so it looks like I'm just trying to use cheap talk to get out of work. For all I know, that is exactly what I'm doing and all my rationality is just a story I made for myself. I hope it isn't.

    Your belief is in error. Self-perception bias causes us to believe we are better than we actually are; in this case, you value the virtue of *rationality* and have developed narratives to support that belief. Whether it is true or not, that belief is inherently harmful in your relations with other people.

  Are there any good EU based charities that focus on life extension research? I’m currently donating to several different charities that focus on research into specific diseases (heart/brain/cancer), but I get the impression that those kind of charities are kinda overfunded and doing research into ageing seems like it would be a more generic solution anyway.

  The EU based restriction is because tax benefits make it nearly twice as effective for me to donate to EU based charities relative to non-EU based ones.
