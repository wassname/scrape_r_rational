  Heh. Immediately though of using a Foucault pendulum to determine latitude, a la Fleep, although not sure how practical that would actually be. The positions of celestial objects combined with measuring the length of a day would serve as a decent geolocation aid too.

      No formulas are necessaryâ€”if they're in the Northern Hemisphere, all they need to do is point the sucker at Polaris and read off the latitude. Just looking and estimating the angle would be useful too. In the Southern Hemisphere, they're gonna be a bit less accurate, since Sigma Octantis is one degree off. Of course, we don't know what year this is set in, so we might be looking at a slightly shifted night sky, but as long as we're within a few thousand years of the present, it works.

  Well, before Sister Krone appeared, I was thinking that one possible strategy would be to kill/knock out Mama. That'll be a lot more difficult with two adults to deal with, but it still should be possible.
