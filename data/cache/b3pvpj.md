  An interesting thought experiment.

  I'm surprised that (beyond the "nonconsensual sex" discussion, and the fate of most of humanity in the Normal Ending), that more time wasn't given to the subject of choice.

  That's what I found truly horrific about the baby-eaters: not that they ate their young, but that the young were old enough to comprehend that, and to choose not to die.  Compare, say, the waiter from *The Restaurant at the End of the Universe*, which is a sentient being who *chooses* to be eaten.  Or any non-fictional animal raised to be part of the human diet, which can't really comprehend how and why its life is scheduled to end.

  Had the offer to humanity been subject to individual choice, if people could have chosen to join with the Super-happies, rather than having been forced into it willy-nilly, the Normal Ending wouldn't have been nearly so bad.

  Maybe that's why the rape conversation is in there?  Deliberately, as an indication that humanity doesn't value an individual's choice so much any more?  If that's the case, I see why humanity wouldn't present it as a counteroffer, but not why it's not a more common topic in the comments.

    I think rape was chosen just because it's something we ( the readers ) could never understand being ok.

    - u/Slinkinator:
      ```
      I think rape was chosen because yudkowsky is both engaged in non-standard plural relationships and he lives in the Bay Area, an area wherein my experience there is a very vibrant culture of sexual exploration; considering the amount of theory he pumps into his fictional writing I assumed he was explicitly aware of conversations about rape outside of the context in which it is generally understood.

        It's frustrating that it's included honestly because it becomes the main thing people remember and discuss afterward, when the rest of the thought experiment is so much more interesting.

  Wait - isn't this the great story that (halfway through) decided to destroy any ability for me to recommend it to friends by having an ill-advised reference to the legality of rape?

  "What? I can't believe there was ever a world where rape was illegal."

  And yeah, I get that it has a thematic purpose - and you can construct a hypothetical chain of reasoning that makes it a rational idea assuming the right technological environment. But it was so entirely out of place that it ruined the story for me. And more importantly, the concept's inclusion made the story impossible to recommend.

  - u/zombieking26:
    ```
    I cant even understand it from a rational perspective. Rape clearly causes immense psychological distress, even in an environment with no physical consequences. How could it ever be moral?

      > So the question is “what was the story purpose and/or creative history behind the legalization and apparent general acceptance of non-consensual sex in human society from Three Worlds Collide”, where Three Worlds Collide is a story that I wrote.

      > So, the notion that non-consensual sex is not illegal and appears to be socially accepted might seem a bit out of place in the story, as if it had been grafted on. This is correct. It was grafted on from a different story in which, for example, theft is not so much legal—because they don't have what you call a strong centralized government—but rather, say, theft is in general something that you'd pull off by being clever, rather than a horrible crime, but of course you would
      never steal a book.

      > And in this society everything—you know, I have yet to publish a really good story set in this world; they all seemed, most of them I haven't finished, the one that I have finished I think still has other story problems—but if you were to see the story set in this world, you would see that it develops out of a much more organic thing in which, say, dueling, theft, non-consensual sex, all of these things are governed by tradition rather by than by law and they certainly aren't prohibited outright.

      > So why did I pick up that one aspect from that story and put it into Three Worlds Collide? Well, partially it was because I wanted at that point to introduce a culture clash between their future and our past, and that's what came to mind, more or less. It was both of something to test out to see what sort of reaction it got, to see if I could get away with putting it into this other story, and because it's a sort of exemplar. When one can't use theft, their society, the Three Worlds Collide society, actually does run on private property; when can't use dueling, their medical technology isn't advanced enough to make that trivial; **but you can use non-consensual sex and try to explain sort of what happens in a society where people are less afraid and not afraid of the same things. They're stronger than we are, in some senses, they don't need as much protection, the consequences are not the same consequences that we know, and the people there generally have a higher grade of ethics and are less likely to abuse things.**

      > That's what made that sort of particular culture clash feature a convenient thing to pick up from once story and graft on to the other, but ultimately it was a graft, and any feelings of ‘why is that there?’ that you have might make a bit more sense if you saw the other story, if I can ever repair the flaws in it or managed to successfully set and complete and publish a story set in that world that actually puts the world on display.

        >non-consensual sex [isn't] prohibited outright.

        What the fuck. I had always assumed the whole point of the decision was to show the future society was equally alien to us, three alien worlds colliding instead of our world and two others (after writing this I realize other people have already said the same better). 

        Is EY actually saying rape being equivalent to other types of mild violence is "more ethical", or am I really misinterpreting this?
        ```

        - u/Veedrac:
          ```
          You're reading it differently to me. The claim “people there generally have a higher grade of ethics and are less likely to abuse things” implies to me that the society doesn't generally have an issue with sexual assault. That is, when the population is near-universally trustworthy (‘have a higher grade of ethics’), and the consequences of getting things wrong are minor, the protocols for opting in to sex might change with it.

          An extreme example might be hugs; it is still not OK to hug someone if they say no, and the law will still protect you if this is violated, but there is no law specifically against nonconsentual hugging, no rule that makes it explicitly opt in in the way we rightly think we need sexual activities to be today. A sufficiently advanced (and alien) society could, with both unusual levels of trust and unusual levels of mental security, in theory, reduce the worries of society about sex in a similar way. It would not be that they consider it right or reasonable to force someone else to engage in sex, but that the topic becomes sufficiently low risk that our social and legal protocols seem unnecessary and inhibiting in the same way a nonconsensual hug law might seem to us.

          That's my reading, anyway.

          (FWIW my mind is pinging déjà vu on the hug analogy, so I might have stolen it.)
          ```

        - u/wren42:
          ```
          the implication I think is that it's not illegal, but people \*wouldn't do awful things\* just because it's legal, they have higher moral standards \*culturally\*.

          So imagine a society where consent is understood really well by everyone, and no one would intentionally harm other people.

          In such a society, you could have temporary suspensions of self-sovereignty, much like in the BDSM community today.

          That is, to people who understand power dynamics and consent really well, you can play at the boundaries of consent/control more readily, in ways some people find attractive.

          When the character in the story talks about it, he references flirting with and leading on a woman, knowing that there is a risk she could bid for your sexual consent on a market and then force herself on you.   This is a very nuanced scenario that implies a lot of things that are different in their society, it's not just "rape is legal."

        - u/Bowbreaker:
          ```
          Imagine that assault, battery and threatening someone's life are all still highly illegal. Imagine on top of that that there is no special social taboo of any form attached to sex. Imagine that unwanted children and STDs aren't a thing. Imagine that psychology and psychiatry are highly advanced to the point where practitioners actually know exactly what they are doing and how to cure something without trial and error. Imagine that education is highly advanced as well, uses aforementioned advancements in psychology, and creates graduates that aren't only actually prepared for the adult job market and economy, but also for all the other perils that adult life in that age routinely throws at them.

          Given all that I can imagine a world where consent is less important. And given a society that is both much more ethical (as in people actually follow and trust the local moral code), but also much more sheltered (in the story it seems that most characters never even saw accurate video depictions of the horrors of previous ages) I can imagine that the generation of that age equates the word "rape" with sex that lacks consent, devoid of all the horrific mental images that you or I would connect to it.

          Of course I never was raped, never had a real life conversation about rape with someone who lived through it and don't even have people in my circle of friends and family of which I know that they were raped. So maybe I am wrong.

      ```
      While that might not be what the author intended, I thought it worked quite well when one simply assumes that it's not moral (in our sense). The effect is that it's not our morals vs two other alien morals, but actually three alien moral systems. It drives home the point that there are no objective moral values, which is why we need to protect our set of values lest they be superseded by another one, which might for example allow rape.
      ```

    - u/AHaskins:
      ```
      Eh, it would be a HUGE stretch, but if we assume something like morality-divorced memory modification and an absolutely perfect medical system, it could be argued. That being said, assault would then be legal as well.

      I guess it's "possible." But it's shoe-horned in, not addressed, and then treated as acceptable.

      I *will* say that it makes sense thematically from a story perspective. The entire story is about dealing with comically different cultures. It makes sense to have a note that encourages the reader to turn their perspective inward. But still - blegh.

    @AHaskins, yeah it's that story. Frankly I think EY would have been more advised to extrapolate from moral values that human beings have currently to predict where they might lead, rather than just going for the shock value of RAPE. He is a smart and creative guy, he could have picked consensual incest or something. But I suspect he ended up going the route he did because he was only trying to appeal to a narrow range of readers who would already be likely to agree with him on such a thing, and it was THEM he was trying to shock, not a broader and less ethically wise audience. And I also suspect that things like this are what contributes a lot to why rationalists aren't as well respected as they could be and why there are so few rationalists. Besides TWC, the main alternative route for getting someone interested in rationality is HPMOR, which is freaking long and not at all friendly to non-technical audiences. In other words, HPMOR is written as if it assumes that its audience already has some measure of rationality skills from the moment they start reading it--the very same sort of skills that it is meant to help teach!

    And don't get me started on rationalists' deep-seated irrational fear of being seen as cultish if they try to effectively teach their REAL, GENUINELY USEFUL SKILLS to the larger public. You know what makes people look cultish? Isolating themselves from the rest of society in a community of hermit gurus. The fact that in this case the gurus' wisdom is actually CORRECT doesn't matter because they're hoarding their wisdom to themselves, hiding it behind mountains of opaque, jargon-filled text where no outsider will be able to reach it and understand it. And if outsiders do not know what one's wisdom entails, then it could be harmful gibberish for all they know. How are they to know, when the one is hiding their wisdom?

    And even if I say this, I doubt most rationalists will actually listen to me and understand. If I say "Presentation is important dammit! How other human beings perceive you matters dammit!" they will likely hear "we should focus on improving our self image at the expense of perfect blunt honesty and accuracy of what we say." NO. NO NO NO. That is not what I'm saying. But unfortunately, inferential distances don't just apply to mere epistemology but to skills in general, and there is a big inferential distance to cross to get rationalists to not only communicate effectively with outsiders, but to actually know why it is important to do so and to care about how outsiders think and feel about them and their work.

    It's infuriatingly frustrating as all hell, and the legalization of rape thing in TWC is just a symptom of this whole mess.

      I don't know where your claim comes from. The internet isn't giving me any sources to suggest this is true, and this seems so incredibly against EY's mode of thinking that I would be very surprised if there was any truth to this beyond intentional sneerclub misinterpretations.

      I'd never heard this before, but I tend to think back on when Draco said he was going to rape Luna Lovegood at the beginning of HPMOR whenever TWC comes up.

      I don't worship the ground the man walks on the way I feel some do, but man is that still discouraging.

      Edit: I did some quick googling and couldn't find anything to verify your claims at all. Do you mind posting a source that Yudowsky was accused of anything?

          I think I agree with you. I think the rape reoccurance is most likely a weakness with regards to writing, versus any sort of morality Yud may or may not possess (especially as I don't view interests in BDSM/polyamory as moral failings.)

          I made an instant, gut reaction when I saw the accusation of accusations. I did my googling to try and have a more reasoned response, though. Thank you for the response and new information.

              BDSM is fine, for several years I had an open relationship with a gal who worked in a dungeon.

              But if I started a book group and people complained that me and my buddies shouldn't have women on leashes while we debate, well, I'd decide that wasn't the proper venue.

              Edit: or i'd change the name to 'pretentious Dom/silent sub book club.'

              At the very least the bay area 'rationalists' prioritized their kink practice over an environment that facilitated free and comfortable discourse.  What is actually described is much less pleasent.

                Maybe try painting with a less broad brush next time? I know a lot of people involved with rationalist groups and events in SF, and none of them have ever seen the behavior described in that twitter/reddit blowup last year.

                It sounds like there's a single group/meetup/whatever populated by the people in question, and some random woman was unlucky enough to end up attending it.

                  I should reign in my discourse, this subject gas been curdling in my stomach all day, and I typed that up while taking a break from building ductwork, I apologise for not qualifying my statements.

                  I may have been assuming? That this was the Meetup eliezer attends, because the BDSM stuff meshes with what we know of him.  In that case it wouldn't be a single meet up, it would be the Meetup attended by the father of the LessWrong community, which is significant.

                  Beyond that she was not some random woman, and neither are the other people who've attached their identities to these claims, they are individuals with a documented long history of interaction with the ratio alist, LW, and EA communities, who have experiences spanning years with these individuals and communities.

                  For my part, I find your usage of 'some random woman' to be infuriating and offensive, but it's not clear to me whether that is pushback against you or actually indicative of a problem.

But I want to say that none of the things you say somehow make it impossible for EY or any other high status member of the Bay Area rational community to get away with sexual abuse without even tarnishing their reputation. All it would require is a careful selection of victims. And if Ozy is nowhere near said victims, their own history doesn't guarantee that they would always take the side of any accuser.

Barring firsthand accounts, at this time, I'm still chaulking things up as 'nothing to be acted upon with regards to public shaming'.

  I'm surprised the "destroy the sun" ending is considered the True or Good ending. The story sets up that humanity broadly believes in utilitarian principles (the rationality community's "shut up an multiply" is said by a few characters) and considers the plight of the babyeaters to be of moral concern, with babyeater children compared to human children in moral value. So the calculus looks like:

  * 10 billion humans die + humans continue to have the capacity to suffer + babyeater children continue to suffer, BUT humanity remains human and able to determine their own destiny or evolution
  * VS:
  * Every babyeater, human and superhappy is modified into a morally superior (from both human and superhappy perspective) form, and suffering is eliminated

  It's not clear to me that the superhappy manner of existence is any worse than ours. They still clearly have science - they have spaceships after all. In fact their commitment to truth is stronger than the future humans of the story: humanity had to lie to themselves about a physical constant of the universe to avoid people maliciously causing supernovas - both superhappies and babyeaters have biology or cultures that eliminated that possibility. As a rationalist concerned with the truth of the universe, I would think any modifications to humanity that increased our capacity to seek truth would be a *good* thing.

  Plus, in the True Ending, the Confessor/Kiritsugu mentions that he had fetal alcohol syndrome and was a murderer before being saved and "fixed." It's possible that all the improvements to him were made with his consent, but the way he talks about it I have my doubts. So future humanity is clearly okay with modifying an individual, possibly against their will, in order to improve life for the individual. If that's the case, they should have no objections when they are the defective individuals with the equivalent of Fetal Alcohol Sydrom that are being rescued.
