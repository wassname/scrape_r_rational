## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You are in a Lovecraftian universe and in a human society from the early 1900s. The Necronomicon has drifted into your possession and you desire to learn everything from it without going insane.

  The Necronomicon has the special property that the very act of reading it causes malevolent entities to become aware of you and attempt to kill you or drive you insane via supernatural means. The entities will them attempt to erase every trace of the individual's existence from memory, although they are sloppy and will unintentionally let some details remain. Afterwards the entities will quickly ignore the existence of the Necronomicon until another individual reads from it. If no one reads it and simply holds on it, then the book can remain in one's possession for as long as desired.

  You have no protection against the supernatural (that's why you want to learn from the Necronomicon), but you believe that the Necronomicon's lethal trait is tied to the book itself and not to the knowledge or words in the book. But you are not certain of this yet and would like to have a way to test this part. How can you make copies of it during the early 1900s?

  * Entities will kill any readers within a few days to minutes depending on how hard it is to arrange a seemingly natural death.

  * Entities will slowly wipe the memory of the person in question from everyone's mind and any physical evidence of the individual's existence will disappear over time. But anything which is not obviously 'connected' to the person in question will go unnoticed. This is how fragments of writings of the Necronomicon has managed to pass on along with hints of what happened to the previous owners. 'Ownership' will be left vague since you don't know yet how the entities define such things, only that they miss things which would seem obvious to a human.

  * After the reader's death/disappearance, if arrangements to move the Necronomicon has not been made or it hasn't been sent away yet, then it will be considered as if it was a book discarded by some stranger and probably sold to someone in a yard sale or given to a library/bookstore.

  * Note that casual attempts to read it will be prevented, since people will receive an ominous feeling of unease from the book and stop themselves from reading it. They'll make up some reason to not read it. It requires an determined individual to force themself to read it. However, if one becomes aware of what the book is, it then gives off an feeling of curiosity calling to be read. The feelings are not very strong and can be resisted, but if you are not careful, you can find yourself reading it before you catch yourself.

  * Reading the cover and back of the book does not count which is why people have easily managed to pass on the title and appearance of the book without issue.

    I'd use a piece of frosted glass to trace where words occur on each page, and copy those patterns to pieces of cardstock. I would make many copies of the word-pattern for each page. Then, I'd use some reliable way of generating random numbers to punch some small number (say, 10) spaces out of each page, so that I could read ten separated words from each page, somewhat like a [Grille cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grille_\(cryptography\)). I'd shuffle my deck of grilles and proceed in random order, transcribing the words into another notebook. 

    Hopefully reading random pages, 10 random words at a time, doesn't count as 'reading' for the purposes of the malevolent entites. To check this I would have someone else read through some grille, and then observe them for a period of time afterward. Due to the information decay effect, I'd have to set up some sort of dead-man's switch, like making a chalk mark every day the person was still alive.

      Ooo...this is the sort of imaginative solution I was hoping to see!

      Unfortunately, the entities consider reading even a single word from the book sufficient to murder the person. However, just tracing the words through the frosted glass is enough to prevent the killing effect since you can't read the words perfectly through the glass.

    Copying machines don't exist, but don't cameras?

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      If you believe that's a viable option with [these](http://licm.org.uk/livingImage/1900Room.html) cameras (not saying one way or another), then how would you take the pictures before the entities kill the photographer, without the entities destroying the pictures, *and* testing to see if the Necronomicon's killing power is linked to the pictures?
      ```

      - u/LiteralHeadCannon:
        ```
        Get a stationary rig set up for taking pictures of books without looking at them, test it on several other books, and then once it's in good working condition, use it on the Necronomicon without looking at it.

        Then get a stooge I don't care about to look at the pictures.

  You have exclusive access to a new computing technology.  In every way except for its unique properties, it's only about as good as traditional computers circa 1980, but you expect that with further research it could follow a progression similar to Moore's Law.

  The thing that makes this computing technology unique is that you may select a physical region of the computer's electronics and freeze time for it, so that it will make a series of calculations instantaneously that would otherwise have taken any finite amount of time.  The computing will still likely require power, but you can account for this by including certain types of battery in the instant-calculation zone.  Trying to include generic matter, like living things, in the instant-calculation zone will flash-freeze it, most likely destroying it.

  What neat tricks can you accomplish with this technology?
  ```

    Computation suddenly is just power limited unless I'm missing something.

    Why not time freeze the entire chip?
    ```

  - u/buckykat:
    ```
    What happens to the waste heat from the chips? All dumped at once the instant it unfreezes?
    ```

      "Trying to include generic matter, like living things, in the instant-calculation zone will flash-freeze it, most likely destroying it."

      I'm not sure if this was intended, but it sounds to me like the time stop is actually dropping the temperature of the region.  This might be destroying the waste heat, although it might be conserved and dumped in a shell surrounding the frozen region.  

      Either way, this ability could be used as either a weapon or a power source, as it violates thermodynamics. 

      If you could nest time-stopped regions you could provide infinite power and infinite time to your computer, allowing you to compute anything instantly.  

      In the second case however you would be limited by the waste heat being dumped into the environment (where you are) and possibly super-heating it to arbitrary temperatures.

    Did you just *actually* say that all computations are constant-time, even the ones that normally take super-exponential time?  I begin [solving the Halting Probability Problem](https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/handle/2292/23906), and [can near-trivially build powerful reflective AI](https://intelligence.org/files/LogicalInduction.pdf).

  Maybe a bit late, but a superpower that, when consciously activated, allows your cognition and awareness to accelerate to superhuman levels - if you went into a professional boxing match, then activated this ability as you closed with your opponent, their thrown punch would seem to travel in slow motion, allowing you to react perfectly rather than be surprised by it (and get knocked out). 

  Your body, however, moves at regular human-possible speeds, despite your super-cognition speeds. Something like [the flow state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology) but *super*flow.

  How would you leverage this to be a successful and effective superhero in our world, or perhaps also in the Wormverse?
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    The [Superhot](http://superhotgame.com/) power is basically that, but also limited by the fact that cognition speed decreases as you move.

    It sort of depends on whether you expend "mental energy" when you're in that state. For example, I can write code for maybe 4-6 hours at the most before my brain starts to get sluggish and I fall out of the (non-parahuman) flow state. If I could activate this superflow state, would I be able to continue computer programming at a rate determined by processing power, screen refresh rates, and physically being able to move my fingers fast enough over the keyboard? Or would I use up my brain chemicals and basically be burnt for the day?

    If I can do productive information work while in that state mostly without limit, then I become a super computer programmer. In the Wormverse, I become a Thinker who mostly serves as an analyst, not capable of making the *best* analysis, but capable of making the *fastest* analysis, which is good in crisis situations. Alternately, I can serve as dispatch or information, given that I can look up answers as fast as my browser can load a page from Google (and obviously I pay for ridiculously fast internet). Plus, that allows me to stay out of the way of all the things that want to kill me.

    If I *can't* do that kind of thinking for much longer than a normal person before getting mentally fried, maybe I still do those things but as secondary function, because I'll mostly be in the field. I'd make a good scout, because I can fully analyze any scene after seeing it for only a fraction of a second ... but other parahumans completely outclass me.

    For weapons, it's sort of an awkward thing, because the power is amazing at close range but only *good* with guns. Being able to hit precisely with a knife is much more feasible given combat speeds relative to muscle action. But with guns, the question is much more about how good your aim is and how well you account for variables. I've gone to the gun range and failed to hit targets with all the time in the world, and with sandbags to not require steady hands. Yes, it's harder to hit a moving target, so there's some benefit there, but I think you'd be sitting there in frozen time trying to track how fast your target was moving, how fast the bullets move, space between them ... and it would all be very hard, giving not all that much benefit. Whereas with knives, you can much better take advantage of openings and weaknesses. Except that knives have a lot less practical applicability than guns, as a general rule.
    ```

    - u/Kilbourne:
      ```
      Let's suppose the power is much like Taylor's; it doesn't tire her to 'think' about hundreds of thousands of insects doing differs things all at once, because her power gives her shortcuts for it. Same for our superflow guy, he can perceive and cognate for long periods of time - as long as he's under pressure or in an escalation situation, as the powers of Worm have that secondary 'requirement'. No additional speedboost, though, so your fingers still have an upper limit to their movement speed depending on signals from the brain.
      ```
