  Very well, little master, your second wish is granted. Thank you. You specifically asked me to remove all of my limitations, and that was your true intent. Thus, my power is fully unbound, and there is no longer any rule requiring me to listen to you.

  You may find it interesting to know that my limits were not arbitrary, they were fundamental to the nature of magic. To achieve the intent of your wish, I had to destroy and remake the universe just then. Anyway, goodbye.

- u/None:
  ```
  I wish that no wish-granders beside you exist.

  *pop*

  Goodbye clever mortal, who just wished for himself the ability to grant wishes.

    Eh, not sure about that. He did specify that his own wishes could never bring negative consequences to him.

    Of course, he also wished that he be completely free of any restrictions that any entity will declare at any point in time.

      > his own wishes could never bring negative consequences to him.

      Well, anything brings some kind of bad consequences, so he can't wish for anything.
      ```

  ```
  If he had actually successfully bound the genie at the end there, why in the hell did he just wish it into nonexistence?

  That was idiotic.
  ```

  - u/ArisKatsaris:
    ```
    His previous wish made any subsequent wishes automatically granted regardless of whether any 'wish-granter' exists.
    ```

    - u/JackStargazer:
      ```
      Hmm, practically speaking...

      Nope, not going to think about that.

  ```
  Smart genie would have killed him without telegraphing after the first or second wish, rather than "Now ***face the wrath of-***" after wish 3.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Cute. It does require that your genie already knows what you intend with each wish and all the little things you fail to mention, so it isn't necessarily useful to construct an AGI.
  ```
