  Isn't there something in the rules that prohibits posting life consuming memetic hazards?       

  Oh god _you made the TV Tropes page yourself_, it's infected you and it's using you to propagate itself.. Quick, must wipe memory before I start editing TV Tropes and become another infection vector..

    It's not life-consuming if I only do it when I'm bored.
    ```

      That's exactly what it wants you to think; anyway it doesn't matter because it's in it's own interest to have the occasional typhoid mary that can still spread the infection without having their life fall apart due to TV Tropes.

  Through the most powerful force ever to be witnessed on the internet (boredom), I created a TvTropes page for The Reckoning. The tropes example list is bare-bone for now, since I don't have the time to fill it yet.

  Feel free to expand it. I recommend these two articles:

  http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/HowToWriteAnExample

  http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/HowToCollectTropes

  TODO:

  - Add more tropes.

  - For each of these tropes, find the trope page, and add The Reckoning to its example list.

  - Replace every reference to The Reckoning in TvTropes with a link to this page.

  - Find indexes to add it to.

  - Profit!

    It's become a joke among my housemates that I'm Animorphs: The Reckoning's second-biggest fan, so my first thought upon seeing this post was something like "nooo! the gap widens!" :)
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      Wait, so I'm some sort of by-proxy celebrity among your housemates? This is weird and I need a life.

        D...don't leave me, senpai...

        ```
        Pretty much, but don't worry: you're in good company when it comes to needing a life :)

  Nooooo^oooo ^^my ^^^free ^^^^tiiiiime...

  Great choice of intro quote, by the way :) When I've recommended the story to others I've actually used that exact one a couple times!
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Yeah, I wanted to add the part where he said they all had the self destruct command for the device because all but one of them might die, but it made the quote too long.
    ```

  ```
  Well shit, even if you made it yourself, the presence of a tvtropes page is what pushed me over edge to read this (when I have the time).
  ```
