## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  Since  Internet has  been obsesed whith it lately lets munchkin the super crown.

  To have clear rules lets say that :

  Any living being wearing it turns into a human  girl , looking similar to princes peach plus a few  mostly  aesthetic features of the original being .
  If human they retain their memory and personality , other animals have different  results depending on how smart and similar to humans they are .

  Loosing the crown makes the user  go back to normal .
  The transformation only happens if there is enough space whith air or some fluid  of similar density for it to happen ,otherwise it does nothing .

    Hmm? What about the other direction?

    &#x200B;

    Bowser is bigger than Peach, so if it puts on the crown and shrinks to Peach's size, enters a confined space, and takes off the crown, does he stay as Peach since there isn't enough space to transform back into his original size?

    &#x200B;

    If so, you can use a single crown to transform as many large creatures into Peaches as you want, as long as you have confined spaces to put them in. Like say a suit of armor.

    &#x200B;

    The next question is: What happens to parts of the body that are disconnected? Say I chop off one of Bowsette's fingers. Does it revert back to Bowser finger? (Also how would that work since Bowser has 8 fingers while Peach has 10?) Does it stay a Peach finger even after Bowsette takes off the crown? Can you force it to stay in Peach form by keeping it in a small container where there is no space to revert?

    &#x200B;

    If so, it's time to begin mass organ harvesting. Transform animals like horses and cows into Peaches, and harvest their now human organs to save countless human lives with organ transplants. Do the same for blood transfusions.  (If I remember correctly, Princess Peach has blood type O, so this is excellent for blood transfusions.)

      I love this sub
      ```

      - u/crivtox:
        ```
        I was totaly expecting something like that when I proposed it .
        It's the obvious thing to do whith healing items .
        I probably  have spent too much time on the sub.
        ```

        Now we need to make bowsette memes about organ harvesting.

           You have spoken porn of this into existence now.

          I hope you are proud of yourself.

            That seems munchkineable:b

            Can I speak  porn of the prime factors of a number into existence ?

            Is it instantaneous , meaning I can use it for ftl communication ?
            ```

      By transformation I meant transformation in both directions, but you know what happens whith transparency illusion.
      For the reverting thing I say that it takes a volume shaped arround  more or less continuous amounts of matter that it detects as a working living being at least bigger than the crown (not sure if I should say it has to be an animal since the idea of turning pando into a peach  its really funny for one reason )stores it on a pocket dimesion , and creates a peach body on the same place  (plus a few complicated effects whith rewiting brains to alow continuity of consciousness)
      And reverting its the same just reemplacing your peach  whith your old body.

      Cutting parts of the peach body doesn't make them revert , killing the peach leaves you whith a peach body that might still revert if you remove the crown soon but will stop being considered one after its dead for a while .

      I could say that its always the same peach body for an specific living being , but lets say its  a brand new one (which even explains why Mario power ups alow you to take more hits ) .

    *(all depend on how common the Super Crown as an item is in the setting, as well as some other aspects)*

    * means to gaining a healthy body, escaping from terminal illnesses and pain
     * escape from temporary negative body conditions (e.g. flu, seasonal allergies, post-op recovery, etc)
     * possible treatment for phantom limb syndrom and mental disorders
    * rich source of research data (e.g. in neurology, psychology)
    * tool for gaining pseudo-anonymity (e.g. to evade the law enforcement system, to participate in protests while evading possible retaliation from the government, to evade mass surveillance systems, etc)
    * option to go through pregnancy, for people who can’t bear children
     * alternatively, a form of birth control ([nsfw — if it does work for that\)](https://img.rule34.xxx//samples/2629/sample_dacbbfc2eb58f2eb7f81c6b5adfb4c321e21537f.jpg?2922179)
    * reversible type of gender reassignment 
     * in some aspects, a more perfect type of gender reassignment 
     * option to circumvent mismatching sexual preferences between otherwise interested romantic \ sexual partners 
       * prostitution
    * roleplaying games
     * masquerades — a tool for organising and participating in them
     * tool for establishing a better contact with some abuse victims (e.g. interaction between a male police officer and [someone who has a fear of males\)](http://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2014-45648-003.html)
    * option for court ordered anti-misogyny cources
     * form of punishment 
    * easier transportation of prisoners, without them being aware where they are being taken (if the host doesn’t have access to their Peach-state memories)
     * easier containment of prisoners
    * animal uplifting, pet uplifting, cheap workforce, loophole used for non-illegal slavery (depending on how much much of an intelligence boost an animal wearing it gets)
    * cheaper types of transport infrastructure (e.g. the seats have to only be designed to accommodate a very narrow window of body shapes and weights)
    * form of immortality for Princess Peach (each Super Crown is a seedling of her consciousness) 
    * workforce that can perform traumatising tasks without any lasting negative effects (if the memories of a pseudo-Peach get reset once she removes the crown)
     * workforce that can easily be motivated to work cheaply or for free
    * access to the real Princess Peach’s memories (depending on the mechanics)
     * legal loophole to usurp power in Princess Peach’s kingdom by creating a legitimate offspring of hers (depending on the mechanics, laws of her kingdom)
    * the usual shenanigans arising from an available No Conservation of Energy mechanics (e.g. using it as an energy generator)
    * [defeat bosses by polymorphing them](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph) shenanigans.

      I would say that you don't get the memories of peach(Bowsette seems to still be Bowser and not peach), but apart from that good ideas.
      ```

  - u/Allian42:
    ```
    One thing to always watch out for in transformations is the condition of the user both during and after. Say a person is injured and uses the crown, is the new form injured or not? If the person is sick, puts the crown and then takes it off, does the sickness returns?

    Depending on the answers, it may work as a limitless healing item.
