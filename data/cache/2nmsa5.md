## Rational!Big Hero 6

### Post:

I am not a rationalist. This seems like a fairly large problem in the way of me posting in a rationalist thread. As a matter of fact, I am also completely new to reddit, and only ever come here to occasionally peek at /r/rational for fic updates. That, and due to a number of factors, I have a patchy idea of how to write english perfectly anyway.

Despite all of this, I feel intelligent today, and had a few ideas on Big Hero Six. If you've seen it, and are a rationalist, you've probably already spotted the most attention-grabbing plothole. Sadly, I have yet to understand how to use spoiler text in my first post, as formatting help doesn't seem to help me there, so there's not so much I can talk about without spoilers.

All that background in place, I'd appreciate help. I am not a rationalist because I do not believe myself capable of performing such a delicate science, as it's difficulty is beyond me. I do appreciate and respect it, though. I'd like to do a rationalist! version of the movie, as a fanfic, but I can't quite get it. Tilt it this way, it's completely anti-climatic. Tilt it the other, and the villain's (It's a super hero movie, of course it has one) plot becomes unstoppable. If someone can teach me how to use spoiler text or PM me, if Reddit does that, I'd like to discuss some ideas about it with a rationalist of some degree or just someone else who respects rationalism and who has also seen the movie without threat of spoilers.

I attempted to figure out the spoiler tag hiding-thing, and failed. Thus, figuring out how to do that would be helpful. Please comment if you know how to do so.

Testing spoiler tags:
[SPOILER](#s "This is a spoiler.")

Whew, that seems... A little clunky, but hopefully it will work. Okay, so. The main hero is a kid genius. That much is known from the commercials.  [SPOILER](#s "The main villain is also a genius- A genius of a calibre much higher then Hiro, and one Hiro greatly respected.") So, with this in mind, a rationalist! version doesn't seem too bad. But, I run into two problems.

If Hiro is empowered with more direct, rational thought,[SPOILER](#s "He would find a way to disable his stolen technology, because of course he would put in a safety measure, recreate it with red microbots to be visually distinct, and execute a plan as thus: Scramble control signal to original bots, grab the control mask with the new bots operating on a different signal band, so to speak, autowin. Really, why not recreate this awesome, extremely powerful technology? The other guy just steals it and uses it. Hiro invents it in, what, a few weeks? Once he too fully realises it's constructing potential, I don't see why he can't recreate his own army of the powerful tech in a few hours. After all, he well demonstrates that once he has enough of the bots, they can create anything, like the metallic structure he fabricates in seconds in his demonstration, at speed. This would, naturally, also include more bots. ") This is anti-climatic. On the other hand...

[SPOILER](#s "If the genius villain is empowered with more rational thought, even through his grief, he would, A, disable the default safeties ahead of time, as he knows it's stolen technology and it's original creator still lives, and B, would use the microbots feature to construct things at hyperspeed- As demonstrated to the villain not thirty minutes before he steals them- And thus Hiro has no time to discover the theft, and the Villain's stolen superweapon is built, charged, and fired, so to speak, long before the heros can even get out of bed, once again so to speak.  ")

Now, the first rationalist idea can be countered by the second. My only nerf for the second is the idea that [SPOILER](#s "The villain, working in secret and presumed dead, has to work slowly due to material inflow, as opposed to maximum assembly speed ") , but I'm not sure how valid that nerf would apply.

This is just basic thoughts on the way home from the movie. I won't really touch upon the obvious plot-hole other then that it exists [SPOILER](#s "How does Baymax deactivate his programming, then operate according to his programming afterwords to save his programming? It's like ripping out your brain, then throwing it to save it. Even if the chip was durable enough to survive rocket-fist-flight, how the hell did it operate according to the instructions that were just removed? Unless of course Baymax could re-write his programming on the fly as opposed to merely take in new data, which is far fetched...")

So... Thoughts? Sorry for being dumb on a smart-people thread. Please go ahead and comment. Don't hold back- If my ideas have obvious logical flaws, I would rather have my tenuous thoughts destroyed then live to be in clear error.

**EDIT:**

Wait a tic. Here's a thought: [SPOILER](#s "If the big reveal requires that his survival be secret... Why was his survival secret? Why not admit to Hiro's technology saving his life? Why be hiding? At the time, as far as I can tell, his revenge motive did not exist yet, unless of course it happened in the past, and seeing such powerful technology sparked his insane grief... Which... You'd expect to already happen, given he works in a facility that generates powerful technology.")

  Hey there, and welcome!

  First, off: don't be so afraid of rationality. You're not "dumb" just because you notice others being "smarter" than you.  Rationality is more of a skill than you think, and to some degree, a lower amount of "talent" can be made up by a larger amount of work and study.

  So don't be so down on yourself! You never know what you're capable of until you try, and even if you don't ultimately accomplish what you want, you still learn from the attempt :)

  Now, onto the story:

  I very much enjoyed the movie, but you're absolutely right that the "genius" characters were cripplingly dumb. Hiro has somewhat plausible excuse: [](#s "Heavy grief, coupled with huge immaturity.")  The villain is the real issue: if it was just some random guy that saw Hiro's invention and decided to steal it, his ridiculously poor use of the technology might be understandable, but as written, we need a lot more.

  My idea: change his goal. [](#s "Instead of going explicitly for revenge, he should have realized his daughter might still be alive and want to reconstruct the portal (the way he does anyway) in order to send the bots in after her.")

  As for what role Hiro and pals might play in that, he might learn of the plan and realize that [](#s "The risk of the new portal going out of control and sucking in the city is too great, so he has to be stopped.")

  The major problem, really, is Baymax.

  Forget the [](#s "fist-chip") thing. Why the hell is Baymax important at all? Hiro is unforgivably, brain-numbingly dumb to think that, no matter what upgrades he tries to give him, he would stand a chance against **what he himself made and should know the capabilities of.** He keeps saying Baymax can "take" the bad guy, no matter how many times the bad guy demonstrates that this is very much not the case. That kind of stupidity is only passable in a kid's movie.

  Baymax can't just be a comic relief rock-em-sock-em-robot if he's going to have any relevance at all in the story.  He has to be something more.  

  What that is, I think, is up to you, if you decide to write this. I would say that's your first real challenge. For my part, I'd be interested to see how it goes :)

  The really obvious plot hole to me was  [Spoiler](#s "The villain had no reason to burn down the lab in the first place.  He could have just accepted Hiro as a student, and collected the microbots (or at least the schematics) under the guise of helping him make improvements. Hiro would be none the wiser and the villain could take his time building his own improved version.")
  ```

  I was shocked at the stupidity of the characters as well.

  1. Hiro's microbots are neat, but the real prize seems like it should have been the headband. A brainwave-reading piece of technology that can transform complex thought to complex instructions without invasive implants? Seriously, the psychic-tech impressed me much more than the metal Lincoln logs.

  2. Beymax was innately capable of performing about 30 different complex medical scans in about 1.5 seconds from across the room. His helmet increased this ability to several dozen blocks (through walls, even). 

  3. The chemist girl wasn't performing science, that was alchemy. Some of her reactions were similar to real chemical reactions, but much bigger and faster. Say goodbye to the second law of thermodynamics.

  Those are my top 3 gripes, but there are many more.

    Honey Lemon, Chemist Girl, pretty much behaves like some kind of idiot savant compared. It looks as if she could whip up a chemical cocktail to do pretty much anything in seconds with a device slung over her shoulder, but it fails to be put to intelligent enough use, especially with the kind of intelligence that she must have to do so in the first place. 

    Baymax starts off as an idiot, but does gain character development- Very well done character development, as the robot develops only from it's experiences, and we are shown just what it's learning from. Good effort put in there, I'd say. Shame his self-optimization levels seem to be low.
