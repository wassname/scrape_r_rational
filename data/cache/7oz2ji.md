## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  I'm making a small video game, and I'm looking to include game theory minigames in them where the player competes against an AI. I've already included Prisoner's Dilemma with unknown and known amounts of rounds, and Rock Paper Scissors. 

  Are there any other games that aren't immediately obvious for the player to get the optimal strategies, aren't too difficult, and are fairly straightforward to implement?

    One option to go for is a game where there is a simple optimal strategy, and the player can force a win from the starting position - but the AI will force a win if the player gets it wrong.

    Example; there are three piles of objects (numbering 20, 32, and 17 objects per pile at the start of the game). Each round, each player can take between one and three objects from any single pile, and no pile is permitted to contain less than zero objects. The player who takes the last object from the last pile wins the game, the human plays first.
