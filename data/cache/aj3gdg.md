  You know that his town isn't really called "Bumblefuck", right? He's just calling it by a disparaging name implying that it's not a good place to live.

  FWIW, I don't think that this sort of post is going to lead to productive discussion, and will likely end up being needlessly negative. I think there's plenty of room for criticism, but this is the kind of low-effort criticism that I find to be particularly without value. I won't remove it, since I have conflicts of interest, but I did downvote it.

  I think "get on my case" is a pretty common english expression.
