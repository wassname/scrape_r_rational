  Ah, the good old Foundling gambit. Masego, you've learned so well.

  By the end of this all the legions loyal to the Calamities would have been decimated. Very convenient.

    I'm not sure this is Black's doing. Killing most of the generals during the battle would neatly avoid any suspicion that could be thrown Cat's way but at the same time the legions are already losing. Without the generals to lead them I honestly can't see them winning this one. 

    If I was being cynical I would say this is Malicia's plan. Get rid of the Black & Cat power block and eliminate Akua at the same time. She would stand to gain the most if all three died in this engagement as it would mean she would be the only power in the Empire and she had a lot of plausible deniability if the plan doesn't pan out.

      True. The kill could very well have come from Assassin. I've always suspected Assassin is her Spymaster and takes orders from Malicia and not Black. Remember that Assassin was in Procer when Black thought Assassin was supposed to be working on the Wandering Bard and nothing in the interludes thus far indicates that Black is actually close to Assassin. 

      Tinfoil theory: Cat will become the Black Queen and Malicia will marry Cat to seal the 2 kingdoms together, mirroring the Fae. It's already been setup by the fact that Cat notices Malicia is lesbian.
      ```

      - u/M3mentoMori:
        ```
        >Cat marrying Malicia

        All of my yes. They can adopt a little hellion of a child and pretend to depose each other every other tuesday.
        ```

    - u/BlitzBasic:
      ```
      But she also decreases the power of the empire as a whole. Sure, she won't have any inner enemies, but when Procer comes knocking she is fresh out of Named, her armies are decimated and her best generals are dead. Those aren't particulary good odds, especially considering the Empires military leaders consider that war to be a challenge even with intact legions and Named.
      ```

      - u/RynnisOne:
        ```
        That's cool and all, but having generals and armies only matters if that's the only way you can win.

        Malicia has other plans at this point, using what she gets from Akua and combined with whatever she's been hiding, she may not *need* armies anymore.
        ```

    Good point. Someone's playing 7-D dragonchess.
    ```

    - u/Nihilvin:
      ```
      Could also be the zombie soup everyone was talking about. No reason to believe it was infecting only the 15th
      ```

- u/Oaden:
  ```
  Suspects for the murder:

  Assassin, Certainly able, but the motive is muddy. Even if black is cleaning house, his actual team hasn't been shown to be on board with any supposed suicide pact for the sake of cat. Also, from what we've seen he generally kills with a bit more style.

  Robber: He's a sneaky little bastard, and we haven't seen in him months, but the motive is even weirder. It would supposedly be at Cat's command, and she isn't certain enough of a win to risk offing commanders during the battle.

  Akua's pet: The 15th cleared house, but Istrid's legions didn't. The motive is obvious

  Cordelia's spys: Technically possible, but she made no assassination attempts outside her borders this far. 

  Malicia's spys: Malicia has eyes everywhere, and she has plans for the weapon, so some interventions by her can be expected. Still feels awfully confident to just assume you will win even if you start killing your own commanders
  ```

- u/paradoxinclination:
  ```
  Well this battle has turned into a complete shitshow. The only way I can imagine for the Legions to survive this would be for Catherine, Masego or Warlock to somehow seize control of either the wights or the gate. It shouldn't be *impossible* given the importance of usurpation in sorcery, but I sure as hell can't see how they're going to manage it right now.
  ```

  - u/idannadi:
    ```
    Warlock is working seizing the Gate. The only one which could seize the wights (in terms of theme) is Catherine and she is going to be busy for quite a while.
    ```

  - u/werafdsaew:
    ```
    I think the Legions (except the 15th) not surviving is going to be the result.  And convenient too, from a narrative stand point, as it means that the Empress must rely on the 15th for the crusade.
    ```

- u/ForgottenToupee:
  ```
  Alright, time to test if this is truly rational fiction or not. If it is, we should be able to deduce who the murderer of Istrid Knightsbane was if we were paying close enough attention. 

  So who killed Mr. Body? 

  I think it was the Black Knight, with the Assassin, on the battlefield.
  ```

  When reading Masego’s segment, I couldn’t help but recall:

  We hold all Earth to plunder—

  All Time and Space as well—

  Too wonder-stale to wonder

  At each new miracle;

  Till, in the mid-illusion

  Of Godhead 'neath our hand,

  Falls multiple confusion

  On all we did or planned—

   The mighty works we planned.

  -Kipling

  It seemed... Appropriate.

  - u/Ibbot:
    ```
    So if I want to buy a Name, are you not part of the right organization to contact?
    ```

    - u/NotACauldronAgent:
      ```
      After the so-called 'golden morning' incident, we had a reevaluation of our core priorities. What we realized is that sure, we're pretty good at saving planets, but we're even better at being a secret power-granting society with shadowy goals. Thus, you are in luck-we have recently expanded to PGtE 'verse, and can grant your request! For merely your life's savings, or three favors, you can be granted a Name. Once you have made up your mind, our friendly recruiting agents will be with you momentarily.

      ^Terms ^and ^conditions ^may ^apply. ^Having ^a ^name ^and ^having ^a ^useful ^name ^are ^very ^different, ^and ^calibration ^is ^still ^a ^work ^in ^progress. ^May ^or ^may ^not ^alter ^your ^soul ^to ^have ^properties ^associated ^with ^your ^power ^sources. ^Sources ^include ^The ^Gods ^Above, ^The ^Gods ^Below, ^The ^Outsiders, ^[Redacted], ^and ^[Redacted]. ^Name ^rejection ^is ^a ^real ^and ^dangerous ^possibility. ^May ^attract ^attention ^from ^the ^Gnommic ^Air ^Armada. ^Refunds ^are ^not ^available ^at ^this ^time.

        Only my life savings? That's cheap as hell! Gimme!

  A traitor, but who?
  ```

  - u/cyberdsaiyan:
    ```
    Either Procer or Black himself setting the stage for the calamities' exit.
    ```

    - u/MoralRelativity:
      ```
      Both of those are definitely possibilities as are Akua and Malica.
      ```

      - u/cyberdsaiyan:
        ```
        Akua is too obvious a target. And know that most of her plants were cleared. Malicia... definitely a possibility, assuming she thinks Black will rebel, but I think she's the type that would wait until the war was over to do something like this. Or maybe she's in on Black's plan. Or maybe its her plan and Black is helping to execute it. Damn, so many possibilities.
        ```

        - u/MoralRelativity:
          ```
          Yes, most but not all. But I agree that Akua is too obvious.
          ```
