  Cat being angry at Hune felt kinda out of the left field. She's been on the receiving end of making these hard choices for most of her life as Squire so you would imagine she would be less hypocritical.

  The way the situation is presented, I'm thinking the best way to go forward would be for the Woe to go in on their own once the battle starts. The way Cat beat Akua before was by playing the role of the Queen, pulling out the sword etc. Playing the role of a Heroic group, outnumbered and outmatched, would give them a big boost imo.

    I think I agree about Hune.  Lots of the story is about Cat's struggle with Sacred Values vs Utilitarianism.  She wrestles with where she should draw the line.

    But, a lot of the internal conflict seems artificial.  Much of it doesn't fit with a military commander who's willing to bet the souls of a continent.

    Take Nauk.  Cat's a woman-of-the-people.  She leads a legion.  I'd assume that she knows 100s of legionaries by name.  And 1000s by sight.  After battle, even the minor ones, there'd be dozens of people dying in a medical tent.  I'd assumed that Cat would visit and write condolence notes.  This just happens off camera, since we don't know Unnamed Legion Member #245.

    But she's got to have spent hundreds of hours talking to the dying.  She's sent her friends to their deaths dozens of times.  Many of them, she'd know that they were likely to die.

    The Nauk thing shouldn't be new to her.  It's just new to us because it's the first time it happened on camera.

      Oh yeah. I hadn't thought about that, but it does make sense that Cat would do a lot more "accounting" regarding her dead/injured soldiers than we're shown.

    I am frankly not sure how The Narrative would deal with a group of two heroes and three villains. Heroes get heroic boosts for being outnumbered, but villains don't? If they were in a tower that exploded, would only Archer and Thief survive because there was no way for them to survive, thus giving them a heroic trope insuring their survival, but villains in a party don't get that trope?

    It has already been estabilished that you can't hijack *all* heroic tropes as a villain-Cat got her ass handed to her by the demon in her soul, while a Hero would have been fine. So it's up in the air if that's what would happen. That being said, that episode while fighting summer fey where they all acted as a unit seems to imply their effectiveness is multiplied when acting together, so staying together may very well be the optimal move.

      ```
      Archer and Thief are not as clear cut as White's group of sheep. Both of those Names are not intrinsic Hero names, they are what I call Skill Names. Names earned through skill alone  (Scribe is another example if Scribe is even a true Name and not a nickname) and not based on some deluded moral.

      They are part of the superclass called Neutral names so as such don't benefit as much from the favors of the Assholes Above as a true hero Name would (like the White Knight). 

      Whether the Narrative will account for that is up in the air. Still, gambling on that Narrative for a win for The Woe, would be a very bad gamble after all the shit Cat has done.

      I agree though that staying together is a sound choice. Their skill sets compliment one another. 

      That's true for Heroes and Villains alike. Only Villains due to their nature, rarely form groups (Calamities notwithstanding). That's One of the reasons Black was adamant and thorough on killing individual Heroes BEFORE they could gang up for their misguided and (for the most part) stupid goals. 

      "Never underestimate the destructive capabilities of a group of idiots with insane moral delusions and resources."

        ```
        In all known examples, Names which can go either way (to include Squire) are still always granted by either Good or Evil. there is no proper noun neutral, at least not that we have evidence for yet. there are some cases where it is not really clear whether their powers are granted by Heavens or Hells, but so far everyone is either one or the other.

  Anyone notice the new home page?

  Also: Catherine, grow the fuck up, she made a call and more of your men are alive than dead because of it

    >Anyone notice the new home page?

    No. What's changed? I'm looking at it, and I can't notice anything different.

      It gives book 1 and 2 summaries, like they would on a book jacket

  ```
  I'm curious as to how this doubt will affect the general story structure of Cat's battle with Akua. Will it give her the slight advantage of a Hero? Or will it take plot power away from her villain side?
  ```

  - u/Yes_This_Is_God:
    ```
    I've noticed that the more complex the speculation, the less complex the end result, and vice versa.

    It would be entertaining to see if Creation and Arcadia were moving in tandem in this instance such that Winter (New Evil that's tired of the old patterns) and Summer (New Good that is trying to play the old pattern) align to take down Akua (the last remaining bastion of the old pattern). 

    EE has stated that Arcadia merely shadows creation, but I don't see what other event would correspond well enough to the highly influential change that just occurred to the faerie realms.

    Again, just like the speculation on Ranger dying, this may not go anywhere. Would be fun, though.
    ```

    - u/Esryok:
      ```
      My take is that the events in Arcadia foreshadow what's going to happen in books 4-5, as of all the players in that drama I think Akua aligns best with the Duke of Violent Squalls:

      New Evil (Malicia/King of Winter) wants out of the old patterns. Catherine takes down a paragon of Old Evil (Diabolist/Duke of Violent Squalls) and claims their power for herself. She uses this power to wage war against Old Good (Principate? Bard?/Summer) and eventually forces them into a corner, where she's able to wrangle them into becoming New Good.
