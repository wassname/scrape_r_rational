## Rational takes on Wheel of Time?

### Post:

I'd come across [a story called Ta-veren](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7628608/2/Ta-veren) which does this nicely. Anyone have any suggestions of other such stories?

**Edit**: I didn't mean to fixate on this story in particular (it just happens to be the only WoT rational fic that I know of). I'm interested in discovering *other* WoT rational fics, any suggestions?

  Rational Wheel of Time might be cool. 

  That story, although it's fun to read, is deeply unsatisfying. It doesn't seem like the characters are challenged in a significant way, and their interactions with Moraine and Lan are too "easy".

  Usually, a fic that centers around time travel, memories getting passed, or some kind of "main character knows a lot more than he should about the plot or about the world in general" are tough to write well. A lot of what makes plots in general, and Wheel of Time in particular enjoyable is that the main character is learning about the world and him/herself. You can still have a character be confident and competent in his domain, but there should be encounters where the outcome isn't clear or the character isn't in a position of strength.

  A good example from this would be The Metropolitan Man. Lex is rich, he has well-managed criminal connections, and he is smart, handsome, and charismatic. You might think Lex is a Gary Stu because outside of supernatural powers he has everything he needs. A lot of what makes the plot interesting, though, is that Lex lacks information. He doesn't know what Superman can do. He doesn't know how Superman thinks, or if/when Superman will go mad and destroy the world. He is able to do some stuff very well, like get information from Lois, make money, and fund the bomber. Things outside of his domain are difficult for him, though, like putting agents in Smallville or any sort of physical confrontation with Superman (which he tries and fails to avoid). Also, he's really really restricted by the constant threat of Superman's information gathering powers. 

  When you read The Metropolitan Man, you're excited because the main character is competent, but you're always a little bit afraid because you don't think it will be enough. Lex is brilliant, charismatic, fabulously wealthy, and above suspicion, and when I read the story I kept on wondering how he could possibly stand a chance against the Man of Steel. 

  Watching Rand-with-Lews-Knowledge build a perfect kingdom and yank Moraine's chain is fun, sure. But I won't be bookmarking this fic.

    Much as I try to avoid over-quoting him, I still think EW said it the best: "You can't make Frodo a Jedi unless you give Sauron the Death Star".

      Fun fact: when I first read that as his "rule #1 of fanfiction" I initially scoffed - it's far too specific to be "rule #1". At the time, I'd been reading fanfiction pretty much everywhere except fanfiction.net - HPMOR was my first. Then I branched out, and saw just how *many* stories broke that rule on ffn, and finally realized why he gave it that place of honor.

        It's not that I didn't enjoy reading the fic, it's just that it was not terribly satisfying. I think that you can have a fic with an overpowered main character because maybe it IS fun to watch Harry Potter effortlessly crush every enemy! It just won't leave you feeling like something has been resolved. An example of this done well is [Seventh Horcrux](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux) which is possibly my favorite fanfiction.

          Okay, I just started reading Seventh Horcrux. First chapter had me laughing out loud.

  That story is crack fiction. Rand sets up a dictatorship for himself, the USSR writ small (and with capitalism rather than communism). It's even got a People's Palace and secret police. The whole thing with Lews Therin and cigarettes was the first clue.

  And then...misogyny.

  > "Compared to some mothers-in-law I've seen, Trolloc is a sweetheart."

  Nope. Ain't nobody got time for that.

    You know, people compliment Robert Jordan for being feminist, but I honestly never saw it. In book 1, Rand has an actual harem following after him, and literally the only useful thing Egwene does all book is make Perrin dinner.
    ```

  So, there's been enough negative discussion of this fic by now that more would just become bashing. Instead, let's ask how would *you* make a rational WoT?

  I'd want to write it from Matt's perspective. He's got the right genre-savviness-to-power ratio. He could figure out the whole Ta-veren thing and manipulate it to his advantage, and curse his luck when it bites him in the tail. Come to think, though, that's pretty much just how he acts in canon already.

  If you want to write "ambitious, knowledgeable character seizes power and saves the world with an iron fist" story like most rationalist fics, Moiraine would be a good pick. You could start before she meets Rand. She gets frustrated with her inability to find [](#s "you know who"), and starts manipulating the world to prepare for the last battle. Bonus round: maybe this causes Rand & Co to not have her present, so they whether the trolloc raid on their own, causing further divergence.
