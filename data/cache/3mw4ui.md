*There were two things I really enjoyed about HPMOR; 1) Harry trying to figure out the underlying rules of magic and 2) reading all the comments when new chapters were posted. Now I've got a magical system and a story to tell, so I'm aiming at recreating those two things.*

*The next chapter will feature the most upvoted experiment proposed in the comment section*

Daniel had turned quiet. When he had found the envelope earlier that day, he considered notifying the faculty, or at least his advisor. But the envelope was clearly addressed to them, and he didn't know the content, so he decided against it. Maybe that had been a mistake. 

There was a knock and the door opened, and before Tom even had the chance to step inside, Emma had already half-shouted "Out!", causing Tom to stop.

"No, I invited him", Daniel said. "Come in Tom."

Emma stared angrily at Daniel, who responded by picking up the envelope of the suicide note; "For Daniel, Matt, Emma and Tom ONLY".

Emma stared at the envelope for a second and went back to drawing.

"What are you doing?", Tom asked, leaning over to read the letter.

There was a pause, and when it was clear that Emma was going to ignore Tom's question, Matt started speaking.

"Uhm... that piece of paper is not actually paper. It's more like steel, I managed to get the worst papercut ever from it. So Emma is copying the pentagram to see if that's what's causing it."

Tom picked up and inspected the note for a minute, while Emma kept drawing from memory. 

"Why do it manually?", Tom asked as he put the paper back down on the table and whipped out his phone to take a picture of the paper.

"Either it works, and your phone breaks. Or it works, and it doesn't affect the electronics, and you're not able to tell if it worked or not. Or it doesn't work because you _have_ to do it with pencil and paper or something.", Emma explained.

"Eh, I've got a spare iPhone...", Tom said. "And the idea is to print the picture."

"Brilliant", Emma replied sarcastically. "I don't suppose you have a spare printer as well? You're going to ask Mr. Bradley for help if the paper jams?"

Tom sighed loudly and sat down. "You really think it will work?", to which nobody replied.

Emma frowned. She had started with the largest circle, then used the pair of compasses to create the pentagram itself. But if the order the pentagram was drawn mattered, what should be next? Without any real clues to go by, she decided to start with the symbols in the arms of the pentagram, starting with the top left and continuing counter-clockwise. Only the upside down triangle with the line through it in the middle of the pentagram remained. She started with the triangle.

Suddenly Emma got to her feet with a shriek, startling everyone.

"It burned me!" she exclaimed, looking at her hands where it had been resting against the paper. 

"Wow...", Matt began, holding his hand just over the paper. "Actually it didn't burn you, this thing is super cold!"

  Next action:

  Have Emma repeat what she just did on a fresh piece of paper exactly, changing nothing about her process whatsoever.

  Have Matt and Daniel follow along on their own pieces of paper, copying Emma's process exactly. (Tom too if he's cooperative, but his characterization so far suggests he might not take orders from Emma.)

  I predict that if she is careful to reproduce her process exactly, Emma's second pentagram will also turn its paper super-cold — but I want to be sure before proposing too many other tests.

  I don't have a prediction regarding the pentagrams drawn by the other members of the group — but if they have different effects besides super-freeze, that will give some useful avenues for subsequent experimentation.

  To clarify, had Emma finished drawing the triangle with the line? Or was she still in the process of drawing when she jumped up due to the sudden cold?

  ```
  first action: don't check if it's hard as steel until it warms.  it hurts enough that she yanked her hand away, and matt can tell it's cold without physical contact. instead, test if this cold can be transfered. place something hot on top of it, or something room temperature, and see if it gets notably different. meanwhile, have emma write down her procedure, and have someone else repeat it. do they get the same result as she does? 

  (testing magic for stability, or branches, is the first thing i would do with any magic system. does everyone have the same system and results, or does a pure-hearted individual saying oogeley boogley create a unicorn instead of a bat?)

  second action: try at least two other orders of steps with the same individual, preferably emma. if all same result, the symbols affect the result and nothing else does is likely, in that case, it should repeat no matter the order of operations.

  third action: test a different combination with a new individual iff the old spell worked identically the first and second time and the results are identical for each order. if so, will the result be the same, or does the order matter the first time?

  fourth action: take tom up on his offer, unless he backs out. photograph the diagram. does it print? does it take effect immidiately? is it more/less potent? does it work after printing? what results occur? if it works on photograph, see if you can get a lot of cheap cameras if you expect to ever need the ability to cast quickly. take a picture and throw it at an enemy.

  five: depending on majors... if electrical engineering resources availible, test electrical resistance, compare before and after. if not, will it burn like paper or stay like metal? (or something less destructive, i suppose. maybe try hitting it with a hammer and seeing how it reacts?)

  Not sure if it's deliberate, but I can't help but picture these characters as Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Tom Felton.

    Considering that [Matthew Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Lewis_%28actor%29) played Neville and [Ralph Fiennes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Fiennes) played *Lord Voldemort*, I think you're onto something here. Makes me worry about what Ralph is going to do to the four of them if they all meet up.

  Did Emma actually finish drawing the diagram?

  What happens if you trace it instead of drawing it fresh?

  Probably unwise to try drawing it freehand, although it would be interesting.  Then again, so would a bomb.

  Okay, my suggestion for the next action is dependent on several things. Of course if this was happening in real life, I'd run away screaming and report it to authorities, because suicide note+demonic pentagram+magic = ominous tidings.

  Is the body there or is it only the paper? Because I want to know if there is anything to look at other than the suicide note and the original pentagram. Because if there is anything else, investigate it. Otherwise, do the following:

  * First Action: Check if new version Emma drew is also hard as steel. If it's hard then wait to see if it warms up and becomes like the first pentagram-paper. If it becomes like the first paper, then Emma probably followed all of the steps to replicate the original pentagram. Otherwise if it stays cold and/or is not as hard as the original paper, then Emma didn't replicate the original pentagram perfectly. In either case, have Emma repeat the process two or three more times to make sure it's repeatable (ie produces ice-cold paper sheets). Then test it by seeing if other people drawing it make any differences. If it's repeatable and other people can do the exact same thing, we can move onto the following testing scenarios:

  * Start testing the 'magic' by changing how the pentagram is drawn:
    * Change the order of how the pentagram is drawn like Emma is currently doing. Vary the order of the triangles drawn, see if the circle, pentagrams, and triangles can be drawn out of order, and test if drawing the entire thing upside-down makes a difference.
    * Does direction of the pentagram make a difference? Like drawing it upside-down, reversed (if it's not symmetrical), or changing the direction of the triangles and/or lines inside the pentagram.

  * Then test external factors of what the pentagram is drawn with, instead of how the pentagram itself is drawn:
    * Does tracing it make a difference?
    * Draw the pentagram on various types of materials like metal, wood, wax, and anything easy to get a hold of.
    * Test it with different writing materials (does blood, pens, pencils, juice, or wine make a difference?).

  * Once we are done trying the various ways to draw pentagrams, try changing the "caster".
    * Does emotional states like anger, joy, sadness, or boredom make any difference?
    * Does having one person blindfolded and/or someone else moving their hand change anything?
    * Does the 'magic' work if one person draws the circle, someone else does the pentagram, and a third person does the triangles?

  * The moment a pentagram repeats an earlier effect, check what was the crucial step. Otherwise, play around to see if anything makes a difference.

  Record how each pentagram is drawn, who made each pentagram, differences in pentagram production tested, and any effects produced. Ideally, everyone tries every single possible combination, but if differences in the drawer mattered, then we should be seeing different effects from, otherwise identical, pentagrams quickly.

  Bigger changes to drawing the pentagram comes later.

  P.S. Stuff like printing out the pentagram comes when we can actually hide evidence of broken printers.

    Really?  I'd start by inferring that this is a terrible idea, because if the Masquerade hasn't been blown wide open by now, there must be something terrifying holding it together.

    Which means that you have to do better than anyone else who ever tried, and that means properly paranoid preparation.

  I'm concerned about experimentation destroying the world. In light of this fact, this post is not a proposal for a specific experiment, but for a research program.

  As an example, suppose the cold is due to the "spell" removing some energy from the surroundings. If we try to cast a spell a quintillion times as powerful, does that freeze all life on earth as a mere side effect? How do we know that flipping a few triangles doesn't correspond to "casting" such a powerful spell? How do we know that there aren't certain conjunctions of circumstances that amplify this cold, making it possible to destroy the world without altering the pattern at all?

  And of course, this is also why we can't tell people without serious deliberation. You don't give everyone on earth a [nuclear bomb](http://www.angryflower.com/golden.gif), and you don't give them potentially world-destroying magic.

  It seems (and to some extent we have to trust) that small changes in pattern or circumstance produce only small changes in effect (assuming that this paper turns out like the last one after it warms up). This is good, because it means that we can experiment with small changes. Ideally what we'd like is some way to limit side-effects. If we were a space-age society we might draw these pentagrams remotely, on the other side of the solar system. Heck, maybe we should be drawing the pentagrams remotely ourselves - even if we don't destroy the world we might win a Darwin award by freezing the room we're standing in.

  But for long term safety, I think we need to limit side effects at the source - by using an ensemble of strategies to "break the spell" if it poses some threat. The ideal would be some sort of "magical fuse" that burns out if too much power is drawn, combined with some fail-safes that attempt to disrupt the pattern when either triggered or damaged. On top of that, we should identify and use practices that cause spells to have a smaller impact (such as drawing them remotely if possible, or [hypothetically] making the pentagram smaller), to increase chances of surviving even a serious accident.

  Can we develop such safety measures with only tiny variations to a pentagram that makes paper unbendable? Possibly.
