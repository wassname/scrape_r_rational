  They use miles in the UK.

  If they did use kilometres it wouldn't be spelled as meters. That's American spelling. The UK spell it as metre, centre, etc

  "To Safety?"

  "No."

  Amazing. I can't even guess how the next chapter will go.
  ```

  - u/Grasmel:

    It manages to have the vibe where almost anything could happen an I'd go "yeah, that makes sense, I can see that fitting into the narrative". 

    It's also good how we have several one-joke characters in the cast and none of them have overdone their joke - or at least not overdone it in a nonfunny way.

      Counterpoint: I vape.

      Though, 'except for Mahuika, who helped pass the time by sharing a fun fact about herself' was a good one.
      ```

      - u/gryfft:

        I believe the issue here is that you are missing the critical fact that, in truth, Mahuika vapes.

        It's a perfectly reasonable misunderstanding, though.
        ```

    ```
    Nah, it's pretty predictable. I can confidently call that >!next chapter will be chapter 12!<. It's pretty easy when you notice the patterns.

      >!Of course, this fic loves subverting expectations, so by saying that you've guaranteed that next chapter will be Chapter 11.5, or Chapter Mu, or Chapter XII.!<

        Shhhhh you idiot this is how you drive gazemaize into ending the story in an inappropriate place again! If he hears us the next chapter is liable to be titled EPILOGUE!
        ```

        - u/callmesalticidae:
          ```
          Don't worry: I expect every update to be the epilogue, so the most unpredictable thing that gaze could do is keep the story going.
          ```

- u/gryfft:
  ```
  It appears that the mysterious instances of Bucket/Wonka confusion last chapter have been edited. Knowing gazemaize, this is not necessarily indicative that Bucket is not Wonka.
  ```

  - u/The_Wadapan:
    ```
    he """confirmed""" on Discord that this was a "genuine typo": "I always read a few random passages out of the original two books before writing to try and help get the tone down and it makes me mix the two up". This seems like a weird thing to be lying about to me (but you never know...)
    ```

- u/DeepTundra:
  ```
  > "What!?" exclaimed Mr. Bucket. "You can't kill them! They're too valuable, and poaching and hunting birds is always wrong! Always! Always! I will never contradict myself on this specific topic!"


  Are we going to meet Danny? I hope this is more than just a cheeky reference, because I have a large fondness for that book.

  ```
  Does anyone else have the impression of Charlie Bucket being a version of the Joker from DC comics except with the blood lust and murderous impulses replaced with chocolate lust and chocolate impulses?
  ```

- u/alphanumericsprawl:
  ```
  What other 'novelty' stories do people know of that are kind of like this one? 

  Some bits of HPMOR and the first two chapters of [Burn-up](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/burn-up-worm-complete.395526/) are what comes to mind for me. Anyone have other thoughts?
  ```

  - u/hyphenomicon:
    ```
    Horry Patter and the Philologer's Stone

    The three best ones that come to my mind are [THE TECHNO QUEEN](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-techno-queen-iii.311201/), [Loaf](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/loaf-worm-post-epilogue-humor-complete.467128/), and [Tank](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/tank-worm-altpowertaylor-au-complete.700525/).

  ```
  I have to say, this chapter didn't make my heart fizzlepop like most of the previous chapters.


  Maybe it was the lack of chocolate puns?
  ```

  - u/gryfft:
    ```
    Well, objectively this was the worst room so far because the grass wasn't made out of chocolate. The terribleness of the room doesn't carry over to the quality of the chapter, though! I enjoyed this chapter every bit as much as the other chocolates in this box we call a story.
    ```

    - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
      ```
      i feel the terribleness was neatly mitigated by the excellent quality of the non-chocolate grass, though.

    I think he tried drinking coffee with chili.
