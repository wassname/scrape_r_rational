  (If anyone else is confused by the two comments on this thread being "really fantastic writing" and "horrible mess of typos", I had a look, and it's somewhere in the middle. The writing looks pretty meh to me, and there are occasional typos of the sort that I would characterise as "the author's English is fine but no-one has edited this")

    I think "occasional typos" is really too optimistic. Typos and other mistakes are near constant. Nearly every paragraph contains a few. Quite a few typos, but worse than that is the poor grammar. Lots of sentences where the order of words is weird, or where idiom is used incorrectly. The story is parsable, but in many places it takes effort. The actual act of reading becomes a chore and not something enjoyable.

    The strong part of this story seems to be the worldbuilding. The premise is interesting. I didn't read for enough to see where it's going, but it is a strong start.

    The characters aren't very interesting. The MC doesn't really have personality. His only emotion is anger and he does not seem to have any goals or desires. The father is even flatter. The mother has only two scenes in the chapters I read. In the first she is kind and caring, in the second cold and hateful. No explanation given.

    Maybe my judgment of 1/10 was harsh, but this story really is quite bad.

    Edit: First few sentences edited for clarity.

      >They are near constant. Nearly every paragraph contains a few.

      My impression wasn't this extreme, but I hardly did a comprehensive survey. There are certainly a significant number of typos. Perhaps our difference is that I classed awkward grammar as poor quality writing rather than as typos. Certainly it's bad enough that it would annoy me as I read it.

        Yeah I'm guilty of sloppiness myself there. What I should have said is that nearly every paragraph contains a few errors. All typos are errors, but of course not all errors are typos.

  Why no summary or tagline?

  The premise seems really interesting, but judging by the rest of the comments on this thread, I think I will wait until the story is fully polished before I read it.

  I checked the story some time ago, dropped it because character observes evil and atrocious acts one after another, and is never able to act on it properly. It seemed that author was planning to do it indefinitely without any change.

  Wow. This story is a horrible mess of typos and ungrammatical sentences. It's barely readable at all. This is exacerbated by a stilted style and painful dialogue. To cap it all off the protagonist is rather unsympathetic (his only emotional response to nuclear war is "glad I'm out in the wilderness").

  1/10. Trash in every way a story can be trash. Do not recommend to anyone.

    Huh, well I thought it was quite good, which means whatever you like must be incredible. What fictions would you recommend?
