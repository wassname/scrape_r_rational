## I feel like this interactive fiction game, AlethiCorp, belongs here. I guess it's a simulation. I don't know if y'all have any tags for that.

"AlethiCorp simulates the experience of working for a surveillance corporation somewhere in the future. Will you focus on your career or try to fight the system? The game took 4th place out of 42 in the 2014 Interactive Fiction Competition."

"This simulation of a corporate training and remote working website is so real it hurts, from the obtuse, jargon-jangling training exercises to the awkward inter-office social event invitations. The twist is you work as a snitch, surveilling and rumbling (probably) harmless citizens for supposed revolutionary behavior. Can you do the right thing, or will you just nod, smile, and volunteer to bring a spatula to the office potluck?" - The Guardian

"Do you have what it takes to be an Associate Information Management Consultant with one of the world's largest information management companies? Can you leverage synergies with the best to operationalize our global market traction? If you were a bear, would you be an American Black Bear or a Siberian Brown bear? If the answer is Yes, apply today!" - Blurb from the Interactive Fiction Competition.

  I couldn't bring myself to complete even the first "assignment". The interview form and the "Haka Training" absolutely killed my soul. Having sat through too many LEAN, AGILE, Six Sigma and SCRUM presentations and meetings, this hits a little too close to home

  ```
  It's like all the worst parts of an intelligence agency turned to 11 and thrown in a blender. It's an excellent parody, but anyone who worked in a "progressive" government office will be horrified by how well it mimics the idiocy and incompetence inherent to them.

  All in all a good job, if a bit ham handed.
