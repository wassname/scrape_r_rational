## Eliezer Yudkovsky's Eutopia/Weirdtopia story

### Post:

So I enjoyed Eliezer Yudkovsky's "Three Worlds Collide" story, and in the [comment section of one of its chapters](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bojLBvsYck95gbKNM/interlude-with-the-confessor-4-8?commentId=5sQwW2uXgQP8FJpuP) (as well as in his [Q&A question #10](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YduZEfz8usGbJXN4x/transcription-of-eliezer-s-january-2010-video-q-and-a)) he mentions that a part of it is actually a graft from another story set in humanity's future that he was writing, where theft and rape are apparently legal (though these words don't mean the same things to them as they do to modern humans). Several chapters from his [series of posts on the "Fun theory"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hQSaMafoizBSa3gFR/eutopia-is-scary) seem to also refer to that setting. My question is: did Eliezer end up posting any of the stories in that setting?

  I suspect not, given this quote:
  > It was also seductive to the point that I had to exert a serious effort to prevent my soul from getting sucked out.  (I suspect that's a general problem; that it's a good idea emotionally (not just epistemically) to not visualize your better Future in too much detail.  You're better off comparing yourself to the Past.  I may write a separate post on this.)

  damn, I do remember reading a story where rape was legal but I have no idea what it was now.

    ```
    That was also Three World Collide.
