  I'm really curious about how #3 and #5 manifest in online fiction in general and especially in rationalist fiction.

  Personally, I love longform content: [Wildbow's](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/) [gargantuan](https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/) [meganovels](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/), [*Practical Guide to Evil*'s](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/) epic scope, [*Worth the Candle*'s](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126) musings on roleplaying games, etc. But I also think that sometimes there's something missing in these works given how they're all, essentially, first drafts.

  Pixar, of course, is an animated film studio. I think film probably rivals short fiction for the sheer *efficiency* that is needed to tell a full story with such limited time. Where, say, PGtE can spend entire chapters just on really fascinating conversations, dialog in film has to be short and direct, ideally without *feeling* too short or direct.

  This leaves me curious about what sort of form rational fiction would take in other media. Has anyone tried making rationalist films? Rationalist games? There's been a [bit of music](https://soundcloud.com/raymond-arnold) written and produced around the [Secular Solstice](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wTeEpNMok2eiAsTd5/state-of-the-solstice-2014#What_makes_a_Secular_Solstice__), which I find pretty interesting. What other avenues are there for storytelling that the community could explore?

  EDIT: So I did, thanks for catching that. Also, links to things.

    > how #3 and #5 manifest in online fiction in general

    I think that more and more there's a huge gap in how stories are told in traditional media vs online. It's even funny that TV seasons (the traditional form of serial longform media) have been slowly shrinking over the decades and cutting fluff to match up with the tighter plotting you see in movies and novels.

    On the other hand online media is mostly literary and the generally accepted length is going *up*, not down. This probably has its actual roots in sporadically updated serial fanfic but has manifested itself even in original stories now (which in some ways have inherited *more* media DNA from serial fanfics than from print novels.) When I read a story (or see other media) without enough fluff these days it feels like something's missing, it's a distinct lack of breadth. 100k words online is a brisk jog through the park (in many ways the gargantuan megaprojects like Worm set the "serious" standards for the online genre now, and that includes fanfic too) but 100k in print would be a serious novel.

    I kind of wonder if this divergence will last, but it's clearly widening now, not narrowing.

    For rationalist film, The Awareness, about a nascent AGI (sadly no longer easily accessible online), probably qualifies. It has EY's seal of approval, at least.

    Time to bust this out again: a long time ago I wrote up a short essay on what rules I think a "rational game" would follow:

    https://docs.google.com/document/d/11QAh61C8gsL-5KbdIy5zx3IN6bv_E9UkHjwMLVQ7LHg/edit?usp=drivesdk

    I didn't know at the time, but there is a genre that Mark Brown refers to as Immersive Sims, that I think comes closest to meeting these rules out-of-the-box.

    Pretty much all fanfic and web novels are probably very weak on #2, #3 and #5. #5 is the least offender because if you do a minimum of planning ahead it can still happen. However #3 is pretty much impossible for something of that length (which will be written while it's published, so it's subject to all the dangers of serials, like TV shows and long-running manga, rather than having the narrative unity of a novel or a movie), and #2 is also pretty hard because if you don't also have fun on such a long project you'll end up dropping it, and that's no good.
    ```

    - u/None:

      I'm not sure I would call it "weak." I'd maybe call it unPixarlike, but since Pixar is famous for writing 90 minute movies and not many-hundred-K fanfics I'm not sure how damning that is.
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:

        Well, I mean, they don't hold up to that standard. But of course it's perfectly understandable due to the different format.
        ```

  For rule #2, what sort of thing(s) would be fun to do as a writer that wouldn't be entertaining to an audience? I'm having trouble thinking of anything. 

  Ideally a writer trying something interesting/fun would also be trying to make that thing entertaining and make sense to an audience. I can imagine some things could fall flat, I just can't think of what would.

    Worldbuilding is fun when it's shown, not told. Exposition dumps are for author notes, not dialogue.

    Legends shouldn't be the unredacted or objective truth. Every legend needs to be chronicled by a character with biases. The Elder Scrolls series does this admirably!

    Prophecies may be a puzzle, but they should have a major takeaway for the character who'll only hear it once, *who then repeats the one or two things they'll remember.* If you refer back to it, have it misremembered unless someone wrote it down.

    If you have a map in the frontispiece, don't only include plot-important places, and don't include all of them. But do include political boundaries. And don't make the reader keep flipping back to it.

      Many a fantasy book back in the day had me doing that last one lol

        Yeah, I don't have an issue with the map bit, but I totally agree with all the others\~

    Breaking conventions for the sake of breaking conventions is sometimes fun for the writer but rarely fun for the audience. Really complex plots or conceits are often interesting for the writer but just confusing for most of the audience; there are exceptions like House of Leaves, but most times you try to do something intricate like that it will be interesting to write but fall on its face when it comes to actual readers.

    In general, being excessively clever just to see if you can manage it will be much less interesting to your readers than to you.

    But yeah, for every example of "things that are fun for the writer but not the audience" there is a seed of "no, actually this is exactly what the audience wants"  (which is why LOTR and HPMOR worked well, despite being used as examples, in fact because of that very trait)
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      > "no, actually this is exactly what the audience wants"

      I feel like the one common example of this is fluff that doesn't directly progress the plot. Often thought of as poison, but audiences gobble it up.
      ```

  - u/eroticas:
    ```
    Another common one is writing a [Mary Sue](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue). Usually the extent to which audiences like this sort of thing is the extent to which the audience is similar to the author

    For example, I and most people on this subreddit love Harry Potter Evans Verres because we see ourselves in that character. But a lot of people outside the rational circle who share little in common with him would perceive him as an annoying Mary Sue. (Yes yes *we* know that he's actually deeply flawed and that hpmor is at least in part a book about just how flawed he is, but most people will not see that, they will only see that he's supposed to be soooo smart)

    Also in general, when you look at things that are more common in fanfic than in professional fic, you see things that are more fun to write than read.

    I think definitely "talking about worldbuilding", for most audiences vs most writers. Audiences like exploring well built worlds as the characters move through them but they don't necessarily like just hearing about the world as an academic paper might describe it.

    Meanwhile writers tend to like constructing worlds even apart from characters. 

     Tolkien is one archetype of this tendency who still somehow managed to be quite successful - Lord of the Rings reads like a history book at times. I think in some ways this was allowed because in some senses it was "the first" fantasy novel which really hit a wide audience (outside of maybe religious texts, e.g. the Mahabharata, dantes inferno, etc does actually involve a fair bit of world building if you think about it)

    Some of these lines become blurred when you are writing for nerds, who are a bit more writer-ish than the average reader.

    This might be things like Charles Stross [writing the novel "Halting State" in second-person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_State) as opposed to the usual third person in novels, or first-person in much of the online fiction.

    Figuring out the backstory for every last character in the story is a good thing.

    *Presenting* this backstory to the reader every time a new character steps onto the page, even if the character is only in the story for a page or two before vanishing, never to return? Less pleasant for the reader.

  With regards to #2 and #21, I much prefer Steven Brust’s “Cool Stuff Theory of Literature.”

  > All literature consists of whatever the writer thinks is cool. The reader will like the book to the degree that he agrees with the writer about what's cool. And that works all the way from the external trappings to the level of metaphor, subtext, and the way one uses words. In other words, I happen not to think that full-plate armor and great big honking greatswords are cool. I don't like 'em. I like cloaks and rapiers. So I write stories with a lot of cloaks and rapiers in 'em, 'cause that's cool. Guys who like military hardware, who think advanced military hardware is cool, are not gonna jump all over my books, because they have other ideas about what's cool.

  > The novel should be understood as a structure built to accommodate the greatest possible amount of cool stuff.
