  Ooh, now I know where to get inspiration for munchkinning for Marked for Death.

    :>

    It's only fair.  I'm planning to take inspiration from MfD for this story -- for example, Kagome is the sigil master for the Dawn Badger ninja clan.
    ```

    - u/gbear605:
      ```
      I noticed Kagome and briefly hoped that this was the future of MfD.

      - u/Cariyaga:
        ```
        Yeah, then at least his living would be guaranteed! I hope he's based on MfD Kagome at least because I need more paranoid seal, I mean, sigilmasters in my life. Plus then we can do crossover omakes where they meet!

        Great job on the first chapter /u/eaglejarl! :D

          Thank you  I'm really glad you liked it.

          And yes, he is based on MfD Kagome.  I just love writing that guy.

            And I love reading him! He vacillates rapidly between adorable and *utterly terrifying*.

  This is the new book; it's a sequel to The Two Year Emperor[1], although it's pretty much standalone -- there's backreferences for humor, but you don't need to know them.

  I'm relaxing with this one and doing it just for fun, very much in the style of 2YE -- no planning ahead, just transcribe whatever the story tells me happens next.  It's a fun way to write, although it tends to surprise me.  Let me know what you think.

  Also, I'm soliciting suggestions for a title.

  A Naruto crossover with Two Year Emperor? Now that's a *very* interesting story. Particularly if you are only using the background setting from Naruto as a template, and not incorporating any Naruto characters? It'd be an exciting story without any ability to predict broad future events.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Glad you like the idea. :>

    It's not even the Naruto setting, actually.  I started off thinking of doing another Naruto fanfic, then I decided that I like the whole "ninja + ninja magic" thing, but I'm not all that excited about the Naruto story itself.  I already put a lot of effort into rationalizing it when I wrote Team Anko; I've been to that well and wanted to do something new.

    In $YET_UNNAMED_STORY there are ninja and they punch through walls, teleport-substitute with other objects, conjure fire and rocks, etc.  There's no hidden villages, no large organized nations, no tech much above a feudal level (most especially no wireless headsets and satellite dishes), no bloodlines, no bijuu, and it's a deathworld full of vaguely supernatural monsters, spirits, and demigods.

    One thing I did have trouble with was what magic to let Jake bring from Flobovia.  I ended up deciding that the only thing to give him was the healing ring.  I cheated a little and didn't even bring the Earring of Intellect, which he really should have had on him even in the bath.  It just isn't a big enough plot element to be worth mentioning.
    ```

    - u/TennisMaster2:
      ```
      May he please have the Earring of Intellect?  It might be frustrating to readers of 2YE if he makes mistakes because he can't think as well as he could in 2YE; it might appear as a mental regression.

      That's the best argument I can make, anyway.  I really just want him to have the earring, please!
      ```

      - u/xamueljones:
        ```
        The more magical equipment he has, the greater the chances of the ninjas figuring out that it's not him who has the power and is therefore disposable.

        That's the best counter argument I have, as the devil's advocate, in response to yours.
        ```

        - u/TennisMaster2:
          ```
          And what a great plot point that would make had he the Earring!  Should he wear it all the time?  Sometimes?  Only in private?  Only when bathing?  Keep it hidden until he is more secure in his position?
          ```

          - u/munchkiner:
            ```
            Given how bad he felt when he removed the Earring in 2YE, I would have expected him to never remove it.
            ```

- u/Cariyaga:
  ```
  I guess now I know how you combated withdrawal from MfD yesterday :p

  I like it!

  A part of me is a little upset that the MC is mostly starting from scratch, since that sort of behavior reminds me of those sitcom-type shows where at the end of every episode everything returns to normal. But I understand that a story where the MC still has all his old goodies would be rather short and boring. At least he kept his ring.

  Looking forwards to the next update!

    Yeah, it would pretty much go "So then I reached into my belt and pulled out one of my ten billion Rings of Wishing and I fixed the problem."  This is pretty much the only way to have a story that can happen.

  I wonder if Fred is going to be another portal fantasy victim/munchkin. Or that might be what we're meant to think, and he's actually just a native who picked/was given a really unusual name.

  If it is going to be revealed that he's a transplant, I'd recommend making it less obvious in a later edit; inserting it into a list of religions or religious figures would help (especially if more than one had bizarre names).

  Also, if Jake loses his ring of magical bullshit healing (which I hope is the correct name), or if somebody called—to pick a name at random—Fred happens to steal it from him, he would be in for a really rough time in ninja world. Probably no resurrections here. Maybe they could use a 

  I'm excited for this. I enjoyed 2YE, Team Anko, the Tinker's Daughter, and Marked for Death, so I'm mentally preparing myself for Jake creating an antimatter demon-fox/pangolin robot just in time to find out that he's actually fighting against an omnipotent incarnation of the planet itself or something.

    Yow, that's the worst copyediting I've done in a long time.  All fixed; thanks for pointing them out.

    Yep.  He can eventually establish himself by showing that his OOC knowledge is useful, but until then he's screwed if he loses the ring.

  Read that 2YE callback. Got immediately excited. Will/may come back to edit comment with real feedback.

  ```
  How is his name pronounced, here?  Muhn-row or Moon-rlo-eh?   Dj-ake or Jay~ku?  Is Fred pronounced Fred or Fu-rleh-ddo?

  Find "Etsuku".

  Title suggestion: Jake, Fred, and Magical Ninjas

- u/Gurkenglas:

  I'm surprised there wasn't a singularity shortly after Jake's return. I'm guessing some precognitary magic told him certain other wishes would be bad ideas?
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:

    No, there was.  Jake's home is now post-monetary and post-scarcity.

  ```
  I don't watch Naruto, but I figure half the source material is enough. Is there an RSS feed I can subscribe to or something? Or do I just have to watch this subreddit closely for updates?
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Like I said below, it's not Naruto. It's a completely original world that happens to involve ninja. 

    As to RSS; one of these days I'll need to set up an actual website but no, right now there is not such a thing. You'll need to either watch this sub or sign up on [my Patreon](http://Patreon.com/davidstorrs). 

    Aside: Wow, Naruto has totally dominated the rational fiction noosphere. Ninja are an actual historical thing that existed before anime was ever conceived of.

    - u/oliwhail:
      ```
      Eh, I think "it's a Naruto AU" is a reasonable assumption to fall into upon learning that the Team Anko / Marked for Death guy is writing a rational story about ninjas.
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        It's not friggin' Naruto!  I can create original stuff!  Not everything to do with ninjas is Naruto!  Now get off my lawn!

        *grumble, grumble, annoying people and their automatic assumptions, grumble, grumble*

    It's not quite all. When he was in Flobovia he got permanent magical enhancements to all 6 stats (strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, constitution, charisma) -- enough to put him at professional athlete levels. That makes him impressive for a baseline but woefully inadequate compared to even a child ninja.  (Also, the wisdom and charisma boosts didn't really take.) The ring lets him heal anything and means that he never gets tired or needs to sleep -- as long as he's wearing it he can literally run for weeks without stopping. 

    Oh, and I've been reminded that he has an intelligence-boosting earring that he really should have. I'm going to put it on him and then forget about it, at least for now. 

    As to him losing the ring...I have no plans for it, but it seems likely it will happen eventually.
    ```

- u/Cariyaga:
  ```
  Maybe this time he'll be lucky enough to have fallen into a world who can transplant their magic system onto him.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Sadly, nope.  He is very sad.

    > "You're a liar," she said flatly. "You have no chi whatsoever, how can you possibly be a healer?"

    >I sighed. "Damnit, how come I can't have access to the awesome-cool powers for once?" I mumbled. "Seriously, if the cosmos is going to yank me into horribly dangerous fantasy worlds every third Tuesday, couldn't it at least let me learn the local magic? I wouldn't even need cosmic power, just little stuff. All I want is to make the laws of physics my—"
