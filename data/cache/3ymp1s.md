  Does anyone know about any offline copies of anything by Scott I can get for myself or do I need to make my own personal version?

  General Discussion Question: Do *you* approve of people making copies of online literary works, even if they don't intend to give it to others? How about when it leads to improper public distribution?

  Remember even if you think it doesn't affect you, this is a significant problem for authors on our subreddit writing web serials. For example, imagine that someone makes a private copy of /u/alexanderwales' *Shadows in the Limelight* and then gives it to a friend, who then gives it to another friend, and so on all before he gets to publish it on Amazon. As a result, alexanderwales has possibly lost out on a significant fraction of his potential earnings.

    Personally, I think that you shouldn't put *anything* online unless you plan on having it be copied ad nauseum. Most of the time, authors have the opposite problem; no one wants to copy their stuff and it just sits there, unread, with no page views, and that feels terrible. To my mind, word-of-mouth is the most powerful force in the universe and getting a wide readership is the path to monetary gain anyway. It's a bit of a different story if the author has said something like, "Please don't make and distribute your own copies". Or if the content is gated in some way, which I think comes with a presumption of that same request. But for things that are freely available online ... well, I think that's part of the calculation an author makes.

    The one difficulty here is that it makes traditional publication unlikely, but I think that's a bullet you're biting when you put the work online, not when it gets passed around through unauthorized channels.

    My one other caveat is that I'd prefer stories that aren't really finished to stay under my control; if I have something I've shared that's not quite at the place where it's ready for wider release, I don't want it floating out in the wild. But that's a matter of pride rather than dollars.

    (*Shadows* likely has a long road to being published on Amazon, mostly because it requires dedicated editing time, which is much less fun than writing. I write because I enjoy writing and when I'm writing something I'm not enjoying it goes painfully slowly.)

      Agreed with this. Every physical book I've ever truly enjoyed has spread into my social circle to some degree, often through me straight out lending them my copy, and often they'll end up buying their own copies, especially for long series.  I don't see why sharing a physical copy of online fiction would work differently. 

      It can get a bit hard to quantify though. The amount of people I know in meatspace who I've turned onto your writings is probably less than a dozen, but the barrier for others is often that they like reading off paper rather than screens. So if I were to get your permission to print out Shadows, pass it around in a binder, and even one of the people who reads it ends up buying your hypothetical eventual publication because of that initial spread, that's a purchase that might not have ever happened without it... or it's a purchase that doesn't happen because they already read it. It's really hard to know for sure.

      But that's just my personal social circle. I can't calculate how many they in turn might spread your works to, or recommend it to when an edited-and-traditionally-published edition comes out. Which is why I generally agree that overall, the idea that people like your stuff so much that they want to share it, even if you don't make a cent off it, is overall better than the alternative of having a tiny or nonexistent fanbase because it's too hard for people to access.

      But writing isn't a source of income for me, and maybe I'd think differently if it was.

        There's also a chaining effect to consider. One of the reasons that modern publishing relies so heavily on series is that they're a really good sort of "natural" recommendation path, but to a lesser extent that also applies to authors. A recommendation for an author's work raises the profile for all of their other works as well. I see that sometimes with fanfic stuff; I'll get a flurry of notifications of favorites for some or all of my stories from the same person as they read though. Any one story having its profile risen raises the profile of all other stories, including stories that haven't been written yet.

        For my own personal preferences, I'm completely fine with people making their own copies or passing those copies around, including any of the PDF/epub/mobi versions that I put out on Patreon (none of which have anything approaching DRM). I get uneasy when people start *hosting* it, mostly because that completely dissociates the copy from its source. Fanfic is mostly fine for people to do whatever they want to do with it, unless it's public domain fanfic, which is basically original fiction.

      Speaking as someone who frequently purchases things they have previously read to support authors (and who supports a few of the authors who post on this subreddit through their Patreons - great service that), a good editing run and maybe a few epilogue sections or some world-building prologue information would be a great addition to a compilation which would justify a purchase of even something I've already read. Also a great reason to justify a reread, which all good stories need eventually.

      In some cases (The Traitor Baru Cormorant), the published version is just so much the superior to the freely available version that it's easily worth the purchase price by itself. Editing and expanding can be boring work, but it's justifiable added value.

  Also, /r/slatestarcodex is quite active nowadays so if you want to discuss issues related to Slate Star Codex in a reddit environment, you should head there. (I personally find Wordpress comment section a bit foreign and hard to follow)
