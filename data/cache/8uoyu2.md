## Help me explain

### Post:

Alrighty, I'm writing a thing that takes place in the Naruto universe and I'm having trouble explaining how a specific technique goes about doing what it does. Essentially, it's a genjutsu (ie. mind magic) that causes those under its influence to be subtly directed towards specific locations, it not the sort of thing that can force them to go in the opposite direction of where they're heading but instead they will likely choose an alternate route to get there. I feel I should probably mention this is primarily used to direct people towards traps.

Now in this universe (and probably canon too since there exists genjutsu that can cause sleep) genjutsu is not limited to sensory illusions, it is also capable of minor brain stimulation and encouraging neurons to release certain neurotransmitters (maybe reducing brain activity on a small scale as well). So what would need to be done to the brain such that someone feels inclined to move in a specific direction? Some of my current attempts at explaining this include:

- inducing topographical disorientation or visuospatial dysgnosia (although I'm pretty sure these would just cause the target to feel lost)

- messing with their cognitive map (but this would probably require memory implantation, not sure if that's on the table given the rules)

- a simple visual illusion might work (but idk how and I suspect it would take an understanding of the person's environmental preferences when in specific situations/moods)

- the genjutsu is delivered by sound (crickets to be precise) so maybe increase serotonin levels (to make them more confident?) when the person focuses on or moves in the direction the chirps are coming from?

None of these really feel like a good enough explanation so I figured I'd see if you guys could help. I'm also kind of wondering if this is even worth explaining, I figure if I can't explain it within the rules I set for genjutsu it needs to go.

P.S. Does this even belong here? Should I bugger off to a psych subreddit?

  I think getting really deep into the neuroscience of it would probably introduce more room for error. Why not just say it places a "temporary conditioning state" on the opponent's brain? 

  ---

  Imagine the person had to pick the route 10 times. Every time they picked the route you want them to, they got rewarded. Every time they did something else, they had a bad time. The next time they want to choose a route, they're going to get a "good feeling" from the route you want them to take, but a "bad feeling" from the other ones.

  Now imagine that the prior conditioning didn't actually happen, but your mind magic hijacks their brain to make them feel like it did (without any explicit memories of it of course).

  In absence of compelling reasons to go a different direction, they're probably going to pick the one they feel good about. Especially if they're not rationalists themselves. Naruto and friends totally make their decisions based on gut feelings in canon. Not sure how applicable this is to your story though.

  But given that it's supposed to be "subtle", I think this is about as much effect as you can really expect. The other solutions seem very NOT subtle and will make it pretty obvious they're under some kind of spell effect.

    I'm not ruling this out but genjutsu in my story is supposed to be difficult on the neuroscience front. Also, I'm not sure how much nuance a feeling can have if it isn't attached to a memory, so I feel like an implanted memory packet would be necessary and that's not something genjutsu can do (in the thing I'm writing). However, I love this idea and fully intend to have the character/clan that can fuck with memories utilize it so thanks for the great response.

      Thanks for the response, and no problem. Though I have to say if you're going heavy real-world neuroscience, the term "memory packet" is problematic. ;-p

      AFAIK, short-term memory is mostly electrochemical, activating a certain pathway of neurons, and then if you want it to go into long-term memory, you have to keep activating that same pathway electrochemically until the brain eventually builds something physical to represent the memory. 

      If genjutsu is "magical enough" to mess with a brain from a distance, it might also be "magical enough" to cause the brain to continually activate that temporary non-hardcoded memory pathway to create the "illusion of a memory" using only that short-term non-hardcoded electrochemical memory pathway, without actually recording one for the long-term so it would go away and not be remembered afterward.

      That said, my neuroscience is a bit sketchy, so I'm not sure if there's major issues with this, but it might be helpful in some way somewhere.

      Cheers!

        Lol I know, I've just started reading MoL and it's the first thing that came to mind when thinking of a relatively small collection of memories.

        Thanks for another great response.

        >temporary non-hardcoded memory pathway to create the "illusion of a memory" using only that short-term non-hardcoded electrochemical memory pathway, without actually recording one for the long-term so it would go away and not be remembered afterward.

        I love this and I'm going to have to think about it for awhile. I think ultimately the question is going to be whether or not I want genjutsu to be capable of this since I already have a character that can do the hardcoded version of it by other means, but genjutsu is something anyone (technically) can learn. What if the temporarily implanted memories condition the person away from wanting to break out of genjutsu? Also, I think if someone suddenly decided to go down path B instead of A, not because of a vague gut feeling/intuition but because they now remember all of the awful things that will happen to them if they go down path A (the idea of having multiple memories of doing something you have yet to do is confusing me atm, i'd say at the very least it would be jarring) they might suspect mind magic is at play and break out of it. Or is that even how this would work, they may just have a sudden and unconscious sense of dread in regards to path A only realizing later that it's because they have memories they shouldn't have, which would still be extremely useful for getting predictable knee-jerk reactions from people. Ya, I'm gonna have to think on this for a bit.

          Cool, glad you like it.

          Just a reminder about conditioning: when you ring the bell, pavlov's dogs salivate and expect food. They're not specifically remembering instances of being fed right after a bell rings.

          Good luck!

            This is one of the things I was struggling to conceptualize here, when it's a person like in the above hypothetical, they expect dread when considering path A but they don't necessarily remember all the dreadful memories, but they're going to almost immediately question why that sense of dread is there and recall memories that shouldn't exist. Like if the dogs were to question why they expected food they would know instantly. Unless the spell was ended immediately after it produced the involuntary response, leaving the person/dog with no idea why they had said response.
            ```

            - u/Cuz_Im_TFK:
              ```
              That's a good point, but considering that the good or bad feeling can exist in your immediate awareness without also thinking about the memories that caused it at the same time, doesn't that make it a related but distinct "entry" in your mind? If so it should be possible to have one without the other.

              What I was imagining was that the temporary brain circuits are activated to create the [effect of conditioning] without any related memories, so if you tried to do a "memory trace" to figure out why you're having that feeling, it wouldn't lead anywhere rather than leading to false memories. This gets you away from the "memory manipulation" issue too. It's more of a trance/hypnotism than anything.

              So if you get that feeling, trace it, but can't think of anything, what do you do then? At that point, you have to ask yourself "do I believe this hunch or not?" It's essentially creating a gut-feeling based on scientific principles. And like I said, it probably won't work on a rationalist with a lot of time to think in a world where gut-feelings don't have precognitive powers, but it would totally work on canon!naruto. Even a rationalist in a hurry has a decent chance of attributing this "feeling" to years of experience combined with a bunch of sub-conscious details that you notice but can't call out individually.

  Dampen entorhinal cortex firing in response to movement away from the point of interest, maybe? That might produce an effect where they'd have difficulty situating themselves spacially unless moving towards the point. If you can find a good human case study of a lesion there that might point you in the right direction for the subjective feeling of it, or you could just make something up.
  ```

  - u/babalook:
    ```
    > entorhinal cortex

    Based on the 3 minutes I just spent reading about it, it sounds like the pattern in which the neurons fire in the entorhinal cortex are correlated with the direction someone is moving at that time. So maybe (prepare for pseudoscience) stimulating the neurons in a specific pattern will result in a person moving or thinking about moving in a specific direction. 

    Thanks, I'll look more into it but this sounds promising.

  Draw the brain's attention to a spot, repeatedly, and they might choose to investigate it without even realizing if they were already  moving. [Here's](https://www.sacklerinstitute.org/cornell/summer_institute/ARCHIVE/2006/papers/Corbetta/Corbetta.Shulman.2002.NRN.pdf) an interesting paper on it, the jist is that attention in the brain is both top down (you find something you're looking for) and bottom-up (it's called stimulus driven in the article, but I learned it as bottom-up).




  Genjutsu messing with memory is pretty OP, unless you're Kishimoto and are incapable of figuring out how to use the powers you already gave your characters. I think it's better to have something that only affects the senses and some short-term memory. This makes more sense neurologically, since short-term memory seems to be mainly in the prefrontal cortex and senses are in several distinct lobes, whereas long-term memory is everywhere and usually needs the hippocampus to be encoded. If you could mess with the mid and hind brain like that, you could just turn off someone's heart. In-story I would say genjutsu messes with the frontal cortex, and can do that because that's the part of the brain that interfaces directly with chakra (we know chakra can enhance senses, the sense lobes interacting with chakra helps explains the super-awareness of skilled ninja) and genjutsu works by injecting chakra into the chakra system, not the brain (again, you could just turn off the brain or give someone an aneurysm if it was direct). That's also related to how I explain the sharingan (the eyes interface directly with the chakra system, which does all the information processing and then writes it into the brain leaving a strong memory) but that's not really relevant.




  You could draw their attention to what you want while hiding other things from their attention, implant something into their short-term memory that will draw their attention to something similar or make something stand out to them, mess with senses and make certain experiences strong enough to be encoded in long-term memory, but you can't mess with long-term memory directly.




  For this specific case, I'd have characters seem drawn to it or find themselves moving in a direction without even realizing that's what they're doing. The unconscious handles more than you'd think. An observant character might realize this is suspicious.

  That sounds similar to the earlier versions of the Déjà vu no Jutsu in [Déjà vu no Jutsu](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9255749/1/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0-vu-no-Jutsu). In that case it affects several things. 1) The initial intuitive pattern recognition 2) The intuition that raises attention to things like movement.

  The use mainly hinges on how ingrained skills is, as well as paranoia. Basically, if they move around they will think there is something they need to investigate *over there*. Then they walk happily into a trap because the don’t recognize that this pile of leaves looks suspicious.

  Of course in the story it is a completely OP skill that also makes people misjudge distances and run into walls, lets you walk right up to someone and stab them and is also impossible to dispel if you do notice it, but I assume that is not quite what you had in mind.

  I imagine it could merely twist whatever decision process the person uses to pick an optimal route? Switch their priorities and the way they assign preferences. The way you said it it shouldn't be so radical as "sure, I'll go there by walking through the river of lava, seems the safest route to me!" - just nudging your preference between similarly plausible routes.

  ```
  David Brin has a story, The Loom of Thessaly, that starts with the finding of a hill where, at every point on the hill, the easiest path, because of slope or thorn bushes or whatever, is always downhill.  The only way to the top is to always push through the most inconvenient direction of travel.

  A genjutsu that created the seeming of a path like this that leads through the target spot might work for you.
