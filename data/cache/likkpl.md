  Back once again! Threshold probably makes a bit more sense if you've read [Ascent](https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/2017/09/28/chapter-1-necessity/) first, but that's definitely not necessary. It also serves as setup for the new serial story I'll be starting in a couple of weeks.

    How long is ascent?
    ```

    - u/TheUtilitaria:
      ```
      Novella length - like 50k words
      ```
