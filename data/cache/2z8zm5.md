## GEB Discussion #1 - Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering

### Post:

**Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid**

This is a discussion of the themes and questions concerning the **Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering**, and its dialogue, **A Three Part Offering**.

This post will list several of the main ideas which appear in the introduction as well as starting questions to answer concerning each idea.

**Strange Loops**

The first problem to discuss is what Strange Loops, or self-referential statements, can you come up with?

To help, the provided definition is that a strange loop arises when, by moving only upwards or downwards through a hierarchical system, one finds oneself back to where one started.

Examples:

This sentence has no punctuation

In this sentence, the number of occurrences of 0 is 1, of 1 is 11, of 2 is 2, of 3 is 1, of 4 is 1, of 5 is 1, of 6 is 1, of 7 is 1, of 8 is 1, and of 9 is 1.

Don’t restrict yourself to sentences either! Think of other ideas such as Escher’s paintings. Play around with the format of this subreddit!

……

**Recursion**

The second problem is to understand the concept of recursion. One relevant definition of recursion is:

If you already know what recursion is, just remember the answer. Otherwise, find someone who is standing closer to Douglas Hofstadter than you are; then ask him or her what recursion is.

How does recursion differ from the concept of self-reference?

……

**Paradox**

The third problem is to discuss the concept of a paradox. A paradox is a statement which *seemingly* contradicts itself but might be true. Note that a paradox is not the same thing as a contradiction. Paradoxes are invalid arguments where *seemingly* valid assumptions lead to an invalid fact or contradiction.

Types of paradoxes:

A veridical paradox produces a result that appears absurd but is demonstrated to be true nevertheless. Thus, the paradox of a 21 year-old man who has celebrated only 5 birthdays is resolved by his birthdate being on February, 29th.

A falsidical paradox establishes a result that not only appears false but actually is false; there is a fallacy in the supposed demonstration. The various invalid proofs (e.g. that 1 = 2) are classic examples, generally relying on a hidden division by zero.

A paradox which is in neither class may be an antinomy, which reaches a self-contradictory result by properly applying accepted ways of reasoning. For example, if the sentence “There is no absolute truth.” is true, then the sentence is itself an absolute truth. 

As before, come up with a paradox and discuss the difference between self-reference, recursion, and paradoxes.

Is the idea of infinity paradoxical? [Hilbert’s Hotel]( http://www.people.vcu.edu/~elhaij/GEB/Notes/Unit1/InfiniteHotel.html) is a good example of a paradox involving infinity.

……

**Dialogue**

Here are some questions on the dialogue found (and [stolen!]( http://www.people.vcu.edu/~elhaij/GEB/Notes/Unit1/index.html)) by searching through online notes on GEB:

a) To what Escher print does Achilles refer at the beginning of the dialogue (what does that print look like)?

b) What is a Möbius strip? To what print does Achilles refer?

c)  What is the relationship between the hole in the flag and the Möbius strip?

d) Is Zeno the sixth patriarch or is he not? If he isn’t, then why does Achilles think he is?

e)  What story is recreated in this dialogue?

f) In what ways is this dialogue self-referential?

g)  Do you understand the crux of the paradox (Achilles paradox) that Zeno relates?

h) Are you familiar with the Dichotomy paradox to which the Tortoise refers?

i) Is there any significance in positioning the Tortoise upwind of Achilles?

j) What (if anything) is wrong with Zeno's argument?

  Inspired by yesterday's reading, I tried to make a strange loop themed drawing myself - [a man imagining himself.](http://i.imgur.com/NVojCes.jpg)

  Some general ideas that the reading inspired:

  >Such, one imagines, was Bach's intention; but Bach indubitably also relished the implication that this process could go on ad infinitum, which is perhaps why he wrote in the margin "As the modulation rises, so may the King's Glory."

  >Implicit in the concept of Strange Loops is the concept of infinity, since what else is a loop but a way of representing an endless process in a finite way? 

  These parts reminded me of how in the Middle Ages Catholic philosophers and theologians tried to come up with proofs of God and ways to describe God. It sounds kinda similar to "trying to represent an endless process in a finite way." [Maybe it's not an accident that even Gödel tried to prove the existence of God.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%F6del%27s_ontological_proof) I believe that for certain types of artists the goal of their art is to describe the "unreachable" (infinity, God, Samsara etc.)

  In this section there was a kinda quasi-spiritual vibe. Maybe the reason why Eliezer adores this book so much that he thinks it's "the most beautiful book ever written by the human species" is that the subjects of this book inspire the kind of feelings that are closest to what believers have when they think about God.  I'm not sure if it's related, but [there are studies say that among mathematicians the number of people who believe in God is slightly higher than in other disciplines.](https://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~neum/sciandf/contrib/clari.txt)

  Russell's and Whitehead's attempt to create an artificial multilevel system to get rid of self-referencing reminds me of my own attempts to get rid of anxiety. It sounds funny, but I've had huge problems with self-reference induced anxiety. It's interesting that the same issue can cause problems both in formal systems and in real people. If I start to reference myself too much in my own thinking (like thinking about how I walk, or keep my hands, or what my posture is etc.) I become really really anxious, I become really awkward and I lose the capability to do almost anything. This was one of the several problems why I was put in a mental asylum last year. [Slate Star Codex further described  this particular issue with self-reference.](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/11/going-loopy/):

  >A guy named Wegner conducted a famous psych experiment where he asked a bunch of participants to sit in a room alone and try not to think about a bear with sunglasses. Of course, that was pretty much all they could think of. They seem to have gotten into a feedback loop where “desire not to think of a bear with sunglasses” -> “thought of a bear with sunglasses” -> “frustration” -> “stronger desire not to think of…” -> “more thoughts of…” and so on.

  >There seems to be an element of this in most anxiety disorders. Someone goes outside, something bad happens. Next time they go outside, they feel anxious. The usual STRONG BARRIER against conditioning upon internal experience is AWOL for some reason. The patient finds the experience of becoming anxiety very negative; therefore their belief that “going outside leads to bad things” is justified. Eventually they are so anxious about possibly becoming anxious that they just stay in their house all the time.

  Btw, [here's Bach's endlessly rising canon.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A41CITk85jk)

    Hmm. It's not uncommon on the internet for a link to link to a page that links back; but it's also not uncommon for connections to be one way. Still, given how much most pages link and are linked to, I expect that most webpages are part of many longer loops.

    Might there be any use for a metric of the shortest loop from a page back to itself? Your comment make this thread's autoproximity 1. Before your comment it was 2 - [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2z8zm5/geb_discussion_1_introduction_a_musicological/) to [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/) back to [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2z8zm5/geb_discussion_1_introduction_a_musicological/).

      Well, I know that [the Wikipedia page for "Philosophy" loops back to itself by clicking only the first non-italicized non-parenthetical link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy).

      {{Kudos for this thread! Very hype for this readthrough. Should we advertise to /r/math and /r/physics, maybe? There have been talks about this sort of thing there before, though I've never actually seen it come to fruition.}}

    - u/alexanderwales:

      It's not a terribly *useful* metric, given that the majority of pages have an autoproximity of 2, and many have an autoproximity of 1. I believe that every comments page on reddit has a link to itself, actually - the link just below the post which (currently) says "23 comments".

      The proliferation of these small, mundane strange loops on the internet is a byproduct of how they're programmed - there's no use in having a page link to itself, but this page was created programmatically, and it's useful for "the page" to have a link from specific to general, because sometimes the page is a permalink to a comment, or a context expanded comment chain.

  This will be my first read-through of this allegedly life-changing book, and I'm curious to see what all the fuss is about. So far I have no idea. Basically all I'm getting so far is:

  - "Recursion! Paradoxes! These things sure are weird and neat, aren't they?"
  - A lot of dancing around Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem without any clear sense of why it's important or interesting (or for that matter, what it even really means, or how it's proven, which is frustrating since while I'm sure some others on this sub are already familiar with this topic, I am not).
  - The most famous of Zeno's paradoxes, with unfunny jokes.

  I realize that we haven't even properly started the first chapter, but... someone reassure me. This is gonna get good, yeah?

  - u/xamueljones:

    Well...Godel's Incompleteness Theorem is explained in the very Introduction.

    It gets good **fast**.

      > Well...Godel's Incompleteness Theorem is explained in the very Introduction.

      Not to my satisfaction. Should I assume, then, that no more detailed explanation is forthcoming? Do I have to do extracurricular reading, and if so do you have any recommendations?
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        It really does get explained very well at the 2/3rd of the book, illustrated by the dialogues.

        The next chapter might be a little math-hardy, he tries to explain formal systems, but that's ok.
        ```

      - u/xamueljones:
        ```
        I'm not sure how much more Godel's Theorem will be covered since I haven't read further on, but I will be very surprised if it doesn't appear again considering that Godel's name is in the very title. Also GEB is known for it's frequent references to previous ideas when it talks about new topics. 

        I recommend making your judgement on whether or not to continue reading on after chapters 1, 2, and 3.

  Strange loop: The idea of actually pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. Holding corporations that own each other nontransitively.

  Recursion always points to a case simpler than itself. It hits an end eventually, even if you're working with infinite but well-founded objects.

  As for paradoxes: truth is truth and is perfect. A seeming paradox is just truth's way of pointedly telling you that your map is imperfect, your glasses lenses dirty - you need to figure out a way to say things correctly. Infinity isn't paradoxical, just so far removed from human intuition that it requires special rules to handle correctly.

      In the case of the fractal, the base is the starting point, the simplest case before you start iterating. Sure, the 'final product' has no stopping point, so to speak, but its not infinite in both directions at least.

  I hope this readthrough is successful!

  While Justin Curry and Curran Kelleher are cool dudes and they put together a good course, don't call it an "official university course". Set your expectations appropriately: It was a summer course for high schoolers, taught by undergrads.

  There's some notes on the first few chapters that you might find useful on [the GEB Wikia](http://godel-escher-bach.wikia.com/). There are... only two of us editing it so far, but I hope there can be more. (Pro-tip for Wikia: turn on adblock, their ads are atrocious.)

  EDIT: off -> on

  I like this a lot - I've been meaning to read GEB for a while. Thanks for helping me getting around to it!

  I think to a lot of people infinity and recursion seem like inherently paradoxical concepts - I've heard several times people misquote Russell's Paradox as "does the set of all sets contain itself?" This is understandable - I don't think infinity itself seems paradoxical, but the idea that something infinite can be described in a finite number of letters (such as the word "infinity" for example) can be pretty mindblowing. 

  I really enjoyed the discussion on the word "heterological". But it seems to me, when it comes to words much moreso than with set theory (maybe just because I'm much more familiar with words than with set theory), that the division of all words into autological and heterological is somewhat of a false dichotomy. It sounds reasonable that words either describe themselves or not - but can't we solve the paradox by simply allowing a third category, those whose self-describing status is undefined? It reminds me of a paradox riddle I've heard - "There is a village with only one barber. All the men in the village either shave themselves or get shaved by the barber. Who shaves the barber?" There, it seems obvious that even though the claim "all the men either shave themselves or get shaved by the barber" on the surface looks like it neatly sorts the men into two groups, the paradox of "who shaves the barber" shows that the dichotomy is not quite real. 

  Incidentally, I Googled "Sixth Patriarch of Zen" and arrived at [Huineng](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huineng), who is apparently a very important figure in Zen Buddhism. The Wiki article is sadly lacking, but in combination with the [Platform Sutra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_Sutra) which is based on his teachings, I did feel like I learned some interesting - and relevant - stuff. Huineng was of the strong opinion that meditation should strive toward thoughtlessness, not reflection. To quote the Platform Sutra:  
  > In this teaching of seated meditation, one fundamentally does not concentrate on mind, nor does one concentrate on purity, nor is it motionlessness. If one is to concentrate on the mind, then the mind [involved] is fundamentally false.

  This is really interesting. I'm reading it as "purity of thought comes from deactivating the mind, not from concentrating it on 'purity of thought'". So basically, you have to find a trick to stop thinking about what you're trying to achieve by not thinking, a very recursive problem. My interpretation is that Huineng sees recursion as a real problem to avoid. I would very much like to hear his thoughts on Achilles and the Tortoise in the original paradox by Zeno.

  Here is a bit of Haskell that generates the series from "Figure and Ground"

      inverse xs = go xs [1..] 
                    where go (x:xs) (y:ys) | x > y = y : go (x:xs) ys
                                           | x == y = go xs ys
                                           | otherwise = error "Ordering invariant violated"

      -- inverse evens == odds
      -- inverse fibonacci = [4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11...]

      series = 1 : 3 : 7 : (drop 3 $ zipWith (+) series (inverse series))

      -- series == [1, 3, 7, 12, 18, 26...]
      -- inverse series == [2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11...]
      -- series == Figure??
      -- inverse series == Ground??

  Computer scientist here.  I found the self-referencing part very interesting, one thing that immediately came to my mind was Haskell (programming language, /r/haskell).  By using lazy evaluation, we can make use of self-referencing in some quite neat ways.

  One thing I learned recently about are Allison's Queues (good explanation here: [link](http://www.melding-monads.com/files/CorecQueues.pdf)).  They can be used to implement breadth-first traversal without explicitly mutating e.g. a queue by creating a self referential queue.  In the paper linked above on p. 5 (figure 3) there is a trace of the evaluation, note how **queue** is defined: 

      queue = tree : explore 1 queue

  This might be a little into the deep end for non computer scientist but I found it might be interesting.

  Does this mean life is a strange loop? You start out as not existing, then you exist and your age increases for a while, until you go back to not existing. My guess is that it isn't, since you don't have existence to look forward to after you die. In that sense, you're not really back to exactly where you started. Or are you?

  I also found it intriguing that the author connected the idea of paradoxes with the number 0. I hope he goes into more detail later on that. My own thoughts were that if truth and falsehood were compared to positive and negative numbers, then perhaps paradoxes are the 0 in between. It does not seem hard to think of some truths as being 'more true' than others, i.e., containing more true/useful information and/or less false information. And it does seem that paradoxes like 'this statement is false' contain no useful information whatsoever - so they seem rather analogous to 0. 

  Do you remember how it was shown that there were certain things 'uncomputable' via Principia Mathematica? Perhaps the authors of PM simply left the 'logical 0' out of their system, much like the ancient Greeks left a 0 symbol out of their number system.

  I also recall (from a computing theory class I once took) Turing's proof that the [Halting Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem) was undecidable. The proof goes that *if* we could write a program A that could tell you, given a program B and some input, whether program B would loop forever, then we could also run program A on itself in certain tricky-to-explain ways and make a paradox. I remembered that even once my mind understood the proof, my heart never quite figured out why it mattered or made sense in real world terms. But now I suppose that it was just the 'missing 0' in Turing's computational theory.

  Could it be that all we need for paradoxes to make sense, is to remember to include the '0' in our systems?
