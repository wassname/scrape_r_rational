## [Challenge Companion] Worm

### Post:

***Assume that this thread and the challenge will have major, unmarked spoilers.***

**tl;dr: This is the companion thread to the [biweekly challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7a6ufq/biweekly_challenge_worm/), post recommendations, ideas, or whatever else below.**

Worm is a superhero web serial. [You can read Worm here.](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/)

There's fairly ~~repetitive~~ consistent debate within the community about whether or not Worm is "rational" with regards to either the sidebar definitions or better definitions that people have proposed; feel free to start those up in this very comment section. It is, at the very least, something that most people here have read, and which gets referenced frequently.

Note that Worm has its own subreddit, /r/Parahumans, where you can find lots of discussion on Worm, Worm 2, Pact, and Twig.

  Can someone write Doctor Mother as a scientist? Because canon!DM is not scientific.

  Notable moments of idiot balling:

  I understand how space whales with a better grasp on physics than Einstein think and deduce that only my experiments can save the world.

  My partner went batshit crazy and joined some murder hobos, so I’m not going to let ANYONE touch the vials, even though I can Master a Stranger to sit behind my partner and kill them if the start getting Ziz’y.

  Let’s be SUPER SECRET because maybe the space whale of doom will understand whatever the hell we’re trying to do and wipe out organization. Despite the fact that it can probably see the future any time it wants to.

  Let’s leave the most powerful precog in the world (who happens to be a child) in the hands of a child molester.

  The crowning moment;

  I, a vanilla human, will lead the SUPER SECRET organization. Not the person who’s power is “winning,” the competence-porn statistician, the flying brick who could out-argue Socrates for fun, or the man who’s superpower is literally making the best plans. I provide something irreplaceable, and that irreplaceable thing is worth more than anything those people could bring to the table.

  Seriously, why the actual Swiss hell is she in charge of Cauldron?

    “Why?” the Doctor asked.

    “I felt the hostility.  I felt how the one we killed, in the vision it had of the future, it almost enjoyed doing what it was doing.  If the golden one is similar at all, then all it takes is an accident.”

    >Let’s be SUPER SECRET because maybe the space whale of doom will understand whatever the hell we’re trying to do and wipe out organization. Despite the fact that it can probably see the future any time it wants to.

    “If we explain to someone important, the army…”

    “Disaster.  They react with fear, and he’ll probably respond to the fear.  He’s… hostile, I’m certain.  He only needs an excuse,” Contessa said.  “They can’t beat him, because he designed himself to be unbeatable.”

    >Seriously, why the actual Swiss hell is she in charge of Cauldron?

    Easier to have an adult handling the negotiating and person-to-person interaction.  Fortuna was young, and people wouldn’t be so inclined to drink a strange substance offered by a child.

    Basically, these things that you call idiot balling keep being because the person whose power is winning approved of the action.

      > Basically, these things that you call idiot balling keep being because the person whose power is winning approved of the action.

      This is my problem with the Path to Victory power; all the author has to do is say "this is the winning path" and it excuses pretty much any plot contrivance whatsoever. People are no longer carrying the idiot ball, they're carrying the prophecy ball. I think that Worm does better with this than it might have, given the sheer scope and strength of its prophecies, but "because prophecy says so" seems like it's the opposite of rational fiction, at least to me, because it's a shortcut for characters not thinking about their actions.

        Yeah, I remember as one point Wildbow mentioning how Contessa would use her power to make sniper teams less effective to give normals learned helplessness, which struck me as... convenient?
        ```

        - u/nogamepleb:
          ```
          See, this I buy. Capes are the most effective weapon against Scion, given that normals no longer have nukes. In that situation, Contessa would probably spend a fair amount of time making sure that normals never started wholesale murdering capes.

          And if any cape did become a problem, Number Man and Contessa are the only snipers you need.
          ```

      - u/torac:
        ```
        There is another issue with using Contessa this way. These arguments would work if she was Dinah and just saw "If we do this, there is a high chance of failure." Her power is supposed to be "I want this to happen" and then make it happen. When discussing on telling more people her answer should never be "We cannot, they will betray us." It should always be "I have a path of x length to gain trustworthy and useful accomplices"

        Going from this to immediately refuting any number of common sense suggestions is extremely counterintuitive. (Near) everything should be possible, if perhaps suboptimal for certain goals. Given that the path already cannot do reliable long-term planning against Scion and crew, and given that Cauldron already PtV as a tool instead of a prophetic leader, what then makes these particular suggestions so problematic that she outright refuses them? Especially compared to other difficult paths, such as "Induce global, decades-lasting learned helplessness in regards to snipers vs parahumans."

        Anyway, I myself never got that far. There were already too many things I disbelieved to continue reading long before that.

      ```
      I'm referring to how Cauldron assumed that natural triggers couldn't harm Scion despite the fact that all the scariest capes in the world (Jack, Sleeper, Contessa, Number Man, etc.) are natural triggers.

      I'm not talking about going to the government. I'm talking about having more than FIVE people involved in the decision making process. Maybe that's the optimal five. Given that Accord is not a part of it, I find that result unlikely. Either way, Cauldron could be more public and create more capes to combat the truly insane number of villains, but they don't becuase...

      But she *continues* to have a role as a decision maker. By all accounts, she's the head of Cauldron until Gully tears her head off! Once Contessa is old enough to look serious, a vanilla human has no business doing a Thinker 12's job.

      A point on Contessa's power: It gives her the path to her objective. Nothing more. It doesn't tell her the best questions to ask (another point: has Contessa ever path'd to 'how do I learn to ask better questions?'). With what frequency does Contessa path to "optimal world-saving committee"? Becuase I'm pretty sure it's not often.

      I'm not saying I have a better way. Cauldron did do a damn fine job of keeping S-class threats (save the Endbringers and Sleeper) under control, as well as making sure a few rouge Thinkers didn't destroy the world economy in an afternoon of debauchery. I do *know* that they could've done it better.

      I notice you don't refute my points on Dinah and Manton. Is this due to an insufficient number of fucks to give or have I found points we both agree on?

        >I'm referring to how Cauldron assumed that natural triggers couldn't harm Scion despite the fact that all the scariest capes in the world (Jack, Sleeper, Contessa, Number Man, etc.) are natural triggers.

        We don't actually know that Sleeper is natural. But we do know that Cauldron produced the Triumvirate, Hero, Grey Boy (and roped natural trigger Glastig Uaine into being a way to channel Grey Boy safely), Shatterbird, Pretender, the first Butcher, Doormaker, Perdition, both N*x's, Siberian... They've got a really good track record, and it's clear from the way they maneuvered Glastig that once the time came to go public, they'd be calling in all the natural triggers who were good enough.

        >Either way, Cauldron could be more public and create more capes to combat the truly insane number of villains, but they don't becuase...

        Because they operate in a situation where Scion *isn't* looking ahead. But this dude shows up to major battles on occasion and has hobo man giving him pants. If a public operation came to light, he would hear about it, he'd figure out which Earth Cauldron hung out on, and he would destroy them. Interlude 29 makes this quite clear!

        >But she continues to have a role as a decision maker.

        Again:

        The Doctor nodded. “See? You’re doing okay.”

        “Easier when someone else takes point.”

        Having the Doctor propose courses of action makes it easier for Contessa to chart the path to victory.

        >With what frequency does Contessa path to "optimal world-saving committee"?

        But she hesitated to carry it out.

        There was another question she had to ask.  Like the fable of Luisa and the black-furred man, she had to ask very carefully.

        Could she do all this, explain to her uncle, find the thing that was at the heart of this chaos, and save her people, and handle the other essential crises she run into on her way?

        She definitely takes the time to ask smart questions in her interlude.

        >I notice you don't refute my points on Dinah and Manton. Is this due to an insufficient number of fucks to give or have I found points we both agree on?

        Closer to the first one - it's easy to pull from Interlude 29 to explain Contessa and Doc Mom. It's harder to pull from the seventy million chapters of Worm to explain everything.

          We can list powerful capes all day. I'm not saying they *can't* make powerful capes, there are plenty of those. What I'm saying is that they disregarded a possibility involving something they didn't fully understand, and that is not a scientific thought.

          They still have a criminal number of unused vials. If Scion saw more capes running around, his primary thought would be "oh goody, a Trump shard is getting it's shit together." Maybe optomistic, but you can take a few risks in the interest in making the world less of a shit hole.

          THEN HAVE A LOW-LEVEL MASTER THAT MAKES PEOPLE LIKE HIM! THERE ARE 9001 PEOPLE BETTER FOR THE JOB THAN A BAD SCIENTIST!

          There's a difference between asking "smart" questions and dedicating at least a year of time away from non-critical threats to maximize question-asking capability. The second pair of useful questions she asks is compounded, so we don't know if it was asking about the Warrior or asking about the equally powerful being was the problem.

          "Smart" Questions
          How do we stop them?
          Weapons? An Army?

          "Better" Questions
          How do I **understand** the Godlings? With knowledge of the cause comes knowledge of work-arounds.
          How do I optimize my power while maintaining sanity? If it takes less than, say, a year, you've got a deal.

          “Okay,” the Doctor said.  “Okay.  What if I made the decisions from here on out?  You tell me if I’m going down the wrong path, give me direction where it’s needed.

          The Doctor here assumes the role of leadership. Fine for short periods of time, but as soon as you find a social Thinker you need to replace her. Except it doesn't happen. Ever. Pure arrogance on her part. Never send a human to do a robot's job, and Thinkers can get damn close to a robot.

          Also, Dragon is permitted to live. I have a hard time buying everyone seeing her slowly slip her shackles and collectively ignoring the Control Problem. I can't imagine a rational!Thinker permitting that.

        I didn't think Contessa counted as a natural trigger. It was my understanding that Path to Victory was scattered when Eden crashed, and it hadn't been packaged for distribution in the same way as the other shards.

        The uselessness of natural triggers against Scion is supposed to be canon; Scion comments on having to cripple several shards before distribution in order to prevent their being used against him, Administrator most of all. (I'm confused about why Sting was shared at all. I get that as their oldest natural weapon, the Worms would want it to collect data and evolve, but it seems like a poor risk. Hindsight, etc...)
        ```

        - u/nogamepleb:
          ```
          Contessa is arguable both ways, so I think we can leave that to matter of opinion. Fair point, though.

          The thing is Scrub also could hurt the Entities. Marquis canonically was useful at the end, Gavel stood up for a full *minute* against the FU beam. A dead bee can sting you good as a live one, and the reason the Shark shards were distributed were to increase levels of conflict if I recall correctly.

          Basically, in canon Cauldron makes an assumption. No one bothers to disagree with them, and the only way to test it would be to have a natural cape of sufficient power shoot at Scion and see if there was a noticeable effect. The error here is in a failure of imagination/not seeking to disprove something.
          ```

          - u/Iconochasm:
            ```
            To add some precision to the discussion, plenty of natural capes were able to do *superficial* damage to Scion, or make him expend *non-infinitesimal* amounts of effort to destroy them.  Sting was maybe the only true danger, but he had a passive precog effect that negated it in practical terms, under normal circumstances.  Cauldron's thinking was that they needed something that broke the rules of the rigged game, and Eden's non-crippled Shards were the only possible source for that.  For example, passive precog all the time is probably way more resource intensive than just tagging Sting to ping back a HUD warning if it was ever targeted his way.  Eden's unmodified version could easily have lacked that tag, which would have been a potential game winner.  The Siberian was also a possible contender, though of course there was no way to test it until the moment of truth.
            ```

            - u/nogamepleb:
              ```
              Fair point, and thank you for increasing the precision! I would offer that Ash Beast was also extremely effective against Scion, despite his natural trigger, indicating that perhaps all that's needed is a sufficiently broken Passenger.
              ```

  - u/Alphanos:
    ```
    While there are excellent grounds to dispute some of Cauldron's decision-making, I think you have selected some poor examples.

    > I understand how space whales with a better grasp on physics than Einstein think and deduce that only my experiments can save the world.

    Cauldron knew that they had a unique resource and capability that nobody else could possibly have.  They knew that the same sorts powers and resources Zion had to fight with were potentially available for them to harvest and repurpose as weapons to fight back.  For all they knew, and remember that with Contessa they knew quite a bit, their plan was the best known chance of preventing the annihilation of vast numbers of parallel earths.

    It would be foolish to plan on the basis that someone else was going to show up with a better plan.

    > Let’s be SUPER SECRET because maybe the space whale of doom will understand whatever the hell we’re trying to do and wipe out organization. Despite the fact that it can probably see the future any time it wants to.

    They knew that Zion had the power to destroy them if he wanted to.  They knew that at some point in the future, he would want to.  They didn't know exactly when.  So they figured their best chance to have enough time to prepare to fight back would be to minimize the number of traces that could lead Zion back to them.  Maybe Zion was just going to use crazy powers to find them regardless.  But maybe not.  Given the stakes involved, it wouldn't make any sense to gamble with that.  I believe they also were aware from trigger visions that Zion and Eden had previously destroyed many, many worlds that had attempted to fight them straight-up.  Secrecy was clearly the smarter choice.

    > I, a vanilla human, will lead the SUPER SECRET organization. Not the person who’s power is “winning,” the competence-porn statistician, the flying brick who could out-argue Socrates for fun, or the man who’s superpower is literally making the best plans. I provide something irreplaceable, and that irreplaceable thing is worth more than anything those people could bring to the table.

    This is actually one of their smarter moves.

    Unlike most of the rest of the world, Cauldron was fully aware that the same powers they hoped to use to fight Zion were in fact parasites created and possibly controlled by him and Eden for purposes inimical to human life.  They knew that shards were designed to foment unnecessary conflict by warping the minds of their human hosts.  What they were never sure about was the full extent to which the shards could influence their hosts, or the level of intelligence that went into that.  Without knowing the strength or capabilities of the mental influences these enemy alien parasites have on their thinkers, it would be extremely dangerous to fully hand over the leadership to them.

    For the general populace, that would be paranoia, baseless discrimination, and stupid given the greater capabilties of strong Thinkers.  But for Cauldron, it was just plain fact that every Thinker was under some degree of mental influence by the same enemy they hoped to survive eradication from.

    Now, here's a better objection and the other side to it:

    Objection: Rather than putting the particular humans in charge who just by random chance happened to stumble over Eden's remains, wouldn't it make more sense to use Contessa's powers to locate and recruit the best possible people for the job and put them in charge?

    Rebuttal: But what degree of Eden's influences remain in attempting to use Path to Victory to select the best people?  Can they be sure?  For how long after they started out should they have tested Contessa's powers in order to decide whether to trust Path to Victory for something like this?  Could Path to Victory predict that and give them whatever answers would assure them of its safety, in plans to support Eden/Zion in the end?  How can they be sure?

    I think this one can definitely be argued either way.  The paranoia and second-guessing involved in making such high-stakes decisions wouldn't be easy to deal with.
    ```

    - u/nogamepleb:
      ```
      Again, the first bullet point is referring to their decision to ignore natural triggers when looking for answers to Scion. Their evidence to do this was shaky at best (especially given the effectiveness of natural triggers at GM) and the refusal to even consider natural triggers is indefensible.

      Here, I'm talking about the truly insane number of vials they have in store and unused. Releasing them all could cause problems, yes. On the other hand, the world is rapidly going to shit, and these vials could buy another three or four years of consistent population growth, while potentially creating another S-tier parahuman. Instead, Cauldron hangs onto them, being (in my opinion) needlessly stingy. You can argue both sides, and I see the reasons for the extreme paranoia. I just think that it's not convincing.

      Given that the Number Man was able to aim Blasters at Scion, I assume that it isn't *stopping* him from trying to hurt the Entities. Additionally, you can just not use PtV to pick the candidates. Look for people who can keep a cool head, people who can't trigger, and with a proven track record of effective decision making. Then draw up a list and follow them with a Stranger to see who's the best, as decided by a panel of humans. Also, I don't think the Warrior actively interprets all the data the shards gives him, nor does he cripple them in a way that would prevent a Thinker from being an effective organizer/recruiter, which is what you would use the Thinker for.

      To clarify: I'm not taking about giving humans *no* seat at the table. But Doctor Mother's power is far and away too broad for a vanilla human, and she is too flawed of a vanilla human. I would accept, say, a Washington-esk figure who went through something that could compare to a trigger event, didn't get powers, and came out of it shaken but healing, who's primary job was to help people get powers from Cauldron and set Cauldron's goals, as well as provide ethical oversight (in the sense that Cauldron appears to be an ethical organization, not actually ethical).

    This is the part that confuses me. We know for a fact that Parahumans are driven to conflict. Therefore they are being modified by their powers.
    Therefore, as soon as it became apparent that Dr Mother could trigger, she should have stepped down and found someone else to lead... who did not have the capability to trigger. And if they became capable? they should have stepped down as well. etc etc.

    Doctor Mother leading the group was one thing they (almost) got right.
