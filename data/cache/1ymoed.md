## [RT] Just finished 'The Stars, Like Dust' by Isaac Asimov - anyone else think it qualifies?

### Post:

I was not that impressed to start with but I just didn't realise that it's actually a fairly decent 'mystery' sort of story, not so dissimilar from what I imagine Sherlock Holmes is like. Wikipedia labels it as a 'whodunit'.

Anyone else read it and think it fits within our budding new genre?
