## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  Every person in the world has a power. If they think about another specific person, they give that person a very slight headache. If only one person is thinking of you, it's so slight you wouldn't even notice it. But if ten people think about you at once, you can feel the slight headache. A hundred people at once and it's annoying. A thousand people and it's a full blown headache that makes it hard to concentrate. Ten thousand and you're in constant pain, you can still walk around and do basic things like eat, but it's impossible to think about anything difficult. A hundred thousand and it's debilitating, all you can do is lie on the ground in pain. A million and you're unconscious. Ten million and you basically die instantly.

  The type of thought doesn't matter, as long as you're thinking of them the effect happens. You also don't need to know their name, or even really anything about them. If they use a fake name, it still applies. Or if they are referred to with a title. Something generic doesn't work, "the person who killed my parents" wouldn't. But "the general commanding the army who killed my parents" would.

  This doesn't just happen overnight, but has been the state of the world throughout recorded history. Leaders are impossible. Once a few thousand people know about them, they get crippled by daily headaches. Widespread sharing of ideas is also impossible. Something like "the author of this book" is sufficient to trigger the condition, so a book that's printed a bunch would get the author killed.

  How does society develop? Are there still cities like we know them? How would someone or a group of someone's rule without being crippled?

  Alternatively, what would happen if this started overnight in our modern world?

    If those number of people have to be thinking of someone simultaneously, I think you could make a society function. If enough people are thinking about a group of people, does the effect split between them? Because books could be authored by multiple authors to keep the effect down.  Humanity would be split into City States of limited populations, with limited information sharing between their populaces. Scientific knowledge could be shared, because scientists/engineers make up only a small percentage of the population, but cultural information like novels and music would be really limited. The city states would be ruled by councils of people, each presiding over a smaller slice of the city, coordinated by a higher level council for the entire region. Any edicts or laws are shared to the population over the course of days, so that the number of people thinking about the council at one time is reduced. The exact details of the governance are kept secret, so that control from the higher levels are always thought to come from the lowest level, so that the higher up people don't die.

    Children are taught to never think of the author of a work, and all factual knowledge is written to remove any humanization. The reading is dry, but it allows for knowledge to be shared. Psychology never really gets off the ground, because no one wants to participate in a study that could mean perpetual headaches and potential death.

    Actually, cultural stuff could still be shared. Van Gogh, for example, was never famous in life, but his paintings became priceless years after his death, when people saw them. Artists and authors could only share their works locally when they're alive, but after their death they could be shared everywhere. This would likely lead to a conservative society, because classics are the main works that people read, and new works dealing with modern issues are extremely slow to spread.

    War between these isolated city states could be common, although it might be dampened by being able to remotely assassinate pro-war people in other cities. Unless both sides want to go to war, in which case war becomes completely inevitable, killing people in other cities is a matter of sharing their name to your own people who want peace. It would be an interesting dynamic.

    If this effect appeared in modern times, society immediately collapses as anyone of influence almost immediately dies, and the people who realize what's going on won't share what they discover because they will be killed for sharing the knowledge, since the cause of why so many people in power are dying would be huge news. The world would regress and decline until the society I outlined above could be proposed without the proposer dying.
    ```

    - u/Watchful1:
      ```
      I think in my original idea the effect would not happen at all if you were thinking about a group of people. So a council would work fine. But it would have to be a true council, cause if there was an internal leader who led votes or was the deciding vote all the time, someone thinking about "the person who did this" would end up targeting them. It would be interesting if the effect was shared equally. You would need larger and larger councils to govern larger and larger groups. And they would still be vulnerable to attacks from rival cities.

      I also considered having only negative thoughts cause the effect, so harmless thoughts wouldn't. Or even having positive thoughts negate the effect in equal measure to the number of negative ones.
      ```

      - u/sicutumbo:
        ```
        Decentralized command would be the name of the game. If a thousand people thinking about you at once is treated as an occasional occupational but not life threatening hazard, a group of 20 people could be the council for a group of 50,000, because it's really unlikely that most of the people in such a subdivision would be thinking about the council simultaneously. You wouldn't get cities the size of IRL ones, but you would get things that are recognizably cities rather than small towns, since the subdivisions wouldn't necessarily need to be geographically isolated. Higher level councils could decide on broad goals, like "improve education" or "more healthcare", while the lower level ones make specific policy like budgets and individual laws.

        I don't think that having groups be immune from the effect would be interesting. You would just have groups of the minimum immune size replace what individual people do IRL. If the minimum size to be immune to the effect is 3, then people elect groups of 3 people as the leader rather than 1.

        The effect would make alliances incentivized. You REALLY want your neighboring cities to be friendly with you. Not doing so means sporadic assassinations of the people that they dislike most. Collectivism would be the dominant ideology, with individualism and capitalism being extremely unstable. Lethal force would be just too easy, and too hard to control. Just send a few thousand letters to random people with some cash telling them to think of someone at a predetermined time. Digital age information transfer would make it even easier, just text them instead, or put a message on TV.
        ```

    Everything would be produced anonymously and also by groups. Rulers would rule in groups so people think of the group not an individual ruler

  You are given the following mission, along with another, randomly chosen human:

  >Exactly [X time] from today, you and the other person who got these instructions must both be in the same location (within 1m of each other). If you are, you will both be rewarded handsomely. If you aren't, you and everyone you know will be tortured and then killed. You have been given the equivalent of $[Y] USD cash in your local currency to achieve this.

  What is your strategy? 

  Choose your difficulty:

  - 6 months and $10,000
  - 48 hours and $10,000
  - 6 months and $0
  - 48 hours and $0

  You know nothing about your counterpart, except that they were given the instruction in their native language, they are between the ages of 18 and 60, and their IQ is above 70.

  EDIT: maybe the threat of torture is going to make people focus too much on not getting tortured; instead it's Fabulous Prize Beyond Your Wildest Dreams for a win and Sad Trombone Music And A Modest Fine for a loss, if that helps you think of something other than *murdering everyone you've ever met before the genie tortures them*.

      I think heading to the city nearest the centre average of humanity is better than most populous. Most populous changes and is debatable. Something with a lot of flights like London is better too.

      Anyway you're fucked because your compatriot will be too poor to get far from their location and if you don't know who they are you won't even be able to get to them in time

    Randomly chosen human? What if it is literally impossible for you to meet up in 48 hours? E.g., if the randomly chosen human is an astronaut in space, or a tribal villager in the middle of nowhere who doesn't even know civilization exists, or someone stranded on a deserted island or stuck in a collapsed cave? Or worse, someone in a coma or about to die?

    The mission is especially cruel because it's going to be nigh impossible to convince everyone you know that they are about to be tortured and killed in 48 hours, and should commit suicide before then. You would have no choice but to murder them to save them from torture, and even then it is difficult to kill everyone you know within 48 hours.

      Geez, cyanide pills and mass murder: you munchkinry friends are a crazy bunch. If it makes you engage with the problem more, nix the torture/murder part and instead put a more Wholesome But Still Terrible consequence.

      Assume that the evil force messing with you is playing reasonable fair in that it's physically possible for you to meet in 48 hours (i.e. not in a coma about to die, stranded on an island, or in space). But nobody's got immortality because of it or anything.

      So, going through your questions:

      - astronaut: no

      - tribal villager: yes, because they can get to Tokyo airport in 48 hours if they wanted to, and $10k would give them the means; you'd have to hope your villager would suddenly be motivated to work out how big the world is

      - deserted island: no if we're talking *Castaway*; yes if we're talking *Survivor*

      - collapsed cave: no

      - coma / about  to die: no; I'd assume a coma patient would not be able to get an IQ score of 70 in a comatose state (which I guess would automatically rule out anyone who is asleep being offered the deal, so I will quickly state that the deal was offered to you in the middle of the night and the Mysterious Force woke you up to do so, just to demonstrate you can't use timezones to narrow things down)

        *Imagines 10 tons of meat materializing in front of a tribal villager.* That's local currency for people that still barter goods >\_<. Good luck carrying that out of the wilderness and exchanging that for a plane ticket. 

        Also, even if by some miracle they arrive at Tokyo airport, there's still no way for them to get within 1m of me except by pure chance, since they wouldn't understand the language of any sign I hold up, nor would I understand their tribal languages. Unless the Mysterious Force has a unique avatar I can draw on my sign.

        > Geez, cyanide pills and mass murder: you munchkinry friends are a crazy bunch. If it makes you engage with the problem more, nix the torture/murder part and instead put a more Wholesome But Still Terrible consequence. 

        The reason we're thinking about failure is because this mission is really hard if the other person doesn't have internet. Other than hoping for a miracle like happening to choose the same location to be at after exactly 48 hours, and even then the 1m restriction makes that exceedingly unlikely. Though I suppose, we could try something clever about the 1m restriction: Graft tons of extra skin onto yourself, in long strings that you can drag around. Lay down massive trails of skin and hope that the other person is within 1m of your skin strings.

          OK, let's do this. It's dried meat for ease of transport.

          I'm one of the Sentinelese, who are not only an uncontacted tribe, but they're doing everything in their power to remain so. 

          One gimme: my mate Greg speaks another, nearby language to a small degree. Very few people except probably for the Sentinelese live in completely monolingual bubbles so you gotta give me that gimme.

          "Those people who come sometimes, the ones we keep killing for $reason, there's a lot more of them then there are of us, aren't there? And I've just gone and asked everyone else on this island and none of them got the offer, and I would notice if someone got a huge amount of dried meat. So I guess I've got to get out of here. Greg, I'll give your wife a month's supply of meat if you come with me, since you grew up on a neighboring island until you were 6 and still remember some of the local language there. Good? Good. Let's go. We'll take as much meat as we can carry, that should be enough to get to any of these local islands, which for all I know could be the only place people live."

          ---

          "Greg, is he telling the truth? The Earth can't have *that* many people on it. Okay, where do most of them live? 'Chi-na', never heard of it. Okay, let's go there. Wait, they're saying that people won't take dried meat? But it's really good meat! Better than fish, I think it's from one of those animals that washes to shore sometimes. Okay. What do people take? Coloured bits of paper? I hate these people and their crazy superstitions but let's do it. Will they exchange the coloured paper for some of the meat I left back home? I don't trust this coloured paper idea so I'd want to keep the rest of it. Coo, they will if we promise to escort them because our island tends to shoot visitors? That's fair enough. Tell them we'll need to do it afterwards, we only have 36 hours and it'll take too long to row - what the fuck is that thing? They say that can get to our island in twenty minutes? OK, but that's only because I don't want everyone I know to get horribly tortured."

          ---

          "Cool, so, Greg, can you have them take us to this China place? Wait they are telling us we need to fly like a bird? Oh god in one of those horrible metal things we keep shooting? I don't like this. But I'll sacrifice myself for my family if it comes to that. Let's go. What, we need another person with us? They speak *another* language? What do we need three languages for? This is stupid."

          ---

          "So, this China place we're going to - very comfortable seats, by the way - where do most of the people live? Oh, the most important city is a place called Beijing? Let's go there, then. Oh, that's where this thing is taking us? Really convenient. Oh, it's a building that is full of people from all over the world who have just arrived? That sounds like my sort of place. If the other person doesn't live here, they'll find us, right?"

          "You know what Stacy, I thought this was going to be impossible - I mean, even if they thought to go to Beijing international airport, we'd never find them enough to get within 1m of them - but there's two guys here dressed in loincloths with a huge pile of meat in front of them, glaring at everyone."

  Every human on the planet is suddenly replaced with an identical copy of you, each copy indistinguishable from you in your current state. Some fudging is involved in cases where your copy would be in a different position or velocity than you (e.g. sitting down in a car while you are standing up at home). Clothes and protective equipment are resized to fit the copy so it's unlikely anyone will die immediately, but the death toll will probably begin to rise quickly after a few seconds (car crashes, power failure, dangerous environments, etc.). 

  Some possible variations to this scenario:
  - People are replaced not instantly but gradually over time.
  - You know in advance/are the one who instantiates the change. How do you plan for this scenario given a day, month, year, decade, etc.?
  - Only people's minds are replaced, but not their bodies (as closely as a mind can be without replacing genetic information, meaning that some people may initially have your memories, skills, and personality but develop radically differently over time) 

  How do you make the most out of this scenario or any of the variations?

    "Okay fuck, it's dark, is there a cellphone in my pocket? Oh, a flashlight, that'll work. Okay, there's the steering wheel-like thingy, there's the throttle, there's the horizon indicator, level, good - thank god everything is in English - but what the fuck is this TFC knob? STD? RST? CTR? Hold on, where's the fuel gauge? Speed, altitude, hydraulic pressure, dammit copilot's stuff is the same, where the fuck is the fucking fuel gauge?! VOR, ADF? Heard about that, no idea how to actually use it. Seriously, this is not cool, where in the everloving fuck is the goddamn fuel gauge?! I'm gonna die. Wait, there's a button there that says fuel. Oh my god. What happens if I push it? Okay, there's a button near it that says gear, does it possibly dump the fuel? Not gonna press it to find out."

    "Oh my god." *Pauses.* "I don't even know how to ask air traffic control for help. What if I'm fucking air traffic control too?" *Pauses again.* "Okay dude, go tell the others to start making calls if they can, see if they can reach someone with an internet connection to find some instructions for us."

    "It'll be tricky. I heard a few of them saying their phones were locked and the language appeared to be Chinese."

    "Oh fuck."

    "Yeah."

    "Umm, alright, well then have them try to work on it, and maybe someone's phone will be unlocked and they can make a call."

    "I'm on it."

    "... okay, back to the fuel gauge. Fuck fuck fuck, not it, not it. Wait, there! Total fuel 36.3 kgs x 1000. Okay, not sure if that's a lot, but it seems to be going down very, very slowly. Alright, theoretically, this thing is on autopilot and we're headed almost straight towards an airport with a long enough runway for a skilled pilot to land on it. Just maybe not me. Let's see if I can pull up a map."

    "Hey, there's no cell service but one guy got his phone working over the in-flight wifi, called a random contact on Skype, the contact is another one of us but he has access to Google. He wants to know what type of plane we're in."

    "Oh fuck. Um, it has four engines. The fuel tank holds at least 36,300 kilograms of fuel. Fuck fuck fuck. Okay, your lanyard says Cathay Pacific on it. Ask for someone to check their tickets, maybe they can Google what flight we're on and figure out what kind of plane this is."

    "Be right back."

    "... oh fuck, we're all gonna die. Okay, map. Sweet, there it is; wait, fuck, the knob says MAP, is it an acronym or an actual map? Alright, just in case, I'll wait on that until the other Me comes back. Let's figure out the autopilot settings. What the fuck are all these fucking buttons on the ceiling? No, no, no, no, no, 'Ext pwr 1?' Does that fucking shut off the power? Oh god. Alright, no, no, no, not it, oh cool a compass, alright I give up on the ceiling shit, maybe on the front panel."

    "Okay, we got the flight number, we're looking up what kind of aircraft it is right now."

    "Good, hey, I'm trying to figure out where we are at the moment, I found this knob here that says MAP, I think it's probably safe to flick it and see if we get a map. What do y-"

    "Dude, the passengers have a display of where we are, it looked like we were over the Pacific heading towards the coast of China. I swear to god, just leave the fucking switches alone until we get more information."

      Not just at risk. If all of humanity becomes one person, the human race would almost certainly be extinct in a lifetime. There's a slim chance of avoiding extinction if the person to get copied is a reproductive-age woman with a background in assisted reproduction technology who is willing and able to use sperm from sperm banks to create viable, genetically-diverse offspring. In this case, it's conceivable that inbreeding could be avoided by producing at least multiple sequential generations as quickly as possible, before the preserved sperm loses viability, though viability loss might happen in under a year if continued electrical power cannot be maintained.

Supposing you do actually succeed in convincing someone that they are about to be replaced, you now also have to convince them that killing you won't stop them from being replaced.

  It is the morning of the 1st of June, just past midnight. You are having an incredibly vivid dream. A dark, indistinct figure has appeared before you, offering to grant you a single wish if you will compete in their "Great Game".

  The Game is this: you and 99 other people in your home town/city must fight to the death, with the last survivor being crowned the victor and awarded their one wish. An intangible sphere will enclose an area 3 miles in radius, centred right in the middle of your town/city. If you step out of this sphere, you will die. Over the next 30 days, the sphere will shrink continually, until it shrinks away to nothing at midnight on the 30th of June. Only you and your opponents will be able to percieve the sphere - to everyone else it will be completely invisible.

  Would you take the figure's offer? If so, how would you go about achieving victory over the month to come?

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    I will assume that this wish has cosmic, but finite power, you can wish for more wishes but their total power doesn't grow, and therefore your reward can be seen as a finite nonregenerating mana pool for arbitrary magic.

    Spread the word that among your wishes will be to resurrect everyone who would have wished the same for you. Arbitrary magic is quite useful for acausal trade.

    At the beginning, it is unwise to try to kill people you meet - it has a good chance of getting you killed instead, and if you succeed you're still 1 out of 99. Also modern citizens seem like their psyche might have problems with it. Teaming is OP. Try to find people who will at least pay lip service to planning to make the above wish, which shouldn't be hard, because who wouldn't?

    With luck, the team grows to encompass everyone or almost everyone, and then this is turned into a social deduction game. Good wins if the town can agree on one trustworthy person to make the wish, and a system of exiling people that does not lead to anarchy before the game is over.
