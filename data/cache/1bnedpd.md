## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  For those of you who liked MoL and like time loop stories in general, I would like to recommend [The Years of Apocalypse](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/81002/the-years-of-apocalypse-a-time-loop-progression). I've never been able to find something that scratched that MoL itch for me until this. I found it on the 40th page of royalroad ongoing stories list, so it is currently a little known gem and has the potential to become one of the top stories.

  It is set in a similar setting to MoL, which is a magical academy, and things diverge swiftly from there.

  The story is set during the tail end of a magical industrial revolution, probably some time analogous to late 19th century in our history. At the current point in time, the mages (called Arcanists) have figured out how to build magical steam engines and mine the magical coal (that comes from the fossils of magical creatures). The magic and the role of a mage is becoming something industrialized, instead of being something only nobles and extremely wealthy could learn.

  Enter Mirian, who is our protagonist. She wants to become an artificer to make money, and also because she is good at the theory and mathematical aspects of magic.

  She is in the middle of her final year before graduation, and we start by going through a month of her school life. In the last few days, city she is in gets invaded by a close ally of her country for seemingly no reason. She dies, and thus starts the time loop.

  It has been pretty great so far, and in my opinion the overarching mystery has been better done than MoL. There are whispers from elder gods, unexplainable nightmares that hint at something really horrible going on behind the scenes. Characters act rationally, and they get slowly explored through each subsequent loop by our MCs different interactions with them.

  Anyone who liked MoL will most likely enjoy this story as well. I personally liked it enough to sub to author's patreon for advance chapters.

    I second this recommendation, it certainly scratches the same itch as MoL. 

    My only complaint is that the first 10 chapters are a bit of a slog to get through. I understand the need for world building and to establish a baseline for loop changes but the early chapters could definitely use an editing pass. However, the story picks up rapidly once the looping begins and is worth reading for any fan of MoL.
    ```

    ```
    Thanks, I could use a good time loop story right now.
    ```

  - u/GeneratedSymbol:
    ```
    Thanks for the rec, I've read up to chapter 6. The loop hasn't begun yet, which I enjoy, the base timeline has to be established first, and the world building is interesting.

    One thing that's disappointing to me however, is the magic system. So far it seems everything is magic item crafting, magic item using, or spellcasting similar to 5th edition D&D ritual casting. And the spells are extremely limited. The MC wants to repair a pipe, but she can only find spells for Repair Page, Repair Cloth, and Repair Pen. She wants to dry her bed sheets and her friend has to cast Heat Water several times. I mean, D&D cantrips have these spells beat in both power and versatility.

    Of course there's nothing even slightly wrong with that from a literary point of view, but it really hampers the emotional appeal of a progression fantasy story.
    ```

    - u/suddenly_lurkers:
      ```
      Without getting into spoilers, later on there are examples of magic that are both more powerful and more flexible, as well as methods to dynamically generate spells on the fly. The hole seems like it will be a fun way to illustrate the MC getting progressively better at magic as the loop count increases.
      ```

  - u/xjustwaitx:
    ```
    Thanks, it's great
    ```

  - u/cultureulterior:
    ```
    Yes, this is good.
    ```

  - u/ThePhrastusBombastus:
    ```
    Sounds promising, though that's definitely AI generated placeholder cover art, right? I'm having trouble pointing to anything conclusively, but I'm getting that vibe from it.
    ```

    - u/megazver:
      ```
      Most covers on RR are AI-generated these days.
      ```

    - u/Dragongeek:
      ```
      The most "reliable" way I've found to identify quality AI art of this type is to look for "intentionalness". Real human artists working on a detail piece generally add things to the drawing for a reason because they are trying to tell the viewer something through their artwork, and not just because they can. 

      In this cover, there are multiple elements which don't really have any obvious reason for existing:

      - Random fire swirl thing on the upper right edge
      - Random shards of something in the upper left of the image
      - Detail of sewing on the character's shoulder pad don't really make sense
      - The hair is not drawn in the way that I think a human would

      Beyond that, there are some more obvious AI artwork indicators, like the nonsensical-ness of the architecture in the background buildings.
      ```

    - u/SpeakKindly:
      ```
      You'd at least need to spend 5 minutes in Photoshop to get that title in there with a glow effect - unless DALL-E has learned to spell "apocalypse" since the last time I checked.
      ```

      - u/ThePhrastusBombastus:
        ```
        I mostly just want to confirm if the giant purple orb in the sky and the sun-mace thing are plot-relevant or not.
        ```

        - u/Naitra:
          ```
          Giant purple orb is definitely plot relevant
          ```

  ```
  [Zeroth Moment: My Cheat Skill Is Stupid, So I'll Just Ignore It](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/70672/zeroth-moment-my-cheat-skill-is-stupid-so-ill) is an interesting subversion of the isekai/portal fantasy genre that I've been reading the past few weeks. The protagonist is an F-rank old guy with a shitty power summoned to a very typical isakai situation, ie demon lord, medieval kingdom, anime typical Japanese teenagers summoned to be heroes, genuinely exponential power scaling, etc. The MCs only advantage is his (C-rank!) intelligence and resourcefulness, which makes for an ideal rational fic protagonist imo. 

  Everything is foreshadowed and carefully constructed, to the point I think it's possible to predict all the twists and reveals in the plot with the information provided. Every weird or arbitrary bit of worldbuilding either makes sense, or is a clue towards solving the mysteries at the heart of the plot. There are quite a few asspulls and idiotball moments that turned out to make sense in hindsight. It's pretty impressive.
  ```

  - u/Dufaer:
    ```
    Seconded. I love these stories, where the nature of the world is a central mystery.
    ```

    - u/CellWithoutCulture:
      ```
      It often should be! I get annoyed by characters who get sent to another world, and don't have curiosity about the fact that souls, other worlds, gods exist. Maybe they should find out more about that, instead of just seeking a nicer sword.
      ```

  - u/Darkpiplumon:
    ```
    Maybe it's just the early chapters, but I found the setting shallow and the MC dumb in an "a bit above average American in his forties" way. I assume it gets better?

    Maybe I'm just too tired of normal Isekai anime tropes, I don't know.
    ```

    - u/GlueBoy:
      ```
      The story is very consciously a deconstruction of the light novel isekai genre, so if something makes no sense it's either riffing on a LN trope, there's more depth to it, or both. I found it only really clicked for me at "Interlude: War Room" (end of book 1), which is a glimpse into the conflict that's going on in the ~~background~~foreground, as well as the absurd powerscale of the world. 

      Mild spoiler: the demon king faction >!is extremely competent.!<

  Wanted to drop [Phytozoology by dakeyras](https://archiveofourown.org/collections/RatFicEx2023/works/50088694) which was written for the /r/Rational writing fest last year and did not get mentioned in last weekâ€™s Pokemon dominated thread!
  ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    Good rec, thank you! Exploring the nitty-gritty of how research works in a pokemon world was really fun.
    ```

  - u/DakeyrasWrites:
    ```
    Checking in a little later to say thanks for the rec and I'm glad you enjoyed it!

  If anyone have any recommendations that are similar to [Super Minion](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion) or [Shade Touched](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34473/shade-touched) I would really appreciate to hear about it. For the people that have not read the stories above they feature a smart non-human protagonist.Thanks in advance.
  ```

  - u/TheAnt88:
    ```
    I only have one. The Iron Teeth: A Goblin's Tale by ClearMadness that has the complete 3 books on Amazon but is still available on Royal Road. Follows a small and weak city goblin that is recruited by a group of human bandits and how he survives and evolves. Grounded with good worldbuilding and Black Nail the goblin is very amusing to read as a protagonist as while he is intelligent and a natural assassin, He is still a goblin with very different priorities than a human.
    ```

    - u/Squidsatiny:
      ```
      Thank you for the fantastic suggestion, unfortunately I have already read "[The Iron Teeth: A Goblin's Tale](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/4293/the-iron-teeth-a-goblins-tale)" but it really fits my request and is an great example of it.
      ```

  - u/Naitra:
    ```
    [The Shining Wyrm](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/81611/the-shining-wyrm) is pretty good. It's a slice of life/progression novel that features some heavy themes in the later arcs. The MC is a dragon that was raised by humans.

    I personally like this author due to one of his previous works, which was a great example of xenofiction. He is pretty good at writing from a non-human POV.
    ```

    ```
    Another throwback is [Summon Imp](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/33295/summon-imp).
    ```

- u/Jason_Cliff:
  ```
  I found one with a really interesting magic system: The Errant Mage, where mages get some or multiple innate control over certain elements or substance - Paper, Silk, water, lighting, crystal, glass, scent, light, stone, solar etc. It was fun seeing how even paper and silk can be used for combat if you think creatively enough. Overall, it was a fun read.
