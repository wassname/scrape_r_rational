## [FF] [Bst] Trichotomy of Purity: Essence, Thought, Form

### Post:

I had the wonderful thought, after finishing my third reread of HPMOR and with the upcoming release of the new expansion, of writing a Starcraft rational fanfiction. I was considering who the main character would be, between the several possible characters, and came to the conclusion that Sarah Kerrigan and her story arc are perfect for the trope.

I wanted to soundboard, and discuss my current ideas with people, familiar with the subject matter or otherwise, before I get started... Just to check and see if I'm going to hit any too-obvious pitfalls, so I can avoid them before. 

If someone needs or wants a rundown of the story as it actually is, I can provide that- would prefer to avoid typing that up if I can at all, since I'm looking to try my hand at NaNo for the second time and need to save all the time I can for the rework of my novel with that purpose.

  I'm interested. I've always loved Kerrigan's character and the arc it takes in SC1, and I don't like the path Blizzard went down with her in SC2.

    My thought was to build my universe with similar ideas as to the overmind/Amon dynamic, and how kerrigan plays in there, but with several liberties taken as to the motivation of all involved, and their powers of rationalism. Start with Kerrigan as a ghost, and her interaction with certain less-changed characters (leaving raynor be, making mengsk smarter but sub-level-3) and then building from there into her integration into the swarm, and how she responds to that and moves from there.

    The current list of character changes I would make, based on my current thoughts that I've had today, would be to keep Mengsk mostly the same, as above- don't touch Raynor, he's a perfect 'norm' to play against- and push up Overmind/Amon/Tass/Zera... And play the game from there.

      That works for me.

      One thing that bugged me about SC2 is how Kerrigan seems perfectly fine with reverting to her human form in HotS, and how she only desired to switch back in order to kill Mengsk. She should be more conflicted about it.

      Also the whole prophecy thing is bullshit. I don't know why Metzen has to shove it into a scifi story.
