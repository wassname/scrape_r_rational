  I really liked this chapter. Just felt nice.

  I eagerly wait for the new chapter every week. I really like this magic system. It's so well put together and thought out.

  But man, the writing is not very good. All the characters have the same voice and the same personality. And the dialogue is so cringey and juvenile. 

  But damn that magic system is so good.

    Same
    The magic system is all that keeps me from dropping it and I realize the same is true for a lot of webnovels and light novels.

      ```
      most web/light novels are such hot fucking garbage. even most of the 'highly rated' ones. if the story isn't written by Wildbow, Alexander Wales, or ErraticErrata then there's a >90% chance it's almost unreadable.
      ```

      - u/Docobonbon:
        ```
        When I said webnovels I meant the Korean or Chinese or Japanese ones. I don't disagree with you on the western ones completely but they have higher highs and that's good enough for me. 
        There are, however, writers on par with the ones you mentioned and they mold my opinion of westerns into being good.

  So close to patreon for those eight chapters
  ```

  - u/Melanthor:
    ```
    I am a patron and I can promise you the next 8 chapters are definitely worth it.
    ```

      ```
      I caved and I definitely loved them

  Spoiler for people who want to know how much longer Rain is stuck in the barrier (+padding I won't give it away by charachter count) >!He unlocked it!<
  ```

  - u/gryfft:
    ```
    >!Also as a computer engineer I'm pretty pleased with the representation of the terminal! I'm disappointed it wasn't unixlike, but I still enjoyed him having to build his own terminal emulator from the ground up, haha.!<
    ```

    - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
      ```
      >!Come on, it the "more Zork than Unix" line more than made up for it. It's the best line in the book so far!<

      >!I really liked the way the obelisk did the work for him, clearly it has to work hard to adapt to everyone's unique interface. I think that made a lot more sense than him building a terminal all by himself!<

        >!Ahkchyuaylly, MacOS *is* Unix.  At least, it's close enough that the basic shell commands are the same.!<
        ```

    - u/Raszhivyk:
      ```
      >!I wonder how he's going to handle the soul fragmentation and paling integrity once he's in the state of mind to tackle that. Will the terminal be able to direct him, or is going to basically have to use it as a check while makes his own ad hoc defragmenter? Plus that whole Core Level: 18 Error Threshold thing proves he's not actually level 18. But whether him displaying as 18 is due to his own preexisting assumptions about how all this works or due to something inherent to the world is still up in the air. Personally I would find it hilarious if this entire time all he had to was "Free his mind" and make some alternative leveling macros to bypass the blue restriction!<
      ```

      - u/Luck732:
        ```
        >!I'm pretty certain the Core Level: 18 Error Threshold just means level 18 isn't high enough to safely use the terminal. After all, in the very next line it says "Core threshold not met."!<
        ```

        - u/Raszhivyk:
          ```
          >!That makes sense, I don't why I didn't realize that when a previous line about system compatibility used the same language!<
          ```
