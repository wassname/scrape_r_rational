## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  [Anti meme]: This power causes anything that contains information of the function of this power, with the exception of the holder of this power, to be destroyed.

  Some examples of it in action:

  1) A recording from a camera that is saved to a hard drive. The hard drive is fine but the video file is desolved into a static mess.

  2) The holder writes down their power into a diary. The ink runs into the paper makeing the words illegible.

  3) Some Internet nerd comes up with a power that erases all information about it's self. Even though the information is hypothetical that is an enough for the power to trigger and the Internet nerd mind is destroyed, rendering them comatosed. 

  4) A super intelligent AI looks though all the information on the internet and figures out that this power exist. It crashes and it's engineers are forced to reset the servers to the last back up a week earlier to get it to work again.

  5) The power info is spoken. The sound waves travel enough for the information to be transmitted but they start to experience interference and become illegible much sooner than you would expect.


  How would you use this power as serial killer if a group of 5 superheros, 1 of whom was imume to your power was investigating you?

  If you were the super hero who was imune to this power and we're beginning to suspect what it was how would you go about stopping the serial killer while protecting your friends?
  ```

  - u/Silver_Swift:
    ```
    From the perspective of the serial killer:

    How you take out the heroes depends a lot on the specifics of situation and the powers of the heroes (there are a lot of situations where a gun is the most more appropriate way of killing them), but if you have to use your powers the safest way is probably to walk up to there loved ones and explain your powers to them. Then leave plenty of clues lying around about your powers so the non-immune heroes start to figure it out on their own. 

    You could create two audio files that when played simultaneously sound like an audio file that describes your powers, if that works you have an untraceable way of killing anyone you can get to listen to it. That's probably unnecessarily convoluted though.

    From the perspective of the immune hero:

    Instruct your fellow heroes in anti-memetic tactics. Explain to them that your current opponent is dealing with memetic hazards and give them the choice of following your orders blindly or take their loved ones and dissappear until this is all over. If any of them stay, keep any information on the case need-to-know and only use the other heroes if you need the muscle or if they have relevant powers. Get new cellphones and only let them give the number to you (and maybe each other, depending on how much you trust them to not exchange information on the case). Then get each hero to find an out of the way hiding place that is far away from other people and doesn't have internet access where they can stay until you have done the legwork on finding the killer (or until you need their powers for something). 

    Any further plans depend largely on the specifics of the situation.
    ```

    - u/RetardedWabbit:
      ```
      The audio combination is a great idea! You could also apply this to other media, like making a crossword describing the anti-meme to kill all who solve it!

      Instructing your fellow heros on anti-memetic tactics is a fast track to them dying from it, since they will be trying to figure out why you want them to do this and for what threat, and if they guess it they die.

      I don't think cellphones are a threat though since the info should destroy itself on the way to them on the multiple steps and conversions sounds go through before it gets to the receiver.
      ```

      - u/CreationBlues:
        ```
        This is a pretty basic anti-memetic device. Does that mean on the day that the power activates a bunch of people who'd already thought of this drop dead, with a bunch of media (say, something similar to the scp wiki) suddenly dropping off the face of the earth? How much information needs to be known about the power? For example, does the information that sound degrades quickly with distance need to be known, does the information that there a 1) unique 2) human immune to the power need to be known? This is in contrast to, for example, a cult that can induct immunity, or an intelligent octopus that holds immunity.
        ```

  - u/corneliuspudge:
    ```
    Does the serial killer know the powers of the heroes? I would absolutely try to incorporate that aspect into my plans. Especially if the hero that's immune to my powers lacks enhanced durability. I'll carve the truth of my powers (in what is my pre-planned, shortest possible sentence that would result in an activation) in a crane or a load bearing wall or something. I imagine the structure would begin to decay around my message, so if done right, I could collapse something onto them, as part of a plan. Scrawl the sentence in big letters with the exception of punctuation or something, wait for the right time, dot my I's and cross my T's and let the thing begin to tumble. 

    If I were a hero beginning to suspect someone of having an antimemetic power that didn't work on me? First, buy a bunch of goldfish and establish the vaguest possible description of the power I could without killing the target. The  I'd let that shit be known, inasmuch as I could. Go on tv, declare myself Scorching Fire's (or whoever's) personal nemesis and completely untouchable, bent on bringing them in, caution everyone to report them, etc. Try to shape the public narrative and eventual confrontation. Assure my friends and fellow heroes to the extent I could and have them wait in the wings when the time comes, with the knowledge that they should be able to handle any direct confrontation so long as they cover their ears and only communicate with signals, etc.

    What's a short bitstring that gets censored? Does any program that counts 0,1,2... crash once it hits the number corresponding to that bitstring? Does a short crashing program count as a description of the power and get censored?

  **Mistborn Munchkinry Miniseries Part 13: Cadmium**

  Ok, week thirteen of the mistborn munchkinry miniseries, for a general overview of the magic system, see [part one](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9zz4sa/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ead595h/). I strongly recommend reading the first part of that comment if you weren't here for the past weeks and aren't familiar with the mistborn setting. Parts 2 through 11 can be found here: [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a23pe3/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eauwn90/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a4be9x/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ebcx4eg/), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a6ftyl/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ebuo08h/), [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a8lgsu/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ecbqhr8/), [6](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/af85cz/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/edw9q7a/), [7](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ahmsgc/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eefzs0m/), [8](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ak1kjr/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ef0o7jj/), [9](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ametuf/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eflf195/), [10](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ar9jrc/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eglnl2s/), [11](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/atwc86/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eh4l3jc/), [12](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/atwc86/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eh4l3jc/)


  *Spoiler note*: I will avoid things that I consider excessive spoilers, but the exact workings of the magic system are moderate spoilers themselves, so if you intend to read the books and are sensitive to spoilers you should probably skip this one.

  This weeks metal is cadmium. As always we're interested in what a cadmium twinborn compounder can do, both here on earth (where they are the only one with this powerset) and in Era 2 Scadrial.

  **Allomancy**

  When burning cadmium a translucent bubble pops up around the allomancer. Inside that bubble time passes slower than normal. From the perspective of people outside the bubble the allomancer and anything caught in the bubble with them appear frozen, while from inside the bubble the outside world rushes by incredibly quickly.

  The allomancer can control the size of the bubble up to a maximum size based on how powerful they are. For an average allomancer, the maximum size for cadmium bubbles is roughly enough to envelop a large building. The extent to which time is slowed down in the bubble also differs per allomancer, but the effects are quite dramatic, 20 to 30 times slower than normal is not unreasonable.

  A bubble cannot be moved once it's created, it anchors itself to the nearest object of sufficient mass. Typically this is the ground on which the allomancer is standing (in which case the bubble maintains its position relative to the planet as it rotates around it's axis/the sun), but sufficiently large vehicles can also be used to anchor a time bubble to, an allomancer burning cadmium while inside a train will see their time bubble stay in place relative to the train, rather than the ground. When the allomancer stops burning cadmium the bubble immediately seizes to exist and it takes a few seconds before another bubble can be created.

  Small objects like bullets can pass through the edge of the bubble if they move quickly enough, but are knocked wildly off course in the process. Larger objects pop the bubble entirely if they move through its edge. Objects are always effected by the time dilation entirely or not at all, depending on if more of their mass is inside or outside the bubble. Whether something constitutes one object or multiple depends on how it is presented in the cognitive realm, which roughly corresponds to how most people would view it. Moving objects that cross the perimeter of the bubble for longer periods of time (eg. a stick that you wiggle back and forth while it is crossing the edge) pop the bubble.

  The edge of a time bubble absorb some, but not all, of the sound going through it. Sounds from inside the bubble are almost completely inaudible to the outside world as they are dampened by crossing into the bubble as well as spread out over a much longer time than before. If you amplified it to a reasonable volume you would still only hear random noise, though, as the same effect that knocks bullets off course also distorts sounds.

  Inside the bubble sounds from the outside world will be a constant, white noise hum (being amplified and compressed by time dilation and then mangled and dampened by passing through the edge of the bubble).

  Light passes through time bubbles unhindered and the magic compensates for the fact that fewer photons move from inside the bubble to the outside world than vice versa as well as for any redshifting or blueshifting those photons would undergo. The result is that both sides of the bubble see the other side completely as normal, other than the fact that time is sped up/slowed down.

  **Feruchemy**

  Feruchemically, cadmium stores breath. While storing breath, the feruchemists body needs more oxygen than normal, leading to rapid breathing and the feruchemist feeling like they're constantly out of breath.

  When tapping the resulting metalmind the stored oxygen is released back into the blood of the feruchemist, allowing them to survive without needing to breathe. In addition, tapping more breath allows the feruchemist to supply more oxygen to their body, leading to minor increases in stamina and physical strength.
  ```

  - u/LazarusRises:
    ```
    I love cadmium, such a niche power but so useful in certain situations--aided by the fact that it burns so slowly.

    Recently I had the idea of a research enclave contained within a large cadmium bubble, either made by a few powerful Pulsers or with strategic use of ettmetal generators. They'd have to be ok with leaving the outside world behind, so I'm imagining an Anathem-style monastery where the scientists study any phenomena that they want to watch over a long timescale. For instance, set up shop within view of an interesting geological formation and spend 40 subjective years studying it while several hundred pass in real time, or set up outside a city and have regular census data mailed to the bubble for a long-term demographics project.

    Also great for long travel, boring waiting rooms,  etc. I imagine an airplane with a First Class section covered by a cadmium bubble. The rich might also pay Pulsers to extend their functional lifespan.
    ```

    - u/SpeakKindly:
      ```
      It's the economy class section of the airplane that could use a cadmium bubble most. If a 3-hour flight becomes 10 minutes long, well - there's a lot of conditions people will put up with for 10 minutes but not for 3 hours. You could just about stack them up like sardines. (And you definitely don't need to give them snacks.)

      Come to think of it, cadmium also drastically reduces the need for food, drink, and many other supplies during long trips of all kinds.
      ```

  - u/Silver_Swift:
    ```
    So, time bubbles, arguably allomancy's most physics breaking feature. I'm sure there are tons of edge cases that I missed in the above description, powers that mess with time tend to not work nicely when you start examining them in any kind of detail.

    Speculation notes:

    * The stuff about how sound interacts with time bubbles is extrapolation from the fact that bendalloy bubbles cause a noise to be heard in the outside world (which can be masked by coughing, so it's not super loud).
    * The 20 to 30 times number is not really based on anything other than the fact that it seems to line up roughly with the fight against >!Miles!<. 	
    * As with Electrum, we don't actually have any source for what feruchemic cadmium does other than an in universe source that has proven to be unreliable.
    ```
