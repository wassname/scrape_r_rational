    I'm not big fan of Pact, but by writing quality The Wandering Inn is not in the same league as Pact.  Not that Wandering Inn is bad per se, it's just upper third of RoyalRoadL. Pact is written by real quality writer, whatever it's shortfalls are.

      That is... strange. I found the Wandering Inn's prose much more compelling at times compared to Wildbrow's stuff. The emotional scenes get me the most, and I feel the pacing is well done. Perhaps it's a matter of personal preference.

    Hmmm i really have a bone to pick with the wandering inn as in i completly hate the main characters. Canst stand them as a reader and they are annoying. Especially the runner girl but erin still comes fairly close.

    In terms of other stories i dont know if they are rational per se but

      > The Gods are Bastards ( i especially would like the opinion on this one as i would think it really fits here)

      This was one comes up every once in a while. IIRC, the author didn't set out to make it rational, but it has some characteristics of it. People tend to love it or hate it - I'm in the "love it" camp, personally. It feels like a nice contrast to a sprawling web novel like Worm, where Worm is grimdark and the characters always end up having terrible things happen to them, while TGAB is lighter and though the characters go through tough times, they usually don't end up dead or maimed. Plus the characters in TGAB are just so darn likable - even the bad guys seem somewhat relatable. 

      But TGAB does have some things I don't like too. The first few volumes just seem "OK" to me; it takes a bit to get into them. The character list keeps growing exponentially, and since characters are hardly ever killed, this means there's an ever-expanding list to keep track of. I didn't care for the second-to-most-recent volume, since I'm primarily invested in the sophomore class and not just one member of them. And since there are so many volumes and it's still being released, it's tough to remember what happened so long ago without rereading the entire series, and that takes way too long. I've also heard some complaints from people that it's "too in-your-face about feminism," which I don't agree with, but it's cropped up a few times. 

      >The Zombie Knight

      I'll admit; I read this a while back based on a number of people recommending it here and there, and I did not like it. I thought some of the issues, particularly the child abuse and depression faced by the main character, were interesting and fairly well-done; you don't usually see those issues in novels except as some background for how people overcame struggles. Whereas with Hector he was still very much facing the repercussions. So that was good. But the writing overall wasn't very good and it feels like the power system is expanded when convenient for the author. It's been a while since I caught up to the end, but last I recalled, some people could suddenly use some kind of ultra form which combined multiple powers, something that was said from the beginning to be impossible? That's kinda frustrating to me. Like, if the rule of the universe is "You only get to use one power," I'd much rather see creative uses of that one power than to suddenly introduce Super Saiyan forms. It just rubbed me the wrong way I guess.

        I've been reading the gods are bastards for some time now and even though I'm enjoying it I can't help but notice how often everyone sounds like the same.     
        Every single chapter you'll see some perfectly clear explanation of something in a way that precisely outlines everything that's going on to the readers. And those explanations always sound the same, no matter who is speaking.    It feels like the writer just decides to speak via whoever is at hand and fuck personality
        ```

      - u/IgonnaBe3:
        ```
        I need to say that i stopped reading both when i caught up to them and never restarted reading them as The zombie knight was on a LOOOOOOOOOOONG hiatus because author had a writers block and IRL shit to deal with. In terms of TGAB i just couldnt be bothered to see the new chapters. In terms of characters i agree the list is huge and you can forget some of them fairly quickly. Especially the new class was kinda meh for me. My favourite character is the bishop guy from the thieves guild/church.

        In terms of feminism it was centairly really visible, especially so if there is a religion of feminism... but otherwise it wasnt that in your face.

        In terms of the zombie knight.... typical shonen problem ...power escalation. I too would prefer if it would keep to the level of a guy in a knights armor walking down the streets. but hell...

          >Especially the new class was kinda meh for me.

          Same. I like Maureen because gnomes are awesome, but the rest just left me wishing we'd focus back on the sophomores instead.

          > My favourite character is the bishop guy from the thieves guild/church.

          Same here. Antonio Darling is like... a moral Littlefinger from Game of Thrones, with a combination Rogue and Cleric class from D&D. He's my favorite too; and I like his party members (Joseph P. Jenkins in particular is fascinating, and Brother Ingvar is intriguing too). His story, and that of the sophomore class, is what really carries the plot for me. The other story lines can be interesting, but I don't get absorbed in them as easily. 

          >In terms of the zombie knight.... typical shonen problem

          Yeah, that exactly describes my problem with it later on. Early on the writing just bothered me. IIRC, the writing for the first few chapters was basically just dialogue and no description. Even after that it feels like it focuses more on telling than showing (if that makes sense?). 

          I also had the impression that the author didn't know what he wanted to write at first, and that's why he's changing the plot. Like at the beginning, regular people didn't know servants existed. But later on we find out that there are thousands or tens or thousands around the world, some countries are run by people hundreds of years old, and they're constantly creating catastrophic events. There's NO WAY regular people wouldn't know about these folks, or not figure out that something crazy was going on. Their actions are disruptive on a transnational, if not global, scale. It's like how ridiculous Pokemon is when you start - there's no way Ash walks down the road and doesn't know what a Pidgey is. It introduces the concept to the audience through a method that makes no sense in-universe.
          ```

  I want to recommend the [Dire Saga]( https://www.amazon.com/Dire-Saga-Season-One-ebook/dp/B01N53O0W7/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1501976948&sr=8-6&keywords=dire+saga ).

  The main character is a female anti-villain Doctor Doom expy, and I for one found the series highly entertaining.

  It also explores (or at least touches on) a couple of topics that I found highly unusual, and I would love to see what the r/rational community might make of it.

  I've linked the compilation of the first three books, but the author recently published the fifth one. If he keeps up his writing speed, then the sixth one should come out early next year.

  I'm going to recommend the currently airing anime (and manga) [*Made in Abyss*](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://myanimelist.net/anime/34599/Made_in_Abyss&ved=0ahUKEwiCmpGMycDVAhVqw4MKHWHBAZYQFgiPATAb&usg=AFQjCNFRKXw5p-pJQtEr7A6aJSyaCl9Jtw). The wordbuilding/creature designs are kickass, the characters are likeable, and the plot intruiging.


  TL;DR the characters are exploring a (not quite) bottomless pit with its own bizzare flora and fauna.

  It reminds me a lot of the [*Tunnels*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnels_(novel) YA novels series, which I also reccomend.

Each video is five to ten minutes of four friends/colleagues sitting around a table talking to each other about pop culture, examining weird aspects of movies and television in a way that I would think would resonate with this subreddit.

  I recently finished reading the webcomic [Always Human](http://www.webtoons.com/en/romance/always-human/1-i-guess-thats-why-i-admire-her/viewer?title_no=557&episode_no=1). It's a lesbian romance set in a (post-singularity?) future where people use nanotech to modify their appearance. The main character gets into a relationship with a girl who has an autoimmune condition that prevents her from using mods. The romance is cute, the art is beautiful, and there's also nice music accompanying each chapter.

  I also found a funny Ore Gairu fic called [My Tinder Experience is about as Genuine as I Expected](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12596369/1/My-Tinder-Experience-is-about-as-Genuine-as-I-Expected). It's about Hikki making a Tinder account.

  So I'm here asking for some non-rational feel-good competence porn/protagonist rising high and crushing everything stories.

    I give you, anime! Btw, the English dub for all these shows are fantastic.

    I recently watched *Gurren Lagaan* and it might be just what you're looking for. It's a straightforward but totally nuts Hero's Journey epic about a kid piloting a mecha with drill-themed shapeshifting powers that's fueled by his self-confidence. It starts off as a very simple episodic adventure series, but the story goes *all the way* with its conceits and intentionally adheres to cliches like DBZ-esque escalating power levels. It's a more than a little mindless, but it works.

    If you want a straight up action show about an underdog protagonist, *My Hero Academia* gives us an intelligent and big-hearted teen becoming a superhero despite not having conventional powers. It's a bit like Worm, except that every situation turns out okay and the characters have a lot more fun. People are calling it the next Naruto and it's been a blast so far so see a distinct yet familiar take on the superhero genre from a shonen.

    If you're looking for something more subdued and relaxing, I recommend *Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid*. The protagonist is pretty damn rational, the story focuses on characters with almost familial relationships, and there's a reoccurring theme of how things could go wrong but don't. It's a slice of life show so the "rising high and crushing everything" comes in the form of achieving satisfaction in mundane life rather than from an epic adventure, but I still think it's worth checking out.

      On your recommendation, I went through the entire thing (manga, not anime, since I dislike watching things). This rules. I see why people are calling it the next Naruto; a lot of the story beats/character notes are extremely reminiscent. That said, the characters are *far* more interesting, I get the sense that the author actually has some sort of coherent worldbuilding ideas, and I love our protagonist. He's everything Gryffindor should be.

      The protagonist of MHA drove me crazy. I think he cried like 5 times in the first two episodes. Also any reasonable person would have given up on their stupid dream to become a superhero and become something useful, like a baker. Instead he's rewarded for being delusional.

        I don't *love* Midori, but I liked seeing him follow his dream because he wants to help people. Seeing him get told that he isn't cut out for it was heartbreaking, while watching him continue to try his hardest anyway and inspire others to take action felt good to watch.

        This show isn't all that rational even if the powers are consistent and the characters are clever, but I find the story it tells emotionally satisfying. Superheroes are an escapist fantasy and I like the way MHA delivers on that fantasy without coming across as pandering.

        After the first couple episodes we also see that Midori has more than just heart as an asset, he has the commitment to push himself physically, and the brains to perform complex problem-solving. He is capable of being a hero, he just wasn't given the chance to prove himself at first.

Of course, it's a show, so we know there will be a miracle, but in real life that doesn't happen. He should have been depicted pursuing some other dream and then getting wrenched back onto the path of being a superhero. That would have made me like him more.

    >Is The Games We Play good? I'm a bit wary of all The Gamer crossovers.

    I was thoroughly and absolutely addicted to the series, even though I hadn't watched/read any part of either source works at the time.  The author is a pretty good writer and the background is explained well. I wouldn't say it's rational, because the main hook are abilities that break MC's world and sort of run on narrativium, but the MC still manages to use them creatively and they don't get too broken until the end.

    >What's it current status (ongoing/dropped/finished)?

    Speaking of the end, the author's sig used to say "I got 99 stories but I've finished two!" but I don't agree with the change to "three" when the author took a break from this story. Throughout much of the story, some questions are brought up and when you expect to finally get some kind of answer, you really don't, you're just left with some wishy washy promise of maybe answers in the future and explanations of some side things that aren't really central to the plot. I'd say it's a decent halfway point but I don't see how it's an ending. The author did publish a one-chapter preview of the next "book" a few months ago but I didn't really think much of it and there hasn't been anything else since AFAIK.

    Having said all that I do recommend it and think of it as worm's little brother when it comes to the world of crackfic that I'm familiar with. Just don't go in expecting it to be rational or expecting everything to be tied up neatly in a bow at the end and I think you'll like it.

  *[A Spell for Chameleon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76664)* (the first book in [the *Xanth* series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/40498)) was somewhat interesting to read. It's based on the premise that, in a particular isolated part of the world (which looks suspiciously similar to Florida), every human is born with a supernatural power, whose potency may vary widely:  
  \- Can create a cloud of poisonous gas  
  \- Can transform a living being that he can see within six feet of himself into a different living being  
  \- Can project his voice perfectly  
  \- Can create and control storms and wind, large and small  
  \- Can create simple holograms while concentrating  
  \- Can create magnificently-detailed, semi-permanent illusions capable of fooling all the senses

  I found the setting significantly more interesting than the plot, though. I definitely can see why this book was listed in [the bibliography](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/powers/bibliography.html) for *[GURPS Powers](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/powers/)*!

    Probably one of my least favorite books of all time. Thought the plot with the woman who becomes intelligent as she becomes uglier and vice versa repellent.

      I'll clarify, though, that I found the setting more interesting than *any* of the main characters&mdash;even Trent, but *especially* Chameleon.

        You're allowed to like it. Just because the book is unenlightened doesn't say anything about you. Or much, anyway, ha.

        Still think the setting was pretty uninteresting, too, though. Not much thought of second-order effects...society didn't seem to have changed much given that everyone has magical superpowers. There's a lot better worldbuilding out there, even if you like that particular conceit.
