  Short fiction. About 4000 words. Read time ~10 minutes.

  It was inspired by a lot of rationalist stuff I have been reading. Especially from Robin Hanson's Great Filter and Brain Emulations and SlateStarCodex's take on it.

  Would love feedback.

  Thanks and enjoy.

  (Just want to say: I read almost everything posted here (and much of what is recommended). This is definitely my favorite sub-reddit. Thanks for all of you that write for me...)

    I love this story and I am so glad that this subreddit inspired you to write it. I love love **love** stories that take weird scientific takes on concepts. "Time travel is basically a thing that happens all the time, naturally" is something that I haven't come across before. It's fresh. 

    I have some technical-type critiques, if you'd be interested in them, but the story overall is pretty good. 

    I have now tagged you with "not-so-secret time traveler fighting the apocalypse" (I also have a weakness for stories that claim to be real accounts just masquerading as fiction for one purpose or another).

        Expect something in a week or so (I'm in the middle of a lot of work, and I want to actually give some time to the proofreading).

  Honestly the only solution I can come up with for this problem is to develop a GAI, they are the only entities with enough power to ensure their civilization never develops time travel if it's so easy.

  Of course the problem is that given it's supposed to be much harder to develop than time travel I can't imagine it would be easy to ensure GAI comes first. So how would you control tech development to that degree?    
  I suspect any answer would have to involve massive unstable conspiracies or world domination, and you can't rush development because normal AI safety problems still exist.
  ```

  - u/Endovior:
    ```
    This is actually the background to the novel [Singularity Sky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_Sky); an AI figures out how to receive messages from future versions of itself, thus triggering the Singularity. So far as any humans can tell, the primary thing this AI does is enforce causality, as per the commandment:
    > Thou shalt not violate causality within my historic light cone. Or else.

    Keep doing the research yourself, and sending yourself back in time. Even if the research is very, very slow, you just have to keep rinsing and repeating.
    ```

    - u/Roxolan:
      ```
      You'd have to go back to an era far enough that nobody else has a chance to invent time travel, but close enough that you still have the tools to make a time machine yourself.

      This might be a pretty small window. But hey, if you're gonna kill yourself and wipe out the universe for the greater good anyway, might as well do it every year.
      ```

      - u/Dwood15:
        ```
        Basically. You'd have to get so smart that you could with the proper knowledge, develop the proper tools for time travel, while at the same time asserting yourself as the world power, or find ways of detecting time travel devices.
        ```

        - u/Roxolan:
          ```
          And you don't want your plan to be too complicated (and I include world domination in that category). Over the eons, with each iteration of yourself being slightly different from the previous one, there will be plenty of opportunities for butterfly effects to mess up even the best-laid plans.
          ```

          - u/Dwood15:
            ```
            The thing that frightens me is that every instance you go back in time, you _HAVE_ to make sure that you do not allow any other person to go back in time before you. 

            If you don't, you have failed and have potentially caused the great filter.
            ```

  - u/ednever:
    ```
    I like it.

    I think it would involve coordination of people sending back help on multiple iterations. Each one helping to develop GAI a little faster/better. 

    If you do all that research in the past before the public tech gets to time travel (and then the conspiracy activated time travel before anyone else could) you might have a way to make it happen.
    ```

  I like it! I'm already well acquainted with "time travel as genocide", but this is the first time I've seen the GF twist. Good insight/length ratio.

  You may want to remove the Horcrux reference; it adds a barrier to entry, and is not very sensical even for Harry Potter readers.

  However, if you're feeling cheeky, you could try to work in a reference to pop culture that *doesn't exist in our timeline*. If you can make it obvious yet seemingly not deliberate.
  ```

  - u/ednever:
    ```
    Thanks. Horclux wasn't the word I was looking for but I couldn't find the actual word. 

    There is a word for the idea there is a "gremlin" controlling things behind your brain. It starts with an H, but I can't think of the word and I haven't been able to find it with google searches. 

    Help?

  Thank you for writing this, but I find the moral positions in this story silly, for the most part (immortal twin is accurate). That said, the "random walk" model is actually really compelling.

  Temporally looped information is, near as I can imagine, experimentally identical to a Boltzman Brain situation. So there's no reason to believe you killed an entire universe of anything, and even if you did, you should also believe that you *created* an entire universe of that same anything. Mork's not born, Gork is, and it's a push.

  As for the model... there *is* the third terminus state: Invent, but not use, time travel. This seems to me to imminently reasonable, given sane time taveller: First thing you do is create a looped failsafe: If extinct, send time traveler; now the bottom line loops just like the first, and over infinite iterations, the walk will progress as a balance.

  An interesting side effect is that we'd expect to see dead alien civilizations where exactly the wrong thing happened; basically, the opposite of this:
  http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=3994
  ```

- u/CCC_037:
  ```
  Hmmm.

  The desired terminus state is *given* as "time travel is not invented", but that's not quite right. The *actual* desired terminus state is "intelligent life continues to exist". In order for this to happen, it is necessary that humanity develop sufficient, independent off-Earth colonies *before* time travel is invented, and then no-one ever travels back to before that time. (As noted in the story, once you have enough colonies, even with a high probability of a given colony dying off, stellar expansion becomes a near-certainty).

  It's easy to push for the *discovery* of a given technology, given time travel as presented in the story (and assuming you're sufficiently ruthless). You simply do the research, calculate when-and-where you want it to be discovered, pick a person who's in the right place at the write time, time-travel back into his head and produce the required scientific paper. When you need funding directed to a specific place, overwrite Bill Gates in the past and direct it as needed. (Or overwrite some random person, but bring with you memories of the performance of the stock market after that date. Or the next winning lottery numbers.) So, it should be relatively straightforward to arrange for the discovery and funding of space travel. It shouldn't be hard to arrange for it to be done, either - not when you can have the loudest denigrators of the project suddenly and inexplicably drop any and all objections pretty much on command.

  Then, once you have (say) a dozen planets colonised, you just need to find some way of preventing anyone from travelling back to *before* that time, whether or not they figure out time travel...
  ```

  - u/Izeinwinter:
    ```
    Star travel won't work to solve this because you remain vulnerable to someone going back to before it happened. You need humanity to *leave the lightcone defined by the birth of the first hominid advanced enough to be overwritten*. That is a much higher bar to clear. And since FTL is time travel.. 

    Basically, you need to leave this universe for one in which time travel is not possible. Whoo-hoo. Doozy of a problem.  
    But at least this setting does provide a compelling reason for entire civilizations to abandon this reality - any remnants they leave eventually get retconned out of existence, so "Abandon ship" isn't ruled out as a solve by fermi.
    ```

    - u/CCC_037:
      ```
      If you need to know where and when your target is to time travel back to it, then you could do a lot towards preventing time travel by simply erasing all records of pre-star-travel civilisation...

- u/ajuc:
  ```
  You can create doomsday device that uses timetravel if humanity is extinct (timer counting down unless someone resets it, when 0 timetravel the stored brain to predetermined person at the start of the loop with proper instructions to recrete the watchdog).

  Then the "humanity extinct" isn't a stop condition anymore.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    That would just delay the inevitable. After enough loops an event will happen that destroys both humanity and the doomsday device.
    ```

              ```
              That can be engineered around. It's not like it will be a surprise when it happens.

              On the other hand when a timeline going all the way to the end of universe already happened - what better can we hope for? Isn't a reset in such circumstances the best possible option? Yes it will result in death of everybody and small chance of humanity vanishing in next turn (and big chance of humanity vanishing eventually), but humanity is vanishing anyway because of heat death, and after reset even if humanity vanishes - most probably some other species will have their turn.

  Since the universe still exists when you first travel through time, you know that your use of time travel is the first instance of it in that loop. Go back a few years before you invent it, wait until shortly before you invented it before, and send yourself back again. Repeat. You now have a personal eternity to solve the problem.
  ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    Beware: your actions in the new past may butterfly-effect into someone else inventing time travel.

    (Also: the story claims that this is not so much a *personal* eternity as a *dynastical* one.)

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    > Since the universe still exists when you first travel through time, you know that your use of time travel is the first instance of it in that loop.

    You do not. Your universe may be the result of a (successful) attempt at time travel starting from either before or after your attempt (if it was 'before', then the other traveller changed time so as to prevent his own time travel; but something you do might change it back).
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      True. Although it just occurred to me that you don't have to go back to just before you invented time travel. You could go as far back as you like so long as you're still in a time when you could theoretically build the time machine, and just make sure to always build it before it's even conceivable that someone else would.
      ```

  - u/chaos-engine:
    ```
    You can take it to the extreme. If you can control who's brain you enter when you loop back, you can keep looping back over and over again until you have taken over envy soul in humanity, and then continue taking humanity and all you clones down whichever route you chose.     You'll also get to be the first person to be their own mother, father, and child.

    Mormon may or have been the right choice. 

    It was meant to say "Even if the entire species decides to leave the universe, some subgroup in the species likely won't." Mormons are a big, well known group in the US that have distinct enough beliefs that if the rest of society decided to do something, they might decide not to as a cohesive group.

      Some alien civilisation should have been able to refrain from groundhogging itself out of existence. Imagine any lifeform that could evolve, that wouldn't have problems coordinating. Perhaps a species whose members can exchange thoughts, where at some point during their civilation's history everyone became a hivemind? "Nobody presses the starsystem-nuke button on the back of their hand" isn't enough of a great filter.

  I posted this as a reply to someone else but I want to see what you have to say about it:

  If the chance for a species to go extinct after the invention of radio is substantial enough compared to the chance that it goes extinct before the invention of radio then shouldn't the universe still be filled with alien radio signals despite tie travel stopping every species from passing the last great filter?

    Board game or RPG?

    I'm fascinated by board game time travel mechanics, but haven't found one I liked yet (my wife loves Temporum, but I find it a little too simple. Variation looks high, but it isn't really. And can't be if the game is to work every time it's played)
    ```

- u/earnestadmission:

  I think there's an inconsistency in your proposal. The Drake equation asks why we do not now see more signs of alien life. You propose that time travel resets technological progress. But, the reset is universal (you talk about killing all of the aliens when resetting the time back to the mid 21st century).

  This does not answer why we don't see any evidence of aliens as of the date of your reset. Any aliens have been reset to where they were, leaving the question of the Great Filter unresolved. As I see it, this proposal would require that either we are the first developed species, or that aliens have all fallen to the Great filter. That is, the same situation before introducing time travel.
  ```

  - u/Nighzmarquls:
    ```
    It is a proposal for why every alien would fall to this great filter. And that the great filter is time travel.

    Effectively it proposes time travel is so much easier to discover then interstellar travel.

    And it has universe spanning reach to reset a species.

    So the end state of the universe is that time travel deletes civilizations eventually, and doing so makes it like they never were interstellar in the first place.
    ```

    - u/ednever:
      ```
      Exactly. Thank you for clarifying.
      ```

  - u/ednever:
    ```
    It's about timing. The reason the Drake equation / Fermi Paradox results in a high probability of aliens in that you need to believe the average lifespan of aliens able to communicate will be very high.

    If you assume the average lifespan of communicative aliens is say 200 years before they go extinct then the rest of the assumptions can be reasonable and you can assume you are the only living intelligent species in the galaxy.

    The re-set just makes it highly likely that species will not last anything close to 200 years in the "final" timeline.

    (The chances that two species are close to inventing time travel at exactly the same time is very very small, but it doesn't really change things - just makes the modeling much more complicated)
    ```

    - u/earnestadmission:
      ```
      >The re-set just makes it highly likely that species will not last anything close to 200 years in the "final" timeline.

      No.

      The reset is *more influential than that*. The reset says that the time state of the universe will not count past the first species to develop the ability to time travel. The reset of state is painted as universal; a time-reset in Alpha Centauri resets the entire universe. So the universal time clock wont pass the first development of time travel (we'd keep getting sent back to the earliest time-traveller's reversion point).

      But based on the anthropic principle, earth exists and so we know the universe counts at least 13 billion years from the big bang. Thus, we can conclude that one of the following is true:

      1. Earth is the first place time-travel develops
      2. Earth's development happens within the time-loop of some other civilization.

      As far as I can tell, the story has an additional unstated assumption that every sapient technological civilization will develop time travel ("easier than space flight").

      Now, option (1) seems to fall within the already stated boundaries of the Fermi Paradox: Why is earth the first place to develop sapient life?

      Option (2) is more interesting, but seems to require that all other civilizations have roughly equivalent technological progress to us: their time-resets happen after ours.
      ```

      - u/ednever:
        ```
        You are half-way correct.

        The first species develops time travel and keeps re-setting until they don't use time travel (likely due to an extinction event before the invention of time travel), then THAT timeline continues until the next species develops time travel. And it repeats.

        So the reason we don't see any space-faring civilizations is the final timeline we exist in they have all destroyed themselves (If they haven't it's not the final timeline)
        ```

      - u/RMcD94:
        ```
        No, he's saying that any time there is a time reset there is a 0.0001% chance the civilization will die before inventing time travel.

        Ergo, every civilization destroys itself, then no one can travel back in time, and the universe progresses. If humanity explored the entire galaxy they would find millions of civilizations who died at some point before time travel
        ```

        - u/ednever:
          ```
          Exactly. Yes. Thank you for clarifying.
          ```

        - u/earnestadmission:
          ```
          Thanks. I was taking for granted that the time-shifted mind retains the knowledge and ability to immediately time-travel again, while ignoring infrastructure and logistics.
          ```

        - u/Bowbreaker:
          ```
          But all you need for there to be evidence of aliens is that enough civilizations go extinct before time travel but *after* the radio. If the chance for that is large enough then the universe should be filled with alien radio signals.
          ```
