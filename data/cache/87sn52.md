## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  A question that occurs to me when reading Sci-Fi and Fantasy, most recently u/cthulhuraejepsen's Worth the Candle, is what do these people sound like?

  This is especially an interesting question with shows like Stargate, where everyone mysteriously speaks English, which raises some problems:

  * What are their accents? Star Wars has an interesting take on this where the Empire, and more generally Core World people often have British accents, while Rebellion and Outer Region people have American accents. (and Twi'lek speak French and/or have French accents). But it's

  * Do these people have alternate languages? In "standard" fantasy, there's usually a "main" language called "Common" or "Imperial" or "the human language" or whatever; the implication being that people in that world don't speak English, they speak Common and it's translated in English (or Japanese or whatever language the book is written/translated in). In the fantasy world, there's no English, so there's also no Spanish or Japanese or Russian; instead, there's Common, Elvish, Dwarvish, etc.

  * Assuming this isn't just translation convention and the characters are actually speaking English, how does the main character sound? The question is often glossed over, which can be a little strange for infiltration-type scenarios where the main character is, eg disguised as an Imperial guardsman, which should logically be about as successful as a spy trying to infiltrate the White House while speaking with a thick Russian accent.

  I think Stargate was probably one of the shows that struggled the most with this problem. All the humans on every planet speak English, even though they were taken away from Earth before English was even a language. Not only that, but they mostly speak English with a perfect American accent.

  This is especially funny in Stargate Atlantis, which features an international expeditions, which means there's more diversity in the languages and accents of *the Earth characters* than from the aliens they meet.

    I think to actually do it right, you have to be obsessive about linguistics to an extent that most people aren't (myself included).

    One of the things that I think about a fair amount is mouth shape, and how that affects which sounds a person can make, and how that then influences what the languages look like. If you describe someone (or a whole species) as having pointy teeth, then you should be thinking about how they make sounds like the [voiceless dental fricative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_dental_fricative) or the [voiced dental fricative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_dental_fricative). It seems to me like the real use of "Common", beyond just being a trade language, is being able to settle on a single language that every species is actually capable of speaking, or which at least a majority can speak, without all that much trouble.

    The real problem for prose is that I think accents and dialects are really hard to get across to the reader unless you're willing to dip into partial or full phonetics, which I've always found really annoying to read, and even more annoying to write, plus it usually makes the person speaking sound less intelligent, which isn't always (or usually) what you're trying to convey. There are other aspects, like word choice, cadence, etc. that you can use, and some of that ties into dialect (or idiolect) but the actual *sounds* are hard to get across in prose.

    (Thus far, there are three created languages for *Worth the Candle*, but I cheated and used [Vulgar](https://www.vulgarlang.com/index.html) to generate them, mostly because all I wanted were languages that was guaranteed to look more or less right to the reader and follow consistent rules, though I won't guarantee that the sample sentences are fully faithful to the specifications for the languages.

    And obviously as far as English/Anglish goes, there's a fair amount of fuckery going on in the background. Anglish is English, but with a different etymological and linguistic background, some missing idioms, and some changed meanings to certain phrases, plus some additions that are literally *from* Earth English by way of the dream-skewered.)
