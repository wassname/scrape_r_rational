## Rational use of an unbreakable object?

### Post:

I was listening to the Rationally Writing podcast when Daystar (I think) mentioned that there were so many ways to use even a peanut's worth of unbreakable material - but he didn't mention any. So, what are the ways to munchkin something like?

  I don't know enough physics but my gut feeling is that there's an energy related exploit somewhere.

  Break the laws of physics, utterly. 

  Let's say you have a platonic solid - a cube - that is the literal ideal "rigid body", just a bit of volume that can't be deformed or broken, it only possesses mass and a moment of inertia.

  Such an object will allow you to fundamentally violate relativity.

  Push it on one end, the other end will move *instantly*, because it can't deform. That means it allows FTL signalling.

  If it *can* deform, it must have an elastic modulus to do so, but I guess then you could exploit the fact that it can accumulate literally infinite elastic energy because it never breaks. And I'm not even sure how *that* would work because where is that energy stored? The object doesn't have any individual atoms, it can't be in the potential of the electromagnetic field that keeps them together. So does that energy just go somewhere else? Does it even contribute to the local stress-energy tensor? Everything basically stops making sense.
  ```

  - u/t3tsubo:
    ```
    Can you explain how NASA could use it to say, send FTL messages to Mars? I get the FTL argument I just don't understand how it would work in practicality, assuming the cube is only the size of a peanut.

    And breaking the physics of elastic energy doesn't actually tell me how it could be munchkined into making free energy or profit.
    ```

    - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
      ```
      Well, you couldn't use it to send FTL messages to Mars that way if it's just peanut-sized of course. But it still breaks physics. I mean, basically, if any part of it can move FTL, it can *all* move FTL. So maybe you can just slam it into a railgun and keep accelerating it to infinity? 

      It's hard to figure out how it would work because *it should not work*, so all bets are off. I'm also trying to think if there's some clever experimental setup with subatomic particles or photons where you exploit its FTL movement qualities. It should be an infinite potential barrier, so it should completely bar quantum particles from tunnelling or even having a vanishing wavefunction in it, and combined with the FTL stuff that means if you just used it as a piston in a cylinder full of some kind of gas or plasma, and one of those particles happened to be colliding with it when suddenly you push it a bit inside... I have *no idea* WTF would happen, that sounds like it ought to transfer infinite energy to that particle. Oh, and anything that's FTL is basically travelling backwards in time in certain frames of reference, to make things more complicated. Easy stuff.

      As for the deformable version, it's less outrageous, but still outrageous. At a basic level it's the perfect energy storage. No losses, 100% efficiency, infinite capacity. Can you break the first principle and create free energy with it? I don't think so, not in an obvious way I can think of, though the fact that this ought to be a *classical* object in a quantum world might still give rise to some serious mindfucky consequences which may or may not break thermodynamics. But due to 100% efficiency it's basically already breaking the *second* principle. Or... skirting the limit, really, since that's just zero entropy creation, not negative entropy. But perhaps you can use it also to extract energy from a colder body, and thus reduce entropy. Suppose for example it's perfectly reflective (it ought to be, it's not like it has individual atoms to absorb light!). Then I think you could use this setup: put it in a chamber with a gas at T > 0 and shine a laser on it at an angle, then collect that laser with a photoelectric cell and turn it back into electrical energy. The molecules of the gas hit it and make it oscillate, and that oscillation modulates the laser's frequency, thus transmitting some of its energy to it. I *think* you could use some variation on this theme to extract energy out of the gas, making use of the fact that the cube doesn't have thermal radiation, doesn't have a temperature, and is perfectly reflective. But I should try and run the numbers to be sure, and it's likely that it wouldn't be very useful regardless due to the losses in the laser + photovoltaic cell apparatus.

  Worst case scenario it's slightly deformable so you can't violate the speed of light but you still can't deform it enough to really change its shape much. You can't use it for infinite thermal energy storage because at some point it will simply radiate the energy back as fast as you're adding it. With these limitations I can't think of much you could do with it.

  If what you get back is black-body radiation and you can get it hot enough then I suppose it would work as a "any kind of radiation to gamma ray converter" but what would you do with that? If you're in a "close to modern day tech but without the nuclear bomb"-scenario it could be a weapon?

  You might be able to find a way to store an infinite amount of kinetic energy by spinning it while suspended in a vacuum, but getting that energy back in a controlled manner wouldn't be easy. Getting it back in an uncontrolled manner gets you a bomb with an insanely high upper limit on the energy output. You might end up having a problem before then since the mass of the object will increase at relativistic speeds, but if you accelerate it while it's far enough away from any gravity wells (e.g. by pelting it with a particle accelerator) then you have a "variable-mass point-source" which I guess could be useful but doesn't seem terrible world-breaking given the time required to add or remove mass. Back of the napkin math says turning it into a black hole would take on the order of gigayears even if you could direct the entire energy output of the sun into it.

  Of course it might again just radiate the energy away somehow when you try to store kinetic energy, depending on how intent the DM is on preventing your world-breaking.

  I suppose you could use a large enough explosion to launch it into space from sea level, but you couldn't attach anything to it so the only benefit would be shooting down a single satellite with very low technology. Or with very high technology it could potentially be used as a planet-killing bullet, but I'm not sure how you'd accelerate it that much. Get it into orbit around a black hole and keep increasing its speed with particle accelerators while nudging it closer and close to the event horizon, then nudging it out of orbit? If someone can travel to black holes then they probably have better ways of destroying planets, but maybe the scenario includes a race of beings who just happen to live near one.

  Hmm.  Off the top of my head, first thing that comes to mind is if you had an unbreakable material, that means you could use it to put something under incredible pressure inside of it without it breaking.  If you could do that with water you could store an incredible amount of energy in a small area by compressing water until it becomes solid at high temperatures.  If you did that with an isotope of hydrogen then I guess you could create fusion?

  Of course it depends what "unbreakable" means; after a certain amount of energy is put in, pressure or force applied becomes heat, so is the "unbreakable" object something that can melt or boil, or is it really indestructible?
  ```

- u/morgf:
  ```
  An unbreakable peanut? Reminds me of a story by Lois Bujold where they had an unbreakable walnut. One guy wanted to take it to a bar and bet big strong guys that they could not crack it.

  But seriously, I'm not sure that you could do much with a small chunk of unbreakable material, unless you had some way to shape it or sharpen it. If that is not possible, then the only thing I can think of is to load it into a very high velocity gun and use it as the ultimate armor piercing round.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    With sensitive enough equipment you could use it to construct a Closed Timelike Curve computer (assuming it does not deform and therefore transmits FTL), but I doubt Earth is equal to the sheer engineering challenges.
    ```

- u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
  ```
  An unbreakable material cannot melt, because melting really means breaking apart on the molecular level. Thus you can use it to build containers for ridiculously hot materials, like molten tungsten. 

  An unbreakable material is immune to most chemical reactions. It's atomic bonds cannot be broken, so at best only layers of new atoms can be created. Thus it should be a completely safe container for pretty much every chemical, no matter how reactive.

  Though it's not clear how you would forge the unbreakable material into containers in the first place...
  ```

  - u/GlimmervoidG:
    ```
    >  Thus it should be a completely safe container for pretty much every chemical, no matter how reactive.

    That's not necessarily true. What if the unbreakable material was porous? While it would not chemically react with a chemical inside of it, there's no guarantee if could safely contain the chemical.
    ```

- u/lillarty:
  ```
  Unbreakable would mean that it can absorb an infinite amount of energy without being affected, thus violating the first law of thermodynamics. If that works in reverse, you could potentially surround it with objects much, much colder than it and have infinite energy flow out of it and into the surroundings. Some kind of liquid nitrogen-powered steam turbine, or something to that effect, maybe?

  As you can no doubt tell, I don't really have the physics knowledge to say for sure, and a lot of how to utilize it would depend on how precisely the object functioned.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    >violating the first law of thermodynamics.

    I don't think that that follows. I would have thought that absorbing infinite energy simply implies that it remains solid at all temperatures. The transfer of heat still occurs normally, it just never softens or melts. So there isn't any infinite energy sink nor source.
    ```

    - u/lillarty:
      ```
      That's entirely fair, I was thinking that it would be immune to the typical effects of adding energy to an object, but that doesn't mean it is locked in at a particular energy level. 

      I have more thoughts about potential uses for it, but those all depend on the nature of the object. For example, the object could be unbreakable while still retaining elasticity, making it a way to store incredible amounts of kinetic energy. I'm sure there's a way to munchkin that further into infinite energy, but I can't think of it at the moment. There's just too many unknowns to delve into it too far.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        Elasticity is a good point. To be considered unbreakable, I would think that the object must either be perfectly elastic, or perfectly rigid. If it is elastic, then it would be able to store arbitrary amounts of kinetic energy, as you say. If it is rigid, with no elasticity at all, then...wouldn't that mean that pressure on one side is transmitted *instantly* throughout the object? As in, FTL signalling?
        ```

      - u/SoylentRox:
        ```
        You have a good point.  If an object that was an "infinite heat sink" existed, you could obtain energy even in environments where the temperature is the same everywhere.

        &#x200B;

        Why would an unbreakable material be an infinite heat sink?  Because as materials heat up, the molecules move faster and faster.  A hot solid transfers energy in both directions if you put it in contact with some other liquid or gas.

        &#x200B;

        An "unbreakable" material can't really have it's atoms moving around above a certain velocity, or the material will turn to gas.
        ```

  - u/archpawn:
    ```
    > Unbreakable would mean that it can absorb an infinite amount of energy without being affected, 

    Generally unbreakable objects are assumed to be unbendable. If that's the case, they can't absorb any energy. Work is force times distance, and if the object doesn't budge, distance is zero. Any energy would just bounce off.
    ```

  So lets use the senario where you only get a peanuts worth.
  Assuming: Its indestructible (chemically non-reactive, never changes temperture, weighs roughly the same as its equivalent weight in iron and is non-magnetic, and of course its volume and shape is equal to that of a average peanut.

  Assuming all that, the peanut size piece would be pretty much useless. Like, you could probably sell it for a bunch to a rich dude/scientist or try to find a break-anything material and try to use the two of them together to crash the universe, but it would have no practical use.


  If you could make it (or found enough of it in a convenient enough shape) you could find quite a few uses for it (eg. armor, weapons, in construction, for tools like drills or axes, as the main part of a space elevator), although none of them would be really "exploits" and would simply be relying on its extraordinary material properties.

  5e D&D has unbreakable arrows in xanathars. fun stuff really. only an antimagic field can break them, and as a common magic item they cost 50gp each to craft (woodworking tools). 

  some of the obvious uses are as traps, ways to wedge things open or shut, and as climbing aids. an unbreakable arrow could help wedge the moving wall or ceiling in place, and arrows tend to be a couple feet long. you would likely need more than one however, as the PSI on an arrowhead may just make a hole in the material its holding back. 

  unbreakable also implies that it wont take damage from other sources, like fire or acid. it would be nasty for a dragon to have one shot into its throat. could be very useful for some types of alchemy.

  Depends on if you can reshape it. Imagine a small thin blade. The thinner the better. It could have really powerful stabs and swings and be very thin or perhaps light?

    Sounds similar to the molecular stiletto in the Timothy Zahn Star Wars novels, or the monomolecular cutter in Full Metal Panic. More generally: "[monomolecular wire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomolecular_wire) is often used as a weapon in fiction. It has applications in cutting objects and severing adjacent molecules. A similar or identical concept may be called a microfilament wire or, as a weapon, a microfilament whip."

    As a real-world analog, obsidian can be sharpened to the point where its edge can literally be measured in nanometers across the cutting edge).  They were frequently used in arrowheads and they are even used in modern medical contexts (for example, see [this article](https://www.cnn.com/2015/04/02/health/surgery-scalpels-obsidian/index.html) about the use of obsidian scalpels in modern surgery).

    The downside of obsidian is that it shatters easily; it is literally volcanic glass, and much like you would expect from glass, it can shatter just as easily as it can be made into a sharp point that can cut.  Most fictional depictions feature this as well; as is the case with the monomolecular knives in Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash: they can easily cut through body armor, but are prone to shattering at inopportune moments. Having a blade made from unbreakable material would give you all of the upside with none of the downside. Though I'm unsure whether this would be the optimal use of such a material, you certainly could do worse than making a monomolecular cutter.

    Honestly that's kind of a waste. You can't make it too thin or light because without any weight it would be useless against even basic armor and would be too light to effectively use defensively, so it would end up being roughly a regular sword but unbreakable. This is nice, but not particularly special or helpful.

    Also an unbreakable material is intrinsically unshapable by physical means because, as some above said, melting is just atomic bonds breaking after you add enough energy.
    ```

    - u/Trotsky5:
      ```
      But if it’s got enough velocity and is thin enough it could be used like an unbreakable, unbendable sabot and it wouldn’t need weight if it has enough strength behind it. Maybe using it as gun ammunition might be better?
      ```

- u/Jeremey_Clarkson:
  ```
  People always say you can flatten a matchbox sized bit of gold out enough to cover a tennis court. Assuming you can work this material (maybe a dodgy assumption, given it's unbreakable) you could flatten it out into quite a large area or long length, and it would remain completely unbreakable. Uses from there are pretty straightforward, for example super thin and strong armour or weapons, assuming the material is light enough.

  &#x200B;

  If we stick with the peanut shape, probably not so useful. Doesn't look like a good shape for hammering, seems unlikely to have any particularly sharp edges. You could use it for party tricks, but you could probably accomplish most of them with a piece of steel shaped like a peanut.

- u/archpawn:
  ```
  If you can decide what form it's in, you could build a space elevator by making it into a really long and thin sheet. But if it's unbreakable I'm not sure how you'd do that.

  You could use it to transmit messages faster than light. If you make two objects like this in different reference frames you could transmit messages back in time.

      Using the [relativity of simultaneity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity). Say you have one unbreakable rod that's at rest, and another one moving towards you at relativistic speeds. You tap on the rod moving towards you, and the other end moves instantly from its frame of reference, which happens to be in the past from your reference frame. Then someone on the other end taps on the rod that's at rest from your frame, reaching you instantly, and the message arrives before you send the first one.

        Yeah, no; I'm ***not*** doing that. *You* go touch an object moving at relativistic speeds. Preferably somewhere in space, so that the energy release caused when an indestructible object touches you at a noteworthy fraction of c doesn't wreck the planet.

  I think that someone need to define unbreakable. Can it be altered chemically or physically? If they do, then the very same method altering it can also be used to get past it. If they don't, I'm sure it's not that useful. Unless you have more than a peanut worth of it.
