## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Recommending wholeheartedly. Incredible doesn't even begin to describe this game. It might be better to go in without spoilers.


  But lets just say this reminded me a bit about the AI box. Great writing and voice acting too.
  ```

  - u/NTaya:
    ```
    Did not expect to see this recced on r/rational, but I strongly second it. The story is not rational (since the two main characters are >!very inhuman gods!<, their actions *can't* be rational from our point of view), and I'm sure a lot of people on this subreddit will feel weird about making >!death!< sympathetic and the >!person trying to kill death!< somewhat unsympathetic. I can't say I outright didn't like that, but I basically had to enter a state of deliberate cognitive dissonance that I wouldn't feel obliged to >!kill the Shifting Mound every run!<. (*Don't* look at the spoilers before you make a full run. A full run is *much* longer than 3 chapters; it took me about 3 hours the first time around.)

    Either way, it's beautiful, the voice acting is phenomenal, and the plot is surprisingly complex and thought-provoking.
    ```

  - u/xjustwaitx:
    ```
    I tried it because of your recommendation, I'm not sure I liked it, I feel like I got the "point" in the first few minutes, and there wasn't anything very cool beyond that.
    ```

    - u/NTaya:
      ```
      Did you get at least one ending? I mean the real ending, not the small one you get after three-ish chapters.
      ```

      - u/xjustwaitx:
        ```
        Yes, I got three real ones, including one real ending after 3 minutes (I think you can guess which >!Slaying the princess and waiting for an eternity!<)
        ```

        - u/NTaya:
          ```
          Those don't sound like real ones, those sound like local ones. The ones you get after three chapters (or after >!Slaying + waiting!<) to so are "small," they are only to advance the global plot.
          ```

          - u/xjustwaitx:
            ```
            >!I'm pretty sure slaying + waiting is a real ending, you get the credits and everything, it just happens to be a True Ending you can reach quickly, especially if someone warns you that the game is similar to a boxed AI!<

            >!And certainly, the other two I got were real endings, each required me to provide 5 vessels over 10+ chapters!<
            ```

            - u/NTaya:
              ```
              Ah, alright then.
              ```

  - u/NnaelKysumu:
    ```
    The voice acting is good and it's entertaining for a couple of hours, but was ultimately a utter disappointment. The choices ultimately matter very little, since we're being forced into three endings no matter what, and you can choose between them until the last moment of the game.   


    The themes also weren't great.
    ```

  - u/Lemerney2:
    ```
    It's voiced by the excellent Johnny Sims of The Magnus Archives, which is an amazing horror podcast with excellent worldbuilding and characters. 

    And it's just started it's sequel(ish) called The Magnus Protocol!
    ```

    - u/AviusAedifex:
      ```
      I listened to like 90 episodes, and while I absolutely loved the beginning, it got worse and worse and I dropped it because >!the overarching story was simply awful.!< The world itself is really interesting, and I loved the episodic nature of it, but eventually you get less and less of it, and I completely lost interest. 

      Some people have a totally opposite take on it though, where they think the beginning is a slog, and it gets good later. 

      Johnny Sims is a great voice actor though, fully agree.
      ```

- u/Tiraon:
  ```
  I'd like to recommend Delta-V and the sequel Critical Mass by Daniel Suarez. The novels deal with asteroid mining and later with expanding the space presence of humanity.


  The technology is mostly grounded and well researched with sources and further reading present in the books but the main thing I liked about the novels is that it presents a society with problems(inspired by the present) and then goes and puts forward a possible path forward. Generally hopeful scifi seems to rarer lately.


  As a side note I'd also recommend a significantly older Daemon and Freedom by the same author. The general theme of the books is similar, this time dealing with artificial intelligence and self sustaining communities.


  And at the end I would like to ask to recommendations for similarly themed books. That is stories that present both a society level problem and *some* kind of possible solution or some way of dealing with it.
  ```

  - u/GeneratedSymbol:
    ```
    Daemon and Freedom were amazing, especially in audio book format, so I'm inclined to trust this rec. Thanks!
    ```

  - u/netstack_:
    ```
    Does delta-V have anything to do with the asteroid-mining game of the [same name](https://store.steampowered.com/app/846030/V_Rings_of_Saturn/)?

    If you haven't read Vernor Vinge's *A Fire Upon the Deep*, I highly recommend it. I hesitate to call the threat facing the larger galactic community present-inspired, but the Tines side of it is much more societal, and they dovetail in a satisfying way.
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      Probably unrelated to the game, delta-v is a term that comes up a lot when you're maneuvering in space.

    I really enjoyed [Path of Ruin](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/path-of-ruin-star-wars-si.541256/), which follows an SI who gets slowly corrupted by the Dark Side of the Force, but in a convincing way. It takes place in the Old Republic era, so it doesn't include any events from the prequels, but it's probably the best Star Wars fic I've found.
    ```

  - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
    ```
    I'm really enjoy [*Sublight Drive*](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/sublight-drive-star-wars.1095425/), featuring an SI OC that's on the side of the CIS and trying to manipulate events so they survive Palpatine.

    There's also [*The Weaving Force*](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-weaving-force-worm-sw-pseudo-post-gm.1058679/), which is a Worm (post-GM)
    crossover where Taylor & co. are transporter to the Star Wars universe a bit before the Clone Wards.
    ```

  - u/Polarion:
    ```
    I like “[The Force Wills](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/star-wars-the-force-wills-sw-si.102996/#post-23764332)” it follows an SI into Ashoka at the beginning of the clone wars. The SI is trying her best to prevent order 66 without openly opposing Palpatine. It’s the only long Star Wars fic I’m currently following. 

    There’s another one, a quest, like The Forge of Destiny called [“I’ve always wanted to own the Galaxy”](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/ive-always-wanted-to-own-the-galaxy-star-wars-ck2-organisation-quest.29259/)

    It’s dropped but it goes on for several years. It follows an OC starting a business and moving up to becoming a major force in the Galaxy.

    I'm liking [A Penumbral Path](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/star-wars-a-penumbral-path.814685/#post-63823781). It takes place 4 years before the Clone Wars and I'm really enjoying the world building and the main characters (which are all OCs, I think), though I disagree with the author's world view sometimes. (For example, the author seems to have a rather simplistic view on how corruption arises in a government.)

    [By the motive force](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/by-the-motive-force.1075611/) is a fun but relatively short and incomplete fiction.

    - u/Darkpiplumon:
      ```
      While I do agree that no canon knowledge is required itself, I don't believe this is a good start to 40k.

      There are tons of references and characters that are more enjoyed if you know who they were in "canon", and can give you a very distorted image of how the world really is.

      It's still very funny, but I'd recommend knowing more about it first.

    *The Infinite and the Divine* is an official 40k novel rather than a fanfic, but I found it pretty enjoyable as someone who's level of 40k knowledge was "slightly above average level of osmosis from general nerd culture".

  Webovel recommendations

  Please I'm looking for any completed or ongoing webnovel (200+ chapters), that is similar to Reverend insanity. A tall ask, I know, but I wouldn't mind other recommendations with a sensible plot and an mc that uses his brain cells. 

  PS: exclude all cuttlefish, er gen and IET works. Shadow slave, birth of the demonic sword, worm and supreme magus also.

  Thanks in advance.

  I tentatively rec [A Ruinous Gift](https://archiveofourown.org/works/50209543/chapters/126809221) by noodlehammer. It's an in-progress wormfic with a very light crossover with W40K(just the powers, basically). The premise is that when Taylor triggers she briefly touches the warp, gets a boon from each of the 4 Chaos Gods and becomes a hyper competent pain junkie masochist psychic with infinite multi-tasking and nigh uncontrollable pride-driven rage and libido.  A slow motion hazardous materials train derailment, in other words. 

  Good times. 

  I liked the story enough to check out the author's other stuff, and that's where my reservations come in. All his other stories are unbelievably self-indulgent harem power fantasies, with the occasional awesome idea getting subsumed by the gratuitous amounts of explicit sex scenes(upwards of ~20% of wordcount!!) and long rambling /pol/-flavored monologues. 

  A Ruinous Gift hasn't shown signs of the above aside from the occasional sex scene (which feel appropriate given the powers and themes present), but fair warning all the same.
  ```

  - u/ahasuerus_isfdb:
    ```
    I found this fic to be a mixed bag. On the plus side:

    * Taylor has an interesting growing power and it’s reasonably well explored.
    * A number of canon characters are done well as long as you allow for NSFW elements. This includes Lisa, Alec, Emma, Coil, Squealer and Lung.
    * Good plotting. At one point I stayed up until 1am because I wanted to “know what happens next”.

    On the flip side:

    * Anyone associated with the PRT – Sophia, Piggot, Armsmaster, Blackwell – is one-dimensional or even an over the top villain.
    * This is, to a large extent, a work of "erotic horror". YMMV.
    * There are segments where the author seemingly pushes his perception of How the World Really Works ™, e.g. his repeated references to prostitutes choosing to remain prostitutes even when given a choice of doing something else. A single scene like that wouldn't attract much attention, but the repetition makes you wonder if the author is pushing an agenda.

    Reviewing the author's posts on Questionable Questing, including the [one that got him banned](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/for-love-of-experimental-magic.17473/page-3#post-5254266):

    > Trying to get me to believe that the Germans would bother chasing down millions of Jews, only to then kill them in overly elaborate death camps instead of just shooting them on the spot... Like hell I'm buying that. Where is the legendary German *efficiency*?

    > And if they were so determined to wipe them out, then why are there so many goddamn "holocaust survivors" around to whine about it.

    provided context for some of the oddities in the fic.
    ```

    - u/viewlesspath:
      ```
      Yeah, not unexpected given the signs of /pol/ brainrot I picked up from just skimming his other works. I'm a believer in death of the author though, so unless he shows his shitty colors in this one, I'll keep reading. 

      I will disagree with you about Piggot being one dimensional though. Her POV when covering up for Sophia was one of the better ones I've seen. Ultimately stupid, but well reasoned given her motivations and what she knew. 

      Also, while the prostitute thing was a bit over the top for comedic purposes, it's not that farfetched. The main problem with prostitution is that it's dangerous, exploitive and low status, so at the low end only desperate people with little or no other options do it. If you (magically) take away the danger, the exploitation, and the desperation, what you're left with is way more palatable, especially in the proto-apocalyptic dystopia that is worm.
      ```

      - u/WhoTookBibet:
        ```
        "Death of the author" is about including or excluding an author's original intent when analyzing *textual meaning*. It has nothing to do with handwaving away an author's actions or beliefs when rating, recommending, or discussing generalities of a text.
        ```

        - u/viewlesspath:
          ```
          What's your point? When did I indicate otherwise? All I did was write that I had found nothing objectionable in the work itself, and I would keep reading until I did.
          ```
