    Yeah, I was wondering who it was he found attractive way back in that first chapter.  But he also acknowledges that his tastes have probably changed since then, and that he's grown more mature.  I think Akoja might have some chance after all, however small.

    Imagine if it was TimeBraid!Sakura instead of Zorian here. Everybody would be fucked.

  Somewhat interesting. This also gets posted in /r/noveltranslations (really just a webnovel subreddit though the majority of posts are translated works)

  He has a brother who is an extremely accomplished mage and hasn't even tried to access that resource because of pride. Grr zorian you're better than that. 

  I don't expect that to change though unless he conveniently helps someone else overcome their pride then applies that lesson to himself.

    To be fair, his brother might also be the villain. There might be plot reasons why the two of them cannot interact yet.

    >It
    was always Daimen this, Daimen that. There were days when Zorian wondered why
    his parents made three other children when they were clearly so enamored with their
    eldest son. Really, going to another continent just to visit him? What, were they
    going to die if they didn't see him for a year?

    He dislikes him as his parents are obsessed.

    >He was like Daimen in this way, only Daimen had actual skills to back up his
    charm.

    Daimen has skills and charm.

    >His father always joked that Fortov and Zorian each got a half of Daimen in them:
    Fortov got his charm, and Zorian his competence.

    Zorian's father used him to insult Zorian.

    >Zorian resisted the urge to scowl. Getting put under that spell by Daimen was one of
    his childhood traumas. It wasn't amusing at all.

    Daimen tortured him with animation.

    >Poorly controlled, the spell is intensely uncomfortable. We don't want to give anyone
    traumas."
    Zorian narrowed his eyes. He didn't. Not even Daimen would… oh, who is he
    kidding? Of course he would have. Practicing such a spell on your own little brother
    was right up Daimen's alley.

    This is normal behaviour for his bro, implying other abuse.

    >"Everything I do is always compared to Daimen and, to a slightly lesser extent,
    Fortov. It has been that way since I was a child, before Daimen ever became
    famous. My parents have never been shy about playing favorites, and since they
    were always interested chiefly in social achievements, I was always found wanting.
    My family has no use for a withdrawn bookworm, and made that abundantly clear
    over the years. Until recently, they ignored me completely, treating me more like I
    was my sister's babysitter than their son."

    His brother is famous, has social achievements, was used to attack him.

    >since Daimen and Fortov were both relatively decent at music, Daimen at
    playing the piano and Fortov at playing the violin.

    Damien can play piano.

    >Once upon a time, when Zorian was younger,
    he dreamt of being a great mage. The sort that legends were made of, the kind that
    revolutionized whole fields of magic all by themselves. In time this dream died as it
    became clear he didn't have the talent, the work ethic, or the right connections to
    make that happen. He was just a slightly above average civilian-born student with no
    special advantages to his name. But now? He had all the time he needed to build up
    an advantage over his peers and become truly great. Greater than Daimen.

    Becoming greater than Daimen is a major motivation.

    >Zorian suppressed a wave of jealousy that washed over him. Zach was just making
    the most of his unique situation, just like Zorian would have in his place. It still
    bothered him, though, reminding him of how Daimen and Fortov could ask and get
    all sorts of help and concessions from their teachers, only for Zorian to fail in
    securing the same for himself.

    He has huge resentment for his brothers succeeding with charisma.

    >"Well done," Ilsa said with a smile. "Not many students have such a firm grasp on
    their magic at this stage. I see someone is continuing in Daimen's footsteps."
    Zorian smiled back politely. He mustn't scowl, he mustn't scowl…

    The idea of following Daimen makes him scowl.

    >"Daimen and I don't get along," Zorian said bluntly. "There is not much I can tell you
    about him that Kiri already hasn't."

    They have a poor relationship.

    >but the sad fact was that she was closer to him in talent
    than, say, Daimen or some other child prodigy.

    Daimen was a child prodigy.

    >"Umm…" Kirielle stammered. "Please don't be mad because mother told me not to
    tell you this because you would get mad at me but mother said you and Fortov were
    only accepted so easily because Daimen got so big and successful..."
    "Daimen had nothing to do with it," Zorian said, grinding his teeth in annoyance

    He hates the idea of riding on Daimen's coattails.

    So, to summarize- he hates Daimen, hates the idea of relying on him, hates the idea of relying on charisma and prefers to rely on competence, and this has been reinforced by years of his parent's and brother's abuse.

    It's not because of pride. Rationality doesn't mean ignoring emotions. He has years of experience avoiding Daimen, it's something important to him.

    ```
    Maybe it’s more than pride.

    >I'm sure you'll hear all about it when he finally deigns to unveil it to the world.

    Daimen could be a type of person who holds all the knowledge he posesses very close to the vest, only annoying those who seek to get such knowledge and giving nothing more.

        Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

        In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

        Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

        “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

        The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

        Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

        Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

        L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

          There are only really two times Zorian has met RR, if I recall. Both in the same [chapter.](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/26/Mother-of-Learning) Zorian disintegrates the vampire chick, and it reads like RR sees this and doesn't react, where Daimen would have been quite shocked if baseline Zorian had done that. After that he's at least partially disguised.

          All of the "ripples" before that could have been caused by the aranae (in RR's mind). Zorian hasn't been in Cyoria until recently. And RR appears to not be paying attention to Cyoria enough to notice now.

              All of them are easily available as ebooks direct from the author, and hardcopies of *Wizard of Mars* are available if you look for them.

  I came up with the theory a couple weeks ago that maybe the aranea figured out that the time loop was degrading because they were using their prophecy powers to prophesize what was happening inside the time loop.

  One passage bothers me:

  So I know that pigs are supposed to be smarter than you'd think, but smarter than dogs? And dogs are lumped in the "dumb" category? I would guess that the author mixed up the animals and it's supposed to be "they were actually closer to animals such as ravens and dogs than something dumb like a horse or a pig", but maybe there's something I don't know?

    In addition to the examples other's have listed, there's the "loops" meta-story, which TVtropes has a bunch of links [here](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheInfiniteLoops). Rather than start at the start, these stories tend to focus on "OK loops are happening and all, but what about 300 loops later? What do the characters start doing? What about millions of loops later?"
