## New to the subreddit and had a question.

### Post:

What exactly does each of the abbreviations in the titles mean? ( \[RT\], \[D\], \[HF\], \[FF\], etc.)

### Comments:

- u/GeeJo:
  ```
  Per the sidebar:

  >You can use standard tags in your post title to improve Reddit's search function:

  >Is the story [RT] rational or [RST] rationalist? Or is your post [META] discussion about /r/rational?

  >Is the story a [WIP] work in progress, or [C] complete?

  >Optional genre tags: [HSF] hard scifi, [HF] hard fantasy, [DC] deconstruction, [EDU] educational, [MK] munchkinism, [TH] transhumanism, [FF] fanfic
  ```

    ```
    Note: this wasn't part of the sidebar in the redesign until about two minutes ago.
    ```

    - u/RMcD94:
      ```
      I like how we spent months working out the sidebar and forgot about tag explanation.
      ```

      - u/ketura:

        He means the Reddit redesign. The way it is now you have to maintain two versions of the sidebar, as the Reddit redesign has a lot more compartmentalization.
        ```

        - u/RMcD94:
          ```
          Oh fair enough
          ```

  - u/signspace13:
    ```
    By this definition a META flair would be appropriate for this post.
    ```

  - u/thunder_cranium:
    ```
    What does your "Custom Flair" flair mean? :)
    ```

    - u/None:

      ```
      I'd guess a smart alec response or a missed click.  Mine is a combination of a mission statement and the inversion of a Banks reference
      ```
