## Communications With Uncontacted Humans[BST]

### Post:

So, you found yourself dumped in the company of advanced humans(1960s to nBSG humans) complete with different language and customs.

You can't get back, and no one is around to help you. 

How do you establish communication? What is the first priority?

Scenarios: 

1) Discovered on a spaceship you owned.

2) Dumped in the middle of a city

3) Dumped in the wilderness

Options

1) Without anything. You're stark naked with lacking anything.

2) With your everyday attires, but you're allowed to bring anything useful under five kilograms.

  Well, you can prove you are intelligent with mathematical formulas and equations. At that point, the others will probably be interested in trying to establish contact. Learning a new language with no background is hard, but doable, and they'll probably have their best linguists trying to help. It's basically the same as your average alien contact scenario, except that since you're both human, you'll have similar neurology and frame of reference.

  As for what I'd bring with me, a computer and discs packed with as much information about humanity as I can. We can always figure out how to adapt the power once we establish contact.

  WRT scenarios 2 and 3, if a naked human showed up in my hometown, speaking a foreign language, and trying to get people to pay attention to the weird symbols they scratches in the dirt, no one's just going to take them to their leader, even *if* they recognized that lame math stuff.

  I'd prioritize being *interesting*. Instead of being crazy and homeless and easily ignored, be crazy and homeless and singing a song in an unheard genre. Cause a scene, draw a crowd, *then* see if you can engage someone who appears to actually be paying attention, honestly trying to figure out where you come from.

  Honestly still a crapshoot, but it's the best I've got this time of night.
