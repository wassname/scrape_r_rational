## [META] What site should be used for recommending paperback books?

### Post:

This isn't so much to argue one site over the other as it is to adopt a common standard for the subreddit. For reference, the discussion was spurred [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/27csrn/hf_the_merchant_princes_series_by_charles_stross/chzvxzx).

Sites suggested so far, in no paticular order (this list will be updated as necessary):

* [Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/)

* [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_stripbooks_deptiss_0_4?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=&sprefix=book%2Caps%2C181)

* [Bookfinder](http://www.bookfinder.com/)

* [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org/)

  In the event I choose to purchase a book, I prefer Amazon, so that would be my choice for recommendations here. 

  I agree with /u/alexanderwales that this sub isn't quite busy enough to have a rule, though a relaxed preference is probably a good idea.

  I'm only really familiar with Amazon, so:

  **Pros**

  * You can buy the book right away
  * Verified reviews so that you can ensure the person making the review actually at least owns the book (see the rather famous case of [Doors of Stone](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10394348-doors-of-stone) on Goodreads having 800 ratings and 150 reviews despite not even having a release date yet)
  * Usually has a preview of the first couple of pages so that you can see whether the writing style or content interests you (above and beyond the recommendation you get here).

  **Cons**

  * Region specific issues
  * May not have the best price
  * Amazon has an incentive to try to get you buying bad books
  * Shill reviews (but you get those everywhere online that has reviews, and at least Amazon has some economic muscle to use as threat in particularly egregious or widespread cases)
  * Amazon has a referral program that I don't know too much about that gives an incentive to excessive posting (probably not a problem with our size given how low the rewards would be though)

  Now personally, I don't think there really needs to be a standard, because we're just not that large of a subreddit. By the general theory of online participation rates, a thousand subscribers means we have maybe in the dozens of people who will ever submit anything to this subreddit. Instituting rules increases overheads and reduces participation rates.

  As a mutually agreed upon (as opposed to strict policy) standard, I would choose Amazon, since that's where I always go to see whether a book is really worth buying.

    There are also certain ethical issues with Amazon. They censor books at whim, even after purchase - most flagrantly, removing copies of 1984 from buyers' ebook readers.

      As a side note, Amazon owns both [Goodsreads](http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/retailing/article/56575-amazon-buys-goodreads.html) and [Abebooks](http://techcrunch.com/2008/08/01/amazon-to-acquire-abebooks/) (which owns Bookfinder).
      ```

      - u/DataPacRat:
        ```
        ... Hunh. I'd missed that, somehow.

        Welp, I haven't got any further non-Amazon ideas, so I guess y'all might as well and go ahead and use whichever site you like.
        ```

        That post is perfect in my opinion. It really is amazing when you look up the chain and you find almost everything is owned by just a handfull of companies at the top. A(lmost a)ll TV and Music industries at the top are owned by a dozen companies, which are represented by just 2 lobbies (MPAA, RIAA). Similar things exist with food companies too.

        "You have the choice between Amazon, Abebooks, Bookfinder and Goodsreads. Amazon owns them all."
