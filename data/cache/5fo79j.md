  Whoa. Now this is a pleasant surprise.

  I like that Red's smart-assery and grandstanding is immediately backfiring in the face of a smart, better-connected, more powerful adversary. Excited to see what's next!

  Well that was rather dark, but props to Giovanni, having a Sandslash trained to the point it can still fight and win after that I think
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Thank you for this -- I like it
  ```
