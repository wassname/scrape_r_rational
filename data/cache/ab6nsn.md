  Wonderful. Perfect holmesian style. The last line is chilling.

  Also notable what the ~~only~~ main three spells cast were.

    Not the only ones though, he also cast Expelliarmus twice at Watson. Though I would have liked it more to keep it at just the three Unforgivables, it just didn't make much sense story-wise.

    But thanks! I was exactly trying to go for that feel :).

      True I had forgotten. But as we all know from canon Expelliarmus counters the Killing Curse, so it might as well be an Unforgivable :P

        Only if you have wands that are twinned with your opponent, or your mother's last act of love protects you, or you just won the Most Powerful Wand In The World through a Rube-Goldberg series of coincidences and so on.

          So... only when it's the MC who needs a deus ex machina? :)
          ```

            That, I suspect, is the rule, yeah.

  It's a great take on the Holmes and Potter settings. 

  I remember Neil Gaiman did a similar bit years ago by mixing Holmes and the Cthulhu mythos.

    It's funny you mention the mythos, because I feel like there's just a touch of Lovecraft in the ending to this story.  Forbidden knowledge reluctantly revealed as a warning by men trying to forget and Watson left with a lifelong paranoia, coupled with the verbose prose of the period, make me think of one of his protagonists.

      The reference is purposeful. I guess I wanted to also cast a muggle angle on the HP world - all whimsy and fun for the wizards, but really, straight up existential horror from our point of view.

      "H.P." Lovecraft, indeed.
      ```

    I know, though I haven't read that story yet, *and* realised too late that I too was involving an emerald. I swear the idea for me was just to allude to the Slytherin House colours.
    ```

    - u/PHalfpipe:
      ```
      Oh no, you have a totally original, interesting take on it. Neil Gaiman was just re-writing A Study in Scarlet with a twist ending.

  I wasn't sure about posting this here, since I did not write it strictly with the idea of making it rational, and Sherlock Holmes on his own isn't considered very rational as a character (what with his wildly inaccurate use of the term 'deduction' to actually mean INDUCTION, and often extremely speculative induction at that!). But in the end I decided to put it up since it still features some munchkinry and the notion of precommitment, so I thought it could be a fun read for this sub. 

  By the way, for anyone who's following The Optimised Wish Project... I'm working on that, but the Christmas holidays slowed down progress a bit both for me and my beta reader. New year will come with new chapters!

  Wow. I've read some Holmes books on project gutenberg, as they are on public domain, and this was fantastic.
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    Thanks! I read them *all* actually, back when I was a kid; all stories and novels. The full collection is I suppose in the order of ~1M words. I only reread some recently, should go back to some of them in fact.
    ```

      I'm similar, at the age of 15 or so I got a big 1960's book from my uncle with all the Holmes stories on it and devoured them. I recently got the free version for my Kindle and reread almost all of them. Still great to read.

  This was wonderful. I've always loved it when stories explored just how terrifying HP universe must be for muggles, and this fic fit the bill perfectly. I've also always loved it when fics truly explored how truly scary mind magic, as portrayed in canon, actually is. Rowling created a world where anybody and everybody with a wand could drug you (Confundus), roofie you (Obliviate) or completely enslave you (Imperius), and there's basically nothing you can do about it, even if your wizard, except exercise constant, never ending vigilance. Canon doesn't provide any wearable shields that block such spells, or anyway such spells can even be detected (since if there was a way to detect mind magic like that, I'm pretty sure Gringotts would have it). And given how Malfoy and rest of the Death Eaters, after the first war, claimed that they were innocent because Voldemort had Imperiused them, apparently its possible to be under the Imperius curse, and for no one around you to even notice (because I guess your captor ordered you to 'act normal')! And of course, all of this is even worse for muggles, because they both have no idea any of this is possible, and even less ability to defend themselves.

  Rowling created a setting that should, by all rights, be a hell state of paranoia and terror, and yet isn't, and I haven't even gotten into the sheer,  bottomless moral abyss that commercially sold love potions are. You can't drink anything without risking getting mind whammied. You can't be alone with anyone without risking being turned into their eternal slave. You can't come back from being alone with anyone without being certain they didn't do unspeakable things to you and then mind wipe you. Any brief moment of confusion of stupor could be natural, or it could be someone confunding you in oder to make you vulnerable to more mind magic (since if resisting the Imperius is a matter of will, being confunded beforehand probably makes that a lot harder); and the list goes on and on. Rowling created a wonderful, whimsical world, but honestly I don't think she really considered if it was one normal people and society could actually function in. 

  In America we can't even handle guns being readily accessible without having to deal with school shootings. Could you imagine what would really happen, if instead we gave every kid all powerful mega-tools, taught them all the incantations for morally terrifying mind magic just as puberty was hitting full steam (I think Harry and the others learn the incantation for Imperio at around 13), and then locked them all in a boarding school together?

  Anyways, this was a wonderful, wonderful piece of fiction, and your writing skills are excellent :)

  And here I was suspicious of >!Lestrade because of his name!<. This was great!
  ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    He's a well-established Holmes-universe character.
    ```

    - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
      ```
      Also one of the few regulars that always get carried over in the adaptations. In fact it's pretty usual to have him be the cop that Holmes always takes the piss off.
      ```

      - u/CCC_037:
        ```
        ...I think that that's Holmesian canon, too. Holmes never had a great opinion of the guy's intelligence.
        ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    Oh, because Lestrade/Lestrange. I wonder how is it that there are so many pureblood wizards with French names... guess they're all descendants from that William the Conqueror group (the Malfoys are canon as such). This actually reminds me, what would be *really* awesome is some alternate history of the wizarding world. Just like we know Grindenwald was the wizard side of WW2... what was it like during the Hundred Years War? Or the War of the Two Roses? Who were the first wizards that went to America? And so on. There's a lot of potential material, especially if you're a big enough history geek that you can tie together all these events in a clever way.
