## Something insane happens—you grow a tail and an a purple tentacle replaces your arm, and then the changes revert. How do you best determine whether you imagined the event?

  If it was only for a few minutes I would probably just _assume_ I imagined the event and move on, unless there was more reason not to. Sane people can hallucinate sometimes. Launching straight into hypotheses about gods/aliens/superintendence would be a ...can i say schizophrenic? response to that event.

    I agree I wouldn't assume it was real, but I'd probably look for other proximate causes for me hallucinating rather than just ignoring it and going on with my life.* Hallucinations are very rare and almost always accompanied by larger issues. not just spontaneously happening.

    Hypothesises would be:


    * Have I accidentally consumed a hallucinogenic substance? e.g. I think there's some kinds of mold that do it, or someone could hae spiked my food/water with lsd. If I have been at a party or group meal in the last 24 hours I would check with other people there to see if they're okay. I'd check if the supermarkets or re4staurants I'd gotten food from had any health scandals in the news, etc.

    * Do I have any family history of psychosis? 

    * Have I suffered any other symptoms that a quick google tells me are associated with conditions that cause hallucinations, e.g. headaches, dizziness, nausea. An based on that is it likely I have a brain tumor or something else needing urgent attention? 

    * is there some unexpected side effect of any medication I'm on?


    * Have I been sleeping enough, hydrated enough, etc

      Any unjustified feelings of certainty would (I *hope*) actually make me lean towards the mental problems hypothesis even more, but if no one is around to check it I will take out my phone, snap a picture, verify that I still see it in the picture, send and ask people what they're seeing.

          How does the fact that it can't it be filmed manifest? That would make me suspicious that it was a delusion. Anyway, once I somehow determined that I wasn't hallucinating which is a _very_ tall order I'd be trying to convince more people that it was real. And if I find that I can't for some reason, it would increase the probability that I was insane. I'd probably go live in an environment with lots of other people so they can observe the phenomenon. I'd also find other ways to make records if not video (E.g. put the tentacle against a mold, douse the tentacle in paint and press it against things, take a video of the tentacle's shadow, etc)

          I wouldn't bother limiting the spread of the information, I see no a priori reason to assume the information is dangerous or should be kept closely guarded.

              Does the protagonist *have* to be 100% rational and immediately check themselves into a mental institution? As a reader, having the protagonist acknowledge that they're *probably* hallucinating but still investigating it because of a strong feeling of it being real would be enough for me to feel that their actions are plausible.

              If it were me, assuming I also didn't seek help immediately, I would keep track of when it happens and what my environment is like to see if there are common threads between occurrences. I would start recording myself whenever socially appropriate. I would search internet forums for mentions of similar occurrences, and see if I can gain some sort of insight from other people discussing the phenomenon (even if I can't ever be sure that it's not just some crackpot on the other side of the screen).

              If I found someone who talks about an experience with the *exact* same thing that I was experiencing, I could use that as evidence that I'm not insane, although it certainly wouldn't be proof.

              I'd try to record myself knocking something over with the tail/tentacle/other anomalous appendages. If the recording shows things moving when I couldn't have touched them, that's pretty good proof of it being real. I would ask someone else to look at the footage too to confirm.

              It would be very difficult to convince anyone this was real. From an outsider's perspective, any footage could have been faked. I don't think I would even try releasing the information to the public, although I could probably manage to convince a few close friends if I was able to interact with things using the appendages in ways that are clearly supernatural.

              If it was just that no one but me could see it in any recorded format (including molds, paint prints, pictures of the shadow, etc), I don't think it would be possible to convince me in my right mind that it isn't a delusion.

              If additionally the mind influencing magic of the thing overrode that and made me believe it was real...well, I guess I'd try to see what happens if I could convince at least one person. Does anything bad seem to happen to the people I convince or do I just never convince anyone?

                  To an extent. The weight of that drops off sharply as the first few people confirm that it makes sense to think something strange is going on. (Because then, either I'm sane, I'm building an insane cult of a certain popularity, or I'm sufficiently detached from reality so as to hallucinate that people believe me, so convincing addition people after the first several may not help determining additional sanity. It would also be important that the particular people i convinced aren't particularly prone to believing in supernatural things and conspiracy theories, or the type prone to playing along with a crazy person's delusions to avoid upsetting them.)

                   But yes, if literally no one but me experiences these things or in any way confirms that there's some form of unusual phenomenon going on that can't be explained strictly by me hallucinating and confabulating explanations around it, i think insanity should be pretty high up there as a hypothesis.

          This might be a rough community for that.  In dreams, when weird things happen, I often conclude I can't trust my own mind, and spend the dream searching for an authority figure to surrender myself to.

            If I become aware that weird things are happening I generally go "oh, I'm dreaming, interesting" and try to take control inside the dream. This either makes me lose conscious awareness again and fall back into a full dream state, or wake up, or (on occasion) dream that I've woken up, which is followed by my realizing that I'm dreaming again and waking up for real.

  Idk. I once was so tired I saw a herd of zerglings cross the road. I assumed it was a hallucination, but just in case it was superimposed over people or animals, I slowed down and let them cross.  It was extremely vivid.

  I checked the news and asked friends. No one else saw anything odd. I ultimately decided if it was real, it doesnt matter with no proof or hostile actions.

  I would likely do the same with your scenario. If it goes away, cannot be duplicated, and never comes back...does it matter?

  As for proof, push the tentacle into something that leaves an impression. Like put paint on it and press it onto printer paper. Or a plaster cast if you have the materials. All this assumes you do not have a camera/super computer in your pocket.

      it was years ago and I had just started a new job with very long hours. This happened the first week of the job and was how I realized I was sleep deprived (I was so tired I hadnt done the math to realize how little sleep I was getting). I ended up having my mom drive me to work the next day and then slept for 2 days on my weekend. 

      I used it as a learning experience to make sure it never happened again...but since it worked out ok it gave me a funny story and some nerd cred.

    This is a good way of examining this question: How did rational people who've had hallucinations that were abnormal react? 

    I once had my home TV start showing things in 3D in my room, while I was in bed watching a twitch stream. I concluded that my sleeping meds had kicked in and I shouldn't try to fight them any longer to watch the end of the match. Easy enough decision even though I did keep watching for a while just for the slight amusement of knowing that I was having a hallucination. Knowing that didn't make the 3D effect of my TV look less real at the time. What made me certain it wasn't real was basically that me having a hallucination from taking sleeping pills was much more likely than my TV suddenly having 3D capabilities, so I turned it off an went to sleep since I clearly needed it.

    In hindsight I'm a bit sad I was too tired to think of trying to set up an experiment of moving my head to see some piece of game information that was previously obscured behind something else in the 3D display, since I shouldn't be able to gain new (correct) info from my hallucination and it would have been fun to see how my mind would try to solve that dilemma; if my mind made up info to fill that spot, what would I experience if/when that info was revealed in the "real" stream? For example it the streamer commented on the new info, would my, to my knowledge, only visual hallucination turn auditory too? Would my mind, knowing I was trying to see something it couldn't really know, just make up some likely guess, or would it go with it being a blind spot somehow, or maybe some otherwise dreamlike non sequitur?

  You check the video on your cellphone, obviously. 
  First reaction to anything extremely odd happening should be to record it, and if I found I had not done that, this would be both very out of character, and a sign a delusion was attempting self-defense by avoiding documentation, time to get a tox screen.

- u/hexane360:
  ```
  Let's use Bayes' theorem:

  P(happened given experienced) = P(experienced given happened)*P(happened)/P(experienced)

  We can assume we'd always experience it if it happened, so that probability is one. It reduces down to P(happened)/P(experienced). Using P(experienced) = P(happened) + P(hallucinated), it simplifies to 1/(1+P(hallucinated)/P(happened)). So if our prior is that the probability of hallucination is zero (and probability of happening is nonzero), then the probability approaches 1. However, if (I assume like most of us), the prior probability of hallucination is much larger than the prior probability of happening, the probability approachs 0. For example, if hallucinations are 10x more likely than happening, it's a 9.1% chance a given experience is genuine.

      You can't. If you're sufficiently insane, your mind is an Evil Demon and "I think therefore I am" is about as far as you can reason about anything. You have to make the assumption that you're not _that_ insane.

    - u/FurbyFubar:
      ```
      While I get your point, having hallucinations is not the same as "being insane". Mentally healthy people hallucinate vividly on a daily basis, or rather on a *nightly* basis. Of course, figuring out if you are dreaming,while awake or not, has many of the same issues as the question you are asking.

      But if you want the character you're writing who is experiencing the body change to feel rational, it's important to have them go with Occam's razor to ask the better questions at an early stage. That is "How can I figure out if this is a dream or hallucination? What caused it?" and not "How should I cope with and prepare knowing that my body at any time could change to have a tail and tentacle again?"
      ```

- u/Trips-Over-Tail:
  ```
  Firstly: being insane does not mean that the transformation wasn't real. Indeed, you only know that it happened to your arm externally, but there may have been any number of internal changes, including in your brain, and you don't know that they all turned back.

  Secondly: this is clearly the domain of Tzeentch, and if the flesh change is already upon me then there may be very little time before the grip of spawndom takes me completely. Giving my soul over to the Architect of Fate will award me both the knowledge I seek regarding that transformation and the additional, more lasting alterations that I crave. With luck, service to the Changer of Ways will grant some measure of control and reserve to these fluid, unstable mutations such that I can stave off spawndom for a time in pursuit of more prestigious fates.

  You’ll probably get better answers if you just tell us what the infohazard/thing/event is.

  A thing’s existence is the effects it has on the world. “Joe is hallucinating a blank paper is a picture of Elvis” and “Joe really has a picture of Elvis but only he can see Elvis while everyone else sees a blank paper” are synonymous. 

  The answer to your question is, determine the measurable effects of the event, then verify other people observe the same effects. This can include indirect observation.   
  If you have an infohazard that makes people Not Believe In Lizardpeople, you can tell a Friend “the infohazard I have in this box will change people’s views on Lizardpeople,” then expose a Believer in Lizardpeople to the infohazard. Your Friend can now verify that the Believer’s views have changed following exposure. This validates the existence of the infohazard without your Friend being exposed. 

  Depending on the nature of the infohazard you might be able to run tests on it directly.  If you take a picture and cover half the picture, does it still work? 3/4 the picture? One pixel?

- u/ArgentStonecutter:

  I run into people all the time who describe things they dreamed about as if those dreams had some deep meaning that implies something magical about the real world. I think if you're actually honest with yourself you have to treat anything that happens in dreams or hallucinations as unreal.

  However, I have never had an experience in a dream that was clearly real... where that details of it persisted for longer than I was paying attention to them, and when I returned my attention to an imagined object or place it remained the same. In a lucid dream, performing that kind of analysis either wakes me up (as if the dream itself depends on my being in a state of mind that precludes analysis), or I lose the ability to effect the dream and the awareness that I'm dreaming.

  So, if a physical event happens and it's persistent and analyzable, I have to assume that it's real or that my mind is broken beyond anything I've ever heard of being possible. I don't know how long it would have to persist before I'd accept its objective reality, but I'd say an hour would be well over the threshold but a few seconds isn't.

  - u/TrebarTilonai:
    ```
    I think this is incorrect from a first-person perspective. When you have limited visibility to a phenomenon, you may only see a piece of the pattern which might cause the appearance of a temporary weirdness even though it may be consistent in a system. A few examples off the top of my head:  


    1. You live in a universe with multi-versal properties, but for some reason another universe starts superimposing on yours at constantly moving touchpoints; you happen to get caught in one.
    2. The temporary weirdness from your perspective is the result of a being with higher power making a conscious decision to start and end the weirdness. Perhaps a wizard playing a prank; you have no way of determining this so the weirdness seems both temporary and arbitrary.
    3. The universe is, in fact, permanently weird but you have no way of noticing this with your given sensory receptors.

    &#x200B;

    From a first-person perspective, the universe can absolutely appear to go weird temporarily rather than permanently.

      These hypotheses are all anthropomorphic / are wrong for the same reasons that religion is wrong (they privilege a human perspective).

      The universe _actually_ getting weird laws on a local level in a way that is explainable when you look at the big picture would range from  "oh how interesting there was a huge peak in this spectrograph from 1990 onwards with no discernible cause" to "oops the observable universe just got destroyed because some fragile cosmic bubble somewhere just popped". 

      It absolutely wouldn't be "a tentacle appeared on your body". If that's the kind of weird you are experiencing, it is a product of your brain.

  My first reactions would be assuming that I was hallucinating, assuming a workday I would probably take the rest of the day off and try to relax.   

  If the event repeated, I would then attempt to discover if it was actually happening or if it was all in my head. Mostly by escalating the proof, keeping it private at first. Trying to acquire video evidence and reviewing it as the first step, then physical-effects (tentacle-in-spray paint print), very small wound (paper-cut-sized) in tail/tentacle (Does it hurt? blood sample - same red blood, or a deeper affect?). Then lastly covering up most of the tail/tentacle and exposing it briefly to outside perspectives (other people) to check for reactions at some local mall/store.   

  If people reacted to exposed tail/tentacle then I'd know something was definitely going on and probably head to a hospital. I would give everyone some excuse if they are freaking out (Haha, cool costume/prosthetic right?).  


  If it was constantly fading/in out.  I would probably get near a hospital (in the parking lot etc) then run in when it's visible again and try to get it professionally checked out (X-ray, MRI, Blood sample) to see if it was malignant.  

  Either way, also investigate possible “causes”, anything out-of-the ordinary happen lately? Exposed to something, something in the food/water? Replace food, acquire bottled water, add house-water-filtration system.
  ```

  - u/Rhylith:
    ```
    If in public people didn't react to the exposed tail/tentacle. To try and remove any doubts of my own sanity I would try to demonstrate (impossible) physical effects using the changed limbs in public to further gauge their reactions. Lifting a shopping bag with the tail and carrying it around would be a simple demonstration. Holding it in front of someone's travel path to see if it’s “invisible” or if it has some sort of congito-awareness altering effect to it.  


    (People walk into it, or people path around it)  
    See if people can touch it/freak out if they do touch it.   


    Now, this is where I’d have problems with the “additions” with other people’s awareness being altered one way or the other I would pretend said limbs were “normal” but I’d fake an injury to try and get an X-ray of the two areas to see if other media can pick it up. Wrapping the arm/hand up in ice packs. “I fell down the stairs doc, and my hand and tailbone hurt an awful lot, I think I landed badly on both of them”.  

    If I still get no reaction from anyone even from the xrays, then I’d give up on making others aware of the changes. I’d record everything I could about them myself (length, dexterity, strength, color (is it purple, exactly what shade of purple?) etc) taking copious notes and video/pictures. Continuing to live “normally” with the changed limbs (just keeping them exposed as if they were normal limbs) while checking to see if the flesh spreads, color changes, strength/dex checks, time of fading/in out changes etc.
    See if I can force differences by doing a wide variety of things, diet changes, weight changes, length of the tentacle/tail stretches.
    If no one else can perceive the changes then I wouldn’t worry too much about it.  


    If the effects spread/got worse, I would probably freak out about it privately. Slowly turning into some sort of tentacle creature would certainly put a crimp in my mood. But as long as no-one else could perceive the changes there really isn’t anything that anyone could do and I’d just look crazy by trying to draw attention to it. So I’d just try living with it and seeing how far the cognito-hazard effects extend by performing some minor criminal acts, use the tail to steal shopping bags/purses/wallets/laptops to see if people react.
    If not, increase criminal activity.  

    Why?  

    Several reasons, Ultimately since other people’s perceptions have become warped in regards to the increasing changes, then any injury or illness would have to be tended to by myself without outside assistance.  

    Future (unknown) changes might cause me to become immobile or cause physical impairment or my body might require a different diet or require mobility devices (motorized wheelchair, wheel-chair access the house). Or the cognito-effect might wear off when the changes complete, rendering me as some sort of tentacle-monster which would be "ill-advised" to wander the streets and/or hold down a normal job and would require delivery service for basic needs (grocery delivery, etc).   

    I would use this new “mixed-bag of shitty superpowers” to slowly acquire additional funds (robbing jewelry stores) via tail sneaking into the display counter targeting 24c gold-jewelry, melting it down into bricks, tossing most of the gems (most are engraved with serial numbers) and sell the gold bricks)    

    Try using some makeup/hollywood-style prosthetics to alter my face/features for longer term criminal activity for the jewerly stores. Jewelry keeps dissappearing while "this guy" is standing nearby.  

    Use jewerly store acquisitions to fund gambling, use tail to alter roulette wheel's ball to ensure a single win on a bet. Call it quits after a single massive win. (guy comes in, puts all his money on a single number, wins big and leaves). Suspicious yes, but with only a single data point, and video-evidence which probably shows the ball behaving oddly but "me" not near it and without any electronics on me (leave the phone in the car). Cash out, pay taxes.   

    And purchase medical equipment (Xray, MRI, sonogram), medical books (how to do blood tests, run an xray etc) basically set up my own little lab/doc office to both track changes and see where it is all going and possibly retire from job if changes are becoming too cumbersome.
