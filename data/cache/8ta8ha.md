## [D] Worth the Candle - Are you put off by the harem style arrangement of the main cast?

  In cases where the leading male character is surrounded by many women, for the purposes of titillating a male audience, I find it extremely off-putting.

  Regarding "Worth the Candle", I find it similar to watching Chris Tucker in films.  In *Rush Hour*, I cannot stand his character.  He is loud, obnoxious, and his sense of humor does not match mine.  In *The Fifth Element*, I love his character.  He is loud, obnoxious, and his sense of humor does not match mine.  The difference is that in *The Fifth Element*, everybody surrounding Chris Tucker has the same reaction to him as I do, being incredibly annoyed at him.  This changes the joke into a meta-joke, with his character being the setup for a joke, rather than the punchline.

  In "Worth the Candle", the social dynamics have not at all seemed like those of a catch-them-all style harem story.  Joon is shown to be in conflict with the game-layer wherever he has moral qualms with it.  Frequently when he has a heart-to-heart and sees a message that a loyalty score increased, his reaction is one of disgust.  The intrinsic motivation for getting to know his friends resulted in an extrinsic reward, cheapening the experience.  Similarly, Joon's anger at the achievement [](#s "A Key for Seven Locks (1/7)") shows the main feature is not one of Joon being in a harem story, but his disgust at being treated like a self-insert male protagonist into a harem story.

  Add to that the parallels between Joon and Arthur, and Joon's worry/dismay on hearing of [](#s "Uther's pedophilic relationship with Kuum Doona"): Joon is worried about what sort of a person the game-layer and narrative is trying to force him to be, and is trying to avoid being a self-insert protagonist in a harem story.

      Thank you!  I liked your question, and it made me stop and think why I have been enjoying "Worth the Candle", where the harem-style plots of other similar stories have made me stop reading them.

    I mean, in Fifth Element Ruby Rhod is a character who makes perfect sense in both from a Watsonian and Doylist perspective. In universe Ruby is a flamboyant media personality who serves as a microcosm of how weird and exaggerated the future is, so his behaviour makes sense for his character. From a narrative perspective his comic relief is contextualized by him being a fish out of water mixed up in events against his will or consent, so his presence in the story feels more natural.

    The presence Chris Tucker in Rush Hour by contrast is bizarre on both. From a narrative perspective he serves no other purpose other than comic relief to back up Jackie Chan's Wu Shu heroism with "comedy" (which is unnecessary because Jackie is a perfectly viable comedic actor) without brining anything to the table to resolve the story. From an in universe perspective you have to wonder how the hell Tucker \*made it through the academy\* let along became a Detective acting the way he does, his existence in the narrative is pure fiat and he's only there because Chris Tucker is a popular comedian with a distinctive voice who will help get butts in seats.

    So it's pretty easy to see why a viewer or reader might react negatively to certain story elements in some context and not in others if it a. fails to make sense from an in-universe standpoint to the reader and b. fails to justify why it needs to be a part of the story to the reader.

  > There are some things that I find outright distasteful like Joon's early claim that he finds it easier to care about the safety/well-being of females than males but which as far as I've seen went unremarked upon in the community. It completely changed the way I relate to the character since.

  Really? I mostly found that admission an admirable display of self-awareness. I think most heterosexual men find it easier to care about the safety & well-being of attractive females in their immediate social vicinity. That's just biology. Being aware of it doesn't make it worse.

  I think most people didn't really find it odd that Joon admitted that because it's an incredibly normal thing for most young men to think. Not to say that it's healthy, or that the culture that produces that state of mind shouldn't be changed, of course. But the culture does exist, and the mindset it produces is so common as to be considered the default.

  But another part of it is how much you appreciate the meta of the situation. Everything Joon is encountering is, to some degree, orchestrated by the DM. So we have that additional layer of separation between the events of the story and the author, and we can talk about what the DM was thinking instead of what the author is thinking. And that sort of thing is definitely not everyone's cup of tea.

    I would bet a not insubstantial amount of money that if Joon had claimed that he cared more about the well-being of men than women there would have been negative comments about it from the community. 

    I'm not wondering at what anyone was not surprised that Joon holds potentially misandrist beliefs/values but rather the fact that I've seen no one note that Joon might be a misandrist. After all, just because something is ubiquitous doesn't mean it's not prejudiced; infact prejudice is often so. 

    I understand the metal levels in the story---I'm not saying the author is some kind of man hater. Just communicating how I don't like the current cast arrangement and reaching out to see if anyone else had the same reaction.

      If there were negative comments they would have been about how that doesn't make sense for his character, not for him being sexist. Because, as I said, we live in a world where some degree of chauvinist masculinity is the norm.

      >I've seen no one note that Joon might be a misandrist. After all, just because something is ubiquitous doesn't mean it's not prejudiced; infact prejudice is often so. 

      Well, that's because that would be a weird, huge leap of logic that doesn't make any sense. Joon is definitely a little sexist, but that's more of the "women are fragile, precious things that need to be protected" sort of sexism.

      >I understand the metal levels in the story---I'm not saying the author is some kind of man hater. Just communicating how I don't like the current cast arrangement and reaching out to see if anyone else had the same reaction. 

      I mean sure, but you wrote that whole thing about the 'weird coincidences' of Fallewhatever being a soulfucker and Grak having a nonhuman gender and sexuality, so I thought I'd comment on why that is.

  This post should be marked as containing spoilers.  I also suggest moving it to be a comment on one of the WtC posts, instead of a post itself, which would target it more at people who read the story.  (This isn’t the WtC subreddit after all.)

  (I also feel this way about the other recent post of this nature, but it’s more of a gray area as that post is also about the nature of rational fiction in general.)
