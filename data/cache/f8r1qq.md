## Pyrebound 12.4

### Post:

With apologies for being a day late--a lot of obligations piled up this weekend, and I don't have a backlog anymore.

[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2020/02/24/chapter-12-4/](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2020/02/24/chapter-12-4/)

Pyrebound follows the adventures of Rammash im-Belemel as he struggles to make his horribly grim world less horrible and grim.  The first chapter starts [here](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/).  Thanks for reading!

  I discovered this the last time a chapter update was posted, and I'm glad I started reading.

    So am I!  I hope to wrap this up in fifteen arcs total.

  ```
  Some great dramatic moments in this one!

  Well... somehow this keeps getting downhill.

  I'm really not seeing any outcome for this where our protagonist and his companions don't end in a shallow, shallow grave before the year is over. They really don't seem to have any kind of plan in mind.
