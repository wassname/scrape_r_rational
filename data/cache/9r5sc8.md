  >Achievement Unlocked: We’re Not in Kansas Anymore

  >Achievement Progress: Oh the Places You’ll Go (2/64)

  Presumably this means there are 64 {planes/dimensions/worlds} including Aerb proper and the Infinite Library. If we include

  * Aerb
  * The Infinite Library
  * Earth (?)
  * The not-quite-the-Ethereal plane
  * The Plane of Drift
  * The 28 elemental planes
  * The (at least) four "mathematical" dimensions (m -space, n- space, t- space, and p- space)
  * The 26 non-excluded "dangerous" parallel dimensions

  That's 63, which is suspiciously close to 64, so although we might have included a spare single dimension this feels pretty close to the actual list. "The entirety of hell" might count as another, and Earth might not count at all. </speculation>
  ```

  - u/adgnatum:
    ```
    Since the number is already 2, I suspect it cannot count both Earth and Aerb.

    ...It might not be counting conventional-plane Aerb.

    That would square it with the fact that it wasn't at the start of the story. (On the other hand, there have been missed messages, it could be in there.)

      I wouldn't be surprised if Joon eventually shows up on Earth and gets a 3/64 popup, since the "game engine" wasn't active when he was on Earth. I'm certainly not going to say you're wrong, though!

    This is feeding in to my theory that The DM is some sort of future/alternate/etc version of Juniper and this whole thing is fundamentally solipsistic in some important ways. 

    (not really, this is just Unsong-ish excessive pattern matching... but I thought it was funny).

    I'm pretty sure that Earth doesn't count since if there were any possible way to get back to Earth, then Arthur would have most likely succeeded in reaching it. The hells probably count as a plane, and I think the last plane is wherever Arthur traveled to from Fel Seed's exclusion zone. Although it could possibly be Earth.

  > Quest Accepted: As the Spirit Moves You - There are no spirit mages left alive... Once you find the entrance to the Infinite Library, you might be able to find the lost power.

  Turning this into a quest could actually be a classic 'dick move' from Dice Guy. Joon's finally given a solution to his Level Up's yet in order to access the solution he needs to complete a quest...which gives him XP...which could very well level him up at Spirit Lvl 1 before he can actually utilise it. 

  Seems like the sort of thing Dice Guy would do. Of course, also like Dice Guy, there are workarounds as long as Joon realises the danger (or future Amaryllis writes about it).

        > a look at an uncomfortably buggy backend.

        My preference would be that one because I've done programming myself and am aware of just how easy it is to fuck up, but the closest to that we've seen anywhere else was this bit from Chapter 36 where his Mental went above the level that the emulation of his personality could handle: 

        > So after reviewing my questions again and finding nothing really worthy of note, I closed my eyes and put another two points into MEN, increasing my mental stats by one yet again.

          This just leads me to believe that the T-Posing really is a joke by the DM. Because I find it incredibly hard to believe that he would have designed this game without considering that Joon would raise his stats beyond what is natural. So he just threw these warnings into the game to screw with Joon, but also to let him know that he can continue to raise his stats without risking personality death.

      Jun's already got a capability like that with his HUD telling him the names of foes that he's defeated, but there might be times when defeating someone is a lot more difficult than just stabbing someone.

    Stabbing an artery in Joon's thigh then regenerating it would be brutal. It would ruin the targets' footing and probably cause lethal blood loss. Slitting the wrists of their gun hands could be a decent nonlethal tactic if he gets the tendons.

  - u/Law_Student:
    ```
    Agreed. The first use that occurred to me was killing entire armies. Or any other large group of people, if the holder were inclined to terrorism. And healing might not even be necessary if it turns out it combines with entads that reflect damage or buffer damage to the user or similar.  The party already has two items that I can think of that might work, Jun's armor and Valencia's armor.  


    Maybe actually doing it would get the dagger excluded for being OP, though.

  Lampshading confusion about cosmological origins is very neat. Yet another worldbuilding detail which helps with suspension of disbelief. There have been some great ones in the last few chapters. 

  >It felt a little awkward, but I had always been weird about physical affection with other guys.

  June is *still* modelling Grak as thoroughly male. His model of Grak is out of sync with reality in so many ways like that. It'll cost him. I love that the writing can be from June's perspective but still make that clear in not too unsubtle ways. 

  Similarly, June's almost complete lack of treating Ropey as a being with any personhood is starting to pay off. Beth must be thoroughly unimpressed at how clearly a large portion of the difference between how he treats her and how he treats Ropey is as a result of her ability to show off a cute female avatar for June to give a shit about.

    While that surely has an impact a far bigger impact would be the fact that one communicates through an extremely high fidelity human avatar and is capable of human-level verbal communication and the other looks like a piece of rope that has to contort its body into individual letters in order to communicate.

  Is the "Loading" from the library re-configuring, or from traveling to another dimension? If it is because of the latter, is the Aerb dimension unloaded? If so I wonder if Amaryllis will notice the world being unloaded. 

  (Then again the "Loading ..." (and T-posing) could just be flavor to reference video games.)

    Or Jun is in a simulation, and Aerb isn't really real. It'd explain an awful lot, like all the game mechanics and the observed bugs.

    - u/CreationBlues:
      ```
      I mean, it's 99.9% verified that Aerb (and earth) are being simulated, or some magical equivalent. And that's excluding the  game mechanics and bugs, as those are artificial knobbins put there by the GM. However, just because they're being simulated, doesn't mean that they're not real. 

      My theory is that Library magic is running using the same systems that were used to fast forward Aerb between Arthurs death and Jun's entrance, and the same system that lets the GM nudge probability and causality.

  >“But you’re the head librarian, right?” I asked. “You have ultimate authority.”

  That's not a "yes". That's the sort of thing I'd say if I wanted to give an evasive answer that wasn't a yes and was worried about truth-divining entads.

  Now, on the other hand, we do see this: 
  >“Left, left, straight, right, Head Librarix,” said the librarian with a short, casual bow. “Nominal directions, of course.”

  But still, I wonder - is there something going on where she doesn't have unilateral authority? A council/senate/whatever of co-equal rulers all given the title Head Librarian/Librarix/etc, for example? 

  Finally - could Bethel's production of books trigger a rapid expansion of the Infinite Library? If Bethel produced 100 million copies of "Missive From Mary of 20 Years In The Future to Juniper" could they flood the library reliably?

    Sounds like the kind of thing that would get a bad reaction from the library (i.e. from the DM). E.g. they show up and most of the library is indeed full of that book...but each copy is guarded very inconveniently by some sort of Fel Seed-y horror.

  - u/Badewell:

    My read on Raven's status is that she calls the shots as long as everyone else is more or less okay on what she's doing. She has a lot of leeway, but not enough that she could give any order and have it go unquestioned. Maybe if enough librarians think she shouldn't be in charge anymore they can ~~backstab her~~ call for a no confidence vote.

    > Finally - could Bethel's production of books trigger a rapid expansion of the Infinite Library? If Bethel produced 100 million copies of "Missive From Mary of 20 Years In The Future to Juniper" could they flood the library reliably?

  "Coactus es?" and "Librarix" are half-assed Latin. The former roughly translates to "Is this coercion?" and the latter to a feminine form of Libraror(?). They come from two different librarians out of contact with one another, so I assume it's the unofficial language of the Library... something secret they can speak if anybody shows up, or can use to develop Library specific jargon.

You could have more than one krin, but it wasn’t particularly common.

  WHY was library magic excluded?
  ```

  - u/RiOrius:
    ```
    It wasn't. It only works on the Library because of what it is, but it's not excluded. When Joon was redoing his skills some forms of magic were listed as excluded (like Ice Magic), but Library Magic wasn't one of them.

      It's just a suspicion of mine that I can't be sure of, but I think that farming bit was a reference or homage to Lord of the Rings. When Sam gets a hold of the one ring, it tries to corrupt him with temptation but he's such a simple guy, the only thing it can think to offer him is turning the whole world into his garden.

      53 exclusions are recognised by the 3rd Empire.

      > “Fifty-three,” came an answer from the bed. Amaryllis swung her feet off the bed and blinked a few times before standing up and looking down at her rumpled clothes in distaste. 

      6 of these were caused by magic items

      > It wasn’t entirely clear what the bounds of possibility were, as far as magic items went; six of the exclusion zones were caused by a magic item of one kind or another.

      13 (14?) of them are people, as described in the Slayer of Horrors quest

      > □ Murder in Duplicate - As soon as it was discovered by a precocious young girl, the ability for a person to duplicate themselves was excluded to a thousand square miles and that single person. Doris Finch lives her life in duplicate; to complete the exclusion, it will be necessary to kill every single one of her. (0/9,511,346)

      >□ Manifest Destiny - The fall of the Second Empire was, by some accountings, inevitable, but by others, it was the work of a single incident. The exact nature of the magic that allows the immortal man named Manifest to puppet his subjects from a distance is unknown, as is his exact location, but it is clear that with the magic excluded, his range is limited to only Lankwon, once the Imperial City, now the City Made Manifest. Defeating him will be an impossible task, but one that you have taken upon yourself.

      >□ A Door Into the Soul - Caldwell Gatesmith has the dubious distinction of being responsible for two exclusions. Through his portals, he keeps watch over his domain. If he spies you, and you do not meet with his satisfaction, his portals will cut with an edge designed to cleave time and space.

      >□ The Z-word - Captain Blue-in-the-Bottle is the reason that no one says it. That's his word.

      >□ Everything Eater - More monster than man, no one has seen Rove's face in four hundred years and lived to tell the tale. He sits at the center of a half mile of dirt, flesh, and garbage. If you slay him, you will be the first to have survived contact with him.

      >□ Better with Loops - Through magics unknown, a young boy of eighteen found himself reliving the same month over and over again, with death only bringing him back to the same crisp spring morning. Time does not behave within his exclusion zone, and only bringing a permanent end to his life will restore the area to normalcy. Beware, lest you be trapped in the cycle.

      >□ [REDACTED] - The more you [REDACTED], the more you [REDACTED], until [REDACTED]. Merely knowing his name makes him [REDACTED], and his gender alone is a piece of information you might wish you didn't have, if [REDACTED]. Better to go in blind.

      >□ Unwavering - In the beginning, they said that the goblin inspired loyalty, until it became clear that what he was doing was more literal than figurative. To kill him, you'll need to fight through a veritable army of his loyal servants, if you don't end up becoming one of them yourself.

      >□ Fleshsmith - For millennia, fleshsmithing was a noble trade of Pendleham, one practiced by noscere and ignoscere alike. When a small cabal took the craft too far, exclusion reared its ugly head, leaving Pendleham as the City of Flesh, where none dare tread.

      >□ Aches and Plains - Perhaps farming might seem an innocuous thing to evoke the exclusionary principle, but given the time and attention brought to it by a billion minds, it was inevitable that someone would breach its deeper secrets. The land of Pai Shep is now guarded by a single warrior-farmer, his fields impeccable, his power absolute.

      >□ Guardian of the Underworld - A machine of vast intellect, funneled into the body of a broken man. The people of Aerb have yet to pass his tests, but perhaps someone of a different world has the wherewithal to be allowed within his inner sanctum.

      >□ Finger of the Sun - When the elves broke Celestar, there were a small few who continued on with their research. The product of their effort brought nothing but pain.

      >□ Gone to Seed - There is a place on Aerb considered worse than the first four thousand hells. Fel Seed sits on a throne of living flesh, unable to spread beyond his domain, but with a rule of horror within it. You know his weakness.

      82 exclusions are skills 

      > 256 skills, 82 (!!!) excluded, 40 at one time for J, unrestricted # skills for others (why?), no limit for others (incl. self) (why?)

      8 caused by trying to abuse the Infinite Library

      > “Exclusions,” said Everett with a cough. “We tried. It caused exclusions. There was once a thing called a demiplane.” He sounded wistful, and not entirely with us.

      > ...

      > “Eight exclusions,” said Everett.

      Soul magic apparently accounts for multiple separate exclusions

      > we would have to either go into one of the exclusion zones that got soul magic partly excluded

      >...

  > Achievement unlocked: Bookworm

  I am pretty sure it's at least somewhat obvious, but no one mentioned it- this achievement most likely doesn't talk about Joon, but the library.  

  > I frowned. I had just the barest taste of Library Magic, and I already didn’t like it. I could feel more clearly now the way that it was intruding into my head, placing thoughts there as though they were my own.

  Library will deposit lots of thoughts and memories in Joon's head, in a very unsubtle way. 
  It's also quite likely that all the knowledge the library deposits, Joon would lose right after leaving the library.  
  ~~Other one of cthulhuraejepsen's works- The Library Unpublished, has the very rule encoded into it ([mentioned in](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11539230/chapters/27124041) >!part 57- the munchkin ending!<).~~

  >~~It seemed most likely that for whatever reason, people lost whatever they gained inside the library as they left it. At the same time, deeper inside the library, the possibilities might be even more endless.~~

  [EDIT: It was /u/vi_fi who made this work and now I wish I could delete this entire post.]

  All of this, combined with the fact that Joon needs to discover Spirit Magic (and the impeding level-up, possibly after discovering SM), leads me to believe that this arc will be focusing on identity and self-modification (by himself and *especially* outside forces).

  What's the issue with him levelling up? I don't remember anymore
  ```

  - u/ricree:
    ```
    He gets an extremely powerful and addictive burst of pleasure that is getting stronger with each level.

    Once he gained access to his soul and could identify his "values", he noticed that "level up" was gaining prominence to the point where it was becoming his number one priority.

    At present, he uses soul magic to artificially remove that impulse, but it has been returning stronger every time he leveled up, and the last time he did he couldn't bring himself to reduce it again (Amarilis did it for him). The worry is that if it happens with no soul mage at hand, he might become lost in the addiction.
    ```

- u/LupoCani:
  ```
  With this talk of Bethel drawing on the magics of the bottle, I suppose I have to register a prediction I've thought of - the locus will be "freed" by merging with Bethel, by putting the bottle inside her entad-eating cupboard.

  It probably wouldn't work on a number of levels, first and foremost Bethel not consenting to anything of the sort, but I believe it's at least technically possible. The resulting being should still be enough locus to count, wouldn't be drastically at odds with itself (Bethel does consider the Loci kindred spirits, and it's easy to see why), and it requires no powers not yet introduced.

  I don't consider it particularly likely, but on the off chance it does happen, I'd prefer to have guessed so publicly, and making wild guesses is a low-cost action.

- u/JonRain:
  ```
  So, one thing that I feel like has not been brought up for a while is the gods. I believe there were 5 of them. And Amaryllis even met some of them didn't she? Anyways although it has been stated that these beings are nowhere near the power of the DM it can be safe to assume that the are orders higher in power than most beings on Aerb. Yet they haven't ever really been brought up as being significant. Never mentioned to have had any interaction with Uther which is crazy because with how it seems the upper echelons of the mortals realized that Uther might have been bending reality in a way that was causing greater and greater mayhem you'd think the gods would notice. Are they excluded into their own little areas, do people worship them, how strong are they. Anyways yeah it felt like all these crazy other worlds and apocalyptic beings were being mentioned and yet not one mention of these gods so I hope they are at least mentioned somewhat.
