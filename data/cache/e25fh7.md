  ```
  Very fun read, although the nonsensical choice to attack the crazy people without a plan for guns is annoying.

    ```
    Yeah, that's the main reason why I described it as "rational-adjacent" and not "rational."  Not enough contingency planning.
    ```

    - u/Hust91:
      ```
      Like, if you didn't plan for guns when attacking people with guns, what were you planning in the first place?
      ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Destroying the millstone struck me as pretty flimsy.
  ```

- u/Nimelennar:
  ```
  An interesting look at what might be possible if we learned to send information back into the past.

  Not hard sci-fi, but I think the trope of munchkining future technology as a completely overpowered solution to a present-day problem makes it at least rational-adjacent.
