  The last image bothers me about not being able to move myself because the power works by using my own body as the center of a reference frame. Even if I can't use another object as the unmoving center of a reference frame, it should still be possible to move myself.

  Assuming that I am strong enough to lift someone up from the ground, I should be strong enough to 'push' down on someone with the same amount of force. If I then 'push' down on the ground, then I should be able to lift myself up, because the telekinesis is exerting force and the force has to go somewhere. So either the ground is compressed or I lift myself up depending on the hardness and density of the ground.

  Another way to explain my problem is that if telekinesis works by increasing the distance between myself and another object, there should be cases where the object is being moved and cases where I am the one being moved instead. The distinction between the two cases would likely come down to whether the object has less or more mass than myself.

    That is also the top comment of the linked thread.

    Of course seems to me like you could avoid doing all that and just wear a bodycage/kevlar clothes and try to move that away from yourself.

  The second point, that moving an object while moving is more difficult because of the relative motion, doesn't make much sense.

  Surely any object that you move while stationary is going to have relative motion as well. How are you able to handle that sort of relative motion but not the sort where you move too, or the sort where an object is moving before you "grip" it?

  I get that it might be more complicated in the case of running, where your centre of gravity may change quite a bit over your run cycle, but what about walking or using devices which don't affect your centre of gravity?

  Also, why is telekinetically moving yourself impossible? "Centre of mass" is a property of the "you system", not any individual part of you. You should be able to move, say, your torso to the same effect, unless telekinesis for some reason operates only on the human definition of an object like HPMOR's definition of canon transfiguration.

  There's a lot of questions that aren't answered, too. Which of Newton's laws apply? Could you lift a planet? Could you rotate a rapidly spinning object against its plane of rotation? Could you stymie a telekinetic by draping strands of cobweb between two objects? Could you move something you were standing on?
