  These videos have been an interesting exercise in understanding what kind of limitations apply even to characters existing in extraordinary circumstances as well as the mathematical concept of there being different orders of infinity to begin with.

  Wow! That's fantastic. Probably the most memorable demonstration of the diagonal argument I've seen â€“ as in, I'll probably remember it this time. I was genuinely surprised by one of the solutions, too. I'll have to send this to my brother! Thanks for sharing!

  I tried to come up with a solution to each problem before moving on to the next video. The first one I couldn't immediately solve was at the end of video three. I then saw the word diagonal in the comments here and that somehow inspired me to think up a solution. It turned out to be different than the solution given.


  For the problem posed at the end of video three, I would have each of the current guests go the the square of their current room. I would then have every visiting team member add up their team and player numbers, square that, and then subtract their team number and go to that room.

  This would leave empty rooms, but it fulfills the requirements of the problem. The solution given in video 4 doesn't explicitly state how they avoid taking infinite time going through each person in order, so I just assumed there was a formula to tell each person what their room would be using the diagonal argument.


  I was able to come up with a solution for the problem at the end of video 4 under the assumption that each visitor represented a rational number, but it turned out that was not the case.

    Yeah, although Part 5 definitely gives you a real sense of what it actually means for something to represent a different order of infinity at it's most fundamental level.

    And *that* I think is the real payoff for this entire mini-series/playlist.  Also it gives you a good feel for what exactly Vihart's whole ["Anti-pi" rant]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iUh_CSjaSw) is REALLY all about.  I freaking love it.

  I wish she would put Part 6 up.  I really enjoyed all of this, and would love to see some things with the infinitely branching hotel.
