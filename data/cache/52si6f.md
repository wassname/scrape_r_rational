  I made some Glimwarden fanart while waiting in between chapters.  

  [Hope I got the details right.](http://i.imgur.com/Vyps3ZW.jpg)

  And with [title text.](http://i.imgur.com/IvLerR1.jpg)

  I am not sure what I visualised in my head is actually how it is supposed to be what is described in the story.  All the clothes are early 1900's-ish because the conversation about horses being replaced by tractors was something that happened in IRL history.

    Neat! Those are all very close to what I'd pictured while writing.

    Sander is very close to how I imagined him, I was surprised

      And Melanie is close to how I imagined her.
      ```

      I based the drawing on my initial impression of the characters after the first read-through.  The details sometimes don't match after a closer second reading, but that first Sander chapter was really great and memorable to me.  I think it was the bollards.  I've never seen bollards in fantasy before.

    This might be my bias creeping in, but Sander and Philip look kind of obnoxious.
    ```

    - u/lonsheep:
      ```
      It might just be you.  I wanted to draw them not only as I saw them, but also incorporate something of how in-universe characters see them.  Melanie is the curmudgeonly old man in the body of a teenage girl, Sander is the guy who does stupid heroic things, Philip is the cool and calm guy who looks heroic.  

      I cringed a bit when Philip told his mother he liked his father more and made her cry.  It might be obnoxious, but no one in Light's Hollow knows about it, and I wanted to draw Philip in the way they know him, and how he wants them to see him.

  Apologies for the delay. I've been spinning my wheels while writing, which is never a pleasant feeling. I wouldn't quite call it writer's block, as it's more borne of indecision and second guessing than anything else. (I'm still hoping to wrap up the first book by the beginning of November so that I can take a break for NaNo without having to come back to a bunch of open threads.)

    >first book

    A series is planned?

    I hope it's so. This story has left me wanting more in a way that it took Limelight much longer to.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      Not really a series, just logical divisions of the serial. In 5-6 chapters there will be a point where I can definitively say "this is the end of this first section". The current plan is for between 3-5 "books", with the story being maybe half or two thirds of the way through the first book. (Assuming that I can hit my deadlines, there will be break between Book I and Book II during November, since I'll be working on finishing *The Dark Wizard of Donkerk* then.)

          I feel robbed :P  That was so good, but ended so abruptly.  I am super keen for the ending.
          ```

- u/blazinghand:
  ```
  I'm glad to see a new update! I feel like the pacing has been good these last few chapters. Even though I rarely comment and just silently upvote I wanted to say that I enjoy this story a lot, even if I don't often write that this is the case.
  ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  It's funny, Melanie was the character I liked the least when the story started, now she's my favourite. Both because she grew on me and because I'm starting to dislike Philip and Sander, for different reasons.

  By the way, I take back everything nice I said about Philip. Divide and conquer? Really? You're an asshole.

  Otherwise, I'm glad this story is starting to tackle the "Immigrants with nowhere to go need to integrate among people with fundamentally different beliefs" issue. It's a currently relevant, complicated, super important issue and I really look forward to see alexanderwales' take on it.

  Not wanting to be nagging, but I miss my fix of good/free/regular webfic - any idea when the next chapters going to come online?
  ```

- u/DamenDome:
  ```
  Curious on the status of this fic. For awhile, this was the only story I was reading in the /r/rational community, so I'd love to see it continue! Any word on an update, or are you officially "abandoning" it? Either way, hope to see more writing from you soon, it's always a reading pleasure.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    A new chapter will be up within two weeks. I'm probably going to be doing longer chapters less often, though in part that means trying to manage narratives a little differently.

  ```
  Anyone getting strange feelings about Golland?

  Think he might have something to do with the lantern failures?
