## [BST][Q][D]Describing your ideal world using a CYOA? What would a fun utopia to be in actually look like?

### Post:

Hi there, I was looking at a cool tool for generating settings, and I was trying to come up with an ideal setting that, uh, 'maximize awesomeness!', or other rationalist sorts of theory of fun things.  I'd like your all's contributions and help coming up with something!

So, to give this a bit of structure, I'm going to limit it to optimizing the 'magical realm cyoa' for 'best possible situation for someone in our in-group with our mostly shared values and memespace to spend eternity at, or at least as their home base.'

If you have no idea what Magical Realm CYOA is, here's some links:

https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Magical_Realm_CYOA And this has some samples on it, too

And here's an example thread with a bunch of people's builds:

Also, why this is really really hard and why I need help with it, and also a reminder of how to make this actually fun, that I am having trouble with, and need some help brainstorming how to actually follow these:

  Easy enough to munchkin: get Tech Upgrade 6 and Insertion. You have now created the Singularity on Earth, which enables virtual realms with infinite baubles for everyone.
  ```

    ```
    Don't forget *some* magic, to circumvent heat death and Protection 2 in case there's a paperclipper about to hit us at lightspeed, in case older Singularities win in a war.
    ```

  I like the base premise, but the format seems kind of rigid.  I took a few stabs at it, but each time gave up, feeling constrained.  Not constrained, mind you, by the limited baubles - more by the alternately overly-discrete and maximally capped options.  When imagining a fantasy world, I don't see the point in dithering around with unimaginably large quantities instead of jumping straight to infinity - an option consistently denied here.  You can say that infinity's meaningless, and you can say that I should be satisfied with Graham's number or whatever, and I say, alright, but why am I expected to care about the difference between five times the size of the sun and a quarter the size of the sun for any reason except "hitting the highest number available"?  "My fantasy world is thirty trillion square kilometers" is the nerd equivalent of "the streets of Heaven are paved with gold" - you're just offering up the material best thing you can imagine, and in the process demonstrating that you have a really terrible imagination.  Yes, the amount of time required to fully exhaust the novelty of thirty trillion square kilometers cannot be meaningfully imagined by us, but this is /r/rational, have we suddenly gone all deathist?  As the linked Fun Theory sequence suggests, a common mark of bad theology - which is, let's face it, basically what we're doing here - is a critical failure to understand what the *eternal*, what the *infinite*, *means*.

  Also, I never actually got so far in as to run short of baubles, but I weep for whoever spent their time contemplating, balancing, and assigning bauble values to various traits.  What a waste of effort.  Resource management and creativity can mix, but not, I feel, like this.

  To be fair, I'm guessing some of this depends on knowledge of a specific tabletop setting with which I am unfamiliar.

  If I was trying to get everyone into the [Beisutsukaiverse](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Beisutsukai) by connecting my demiplane to Earth (and then making myself a typical citizen after that):

  [140] Rolled: Trapped!

  [125] Area Increase 8

  [121] Portals

  [116] Gateways 3

  [110] Protection 2

  [107] Assimilation

  [104] Transient

  [102] Pretty Population

  [100] Population Demographics

  [97] Population Longevity

  [93] Metahuman Population

  [85] Magical Upgrade 4

  [83] Aesthetics

  [82] Public Education

  [80] Wealthy

  [76] Mystical

  [75] Healthy

  [74] Music Affinity

  [73] Art Affinity

  [72] Intellectual Affinity

  [71] Food Affinity

  [70] Sexual Affinity

  [69] Festival Affinity

  [64] Fauna & Flora 3

  [61] Exceptional Materials

  [58] Landscape Adjustment

  [55] Magical Phenomena

  [50] Dungeons 3

  [48] Spirits

  [45] Afterlife

  [42] Fate

  [39] Lifestyle Upgrade 2

  [37] Immortality

  [34] Spirit Walk

  [32] Shape Shift 1

  [30] Memory

  [28] Awareness

  [26] Peak Condition

  [23] Superhuman Body

  [22] Levitation

  [20] Healing

  [17] Time Manipulation

  [16] Friendship 1

  [12] Waifu 2

  [11] Influence 1

  [1] Divine Spark

  Have everyone on Earth march through the gateways, which should take about a month, and you're as close as you're going to get using this CYOA.  Plus Healing would let you pull off resurrections of dead people from Earth itself, so I threw that one in even though it's not Beisutsukai standard.

    ```
    Senpai! Could you describe some of your decisions with, uh, at least a sentence description of the bit? Not just the choices, but your tweaking of a particular choice, or your reasoning, or anything like that?
    ```

  - u/TennisMaster2:
    ```
    I've always wondered: why is it "Beisutsukai" rather than "Beizutsukai"?
    ```

  ```
  Minimum point-cost utopia, since I pretty quickly realized I was going to have some left over. My personal perfectly free utopia, on top of which you can add whatever:

  [89] Area Increase 6

  [86] Transient

  [84] Division

  [82] Magical Upgrade 1

  [77] Technomagic

  [75] Infrastructure

  [72] Afterlife

  [69] Fate

  [67] Blessing

  [57] Guidance 2

  [56] Insertion

  [55] Attitude Adjustment

  [80] Trapped!

  [105] Partnership!

  [100] Technology Upgrade 5

  Area Increase: may as well max this, but [Area Increase 6: 11pts] should be enough for the foreseeable future.

  [Division: 2pts] and [Transient: 3pts] allow you to switch between location categories at will for arbitrary subsets of your territory, most notably [Insertion: 1pt].

  Inhabitants: [Attitude Adjustment: 1pt] makes them universally benevolent. If you want them to outnumber pre-existing humanity, it might be worth springing for [Population Increase 9: 16 pts] or higher. 

  Magitech: [Magical Upgrade 1: 2pts] means there's a widespread population with powers "about as potent as what you might start with in the Powers section", which includes perfect healing and resurrection, breaking . [Technomagic: 5pts] makes it explicit that magic and technology can be combined. [Infrastructure: 2pts] reaches "across the globe", so free first-world everything everywhere. [Afterlife: 3pts] will catch anyone not saved by all the other safety nets; it's up to you, so just make it "reincarnation will all memories intact".

  Future-proofing: [Fate: 3pts] means everything will be subtly but irresistibly guided into whatever. [Blessing: 2pts] guarentees that everything will be a utopia, which seems kind of broken but whatever. [Guidance 2: 10pts] contains "anything and everything that could be necessary to advance or improve oneself", but [Guidance 1: 4pts] grants "untold amounts of information and arcane guidance [...] guidance in any path you wish to take", and is also indestructible, so really this one's up to you.

  Munchkinning: [Trapped!] isn't exactly a huge hardship, especially given you can move small parts of you territory into the real world and manipulate them at will. Neither is [Partnership!], given that you don't really need any extra personal benefits in this setting.

  ___
  It's probably worth springing for [Secure], [Healthy], and [Public Education], all of which are 1pt each, just for that shiny new "Utopia" feel. 

  [Technology Upgrade 6: 6pts] gives you "singularity" levels of tech, whatever that means. [Automatons 2: 5pts] removes all menial labour, if that's not already covered (they're under your personal control.) 

  [Artifact!] is pretty much fine, although it may not be worth risking your [Blessing] for a measly 20pts. [Amnesia!] isn't too bad, either, especially given you have a magic book/library that'll tell you everything.
  ```

- u/Rhamni:
  ```
  I like this one. We see it on /r/makeyourchoice every now and then.

  Does anyone happen to know if there are any tools that could be used to make my own interactive version of this? I've made a similar MYC set in my Fantasy world (so less world building and more carving out your own place in it), but since I don't have any artistic talent, I think the interactive version is the way to go.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    The interactive version linked in the OP is dead simple to code. It's just simple HTML and simple javascript mixed together, most of which can be stolen for your own without too much hassle. If you'd like help with it, just shoot me a PM.
