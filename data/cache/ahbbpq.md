## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  I recently started rewatching Stargate: Atlantis on amazon prime, a show that I haven't seen since childhood. Almost done with season 1, and so far it holds up *extremely well*. In fact, it's even better than I remember it, especially when episodes are watched back-to-back so the season-long arc becomes crystal clear.

  The show does so many things well:

  * Great cast playing lovable characters
  * Great chemistry between the characters
  * Great soundtrack, as per usual for a Stargate show
  * Extensive subtle references to classic sci-fi, including Star Trek, Apollo 13, and Alien
  * Usage of good-old-fashioned hand-painted vistas as backdrops
  * Great balance between season arc and episode arcs
  * Interesting moral dilemmas
  * Pretty good technobabble
  * Half the episodes barely even have a conflict because they are just about the thrill of discovery
  * Characters learn from past episodes and tend not to make the same mistakes twice
  * Characters generally cover the obvious possibilities when making their plans

  Sure, the characters are no rationalists, and they do sometimes hold the idiot ball or conveniently forget some amazing technology they encountered in a previous episode, but no more than any other serial television show, and probably much less. (Without idiot balls, most TV shows wouldn't exist at all). The main villains, the Wraith, are quite campy in design, but I actually like this, because it fits the tone of the show quite well. There is the convenient fact that literally everyone, human or alien, on every planet, somehow magically speaks perfect idiomatic modern English, but I'm fine with this suspension of disbelief, because it allows plots to move forward without the same annoying translation problems every episode.

  When I think of the constraints placed on the show by budget and tone, I actually think the worldbuilding is rather genius. The Wraith are a clear nod to Alien, while their campiness takes the edge off the horror to preserve the mostly lighthearted tone. And the fundamental premise, that ancient humans spread colonies around the galaxy which are now mostly in a primitive fallen state co-existing with mysterious ancient technology, not only allows the showrunners to save lots of money on set pieces and character designs, but it also makes for very interesting plot dynamics.

  I was also impressed by the number of times I was thinking, "why don't they just solve their problem with this?", only for one of the characters to raise that point in the very next scene and either incorporate it into the plan or explain why it won't work. ("Why is a storm threatening this powerful ancient city?" "Oh, it's because they relied too much on their shield, but now we don't have enough power for it."; "Why don't we go back to that one planet and get that one thingy" "Oh yeah, good idea, let's puts that on the table";  "Why don't the wraith dial into stargates to prevent people from escaping?" "Oh wait, they actually do use that tactic when they need to")

  I'm sure there are plenty of other flaws in the show, but so far I'm loving it enough that those don't matter.

    Stargate is probably my **nÂ°1** franchise that needs more rational fic, more than Animorphs, Steven  Universe, Mass Effect, She Ra (the reboot), Totally Spies, and Legend of Korra all put together.

    (ok, maybe not Totally Spies, but I *really really* want a good rational fic for any of the others)

    I also loved that show growing up!

    I haven't done much rewatching of it, but I remember two things that struck me back then, when I'd compare the first season to the 4 following seasons.

    1)  The costuming.  An in-depth analysis of fine technical details is beyond me, but I definitely felt like the costuming improved after season 1: somewhat in the outfits worn by the main cast, but mainly in the diversity of Wraith characters that later appeared.

    2)  Later season arcs.  I remember and really enjoyed how the first season gradually developed into the 3-part finale (the third part being the premier of season 2).  But later seasons didn't feel as established to me; as interesting as later season finales were, the development didn't seem as strong.

    But then again, my impressions may also benefit from a solid rewatch of the series.  Just two things I thought I'd share.

    I am appalled by you liking Atlantis! It holds no candle at all to to original Stargate.  No part of the setting makes any sense at all. Wraith suck "life energy" which ages the victim? They are not even trying for any kind of pseudoexplanation. Welcome to fantasy land, vampires were just in at the time of writing.

    The McKay character is so very socially incompetent and clichee that its offensive to nerds anywhere - his very mode of operation is to ignore common decency, chain of command, endanger his team. If one were to tally up the the numbers on how often he safed the team vs how often he fucked up, I am sure it'd come up as a deficit. 

    The Magical McGuffin that are ZPMs annoy me to noend. "Basically unlimited" energy, except that they run out every second episode. 

    About the only good pieces of Atlantis is this predeployment rat!fic http://synecdochic.dreamwidth.org/122553.html and some of the old character episodes.
    ```

    - u/TheTrickFantasic:
      ```
      I have to disagree with you.

      The process of Wraith feeding was described as a complex physiological process that *resembled* physical aging.  More details would have been welcome, sure.  But from the scientist characters' perspective: it is at first something that they've never seen before, getting samples of Wraith to analyze is dangerous, and for the few body parts and corpses that were recovered over the course of 5 seasons, those analyses would take time.

      McKay may have suffered in the consistency of his character development, depending on the writer, but I doubt he was ever that bad.  His most catastrophic failure in the series, in "Trinity", only endangered himself and Shepherd (before the Daedalus intervened).

      As for the ZPMs... first, I give them a pass under Clarke's Third Law.  Second, they were never described as unlimited, just huge.  And while every second episode in the first season might have revolved around looking for them, I cannot remember a single episode post-season 1 that revolved around a ZPM running out.  Feel free to remind me, if there's one you specifically have in mind.  Also, I question calling the ZPM a McGuffin; the characters need one in order to supply (huge) power to Atlantis, and once the have finally have one they are able to access more of Atlantis' capabilities, like the shield.  They story doesn't have them search for one purely for the sake of searching for it.
      ```

      - u/LupoCani:
        ```
        There were, strictly speaking, three times the ZPMs ran out or needed replacement past season one.

        When experimenting with universe bridges, sending alternate!McKay back to his universe drained the ZPM, which later allowed the (thus shield-less) city to be taken over by replicators. The replicators installed their own ZPMs, a full set of three even, which the expedition kept when the replicators were defeated. Of these, one was taken to power Earth's drone chair, one was installed on the Odyssey, and the third remained in Atlantis to power the shield.

        When Atlantis fled the planet to avoid the Replicators' satellite beam weapon, taking a glancing, unshielded hit to the main tower in the process, the resulting energy leakage drained the ZPM over the course of about a day. Unable to land on a planet without one, the Replicator homeworld was raided to acquire another ZPM, at the expense of their main trump card - the ARG - which they had to abuse enough that the Replicators ended up adapting to it.

        Finally, since the city can't normally fly without a full complement of three ZPMs, they had to be given another two by Todd in the series finale. (Don't get me started on _everything else_ about that finale, though.)

        Of course, these were rare, exceptional events, and the assessment that they "run out every second episode" is blatantly exaggerated.

      Haven't seen the original Stargate in a very long time, so I don't have a comparison, but...

      * Literally all TV shows do things similar to what you describe. Like, literally all. If I rewatched SG1 I'm sure I could come up with similar criticisms. If I held TV to rationalist standards I wouldn't be watching any TV at all (maybe that would be for the best)
      * I am therefore willing to suspend disbelief regarding characters who would have been fired in the real world
      * Stargate Atlantis is just loads of light fun for me, and a callback to when I was a kid

      Edit:

      Also, regarding Wraiths, the lifesucking is a perfect plot device for television, because it provides a villain without being too graphic in violence on screen. And speaking of magical McGuffins... this is a universe based on magical stargates that make no physical sense... you just sort of go with it. The physics is not the point.

      Um, are is the user of this comment and the original post user friends or something? Cause it seems kinda, well, mean to say you're appalled by someone liking something and then say that the thing they like is irredeemable in so many words. 

      I wish that the response had been more like, "I'm glad you liked it, because I had a hard time finding the Wraiths interesting due to the lack of explanation on their energy draining power, really took me out of the show."

      I don't know if I am supposed to read sarcasm into it or some kind of playfullness, but if the original poster didn't read those things in, well, this does seem kinda mean, and it would be cool if we were all careful about that, because tone isn't present in text unless you really go out of your way to be explicit about what you are conveying.

      Hopefully I am just misunderstanding.

  This might be a little weird but I really enjoyed [Tangled: the series](https://youtu.be/f-K6b6mPnkM) and been following the second season now. For someone that spends lots of time working, an idealist and relaxing adventure show is great. I can see where the SoL appeal in anime is.

  I also loved the twist of >!a supporting cast character becoming the big bad!<, and seeing all the hints there makes all the previous interactions take on a new light. The fact he becomes evil because of all the abuse and faults the "heroes" inflicted on him makes more sense than other series villains and feels slightly rational, making me instantly side with him.

  Plus I'm a sucker for >!scientists and one man industrial revolutionaries!< in fantasy worlds.

  The world feels so lively and the writers made good dialogue and chemistry between the characters without making them overly childish, which surprised me and made me feel less guilty about watching a cartoon usually pushed  to the "little girl" demographic lol.

  The romance keeps progressing and is refreshing to see the main character change and develop a wider emotional range across the episodes, and have intimate interaction and support between the two lovers unlike other series that try to stall any romantic development until the end.

  They even got the original movie cast to voice the characters and the art style and color palette is relaxing and makes sense if you read the reason they used it. IMO one can feel the passion behind the project and I wish it had more fans, especially people I could discuss it with.

    I think the *Tangled* series is pretty good at what it's trying to be: a "lesson of the week" kid show. I'm not really sure I like the turn the first season ending and second season took to a "adventure of the week" format with fantasy tropes and mysteries.

  I've just finished Chapter 31 of Pokemon: The Origin of Species. Unmarked non-specific spoilers for up to that point below.

  I'm getting a little exhausted from the constant near-death experiences (said the guy who likes wildbow stories). If what Red, Blue, and Leaf are going through is in any way typical for new trainers, how on earth does anyone make it out of their first year? I don't think mortality rates have been explicitly stated, but yeesh they must be terrible. And this is with a trio that seems like they're probably in the top percentage of ~~rattata~~ 12 year olds in terms of experience, preparedness, and intelligence.

  ...oh hey I was double checking on the age and found my way to the FAQ. Let me check that out...

  (wait does the Temeraire series eventually address how dragons are treated seriously? I only read the first trilogy and after the one person who brought that up >!turned out to be the villain!< I didn't think it would be relevant anymore).

  Alright then. I don't really have a problem with the justification for smarter than average kids or kids doing something this dangerous- especially since these kids in particular have good reason to be that way, and the world is definitely dangerous enough to justify it. In general I'm liking that- I love the idea of the legendary birds being an endbringer-ish sort of threat. 

  It's not the suspension of disbelief over plot armor that's getting to me so much that the constant "almost dying" on the road is a bit oppressive. I'd like to see the cast deal with problems that aren't just life or death battles. I liked the Pewter city chapters because we finally got a chance to *breathe*, and to see the characters actually in their element.

  Sorry if I'm rehashing old ground here, I haven't looked at any other reviews or discussion but I'm sure there's a reason the FAQ lead with those questions. I am definitely enjoying the story.

    I don't think RBG are typical new trainers. The mortality rate is probably pretty bad, but RBG intentionally dive into any crisis situation they possibly can. Though also, I'd expect higher fertility rates too.

    >(wait does the Temeraire series eventually address how dragons are treated seriously? 

    Yes. >!Napoleon takes up the mantle of dragon rights, and allies/tries to ally with polities (imperial china, the aztecs) that have very non-western perceptions of dragons, so Britain has to change how they treat dragons to avoid defections.!<

    I think the early wild Pokemon attacks are kind of a point the author is trying to make. How many times did you get attacked by wild Pokemon when just trying to travel from place to place in the games? The early areas are especially bad for that because they don't even have a path from point A to B that isn't overgrown with weeds that Pokemon like to nest in.

    The random brushes with death let up later on and are replaced with brushes with death that result from the group doing something stupid like ignoring warnings from the rangers and rushing into a situation they are unprepared for. Not sure if that's much better but at least you know to expect it or that you don't need to worry as much. Even the ~~endbringers~~ legendary birds follow somewhat predictable patterns because of the weather.

  I just read two opinion articles discussing how the current climate of fake news is likely to intensify via an impending deluge of homemade fake video and audio, courtesy of new editing software.

  I'm interviewing at Harvard Law next week! HLS was my biggest reach and it's extremely gratifying to receive an interview invite after being rejected by HBS and waitlisted after interview by MIT.

  I've realized that I have no idea what goes on in the admission process. I thought I was a shoo-in at HBS/MIT and a long shot at HLS.

  It's surprising because my background is in business and my GPA is sooo far below HLS's 25th percentile GPA of 3.8. Who the hell maintains a 3.8 over four years? That's ridiculous.

  HLS interviewees have a 60-80% admittance rate. Fingers crossed!

    I'm very pleasantly surprised to see this opinion from you; I recently rewatched Mary Poppins myself, was also very impressed by it, and was somewhat disappointed to see you refer to "the sanitized Disney movies" in a comment on MPE.  (Incidentally, the new movie actually *is* utter shit; it succeeds well enough in replicating the *stylistic* content of the original, I suppose, but has zero understand of the *thematic* content of the original, to the point that only a modern Hollywood studio could possibly have made a followup so vacuous and empty.)  I think that this is a fairly common narrative about Mary Poppins - many people are vaguely familiar with the Disney movie, but haven't really given it a deep watch, just associating it with vague memories and exaggerated cultural tropes, sometimes so strongly that they could actually watch the movie but pay no real attention to it and not notice what they're doing.  Then some of them also read the original books, note the differences between the books and the movie, and decide that the movie is a broken or watered-down version of the books.  (I think that similar processes must have been at play in the development of the new movie.)  In actuality, the movie is its own thing, and I personally think it's an *extremely thematically coherent* piece of *great art*.  So, assuming that I'm correct that you rewatched it sometime after posting that comment, I'm very glad that you've come around.  :)

  - u/ulyssessword:
    ```
    You have to narrow it down more.  What features do a phase-shifted object have that would interact with the two-slit experiment that *wouldn't* interact with eyes?  

    Remember [Universal Fire](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LaM5aTcXvXzwQSC2Q/universal-fire): Just because something isn't *the archetypal example* of something (two slit experiment for QM, matches for fire) doesn't mean that it isn't *an* example of it (eyes, cellular respiration).  In the same way that "stopping fire" means both stopping matches and respiration, "interacting with quantum mechanics" means interacting with both double-slit experiments and people's eyes.
    ```

  - u/I_Probably_Think:
    ```
    I think the issue here is that your premise needs more context. Primarily, what do you mean by "phase-shifted being"? Secondly, what do you mean by "detect using a double-slit experiment"? The double-slit experiment is a demonstration of an interesting physical phenomenon that helps to validate a prediction of quantum mechanics; is your suggestion to have a double-slit experiment set up and then for your phase-shifted being (this is where we really really need more context/clarification!!) to somehow interact with that?
    ```

  - u/CreationBlues:
    ```
    I'm pretty sure that that statement doesn't make sense. First, what does "phase shifted" mean? Does that have something to do with intangibility? If so, that kind of axiomatically prevents it from interacting with physical phenomena like the double slit experiment. If it did, it would have to do something really weird, like muck up probability on a quantum scale. 

    I'm not sure the wave function refers to an actual wave, and if it did, then I'm not sure what it would mean for something to be "shifted" relative to it.
    ```

    - u/Kuratius:

    I understand they've just been through a third rewrite, but the opening 25 chapters or so are really poor, even by the standards of web serials which I always find tend to start badly.

    Once you get through that it's a solid alternate world fantasy story. I'd say the best thing about it is just that it's different in a lot of ways. The locations, and the author's style and preferences , contribute to a more unique take on a fairly normal plot.
