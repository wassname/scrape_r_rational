  > Use them all and save often, there's no autosave in the game!

  There is an autosave, the 100th slot is an autosave slot, saving at each new screen.

  That having been said it won't be enough -- it'll suffice if you messed up a fight, but not for bigger strategic failures like misusing funds, failing to blackmail an official, or whatever.

  It's a LONG game, and you'll sometimes feel like redoing an entire chapter if you got a suboptimal result, so what I recommend is using the 50 first slots or so at the beginning (or before the end) of each chapter/major story bit and **keeping** those saves indefinitely, and using the other 50 slots to save near constantly, or for alternate/experimental decision paths, etc

  Oh, I think I tried this a few years ago when it was still unfinished. Gotta be the same game with that combination of porn and the initial twist.  The length was a huge problem then, I think I hit the end of the current game like two hours in. It definitely had enough promise even early on for it that I'll have to revisit it.

  EDIT: I sit corrected. There's an autosave slot that does exactly what I'd expect, it just happens to be at the *bottom* of the list of 100 save slots.
  ~~If anyone decides to give this game a try, I would want to point out that all saving is manual. I was having some fun, at least as much as with Final Fantasy games, for a few hours before I died and decided I would rather given up than start over and replay all the intro stuff again.~~

  Yup, having now played through the first and part of the second chapters of this, it's \*great\*.  Fantastic dialogue and interesting worldbuilding, and a main character that really makes sense to me.  I'm super into it.

  Caveats:

  1)  The thing where XP is a finite resource means that it's very, very easy to accidentally get into an unwinnable state, typically signaled by a mandatory boss that you clearly have no hope of fighting.  I got around this via, ah, vigorous cheating with save editors.  This made me realize that grinding in most JRPGs is actually an important usability feature allowing players to implicitly tune the difficulty of the game to desired levels (since more time spent grinding=lower difficulty).

  2)  There are a lot of places where extremely important mechanics are just straight-up not explained to the player.  I kinda regret not starting to read the walkthrough prior to getting midway through chapter 2, since I've missed a couple of story arcs and investment opportunities already by not noticing these mechanics existed.

  Yes, it is great. Author also has a few Vn's as well as book series of varying quality.

  I just started it on the strength of this recommendation and was immediately struck by the quality of the writing and banter.  This may be the only JRPG I play this decade.  Thanks for the heads-up!
