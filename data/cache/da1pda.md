## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  There are SO many fics out there about people from our Earth who are punted into a fantasy/sci-fi world. But what if the hero came home ... maybe after gaining powers or learning things? Anyone ever heard of a rational (ish) story like that?

  Closest I can think of is re-do stories of coming back from the future with memories/skills intact. Not quite the same thing.

  What is the optimal way to stay up-to-date with world events? Or, failing that, how do *you* do it?

  I'm speaking of political, science, and economic developments alike.

  * Which news websites could be trusted to provide reliable information on new developments in technology and science, and not *miss* any major developments?

  * What is the best way to get information about the current state of any field of technology? Browsing science articles? Reading Wikipedia?

   * For example, how far have we gotten with uploading animals since [this thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaCRNX0hdwU) from four years ago?

  * What are some more-or-less unbiased sources of news on global politics and economy?

  * What political analysts do you trust? What economists?

  * Are there any other resources useful for the overarching task of staying-up-to-date, besides news sources and analysts?

    > What are some more-or-less unbiased sources of news on global politics and economy?

    This does not exist. There are only sources with different kinds of biases.

    If you want a broad basis, for the US and UK I'd recommend perhaps The Guardian, NPR, the WSJ, the Economist, the Washington Post, and the NY Times, but you'll need to keep in mind how those publication's editorial biases and their writers' personal biases compare to your own.

    > Are there any other resources useful for the overarching task of staying-up-to-date,

    Get a good feed reader. I don't know which one to recommend to you, though, because my feed reader is Tweetdeck and Reddit and a few Mastodon instances skewed towards hedonism, and that's not a good combination for your purposes.

    Don't try to stay up-to-date. Stay informed. Read [the day two stories](https://www.emptywheel.net/2017/10/02/in-praise-of-day-two/), not the live updates. Look at moments, but pay attention to the trends, not the details of the moment.

      >Don't try to stay up-to-date. Stay informed. Read the day two stories, not the live updates. Look at moments, but pay attention to the trends, not the details of the moment.

      This. This so much!

      I have a tendency to tune out nearly all live news or news that try to be as immediate as possible. So much of the news are about being as emotional as possible and there is always some distortion as they exaggerate or outright falsify what is happening (intentionally or not).

      News reporting is optimized towards reaching as many people as possible. That means it's all about being as efficient of a replicator of a meme as possible. Hence all the click bait titles, extreme emotional drama, simplified into a quick sentence summary, and many other ways to butcher and mangle the truth until it's more fitting and well suited for publication.

      At this point in my life, I cannot recall any time\* when any piece of news was so relevant or important that I needed to know about it right away regardless of how accurate it might be. I rather listen to day two stories where the reporters have had more time to investigate and with less of a pressing need to cram in as much emotional drama as possible.

      This method has its pros and cons. Sometimes I'm unaware of major events that just happened and am surprised when some of my friends are talking about it. But after I have taken the time to catch up, I have a better understanding of what is going on without any distortions from reading the first published news reports.

      \*The one exception might have been 9/11 since I lived in the same state at the time, but I was pretty young and wasn't old/mature enough to care about watching the news or to understand what was going on.

    Generally, I'd look for publications with topic-specific RSS feeds that publish occasional updates rather than ongoing coverage.

  I've been forced to use new-reddit as the new mod tools are only available for new-reddit, and I need them for /r/3Dprinting.

  I threw an open-source reddit clone on a cheap server if anyone is interested. Eventually it's supposed to end up being federated, so it could talk to other reddit clones.

  So I went to a co-ed pickup sauna the other day (for the first and probably last time, though the person I went with assured me that this was a substandard club. 3/10 got groped, would not recommend. any regulars want to read my 2,200 word writeup feel free to request it and I'll PM it to you - note that nothing interesting or titillating happened if you are expecting a penthouse letter). But that's not what this is about. 

  What this is about is that I realised that the sort of sex club vibe seemed very much like how I imagine vampires to be, so I wrote a (pretty bad) short story based on the layout/appearance of the club I visited (except I made the vampire lair classy). Thought people might be interested in it:  (1962 words) https://pastebin.com/6yKhmgWX (contains a very small amount of mild sexual content, and it's text-only)

      Eh, on the scale of sexual stuff I've dealt with in my life being groped in a sex club is way down on my list tbh. At least there I had an escort who immediately complained to management that someone touched me (management was, of course, impotent and literally said that I need to be very firm. This horrified my escort needless to say).

  After chatting to the director of the computational stats dept on campus, I was asked to lead a year-long workshop series on Bayesian inference. Since my home department is Anthropology, I think this'll be a good way to further signal my technical skills in anticipation of industry positions after graduation. And while it won't be paid, it's work that I'd mostly be doing anyway (in running an ongoing reading group on the subject), and it'll be catered (my budget for refreshments is $100 / meeting) and I'll have another $1k to use for travel purposes. Looking forward to it overall! Now I need to make a flyer and figure out what to call it. I'm tempted by something in the Charles Atlas style, complete with scantily clad bodybuilders and "DO YOU WANT TO UNLOCK THE SECRETS OF ABS (Applied Bayesian Statistics)?" calls to action. Don't know if they'll go for it.

  Have had some other questions over the course of the week that I wouldn't mind reading this community's thoughts on:

  [What do you think of college instructors enforcing lecture attendance policies?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/d9f2zk/lecture_attendance_policy/)

  [What's the best way to implement a keyboard shortcut (on Windows 10) to disable all or part of my keyboard?](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/d9pufy/can_i_set_up_a_custom_keymap_to_1_toggle_the/)

  [How important is it to cite all copywrighted materials in slideshow presentations?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/d9lob4/do_you_make_sure_to_cite_your_sources_in/)

  [What's the mechanism by which adult obesity lags childhood sugar consumption?](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/d8dcm0/todays_obesity_epidemic_may_have_been_caused_by/f1ahv23/)

  Also had a tire pop on me earlier this week -- I approached the prospect of swapping it out for the spare with some trepidation, having never done it before... which turned out to be entirely unfounded. One 3 minute youtube video and 10 minutes later and I was done (and this is triple-checking myself every step of the way)! Super easy, dunno why the media portrays it as something that can discriminate the hapless from the handy.

    Apparently you're handy.  Would you describe someone who couldn't do that "super easy" task as hapless (barring other complications)?

    Lecture attendance is meaningless in a world of online lecture recordings. Much better to have weekly homework to make sure that students are keeping on top of work. For first-year maths, our uni has weekly online tutorials with automatic marking, so it's really low upkeep that doesn't scale with student population.
    ```

  - u/Robert_Barlow:
    ```
    In order:

    1. Lecture attendance policies are bullshit. Lectures are like gas, they expand to fill all available space. I've never met a teacher whose lectures were worth paying attention to that failed to convey information in the time given, and likewise, I've never met a teacher who sucked at giving lectures that would have done better if given twice the amount of time. As far as I am concerned, as long as I do well on the assignments, it should be up to me what I do with the time allocated. Ditto for technology policies. If I want to use my phone to not pay attention, that's my business, not the teacher's.

    2. You're chasing the proximate cause rather than the ultimate cause. The problem isn't how to disable keys to make room for your cat, it's how to keep your cat off your keyboard. I recommend a water bottle, but a kinder alternative is to keep something the cat likes better than you nearby. I distract mine with a cat tower he can use to peer down at me, but a cat bed nearby on the desk might be more helpful. Assuming your cat is nice enough to use a cat bed. But to answer your question: [google says somebody already made a solution ages ago that's compatible with Windows 10.](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/11570/disable-the-keyboard-with-a-keyboard-shortcut-in-windows/) I imagine if you want to be more specific and disable only the function keys, you can just write your own AutoHotKey script.

    3. Not important at all. Fuck copyright, and *specifically* fuck copyright trolls who think a meme or a single diagram is important enough to demand citation. It's *polite* to give credit to artists and photographers, and expected if you're citing academia, but if you expect to be processing a lot of copyrighted information in a short amount of time, it's a waste of resources for something that's probably not even going to get you in huge trouble. Only do it if you think the citations will point your students or coworkers to resources that might be useful. A lecture or an informative slideshow is a transformative context anyhow.

    4. Correlation doesn't equal causation. I wouldn't be shocked if obesity was partially caused by food choices in childhood, but given the overwhelming evidence in favor of modern food being unhealthier and more plentiful than food in the past, I *would* be shocked if your baby food was the most important factor. People have been trying for years to frame the obesity epidemic in ways that imply it's not the fault of grown adults for making the decisions that they do. I won't claim that they're wrong - a lot of that evidence is very compelling, and most of it makes sense. But this study in particular seems like an extension of that in a direction that doesn't feel like it works. I'm not going to do a deep dive into the study, but there are a couple points that bug me. One: I'm pretty sure [adults in *every* age range](https://www.stateofobesity.org/obesity-by-age/) started gaining weight at around the same rate, in the same proportions. People who are older than sixty-five probably weren't eating baby food in 1970. Two: [the idea of HFCS being responsible for the obesity epidemic is pretty old](https://www.nature.com/articles/ijo2012157?WT.ec_id=IJO-201306). We're still not sure if it's functionally different from other sweeteners, and there are plenty of other things that could have caused it.

  I'm working on a Halloween costume based on one of those tiny jumping spiders, like a *[Matatus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maratus) spp.* These are smaller than a penny. I'm blowing it up until its head is big enough to be worn over my own head. And I'm having problems with the eye material.

  I'd really like to capture the somewhat-metallic appearance of these eyes, while still being able to see out of the eyes. Here's a reference for a *Maratus volans*: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Maratus_volans#/media/File:MalePeacockSpider.jpg

  What material or technique would you use to achieve that color and curve on the lens?

  Last year I used >!cheap sunglasses lenses that were the wrong color!<, and this year I'm playing with >!heat-forming plexiglass and painting it!<, but I'd like to know what suggestions the community has.

    Green celophane lightly melted over hexagonal mesh? That would simulate the compound nature of the eyes and be see-through. You could also just let yourself see through some other part of the costume and make the eyes however you want.
