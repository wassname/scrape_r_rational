## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You can instantly switch bodies with anyone upon physical contact, such as a handshake. The switch is accomplished by some mysterious magic that rewrites the other person's brain to be an instance of you, and rewrites your brain to be an instance of them, while fixing up all the obvious problems that this might cause. (You will not have to relearn to walk, talk, or otherwise move in the new body, but you will be yourself and not inherit any special skills the other person may have learned. You are susceptible to genetic brain malfunctions the other person may possess, however). The power follows your consciousness between bodies. There is no limit on how frequently you can switch bodies.

  What do you use this power for, if you decide to use it at all? Keep in mind that the person you switch bodies with will inherit the body you just came from, and will probably be rather unhappy with this sudden change (if you did it without consent).

    Some trans people could potentially get a use out of this, so I could sell body swapping services (if you've got two people who want to switch with each other, it's relatively easy to facilitate a swap by shaking hands with each body one after the other). 

    I could also sell temporary body tours and permanent swaps for people who aren't trans but would like a different body (and life?) for other reasons. 

    Come to think of it, there might be a niche market for swaps between (1) people who find it relatively easy to work out, diet, and lose weight and (2) people who would prefer to slim down immediately in another body rather than slim down on their own. Alternately, this might be an extended body tour sort of thing, where your fitness swapper is expected to reduce your weight over a period of time, and then you swap back. 

    There are romantic/sexual applications to this as well, come to think of it. Imagine a whole new form of swinging, where you're still sleeping with your partner but both of you are in new bodies. 

    If I could just keep the government from trying to kidnap me, I could stand to make a fair amount of money.

      There would be an extremely lucrative but potentially unethical market for permanent body-swaps.  If you take someone with an old or sick or crippled body and give them a young healthy body, their lifespan will drastically increase, at the expense of whoever they swapped with.  I have absolutely no doubt that there are a large group of wealthy people who would spend millions of dollars for the opportunity.  If you want to be semi-ethical about it, you could find poor and/or suicidal people who would be willing to literally sell their body to leave something behind for their family.  Or perhaps you could do compromise things, maybe a broke 20 year old would be willing to become a 30 year old in exchange for a few million dollars.  And the rich guy could repeat the process with a new person every 10 years.  Anyone can have eternal youth as long as they can find enough willing hosts and have ridiculous amounts of cash (of which, you can take a cut)

      I'd expect the demand for good bodies would vastly outstrip the supply, so there is a 100% chance that a black market for bodies would emerge.  Kidnappings for sure.  Adoption of a baby only to steal their body and have a chance at a brand new life.  Heck, you'd likely have people who would conceive and raise a child (or clone themself) for the express purpose of taking the body.  Also, they could probably convince someone who was planning on having an abortion to have the baby instead and give it to them for swapping (although I'd expect young-adult bodies would be the most desirable).  Depending on your balance of ethics vs. piles of money, you could either allow this to happen or try to find some way of preventing it, but good luck with that.

        Alas, I'm too much of a dirty socialist to take part in extending the lives of the superrich. They can fund life extension research that can eventually be used for the benefit of all humans, or they can die with the rest of us. Taking advantage of a single supernatural bodyswapper is not the key to humanity's future (near-)immortality and I will not give them that escape valve, especially at the expense of the poor and desperate whose bodies they would be taking. 

        Although, I suppose that I might permit such swaps in exchange for more than mere cash payouts - e.g. "My price for swapping you with this person is not only that this person's family is taken care of in a generous fashion, but that you dedicate a sizable proportion of your resources to combating existential risk. I will not extend your life a second time if I am not satisfied with your results." 

        It would be pretty expensive, but you can't use *any* of your money if you're dead, so there's that.
        ```

        - u/zarraha:
          ```
          Those things are equivalent to cash payouts.  There's not really much point in coercing someone to donate their money to a cause as a price for the swap when you could just make them pay you as part of the cost and then donate it yourself and do other moral things with it (unless you're trying to decrease an extra step that could be taxed)

          You're not extending the lives of the superrich as the endgoal, you'd do it to make yourself superrich, and then achieve your goals with that money, whether that be selfishly making yourself happy, or donating to science and life extension or whatever other donations are most efficient to maximize human well-being.  The main question would be how to obtain healthy bodies ethically, and whether extending the lifespans of the superrich would cause more harm than your money is doing good, given that they would maintain and increase their wealth and control over society for longer, and wouldn't die and split their estates among multiple heirs and have estate taxes bite chunks off of it.
          ```

          - u/callmesalticidae:
            ```
            Partly decreasing an extra step, partly "It seems like it would be easier to avoid or at least reduce a shift in values if I'm explicitly requiring actions on the part of my customer, rather than just asking for money and distributing it myself." 

            If the money is in my hands, then it's easier to think of it as "my money" and easier to come up with arguments as to why I don't need to spend it on other causes. The probability that my values would shift that much isn't too high, really, but I'd still prefer to avoid it.
            ```

            - u/zarraha:
              ```
              Maybe.  Theoretically, you could rake in enough cash (billions) that anything you wanted to buy for yourself you just could and there would be plenty left over for good causes too.  I suppose it would be more socially optimal if you donate $10 billion to good causes rather than donate $9.9 billion and spend $100 million on yourself, but I'd say you earned as a reward for doing so much good with the rest of it.  Though It is possible that over time you'd become corrupted and end up keeping larger percentages, hoarding wealth and power and end up just like them, I wouldn't know, I've never been superrich and had to face such a temptation.

      I read a short story or listened to a podcast with this as the premise: people would pay for a personal trainer to use their body for a one hour workout. You could do something like that.

    PseudoImmortality: Whenever you're old, possess someone young.

    World Domination: Just possess the world leaders. 

    This power seems inherently evil. At best, you can find willing victims, like suicidal people, to possess. Or use it against evil people to undo their evils.
    ```

    - u/LieGroupE8:
      ```
      Sure, you can possess world leaders, but since you have never been in power before and don't know any of the secret passcodes, you are very bad at it, and soon removed from power. (Well, unless you take over Donald Trump, then you would be instantly spotted as an imposter for being more competent than normal). Also, you leave a trail of bodies behind you to cover up the evidence, but if you make a mistake, then suddenly you've got a police investigation and/or a very angry powerful person who *does* know the real passcodes after you. What would you do to eliminate these risks?

      Alternately, suppose you actually want to use this power for good. Is there any clever way to do so?

        Just pretend you forgot. 

        > Also, you leave a trail of bodies behind you to cover up the evidence,

        Ingest poison before you swap bodies. That way you have a trail of corpses rather than people accusing you of stealing their bodies. No police investigation either since it's clear suicide.

        > Alternately, suppose you actually want to use this power for good. Is there any clever way to do so?

        Only for the greater good. With a long chain of sacrifices, you can amass lots of power to do good things. Not good for the people you killed to get that power though.

    > if you decide to use it at all?

    Well, this is a munchkin thread, here it would be unethical _not_ to use arbitrary horrible powers :)



    First, it is interesting to run several tests:

    1. Imagine a thread: at one end it goes into your finger, another end is loose. Thread is soaked in your blood, so it is virtually an extension of your body. Will touching the thread register as physical contact? If true, I guess you can shoot long and extremely thin streams of blood to transfer bodies.
    2. Touch two persons at once. Try to focus on both of them and then activate your ability. Can you occupy two bodies at once? In one case, you get your clone, probably with the same power (and mangled mess of two consciousnesses in your previous body). In another case, you can test how your ability chooses its target.
    3. Can you switch with people you can't see? If two unseen persons are touching you, can you specify target with your power?

    Results of these tests will determine my strategy (and avenues for further tests).

    If cloning from (2) didn't work, I see the wielder of this power in guarded facility, at the center of sprawling web of blood transmitting tubes. Pairs of people come there to switch their bodies for a price (switch with Person A, switch with Person B, switch with you original body). It is unlikely the wielder will ever leave the facility or die — at this point, they made themselves too useful.

    If cloning from (2) worked... well, it would be like intelligent and deadly virus. World domination becomes even easier (until your copies begin to rebel, but well, it's still technically the wielder who is in power, so goal achieved).
    ```

  - u/Izeinwinter:

    More-or-less ethically sound. This is immortality trough stealing "vegetable" bodies. Heck, you can swap *other people* into the formerly brain-dead by doing a trivial rotation, so.. you can cash in on this.  Of course, the supply of people with non-genetic brain damage but otherwise functional bodies is very small, and if you make a habit of doing this for rich old people, people will catch on. 

    Much larger market: 
    You can help transsexuals far better than any surgeon ever could. Find one preop MTF, one preop FTM. Swap a into your current body, swap into b, leaving b in a, swap back to the body you started in, get paid.

  **Description**

  To make illusions, you need Replica and Audience. With these two things your creations manifest into reality, gaining independence.

  Replica is a 'draft' of your illusion, something that (vaguely) resembles it. Audience is the group of people who believe Replica is a real thing.

  For example, to create an illusionary dragon, you must first create its Replica out of wood. You can start a spell then, but illusion will be very weak. It is better to build a large tent, put the replica there, add devices that make really convincing sounds of large beast and emit smoke. Gather large crowd outside and make a convincing speech about how dangerous the dragon is. Suggest that you can show it — if visitors promise to be very careful. And *then* you start a spell.

  In this example, dragon is fed by fairly powerful beliefs. It will look like a real thing at the start of a spell, its behaviour dictated by Audience expectations. It will *become* real thing in 8 months, if people still aren't skeptical (although the final result may differ from your initial concept: it is strongly affected by Audience beliefs/expectations).

  If Replica is the living being, same rules apply until they start to question their identity. Then, illusion shatters.

  For example, if you manage to convince Audience that you are a stone statue, you will stand unaging for centuries, only threatened by pigeons. You won't be surprised that you can think — obviously, you are made from thinking stone! Only with a powerful mental discipline you can break from this trance.

  **Details**

  * You can support only one illusion at a time. If illusion became real, you don't need to support it.
  * Anything can be Replica, but you have to build it yourself... I mean, you have to *believe* that you built it yourself.
  * Audience of 100 people will make illusion real in 8 months. 1000 people — 7 months, 10`000 people — 6 months and so on. It will require at least 30 minutes for illusion to become real.
  * Number of people who strongly doubt your illusion will be substracted from the Audience.

  So, how would you rule the world, break the world, improve the world? Any interesting uses of this ability?

    HOLD ON A MINUTE.

    >  It will become real thing in 8 months,

    Real thing, as in REAL THING? Not an illusion anymore but a literal dragon?

    This power is so overpowered its absurd.

    Step 1) Form a cult.

    Step 2) Create illusionary god for cult to worship.

    Step 3) Wait 8 months.

    Step 4) NOW YOU HAVE AN ACTUAL OMNIPOWERFUL OMNISCIENT GOD.
    ```

    - u/RatemirTheRed:
      ```
      > Real thing, as in REAL THING? Not an illusion anymore but a literal dragon?

      Most certainly. But... well, one more thing to consider:

      > its behaviour dictated by Audience expectations.

      The final result is shaped by Audience beliefs. So you can get omnipotent and omniscient being, but its morality will also be determined by what your cult members believe, at least in the beginning.

      ^((I guess I should have made the point about Audience beliefs affecting the final result more clear))

      EDIT: Oh my (illusionary) god, that actually works. You just need to define your god as 'omnipotent being that does whatever ShiranaiWakaranai prophesizes'. It still has some genie-like problems but it works.
      ```

      - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
        ```
        Well, if you're worried about your illusions turning on you in some way, make illusions of asentient objects instead. So instead of gods, make illusions of sacred artifacts that imbue the wearer with great powers. A circlet of omniscience. A plate armor of invincibility. A sword of promised victory.
        ```

        - u/appropriate-username:
          ```
          And then set the plate on the ground and hit it with the sword, while keeping firmly in mind that the only path to victory for you is to break the plate.
          ```

          - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
            ```
            When the sword hits the plate, the plate wearer is blasted away from the battlefield, but is completely unhurt. That way the sword-wielder wins, while the plate-wearer is still invincible.
            ```
