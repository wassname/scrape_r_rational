## Rational Fallout?

### Post:

Howdy folks! Long time reader, first time poster. I'm not particularly in favor of the general trend where "X" thing becomes popular, more things come around that are basically "Existing thing, but with X!". However, rationalfic where the plot is essentially a retelling of an existing story with better thinking in it has been pretty darned entertaining thus far. Also, I've had some story ideas knocking around in my head lately. So that said, would anyone be particularly interested in a Rational Fallout 3/New Vegas fic? Even if not, I'll probably still write the bloody thing, but some pre-story consultation would be cool :)

    My intention is to play it completely straight. This is a world where physics are very different from our own. B-movie Science! That doesn't mean I don't intend for them to discover rules, or that I won't keep them internally consistent. And my protagonist will definitely notice, for instance, that Mackay's theories of mutation due to extended exposure to radiation don't really explain the presence of giant green people. The rules are insane by our standards, but they exist.

        Now that's advice I can take to the bank. Thanks!

    I dont remeber where I read or it's cannonicity but an explanation for a big deal of the mutations are due to the FEV (forced evolutionary virus) being released along the nukes. granted this replaces one handwavium with another but hey it's something. on the other hand there is a core of creatures that were the result of deliberate genetic engineering you can keep with cannon sources: deathclaws and super mutants from mariposa research cntr. cazadores, night stalkers, and man-eating plants from Big MT.  considering the pre war world had [nano assemblers](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Sierra_Madre_vending_machine) i chose to think ghouls are victims of life support nanites that switched to being powered by radiation or radioisotopes (thus explaining why they heal when irradiated)

  Err...

  Check out [fallout equestria](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/119190/fallout-equestria). Yeah, I know. Do it anyway.

    Fallout Equestria does not seem particularly RT or RST.

      Rational, not rationalist. The world is well done, the characters are not rationalists.

      Keep in mind that rational and rationalist have different meaning around here.

        I know. I don't think it's particularly rational, either.

    I have seen it of course, it's very well written. But part of the whole idea, at least for me, is to alter the setting and premise as little as possible. It'll still be, at its core, the story of the Wanderer and the Courier. Just a little.. smarter.

      > the Wanderer and the Courier

      uh, what about the Vault Dweller and the Chosen One?
      ```

        Not in this story :< If you wanted, you could write about them. One of my authorial edicts will be that the Tale of Two Wastelands is canon, so the same character will be the Wanderer and the Courier. That's always been my headcanon anyway.

  I mean, evil AI, large scale terraforming projects, trying to be rational when science is replaced with Science!, life extension, saving the world? This is our stuff!

    ...

    Stop making me want to write... I have neither the skill nor the time...

    Mr. House would obviously be an Old World rationalist. And there could have been an actual Bayesian Conspiracy...

    Oh god, stop it, brain!

      Don't worry, I'll do this one. You are freed~ But yeah, exactly. The setting is so ripe for a story like this one that I'm shocked there hasn't been one yet.

  Be critical, be honest, but be gentle. I'm a bleeder!

  Chapter 1 will be up on FF.net very shortly. I'll make an AN with my general ideas, and the text of the story should be considered a rough draft. If there's a better way to get drafts to Redditors, please let me know and I will use it in the future.

  I'd definitely be interested in a fic like that. I'm not an *expert* on Fallout canon, but I've played through all of 2, 3, and New Vegas, and somewhere around half of 1, so I can probably still be of some use as a consultant.

    I have at least 2,000 hours across 3 and NV, that much I have covered. What I lack is writing experience - I was thinking more idea-bouncing and betaing and so forth. I am not a rich person, I can only pay in potential entertainment dividends :)
