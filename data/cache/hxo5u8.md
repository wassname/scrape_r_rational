## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  let's break game rules again.

  Omniscience.

  You will gain ' omniscience  ', defined as ability to answer any possible question (but you still retain your language, your thinking speed, and you will be only able to phrase the answers in language you know), but.... you will die in next 3 minutes.

  So basically, you have 3 minutes to gain as much answers you want (by asking yourself questions in your toughts) and write answers out somehow.

  What do you do? Are you getting answers to ensure your family well being? Are you getting answers for humanity? What kind of questions you ask? Do you care at all, assuming that you have 3 minutse of live left? How do you store out the answers? Writing? Drawing?

  PS: also consider that the remaining people might won't trust what you write, so maybe you should focus on smaller questions that are more easily verifiable

  PS2: pls avoid obvious trick 'asking question what is the best question'

    First ask if there is any feasible way at all to extend the 3 minutes, whether its lifespan prolonging medicine or time dilation or cryogenics or mind uploading or even time leaping. If this succeeds, you are done.

    Otherwise, ask what actions you can take within the remaining time to cause butterfly effects that ensure the survival, freedom, and moral goodness of humanity for as long as possible. Omniscience should perfectly predict the vastly different results of every possible action you could take in those 3 minutes. So the amount of 'success' that you can give via butterfly effects should far far far exceed any type or amount of info you leave behind via other methods.

      Correlary to your initial suggestion. Ask how you can ensure that someone can and will ressurect you after your imminent demise in such a way that you retain your question answering power.

    In that case, let's go with the next obvious trick, basically "what is the best answer": "what action or sequence of actions can I take before my death that will maximally increase the sum utility of all moral agents\[\^1\] according to my coherent extrapolated volition?"

    It may be debatable whether "you will be only able to phrase the answers in a language you know" precludes being able to phrase the answers nonverbally (i.e. by actually executing an action, if it is not a solely verbal action), but from context it sounds more like "you aren't granted knowledge of all languages in the bargain", not "you are arbitrarily restricted to your own spoken language". But if you can "phrase" the answers by doing them, then whether the correct answer involves the transmission of knowledge or not, you can just do whatever is necessary. And by phrasing it as "before my death", if it is possible to save yourself, it is very likely you will do so (you will unless doing so somehow turns out worse for the world).

    On the minus side, depending on how the gift works and whether or not it's possible to save yourself, you may be flooded with the knowledge of an unbounded personal future and the certainty that deviating from it is the wrong thing to do, binding your free will for as long as you can remain moral. (Although maybe the answer will be something like "follow The Plan for 10\^100 years, and then erase your knowledge of the specifics of this answer, because then it and you will be the last remnants of suboptimal utility to be optimized".)

    \[\^1\]: Replace with something other than total utilitarianism, if you wish.

    > PS2: pls avoid obvious trick 'asking question what is the best question'

    By that, do you mean that all recursive questions and meta questions will fail?  Meta-questions and questions that utilize recursion are your best bet for packing in as much information as possible and getting useful bits of information.

    Baring those sorts of questions.  I think my next best bet is to ask for AI-related algorithms and example code.  A few core algorithms should be the sort of thing you can write out in 3 minutes.  I am not sure if any useful example code could be written in 3 minutes.  So for best algorithms to ask for (because by your meta restriction I can’t just ask for best algorithm I can write in under 3 minutes)... off the top of my head... maybe a modification to reinforcement learning that allows it to generalize over multiple scales?  (Reenforcement learning has a scale imposed by how you define states for instance the next move on a game board and is thus limited (requiring either looking an excessive number of states ahead or truncating how many states ahead you look) in the real world where you don’t have access to a true and accurate model with which to compare to and you have multiple scales you need to consider simultaneously: for instance your actions in the next second simultaneously with your actions over the next minute/hour/day.)
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    What can I do to minimize subjectively negative experiences?

    This question is implying several things by not having bounds. It should encompass all sentient life and all of time and space, and doesn’t give my any information that I’m unable to utilize. If there’s a way past the 3 minutes, the answer will encompass that. 

    It’s possible that this will prioritize non-human life, but there are workarounds for that, if I feel that it’s necessary.

  Wow! You can now create arbitrary material objects!

  To do so, you must provide a certain level of specificity. Don't worry, you don't need to know where every atom goes, but the power borrows your intelligence, so that degree is "could you construct this yourself with a box of unlimited resources?"

  To put it another way, the power can't generate any sourceless knowledge, it just extrapolates the way you would build something and then skips to the part where it's done.

  The whole of your creations must be within 100 meters of your person, take one second to appear, and will only displace air or water of sufficient purity when appearing.

  You have a daily mass limit of 100kg, objects coming out partially complete if their creation would exceed the limit. Matter that does not exist in your universe (for the whole of the second it takes to create) comes up empty.

  No other limitations. No other supernatural powers exist, and you win the simulation when a minimum of five billion humans vote for you in an election for Supreme Dictator of Earth.

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    Do your creations persist after your death?

    If so, the simplest method might be to construct a doomsday device with a dead man switch and threaten to trigger it if you aren't elected supreme dictator of earth.

    Said doomsday device could be a big lump of antimatter, electromagnetically separated from normal matter so it doesn't explode until you turn off the current. It would also be fairly simple to set up the circuit so your death shuts it off.

    Your rule will not be safe, as your doomsday device is most likely unstable and will soon explode. But hey, all you wanted was to win the election, not govern afterwards!

    seems easy, you can convince people that you are a deity and all's done.

    Or second approach, you can just use your power to create wealth...

    daily limit of 100kg. What is the most expensive substance?

    Or just screw it, let's go with gold. From what I can Google now,  **61105.71** $ that's the price per 1kg of gold. So you get.... 6 110 500$ daily. Omg, even assuming that, it would take few years only to become the richest person in the world.
    ```

  - u/3combined:
    ```
    When you say the box can make what I could construct, what methods could I use? How do tools play into this? Am I only able to make things I could build with unlimited materials and my bare hands? What shape/shapes are the unlimited materials in - do I get lego bricks, or have to carve out shapes from a huge sea with my hands?


    You also say there's a mass limit, but is there a separate energy limit? 


    As to the victory conditions - what counts as a vote for "me"? Can I work under a pseudonym? Can the position be a figurehead position, with absolute power but an understanding I'd never use it? Who sets up the election - can I make all non voters vote for me by default by running the election myself? Can I  very reasonably suggest AV for the vote, so everyone votes for me to some extent (though likely not as first choice)?
