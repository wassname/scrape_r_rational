  I'm going to have to side with Delphic's parents here. This trio does seem fishy. I was already very put off by the roommates demands; in a world where superheroes exist, secret identities are probably serious business. Expecting Hector to be completely honest and upfront after spending literally one-night with Kimberly, strikes me as ridiculous. There seems to be no charitable reason for the roommates outrage, unless there's also an ulterior motive behind it, or some serious, serious backstory that hasn't been revealed yet.

   I know the story isn't finished yet, and the world-building isn't complete, but getting mad at a guy for not telling a girl he's known for one night he's a super, seemed to me like someone getting mad at a fried they met yesterday for not telling them they're gay. Realistic? Yes. Believable? Yes. But it still makes me strongly dislike the roommate, and distrust Kimberly to some extent.

  She appeared so suddenly, clicked with Hector so well, and has a strong interest in super. Hector already knows he's under suspicion for ties to Delphic. He should definitely check them out, make certain they're not government plants, because they definitely could be. They all seemed to be positioned in fields/clubs that would make it easy for them to get in touch with underground communities of supers; and one of them even has an 'ability' that lets them detect supers, making them perfect for finding undocumented ones. 

  Seems far to fishy to actually be benign.

  Since votes for Top Web Fiction only last a week, my lack of updates means this story has fallen off the main list.

  Please [vote](http://topwebfiction.com/vote.php?for=delphic) to get Delphic back on there.

    [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/Delphic) also exists, if you want the moral right to complain about my late updates.

    (Or access to a patrons-only channel on a Discord server that no one visits, anyway.)

  No clue if you have anything to do with this, but this website keeps redirecting me to virus/scam sites.

    That would be Wordpress not properly policing their ads.

    Make sure to hit "report" under where the ad is. Also send me a screenshot and I'll see if there is a way to blacklist the problem. 

    If it keeps happening, I think there's a way to turn ads off entirely for X dollars a month. I will look into that next.
