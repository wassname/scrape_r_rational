  This is absolutely brilliant ! It makes so much more sense than an independently evolved symbioite being compatible with human biology. This is going to be my personally preferred canon for the series. 
  The mindless symbiote feeling pain in the home waters is puzzling at first, but makes sense as Baal"s after-the-fact interpretation of the symbiote memory.
  ```

  - u/DRMacIver:
    ```
    I've updated that sentence slightly. I was intending it to mean that the symbiote has only animal intelligence without a host rather than being completely mindless.

    ETA: Also, yes, I've absolutely accepted this as my new headcanon. :-)

  ```
  I'm reminded of /u/DocFuture 's personality drift concern, and the first thing I thought of when I read the description of the anticipated Brain  in a Vat experiment while reading The Terminal Man

  - u/JackStargazer:
    ```
    The always remembered 7.9999 million years of primordial rage, fear, and hate probably has something to do with the [Always Chaotic Evil](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil) nature of the Go'auld in this scenario, yes.
    ```

- u/Jiro_T:
  ```
  How is saying "a Go'auld doesn't control the mind of its host" consistent with the Tok'ra, who *actually* don't control their host?
  ```

  - u/DRMacIver:
    ```
    My working assumption is that the Tok'Ra are all crazy and/or lying and/or engaged in an extreme degree of compartmentalization to deliberately offset the worst effects of the symbiosis. I agree it's a bit of a flaw in the theory.
    ```

  - u/Empiricist_or_not:
    ```
    The Tok'ra have long term memory of ascetic self discipline
     trying to reacquire their old culture?
    ```

- u/Mbnewman19:
  ```
  I like it!
  ```
