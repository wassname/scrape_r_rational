## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  So I've committed myself to writing a series of stock responses as part of a Trigger Action Plan to use in any online discussion that I feel is getting out of hand and entering a "death spiral" from which constructive, reasonable debate is unlikely. This is as much in an effort to restrain my own temptation into that death spiral as anything, since I've often been upset with myself for "taking the bait" or letting conversations go astray when I should have nipped such problems in the bud as soon as I saw them.

  Curious what you guys think. The first one I've come up with so far is this:

  "Hey, so it looks from my perspective as though you just tried to summarize my arguments or assert what I believe in a way that doesn't match what I've said. In my experience this is unproductive to useful discourse, and one of the situations that tends to upset me, leading to a downward spiral from which productive conversation becomes nearly impossible. Please attempt to re-read what I've said so far and accurately repeat back what you believe my main argument/assertion/belief is before we continue the discussion.

  Thank you!"

  Edit:

  Suggestions to just stop talking with the person, while appreciated, is not really the aim here: if I stopped talking with everyone who I thought was bad at arguing, I wouldn't argue with practically anyone online, which might be a net benefit for myself (I do feel I learn a lot from such arguments, even ones that go bad) but I don't think is a net benefit in general.

  The usual response I see when someone's argument is being misrepresented is them trying to correct the other person then continuing the discussion, and the other person ignoring the correction and just addressing the new discussion, which leads to further conflict. The idea here is to stop myself from attempting to correct them and continue the discussion, since it so rarely works, and trying something else to course correct before things get to a really toxic point.

    My strategy is to just leave those comment threads and let the other person have the last word. This is a little bit impolite, but a great sanity saver so I'm not tempted to dive back in after I try to post a message meant to take me out of the conversation. Odds are if you leave a message trying to bow out the other person will get the last word anyway.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      > and let the other person have the last word

      Yeah, that's kind of a major failing on my part :P I'm not good with letting people get the last word unless I feel like I've actually demonstrated my point. I'd like to get better at that too, but hope this will help conversations that aren't necessarily going to end in terribleness avoid getting there in the first place.
      ```

  - u/eternal-potato:

    What do you hope to accomplish? This is great if you want a low-effort/high-gain throw-shit-into-the-fan kind of thing, as it is mildly patronizing and insulting as is, more so once you've used it for some time and your opponents realize you don't even bother to type it out, and just copy/paste canned responses. I suggest making it into a picture with text '[meme animal](https://www.google.ru/search?q=meme+animals)'-style for greater damage.

    If you actually want to diffuse the situation, just quietly leaving is probably the best option.
    ```

  - u/ketura:
    ```
    lol just drop a NICE BAIT meme and moonwalk out.

    Or just cut off the conversation and leave. You can even type out your response if you think you're particularly articulate, just be sure to delete it before posting.

    > Curious what you guys think. The first one I've come up with so far is this:

    I don't think that's going to work.

    Look, the thing about an online discussion is, it's like a real discussion, everyone makes up the rules. And like in real discussion, sometimes people "bend the rules" or impose their own bended rules, and others accept it (google "Justify-Argue-Defend-Explain")

    The trick to finding satisfaction in a discussion with people that are sometimes unreasonable, is to draw your rules/boundaries, and stand by them. Don't try to win at others people's games; if you want to compromise with other people, find rules that you feel you can both accept; if you can't find common rules, then you can't communicate; move on and hope the next gal you talk with will be more reasonable.

    I'm using very abstract terms because social rules usually take the form of unspoken social-fu; everyone has different rules, and usually you try to enforce your rules "softly"; it's pretty rude to stop a conversation and go "Alright, I don't like what you're saying, so from now on I want you to only make arguments based on X, otherwise I'm out"; but sometimes people go "Could you please not use this type of argument? I think it's offensive", etc.

    Anyway, as an introverted nerd, the trick that made me less socially awkward was to realize that social rules are subjective and informal. You don't strictly have to respect them, but it's rude to completely disregard someone else's preferences. At the same time, you absolutely don't have to argue the way other people *want* you to argue. If you feel you're not being taken seriously, you're absolutely allowed to say "I feel you're not taking me seriously, that's pretty rude". If you think someone missed the point of your argument, you're absolutely allowed to say "Okay, this is interesting, but my initial argument was X, and I don't think you're addressing it".

    Keeping in mind, again, that you can never impose social rules on people who don't accept them. You can try to argue better, you can try to understand someone's perspective, but sometimes it's just not worth the effort. If someone is being rude on purpose and you're arguing harder to compensate, you're enabling them.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      >If someone is being rude on purpose and you're arguing harder to compensate, you're enabling them.

      Yes, that's what I mean by "I get upset with myself for taking the bait." It's not about imposing rules on others who don't accept them, it's about setting a hard standard that's easy to understand (in this case, attack my argument, not a strawman or misrepresentation of it) and if that at the very least is not respected, then I know it's not a conversation that can be salvaged. 

      Your example of enforcing rules softly seems like a tonal difference more than anything, no? So if I reworded the response to be softer in that respect do you think it would be more effective, or are you mostly just objecting to the idea behind it?
      ```

      - u/CouteauBleu:
        ```
        Oh boy. Um.

        Alright, keeping in mind that I'm not exactly Doctor House, and this just my observations as someone who had to climb out of Nerd Social Awkwardness:

        > Your example of enforcing rules softly seems like a tonal difference more than anything, no?

        Yes and no. There, your problems are solved!

        But yes, I think your stock response could be put less formally; something like "I'm sorry, I don't think you understood my point. Just for the sake of the debate, what did you think I meant when I said X?"

        Otherwise, from what you said, it sounds like your "target audience" is people who are not actively trolling you, but are still arguing in bad faith out of habit / irrationality / whatever.

        When arguing with people who fit that profile, my go-to "tricks" are:

        * Signaling that you're not an enemy

        * Explicitly challenging implicit assumptions

        I strongly remember people shaking me out of arguing in bad faith using the second one (like, there are people who argued like that and made me be less of an asshole forever).

        ---

        Signaling plays a strong part in avoiding straw-manning. It's the "I'm not a racist but -" trick; if you don't want people to assume that you have position X, you start off by showing, explicitly or implicitly, that you don't have position X. If you want to argue for stricter immigration laws, you start off with something like "I want to insist that immigrant as individuals are not bad people; it's perfectly reasonable for them to want to travel to richer countries to feed their families and stuff; but, it's still something we need to oppose as a country because -".

        If you want to appeal to Republicans, you say that "They are people who feel that the government has let them down, nobody worries about their futures" except you fuck up and because of the way you phrase it everyone just remembers the "basket of undesirables" part because fuck quoting what politicians say in context, and you know what, fuck politics.

        Personally speaking, I know I have a tendency to do the opposite; like, I make subtle / ambiguous points when I could be perfectly clear; and in retrospect I realize I've been baiting people into misunderstanding what I was saying. It's a bad habit.

        ---

        Challenging assumptions is... I don't know how to describe it. In my head, it's The Ultimate Technique of Perfect Epistemology. It's when you analyze what someone says, and instead of answering their point, you say something like "I assume when you said X, you meant Y? I disagree with Y", where Y is a steel-manned version of what you think the other person means.

        Basically, steel-manning people challenges them, because it forces them to not perceive you as an ignorant that must be convinced, and instead perceive you as someone who understands what they think, and still disagrees.

        So yeah, steel-manning is good, but it's not just that; it's one of the things I think of when I say "don't play by someone else's rules". Basically, it's debating on your own terms; realizing that the "rules" don't have to be determined by arcane unspoken word jousting, and you can just say "I think X isn't important, Y is important, let's talk about Y instead".

        It's a double bonus, because [1] it makes you sound persuasive [2] it means the conversation actually shifts from stuff you don't care about to stuff you care about.

        ---

        Then again, I'm not so sure. The thing with implicit social norms is that you're never sure what you're seeing. Maybe I'm wrong and everything I just said doesn't work and you'll end up looking like an asshole if you try to apply it; disclaimer aside, I've empirically seen people be convinced like that, and I feel pretty confident that none of this is "take yourself too seriously and sound like a pick up artist" bad advice.

        Also, talking on the internet cool because you have time to think about what you say, edit your posts, do research, and not let yourself be baited into discussion you'll regret.
        ```

  - u/ben_oni:
    ```
    If you've ever had, ah, "discussions" with people *in person* that aren't interested in having an actual conversation (you know, the kind where both parties try to learn something from the other person)...

    You know, like the crazy uncle who insists on repeating all the talking points he's heard on NPR or FOX or whatever he listens to; and thinks if he repeats them often enough and loud enough he'll eventually win?

    ... you'll know that sometimes it just isn't possible to course correct a conversation. On the other hand, if you have someone who is willing to learn and admit when they're wrong... well, you also know that the internet isn't very conducive to that sort of conversation.

    I would suspect that a canned response is a poor approach, but that having such a strategy in mind is a plus, as it can be tailored to the particular conversation. And while asking someone to summarize your views certainly seems reasonable, I would suggest that simultaneous to doing so, you summarize the other person's views as well, as honestly as you can. If you can't or won't, it would seem rather one sided and unfair of you to make the demand.

    ---

    I've been thinking lately about how to manage time-lapse conversations online. Threaded, like reddit? Or linear, like other forums? The problem is that conversations kind of form a partial-ordering instead of a total ordering. This one piece of a conversation goes between two others, but isn't really related to this third, although that one also fits in with the surrounding structure... It's kind of a [lattice structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(order)). But how in the world do you represent something like that on a webpage? I suppose this is really a problem for UX design, which is not my specialty.

  What, if any, is the internal difference between love in a romantic relationship and a very close and intimate friendship with benefits? Assume roughly the same amount and quality of sex. By internal I mean psychological and emotional state of the participants, not the social/commitment expectations associated with either.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    For me, the biggest difference is the *internal feeling* of commitment, even if that commitment isn't public, implied, monogamous, or reciprocated.

    There's kind of a temporary quality to a friends-with-benefits thing, even if it's a long-time friend. I've done the friends-with-benefits thing a few times, and it was always with a sort of "yes, that was fun, let's do it again" quality to it, like it's a hobby that I enjoy but which isn't integral to my being.

    Whereas romantic love is more the feeling of integrating (or wanting to integrate) someone into my life. I've been married for about six years now, and we were dating for another three years before that, and before *that* we were close friends with benefits. I think for me it slowly changed from "I like spending time with you, talking about things, and having sex" to "I want the essence of my being to be muddled with yours".

    (This is at least how it feels to me. Conversations with other people have revealed that, to them, there is no internal feeling of what I would call love, romance is *just* a combination of sex, friendship, and some essentially-social-contract stuff.)
    ```

    - u/narfanator:
      ```
      > "I want the essence of my being to be muddled with yours".

      Yes, that. _That_. I would not, however, call that commitment; "I cannot promise what is already true.". In reading "More Than Two", I'm also thinking of the phrase "I want my life to be disrupted by you."

      An image popped into my head:

      Model me as a filled circle in existential state space. There's an overlap I have with this other human. As I grow, so does my existential "circle"; modeled with time as the third dimension, forms a cone.

      The cones continue to overlap. At some time T, everything I was at some prior time T-t is contained in the other human; but now there's more of me, that has yet to be overlapped.
      ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    The feeling of "love" is enough of a social construct and varies enough from person to person that it is very hard to give an answer that will be useful to you. 

    For me, there is very little difference; and to call whatever happens love at least partially a concious decision.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I concur with /u/alexanderwales, but I also think you can't really separate out love from the commitment expectancies.  Where's that damn quote?

    >Love at first sight doesn't exist. Love takes time, and love takes work.

    -- Garnet

    Yeah, *that* Garnet.  The wife has me watching *Steven Universe*.  I can feel the Tumblr-ness leaking out of the screen.

    But she's got a point.  Relationships really are about commitment.  They're about being able to expect that someone's *got you* and you've *got them*, even when stuff's about as hard as life ever gets.  You can't separate that from the "love word".

    Psychological and emotional states *about relationships* need to have intentional content about the causal processes that constitute the relationship, or you're Garnet's lovesick fool.

       [...]

      A _true_ friend's got you through whatever crap there is too, even if the commitment is only implied and not socially recognized/enforced or explicitly stated.

  - u/narfanator:
    ```
    I'm currently completely in love with someone. It doesn't feel like anything I've ever felt before (maybe 70% overlap with some other special cases). It is amazing and occasionally terrifying.

    One of the things that is occurring is immediate happiness when looking at her (or picture of her). Usually there's some intermediate emotion, or I can feel the reprogramming happening; not this time. There's no intermediate emotion; there's barely even the "recognition that it's this person" step. I bring up visual memories, and it's not "and this was a good experience". It's just her face, and I'm happy.

    A thing I've identified but never felt this way before is the degree to which I appreciate her nth-meta level. There's the person before you, there's the person they're becoming. There's the person guiding that change; repeat this pattern to the nth derivative. I feel like we're having a conversation as far up that nth-derivation as I can glimpse

    I've been asking a lot of people what the conceptual relationship is between "emotionally intimate", "sexually intimate" and "romantically intimate" is. Seems like "romance" is a supercategory containing the other two, and additional, unidentified elements. One friend answers that "romance" is the synergy effect between however many categories/attributes you're paying attention too.

    I haven't been in a loving-friends-with-benefits situation, so I can't really compare. I imagine it's the difference between not being bothered by the little things and finding all the little things _amazing_.

  It has occurred to me that I'm a crappy roleplayer and I'm not sure how to get better. I don't like D&D and it's hard to find people who want to play something else. I was happy to finally play Lasers & Feelings on Discord yesterday, but my character wasn't very good and I'm not sure if I can do better. 

  I think I have the same problem as I do with writing, I don't know how to think in narratives and my imagination doesn't work under pressure. That makes me think I shouldn't play narrativist games, except I don't find simulationist games fun.

  I know you're supposed to learn creativity from experience, but if I don't already find the game *fun* then why would I play it? I don't want to have the same "admire from a distance" relationship with tabletop games as I do with video games.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    You might want to try something that's roleplay-adjacent, like taking an improv class (if they're available where you live). Trying to jump feet-first into roleplaying and learn all the creative stuff on the fly seems like it would make the roleplaying less fun and the learning stuff much harder.

    In my experience, it also helps to have some rapport with the people you're playing with, which means either playing with people who are already friends, or playing with people who aren't friends for long enough that they become friends. I find roleplaying (and DMing) a lot more difficult if I'm having any trouble feeding off of the other players.

    (If you have a really great DM, then you don't need to think in narratives, because they'll weave all the narrative stuff for you. Just make a consistent character and the rest will be done for you. There are a lot of crap DMs out there though, and a lot of people run adventure paths or modules, which aren't conducive to that.)

  ----


  This week was a bit of [yak shaving](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/03/dont_shave_that.html), but I feel like that’s par for the course at this point.  In an effort to get Systems up and running, I was taking a look at the ModLoader which ultimately reads, prioritizes, and compiles said Systems.  I knew it was in a sort of hacked-together state, and I’m still not 100% happy with it yet, but it’s certainly much more robust than it was a week ago.  


  The majority of the time was spent implementing the priority system that I’ve had rolling around in the back of my head for some time.  Basically, mods have 4 different ways of declaring up front how they interact with other mods: you can declare another mod as a dependency (X will not load without Y present), you can declare another mod an irreconcilable conflict (X will not load if Y *is* present), you can declare that you must load before another mod, and you can declare that you must load after another mod.  In isolation this is all pretty straightforward, but getting all these rules to play nice was a bit tricky.  

  (if this sounds familiar, it might be because you’re familiar with Supreme Commander’s modding system, which I cribbed it from.)


  Surprisingly (to me anyway) the load before/load after part actually took the most amount of effort to get right.  It boiled down to [constructing a graph](https://i.imgur.com/vF3QFbY.png) and then implementing various algorithms I stole from the internet to *topologically sort* it (that is, to take the messy diagram and turn it into a straightforward priority list).  I wasn’t able to find a graph library for C# that had been updated since 2011, which seemed a bit surprising, so I had to roll my own.  I started by implementing [Kahn’s Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting#Algorithms), which worked perfectly until I introduced a circular reference (A loads before B loads before C loads before A).  At that point it throws up its hands and returns a half-assed result, which was obviously unsatisfactory.

  I then moved on to a [Depth-First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting#Depth-first_search), which handled the circular reference no problem.  However, after getting it to work, I realized that I would like to know if there *was* a cycle in the graph, or at least more information than knowing that Kahn’s blew up on it.  At that point I found [Tarjan’s Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan%27s_strongly_connected_components_algorithm), which would not only tell me exactly what nodes are looping if there is a circular reference, but as a *side effect* would topologically sort the graph!  It’s a pretty neat little algorithm.  

  Anyway, so equipped with these tools I got all the priority rules working together properly.  After /u/Xavion helped me find what should have been very obvious errors, I then set up a bunch of unit tests for the ModLoader.  I may have brought it up before, but [there’s nothing quite like a row of freshly green unit tests](https://i.imgur.com/QNpPL7m.png).  

  So yeah, a lot of good work finished, but the Systems themselves still remain to be implemented.  I’ve got some more unit tests I’d like to write now that I’m in that mode, but then I’ll get back to more game-relevant stuff.

  Oh, I also spent a good amount of time trying to figure out how to set up the git repository to work well with two different versions of Visual Studio (one 2017, one 2015).  My workplace has requested we not install 2017 at all, and 2015 doesn’t support C#7.0, which leads to some interesting incompatibilities. I’m not willing to reduce my target version just for that, but at the same time I’ve had a lot of downtime and I’d like to take advantage of it.  

  If anyone has any insight as to how to [maintain two separate branches](https://bitbucket.org/ketura/xgef/commits/all), letting them merge into one another while keeping at least one branch-2-only commit on that branch and only on that branch, I’d much appreciate your wisdom.  At the moment I’m manually merging things and I just know there’s got to be a more painless way to do it.

    Have a `common` branch that contains all version-agnostic commits, and branches `v6` and `v7`, with commits specific to corresponding versions. Whenever making a version-specific change, commit to corresponding version branch. Whenever making version-agnostic change, commit to `common`, then merge it into each version-specific branch. If you are careful, no conflicts should be introduced (beyond the initial setup), thus allowing automatic merge.

    Have you had a look at package managers? If you're worrying about dependency checking and loading priorities, you're basically making a PM. Have you looked at pacman / npm / yarn / etc?

    One common PM feature that seems to be lacking from your design is optional dependencies.

    > but getting all these rules to play nice was a bit tricky.  

    In addition to yak-shaving, it sounds like you're falling prey to YAGNI, that is, premature feature-creeping. Also, [inner platform effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner-platform_effect).

    Are you sure you're going to need all those rules? Direct dependencies I can get, irreconcilable conflicts I can sort of see (if you have a very popular mod, other modders might want to say they're incompatible with it), but priority loading seems a bit like over-engineering.

    Most modders aren't aware of other mods except the most popular, and their own. If 10 mods try to modify the same gameplay mechanic, it's unlikely that each of then 10 will know about the other 9, and specify each of them as incompatible, or specify a coherent loading order.

    Then again, maybe I'm plain wrong; how often is the "load before, load after" system useful in a Supreme Commander mod?

      It could be useful for when someone is making a modpack, which will be especially relevant for this because any game that it made with it will be a modpack.

        ```
        Short answer: that kind of reasoning isn't good practice for gamedev. Game development is first and foremost a logistic exercise, where you have an objective (make a video game), a limited amount of resources (ex: your free time), and a million possible failure points.

        "It could be useful" is true for any potential feature; what I'm asking is "Is it likely to be worth the effort, given other games and package managers as examples?"

  So, got in a discussion with /u/summerspeaker that eventually included the words:

  >As much as baselines do have souls filled with utterly disgusting amounts of entropy-wear, they're what we all came from, so they've got rights too.

  The thing being, this roughly expresses how I felt about the Rosh haShanah sermon/speech I had to endure yesterday.  It was about Resilience, and making ourselves Stronger in the face of Loss.  Problem was, it played up *fucking* Sheryl Sandberg (yeah, the Facebook one) as its example.

  Like, it came after 2016-2017, and it played Sheryl Sandberg for a theme of *resilience*?

  Besides which, as we'd say here, if resilience is so great, how come we never get out some nice truncheons and go beat everyone over the head until they become more resilient?  Maybe murder every second toddler so the families learn Resilience?

  It seems absurd when you try to treat Resilience as a terminally valuable thing, and worse, it's practically an insult to those of us who've lost things or suffered and *never yet* fully overcome it.  I've got a friend in a wheelchair basically for life, and another who walks with a cane, has a pain disorder in her nerves, *and* suffers psychologically -- she's too poor for the *good* doctors.

  What is Resilience supposed to say to that?

  It occurred to me: [oh, the social function of religion is to explain suffering](http://anthro.palomar.edu/religion/rel_1.htm).  The older these (mostly older) people in this audience get, the more they want to hear religious narratives about Resilience because *their souls are disgustingly worn-down by Entropy*.  Like, they're talking this stuff up because the Lone Power's got Its hooks in them, and they don't want to confront that, let alone actually struggle actively against It.

  This kinda explains to me why I tend to have trouble *feeling* anything about religious or spiritual things.  The rare occasions when I *do* feel something, it's not from a comfortable feeling that I've had the actually-existing world neatly explained as a product of God's plan.  It's from [stuff more like this](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Awesome/YoungWizards): I actually cannot read [*So You Want to be a Wizard*](#s ""I am the wind that troubles the water"") or [*Book of Night with Moon*](#s ""What has become of My children!?"") without tearing up a little.

  Seems kinda relevant to other people here, since the whole lot of us are the basic sort who did or would have immediately taken the Wizard's Oath as a child, and who, introduced to the concept, think of the Lone Power as someone to be combated and driven out, Its "gifts" rejected out-of-hand.
  ```

  - u/PeridexisErrant:
    ```
    Hrasht, to a close approximation *everyone*\ knows to reject That One's gifts.  The problem is usually recognising them, or being able to work against them.

    So... be careful who you choose to become, because "baselines have souls filled with utterly disgusting entropy-wear" sounds like there might be deeper hooks in you than you'd prefer.

      Well yes, an entirely fair criticism.  Actually, I liked the people I was with *while* that speech was being given.  Had a nice time, going back.  Just didn't like the speech.

      I mean, come on guy, at the time of year when we're actually considering these things, don't *concede the fight* at the first round.  I was there because I figured, gods or not, the whole lot of us must have *fucked up* for 2016-2017 to have actually happened, and we *need* to collectively figure out how *not* to do *that* again.

    I also tear up and get a spiritual high from reading Young Wizards, but it's because it resonates with that narrative I have of building up resilience from suffering. They are stories about confronting despair and darkness with the full knowledge that you will eventually succumb to it, then choosing to keep fighting anyway to prevent the suffering of others. 

    My favorite tv series of all time is Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood for the same reason, "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger" is an appealing theme that helps put me in a mindset to overcome the suffering I endure. I don't think admiring or focusing on people who have become stronger from suffering is *necessarily* disrespectful of those who haven't.

    When I'm having a anxiety attack or depressive episode, I don't want to hear about the people who've faced similar obstacles and failed to overcome them because that makes me afraid that I will fail as well. I need to hear about the success stories so I can hold out hope. There are times where I felt I couldn't live up to the example and despaired more, but those have become much rarer as a I get better.

    The case in point for me is Bojack Horseman. The series is a fantastic portrayal of living with self-loathing, the mindset that traps people in it, and how futile escaping it can be. However, seeing Bojack make one bad decision after another just made me feel more disheartened about my own self-loathing. Bojack seemed like the person I could become and I didn't know how to stop it from happening.

    It's the same reason Rick & Morty's nihilism can make it hard to watch at times and why I couldn't bring myself to finish Worm, I need to remind myself that looking at the world in that way will turn me into an emotionally dead husk. Bojack didn't get me through the worst depressive episodes of my life, *K-On!* and *Yuri on Ice!!* did. They made me feel like I could live through it all.

    It was when The Mixed Six did a bit about identity as a performance, "I am only what I pretend to be so I must be careful what I pretend to be", that it all clicked and I figured out how to keep trying even when I felt like giving up. I'm not sure if it's a solution that would work for everyone, or even one I'm capable of teaching to others, but it's what has kept me going even when the depression is still there in the back of my mind.

    I don't think that's disrespectful towards those who have turned out worse that I have. If anything, I'm starting to question whether telling stories about people who ultimately failed ends up turning their suffering into a spectacle for others. Stories like Jessica Jones and the Night Angel Trilogy turned surviving trauma into an act of heroism, and ultimately made me care for those who've suffered worse that I more than I already did.

      Note to self: write an awesome story about a character plagued with self-loathing and self-doubt slowly overcoming nihilism, cynicism and learning to accept himself despite his flaws, both to cheer eaturbrainz and trekie140 up and to become rich and famous.
      ```

      - u/trekie140:
        ```
        I'd read it. Sounds a bit like Night Angel and...I think Sword Art Online: Abridged. I mean, the former was about people holding on to their humanity despite going through hell and constantly staring into the abyss of despair, but the latter features characters who are insecure assholes going through arcs where they learn to care about others and manage to achieve self actualization. Huh.

  I worry a lot about "mansplaining".

  Like, my son has a lot of trouble with the final consonant in any consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) syllable, which means that "book" and "boot" both come out as "boo" (or, sometimes, "boo", then a long pause, and then "kuh"). His pronunciation is a lot like you would expect of a Japanese speaker learning English, because Japanese (almost) exclusively uses a CV structure for their syllables (e.g. "su-shi" or "o-ri-ga-mi" or "ki-mo-no"). His first multisyllable word was "blueberry", and I'm pretty sure that's because he could pronounce it with all open syllables (i.e. "blu-beh-ri").

  And anyway, this is something that I've been geeking out on, because I find it super interesting, and if I talk to someone (especially someone with kids, as often happens at the park) it seems like a thing that I might bring up, because again, I find it to be super interesting. And even if it wasn't that specific thing, a lot of what I want to talk about with other people is based on sharing things *like* this.

  But since a lot of my random social interactions are with parents (I'm a stay-at-home dad these days), that means a lot of my social interactions are with women, and I get nervous and worried that if I talk about the things that I want to talk about, it's going to come off as this gendered condescension or like I have some intent beyond just trying to have a conversation.

  And I don't know how much the other person knows about whatever I'm interested in that day, which means there's more indecision, because I don't want to spell things out if it's obvious to them, and I don't want to go shorthand if that's going to make it seem like I'm talking over them, and I don't know what to do about that either.

  So I mostly try to just keep my head down and not talk to people that much.

    Theres a difference between mansplaining and infodumping and anyone who says otherwise is ableist.

    Infodumpingis a function of intellectual excitement. Mansplaining is a function of sexist prejudice. The rhetoric styles will often reflect this.
    ```

  - u/Kishoto:
    ```
    Well, if you're *very* concerned, I would say to save your enthusiasm for people that you've already constructed some sort of basic relationship with. Like enough of one that you can reasonably expect them to know you're not trying to "mansplain" anything. 

    Truly, however, I think mansplaining is all about the way you explain things. It's about the somewhat implicit condescension that can come across when a man tries to explain something to a woman. Sort of like saying "I know you're just a girl, so you probably won't get this but..." before your actual sentence. Though it's obviously more subtle than that usually.

    But I highly doubt you have anything to be concerned about. You're going to be discussing your kid's progress and learning with other parents. That's basically talking shop. You'll be fine.
    ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Um... it sounds like you worry too much? (man, I did not expect to ever say that to you)

    Did people/women ever react negatively when you were having one of these conversations? How often?

    > and I don't want to go shorthand if that's going to make it seem like I'm talking over them, and I don't know what to do about that either.

    I'm sorry if that's too obvious, but have you tried "Do you know what [shorthand] means? Cool, so then... / Okay, so [shorthand] is when..."

    I do it all the time and it's usually pretty smooth.
    ```

  - u/syncope_apocope:
    ```
    I think the fact that you *are* concerned is a good sign that you won't do this. Just be sure you're giving the other person room to talk and you should be fine!

    EG., "My kid does this funny thing. What about yours?"

    That said, I hope you're taking this opportunity (of having a small child) to do more linguistics experiments with him! The [Wug Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Berko_Gleason#Children.27s_learning_of_English_morphology.E2.80.8D.E2.80.94.E2.80.8Cthe_Wug_Test) is a really neat one.

    That's really interesting, especially as my speech issues are in the exact opposite direction. I have no problem with closed syllables, but vowels annihilate me. When I speak Japanese, I truncate all my words so I don't have to add those dreaded vowel endings ("watash wa ien kotob g' ar" is a good approximation of a typical sentence for me) . Does your son have any other speech problems? I've never heard of something so specific.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      I wouldn't actually call it a speech problem *yet*, because he's 19 months old and more or less on track developmentally; it's likely that this difficulty will disappear on its own in a few months time. (I'm trying my best not to be one of those parents that analyzes everything their child does to compare it against developmental milestones, because I think that can create some unnecessary anxiety.)

      This only other peculiarity of his speech thus far is that his first consonant was [k], which was all he had for a long time, and his first two words were both [k]-onset words. Usually kids will correctly articulate [b], [d], [m], [w], and [h] first. I'm not really sure *why* he had a (somewhat) offbeat first consonant, but it probably has to do with how his brain was wiring itself up, or maybe how his experiments with mouth shapes hit on a solution space.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        I am a child at present, and I would certainly appreciate anything that could plausibly reduce child-caused parental anxiety, so I approve of  your consideration.

        It is especially interesting, as with the exception of [h] all those listed consonants have significant voicing, and [k] doesn't. This is fairly blatant pattern-matching on a paucity of data, but nonetheless I can see why you want to bring your kid's speech up to people.

  Has anyone happened to see the Lego Ninjago movie? I really enjoyed the last two Lego movies but have heard bad things about this one so I hope to get the opinions of people with similar opinions to me.
