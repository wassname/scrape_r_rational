## [Spoilers] Has anyone else been following the latest season of Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.?

### Post:

I might be reading too much into it, but the Darkhold really strikes me as a superintelligence, or perhaps a means of enhancing other intelligences; it hasn't become clear yet whether it has goals of its own. Radcliffe seems like a cautionary tale of the dangers of being transhumanist without being rationalist.

The subplot with AIDA and the Framework was really interesting to me. For example, Radcliffe seems to have implemented AIDA's safety measures through her hardware and not her utility function, which naturally led to her trying to circumvent them to more effectively maximize her utility function of protecting the Framework. I also liked how fundamentally different the simulated versions of team were, due to their different pasts. Daisy and Simmons weren't able to get their "true selves" to come out because they weren't just brainwashed; they'd developed into different people due to different memories and influences. Well, except for Coulson, who kept flashes of his old memories due to previously having alien technology messing around in his brain.

  I'm watching it too. The Darkhold is surely a means of enhancing intelligence and definitely seems to be kinda-sorta sentient or aware.

  It struck me a while ago just how absurdly powerful it has to be, based on how they can scan the brains of someone within minutes and send them out. No one comments on it but it really is ludicrous.  It's a shame that they're likely going to find some way to wipe out most or all of Radcliffe's work since it breaks the status quo so much; with the Darkhold he essentially achieved all he set out to do, he was just dumb about AIDA.

  AoS in general seems to be very bad about following the "fighting the mind control from the inside" trope, which I kinda like. Brainwashing or control really seems to stick. See the Hive arc, which provided a brutal example trying to appeal to that going wrong. Once you change someone's history or their brain chemistry they change, and it's hard to get them back.

  Which makes it odd that the main ways of mind control in the movie universe, despite being based on the canonically most powerful things like Infinity Stones...suck.

    The characters themselves can be infuriatingly irrational, though. The scene where Fitzsimmons walks under the LMD detector and it goes off, prompting the two to argue over who's the robot, lost all of its intended emotional impact for me because I couldn't get over the fact that the two supposedly brilliant scientists supposedly couldn't think of something as simple as *walking back through the detector one at a time*.

    What about the infinity Stone's mind control wasn't as effective? Loki's staff gave the wielder complete control over people without reducing any of their abilities, and they were only freed when they hit their head after being punched by an Avenger or Scarlet Witch counteracted it with her own telepathic powers. It seems like the Stones are just as powerful as the stuff SHIELD deals with, they just don't have any special abilities to protect themselves.

      I mean...individual mind control upon touching that's broken by hitting your head kinda isn't that good for an Infinity Stone.

      Compared to the Power Stone being capable of roasting a world or the Aether being able to take out the universe...

      Even compared to mind control like say...Hive's they don't look that impressive, in terms of robustness.

      The Infinity Stones are supposed to be the next-level thing, as they're set up. And the Mind Stone seems like it was the weakest, in how it was harnessed at least.
