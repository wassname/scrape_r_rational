## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  I was ready to call it quits on *Full Metal Panic*. [It took seven episodes for me to warm up to it](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8gzxzd/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dygpdoq) and the rest of the first season was a mixed bag. I liked the show whenever Sagura and Kaname were together, even if the story was *far* from nuanced, but when they were split up I was just bored.

  I expected there to be filler, the problem was that almost none of the filler took place at the high school where all the episodic comedy happens. Even when Sagura’s job took him places that get referenced later, I really didn’t enjoy those episodes because they felt like pointless tangents at the time.

  But then I gave the purely comedic Fumoffu season a shot and **I busted a gut**. I don’t remember laughing this much at a anime since *One Punch Man*. The story is complete nonsense, of course, Sagura and Kanme are stupid even compared to the first season, but I don’t care because it’s so funny.

  This is some quality anime comedy with perfect dubbing and spectacular visuals from Kyoto Animation that I recommend to everyone. It’s all dumb on purpose so it’s not like you need to know that these characters are also from a serious military thriller story, but for me it heightens the absurdism.

  The experience of watching this anime is one of the strangest personal narratives I’ve ever gone through. The first season was really just okay at its best, and boring for long stretches, yet I enjoyed it anyway for some reason. Now my loyalty has been rewarded with the comedy I never knew I wanted.

  I'm starting to seriously think that my mood is strongly tied to the day's weather, to the point that I'm wondering if I might have some sort of variation of seasonal affective disorder.

  I've often noticed that I felt happy in motivated during sunny days, and sluggish and depressed in cloudy/rainy days, even when I'm spending most of my time working indoors. I used to made jokes to friends about how the only possible explanation was that I had mood-triggered superpowers that controlled the weather, but now that I'm paying attention to the correlation it seems way stronger than confirmation bias would explain. Or maybe this is just placebo+nocebo effect, and me noticing it has made it stronger.

  Any insights?

    I had an epiphany two weeks ago and allowed myself to recognize the fact that I'd been in a depressive state for quite a while, noticed its correlation with the fact that I've been a shut-in hermit for like a year, and started taking vitamin D supplements. I feel less numb, and more capable of thinking. There's a lot of contradictory information about it on the internet; but, anecdotally, it's seemed to work for me. YMMV.

  I have always been more surprised and baffled the way US media portrays **workers' unions**, with strikes being something that is far more destructive an affair than I'd expect to be reasonable given the stakes. The stereotypical union boss is obstinate and unrelenting in getting their goals, often corrupt, and has no qualms in killing the company they're ostensibly working for to get what they want, except killing the company kills the jobs. In their quest on following their mandate they're often prone to exploding and yelling, not arguing.

  Not being versed in that part of history (at least not for the US in particular) I wonder if there's the societal trauma the US went through, where unions killed off industries in their 'shortsighted' demands for higher wages, better working conditions and OSHA compliance. 

  But I want to understand this. So if someone could point me in a direction, ideally with a book on comparative union philosophies across the globe, that'd be much appreciated.

    ```
    Why do you think that this type of media portrayal comes from a legitimate social trauma? Commercial media creation is not a democratic process. Nor do people usually watch and like the movies/shows that portray workers' unions this way because they really enjoy that specific fact as the main appeal.

    Honestly, just look at how pro-capitalism even poor people are. They routinely vote against what would clearly be in their best interest, selfishly seen.

    If that is due to wholesome libertarian ideology or due to rampant capitalist propaganda is for yourself to decide.

      > Why do you think that this type of media portrayal comes from a legitimate social trauma? Commercial media creation is not a democratic process. Nor do people usually watch and like the movies/shows that portray workers' unions this way because they really enjoy that specific fact as the main appeal.

      First, let me point out what I wrote (emphasis added):

      > **I wonder if** there's the societal trauma the US went through, where unions killed off industries in their 'shortsighted' demands for higher wages, better working conditions and OSHA compliance.

      It was just one of the scenarios I could come up with, in the likes of the [swing riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_Riots), destroying products and machines of industrial manufacture the workers use to emphasise and make a point of their plight during the strike.

      Like I said, it's not a part of US history I know anything about. I find it curious how this stereotype came to be and wonder if there's an actual foundation to be pointed towards that inspired it, or if it's a slow accumulation and gradual development that came about in light of the developments in the old world. 

      Another factor could be the socialist reforms that were talked about for a long time during the 19th century before they were implemented in various European nations, and how the American Way of Life with its deep-seated roots in capitalism, personal enterprise, and such was threatened (or at least *felt* threatened) by these reforms, with newspapers and opinion columns reporting and caricaturising these events from afar and drawing a more fearful picture that later transformed into the self-harming unions stereotype.

      Again, like I said, I'm not a historian, this is just guesswork on my part. It'd merely be nice to know more about it, especially in some comparative way.

    I'm in my union at work (engineer's union) and I find it a very positive organisation though it does get a little political at times. Mostly just in a partisan way, the worst experience I had was I went to a union training session and they politely asked us if we'd like to stay back to cold call people to vote for their preferred candidate, and I and a bunch of other people  said no and there was no pressure or shaming or anything so overall not too bad.

    In Australia at least, unions are the reason a lot of our great benefits are there: things like employers having to pay 9.5% of your wage into a retirement account, four weeks of paid leave a year, two weeks of paid sick leave a year, legislated minimum conditions for different types of job, extra pay for working on the weekend, maternity leave, long service leave (I get 3 months off, paid, after being at my employer for 7 years), redundancy (usually about 12 weeks pay if you're fired!), etc. These are all things that people take for granted here (and probably sound like unicorn tears to people reading this in the USA). 

    This has all been happening for a ridiculously long time and Australia isn't some jobless wasteland. (Aus unemployment: 5.6%, USA unemployment 4.1%; but we have unemployment benefits for basically as long as it takes you to get a job...)

    Here's a biased page on what Australian unions have acheived over the decades: https://www.australianunions.org.au/union_achievements

  How is everyone doing? Anyone have anything exciting or interesting going on in their lives they want to talk about?
  ```

  - u/neondragonfire:

    Depends on your definitions for exciting and interesting :)

    But based on my own, there are a few things that I wouldn't mind talking about:

    * I'm making a [game](http://felix.prinz.name/villageBuilder/index.html).
    * I'm writing [fan-fiction](https://archiveofourown.org/works/14620938/chapters/33789492) for The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant, from the point of view of the Dragon. 
    * I have a [blog](https://dnimeht.wordpress.com/), and there are statistics over when people have looked at it and from which country. Especially the last part I find fascinating, because there is so much variety. I also wonder how people came to find the blog. I told friends and family, but... I don't really think any of them read it. I haven't put the link out anywhere on the internet (before this very post). So I assume that it has something to do with it being hosted on Wordpress where people can find my posts through the Discover feature or something like that.

    I want to start writing some fiction but i suck at motivating myself to actually write. I am so lazy...

    also my drivers license exam is coming and i suck at driving so i am really worried

    there is also my technician exam which i am not worried about because its easier and i am feeling rather confident about that, atleast more confident than i am feeling about the drivers license exam

    i just finished my aprenticeship and it was shit. I am never working that job again. Shit hours, shit commute, exhausting af and boring. I felt like dying everytime i had to wake up 4:30 am to get there on time. Also since summer is almost in full swing already and i am allergic to pollen i wanted to die even more while working outside because i had to blow my nose every couple of second ( the skin on my nose is all cracked because of it) ughhhh even after 5 years of treatment its still horrible. And on the last day of work we had to go near the ukraine border and there were so many mosquitos there. Like if you stayed in one place for a second something like a 200 or smth mosquitos instantly tried to get onto you and i am not exaggerating when i say 200 it was as if a whole beehive was onto you so to not get bitten all over ( my friend thought he woulnt need  a hoodie or full lenght pants and got bitten all over although he got a replacement hoodie from one of our coworkers who worked somewhere else but the short pants made his life misarable...poor lad). It was 30 degrees celcius so working in a hoodie while digging holes in a dirt,  raking the earth and planting grass (WHICH SHOULDNT BE MY FUCKING JOB!) was god damn horrible and i dont want to repeat that experience ever again.

    I also want to get some summer job abroad when i will have vacations but i kinda think i realized it too late and it looks like most of the things are taken...ehh maybe i will try next year. 

    I also have some ambition of learning programming but the same thing with writing i am lacking motivation. I once started learning, downloaded codeblocks and started doing some things in accordance with some guide but i didnt get too far and forgot most of it by now cause it was in middle school. Also being more technologically literate would be cool like knowing your stuff about PCs etc so i could build my self one that is on a budget or smth. Are there any usefull sites to learn such things ? i used to learn programming on cpp.pl which is a polish site since my english in middle school was a lot worse than it is now i think i am more confident in trying at some english course. I know its probably easy to find and its just a case of googling it but are there any really good ones that people tested or learned from themselves ? i have some aspirations as a game designer since yeah, i kinda like games etc.

    It kinda bums me out when i see guys younger than me or my age doing amazing games or some cool engineering when the only thing i ever do is is surfing the net and playing games when i am home. My excuse is that school and all the things like drivers license and other exams are taking a toll on me but yeah... its mostly because of my laziness

    atleast my and my friends smithy project is going kinda good. We are like making a smithy for a year already but thats mostly because we live on the opposites sides of town and its hard to meet up cuz the bus times are horrible. Hopefully it will be easier when i will have a car. Its almost done tho and we can finally make some cool swords or smth

    - u/DrunkenQuetzalcoatl:

      You can sort of combine playing games and learning programming. There is a rather small genre called programming games. It teaches the abstract basics of programming that trip up many people that start with text.

      Some recommended examples:

      http://pleasingfungus.com/Manufactoria/

      http://lightbot.com/flash.html

      http://www.zachtronics.com/the-codex-of-alchemical-engineering/

      (And all other zachtronics games)

      There are also some programming games on steam. (But these cost a small amount of money).

      Like Human Resource Machine and Opus Magnum.

  In ASOIAF or GoT it's always "King in the North". Why King IN the North? Why not OF? Maybe because North is actually a direction but that seems too shallow. (could be the reason though) 

   In real medieval Europe such "connections" had actual meanings. For example Brandenburg-Preussen. They(the Hohenzollers) were the rulers of Brandenburg and Prussia and because they weren't allowed to be Kings in the HRE, their titles were "Prince-elector OF Brandenburg (Kurfürst von Brandenburg) and King IN Prussia (König in Preussen) so they technically were still a prince in the HRE. But Kings outside of it. 

  But in ASOIAF there isn't such a circumstance and I am probably thinking far too much about something which was probably thoughtlessness by the Author. Just wanted to say it.

  so, anybody have any suggestions for finding time to write while juggling other responsibilities?

  I find context switching very hard. It's very difficult to get any writing done without spending a lot of time to get into the flow. (I've tried the "oh, write for an hour each day, or write *n* words each, or whatever, but had no luck.) Right now, I've found a system where every couple of weeks, I set aside 3-4 days to do focus on writing. After the first day I can focus consistently. But then after 4 days I get sufficiently beyond on my phd work and the like, and then I have to stop.

  This has an OK output level, about what I can reasonably expect me to achieve given my current writing experience level, except sacrificing a bunch of days in a rows kind of sucks and makes other things in life hard.

    So, I'm writing a novel, studying part time, and working full time. This is more organisation specific than writing specific, since that's where I excel. \*cracks knuckles* here's the strategies that work for me:

    - Bake everything into your routines. Saturday mornings I typically spend 2-3 hours broken between studying and writing. After work I go into an empty office, log onto the computer there, and spend an hour or so after work doing anki cards or editing the novel. Since I'm still in the office building, it's not distracting like being at home and having to worry about cooking dinner / walking the dog. I normally finish work at 4 so I stay until 5 working on personal projects. 

    - On the above, change your context. I found I got a lot more done when I wrote in libraries than when I wrote at home, because home has all these distractions and the libraries have none. 

    - This TED talk inspired me to do the above, by the way: https://www.ted.com/talks/laura_vanderkam_how_to_gain_control_of_your_free_time/transcript?language=en particularly the following passage:

    > She comes home to find that her water heater has broken, and there is now water all over her basement. [...] So she's dealing with the immediate aftermath that night, next day she's got plumbers coming in, day after that, professional cleaning crew dealing with the ruined carpet. All this is being recorded on her time log. Winds up taking seven hours of her week. Seven hours. That's like finding an extra hour in the day.

    > But I'm sure if you had asked her at the start of the week, "Could you find seven hours to train for a triathlon?" "Could you find seven hours to mentor seven worthy people?" I'm sure she would've said what most of us would've said, which is, "No -- can't you see how busy I am?" Yet when she had to find seven hours because there is water all over her basement, she found seven hours. And what this shows us is that time is highly elastic. We cannot make more time, but time will stretch to accommodate what we choose to put into it.

    > And so the key to time management is treating our priorities as the equivalent of that broken water heater. To get at this, I like to use language from one of the busiest people I ever interviewed. By busy, I mean she was running a small business with 12 people on the payroll, she had six children in her spare time. I was getting in touch with her to set up an interview on how she "had it all" -- that phrase. I remember it was a Thursday morning, and she was not available to speak with me. Of course, right?

    > But the reason she was unavailable to speak with me is that she was out for a hike, because it was a beautiful spring morning, and she wanted to go for a hike. So of course this makes me even more intrigued, and when I finally do catch up with her, she explains it like this. She says, "Listen Laura, everything I do, every minute I spend, is my choice." And rather than say, "I don't have time to do x, y or z," she'd say, "I don't do x, y or z because it's not a priority." "I don't have time," often means "It's not a priority." 

    - Examine what you're doing and what you want to change. I use a productivity website called [Complice](https://complice.co/?r=uv93q4n34x) that has you do a weekly review. I noticed last week that I hadn't got any writing done at all, and decided I had to lower the priority of my study time in order to fit more writing time in. (note: complice link is a referral link, but it gives you an extra week of trial)

    - Measure things that are easy to measure. I prefer to measure time rather than outputs, because if I say "no going to bed until I finish editing this chapter/write this many words", I know there's a risk it could take me hours and I never get to bed which means I'm going to let myself off the hook. Better to use a time goal. Complice has an integrated pomodoro timer, so I have started using "pomos" as my time limit: so for a typical Saturday morning, for example, I might say, 1 pomo studying anki cards, 1 pomo working on my talk, 1 pomo working on chemistry, 1 pomo working on my novel. That's about 2.5 hours of time and I'll get a hell of a lot done. 

    - If you need words written, check out beeminder: https://www.beeminder.com - I used URLminder and google docs to force myself to get a word count. If I didn't get that word count, I had to pay $5. It helps keep you accountable to yourself.

    - You have downtime. You're on the toilet. You're waiting in line for coffee. Make that productive - like someone else said, you can think about your novel, think about plot ideas, but also work out ways to scaffold other parts of your life into that time. I use anki decks to study and I use the phone app during those times. I can get 15 minutes of study done every single day just from those moments where I'm at work waiting for people to attend a meeting, waiting for coffee, and pooping. I don't know how this works for you - maybe you can do stuff related to your phd on anki, or maybe you can use a note taking app to brainstorm, or maybe you can use it to sketch a scene out in dot points. Even if it's less efficient than using your computer, it's time you'd have wasted anyway.

    - I reward / bribe myself. "Can't start making breakfast until I've done one pomo", "that pepsi you're craving will only be yours if you've done a pomo of project status reports", etc. Only ever small things that I get immediately after my equally small achievement.

    - Don't be too hard on yourself. The biggest thing that gets me in my work day in terms of productivity is my "shame spiral". I don't get much done which means I feel shitty about myself and keep on not getting much done, "the day is wasted anyway". I try to think what my best friend would say to me and internalise that rather than thinking what a failure I am. Also, if I have a real shame spiral sort of day, I try to change my to do list to just one or two stupidly easy things, or break tasks down to steps the include "open the program", "click on the link", "type in the name of what i'm searching for". It's motivating to give yourself some wins.
    ```

      I can be decently productive in my downtime (commutes and so forth), in terms of thinking of story/plot/character ideas, the issue is actually with you know... sitting down to write.

      My general life strategy is that when I'm having trouble being productive, I just switch to whatever task is on my mind that's distracting me from doing the task I'm 'supposed' to do be doing. I believe this is basically like structured procrastination or closely related. The problem is... the task that I switch to is almost never 'writing words on a page', UNLESS I'm in one of those days-long writing flow states which are painful to get in and out of. I guess what I'd *ideally* like to do would be to pack some writing into the 2-3 hours of downtime I have every evening but I can't swap in that fast.
      ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    I think context-switching is something that you can get better at, and if you can't actually carve out time from your other responsibilities, that's probably what you'll have to try to do. The actual question of "how do I find time for writing" is a much harder one, and depends on your specific responsibilities and/or schedule.

    Some techniques I've found helpful for either writing on a consistent basis or being able to jump back into it:

    * If possible, writing should be your default background mental process, i.e. the thing that you're thinking about when you have any time at all. If you've got a commute, that's a good time to think about writing, rather than zoning out. Even if you're not "writing", then your time is still being spent working out problems or thinking things through, which makes getting it on the page easier, and (in my experience) getting it easier to get into the flow state.
    * Be careful about where you leave off, and how you spend your writing time. I try not to leave a scene unfinished, if I can at all help it, because coming back into a half-done scene means that I'm spending my writing time trying to get back into that specific headspace, rather than just the general world of the novel.
    * Use notes, especially for upcoming scenes (though this sort of depends on how heavily you outline). I think that when you're "in the zone" you can sort of lay the groundwork for your return to "the zone" at a later date, but that's its own special sort of skill, and very individual. Toward the end of a writing session I usually try to leave myself a line about what the next scene I'm writing is, and I have a doc with a few dozen scenes that I'd like to include at some point, which helps me get back into it without taking up a huge amount of time (though I hardly ever look at those notes, since they're all part of the persistent background processes and the kind of stuff I think about when I'm not actually writing at the keyboard).
    * Make writing as much of a habit is you can, in order to wear in that groove, and ensure that there's no rust when you start back up. Writing is, in many respects, a muscle, which doesn't just snap back into perfect condition the moment you need it. But you already said that doesn't really work for you, so I don't know -- included here because I think it's good general advice, rather than good advice for you specifically.

    If none of that helps, which it might not (because that wasn't your actual question), and the problem really is just time management, we'd need to know more about your specific schedule in order to know what you might be able to drop and/or change.
    ```

    - u/tjhance:
      ```
      > If none of that helps, which it might not (because that wasn't your actual question)

      nah, your advice was pretty on-point. thanks! (unfortunately (fortunately?) i'm already doing a lot of it, except the 'make it a habit' thing)
