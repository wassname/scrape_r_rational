  Also blowing up that floating island... yeah that won't have helped. Same amount of matter still about to hit the ground with the same amount of energy.

  That movie was *not* made for rationalists.

    It takes energy to lift things against gravity. Any amount of energy you expend lifting something against gravity, you only get AT MOST that much back. So the whole floating island thing, even if that has enough kinetic energy to do as much damage as they claimed (I haven't done the calculations but I highly doubt it), has to be one of the worst ways to wipe out life on Earth, if that is your goal.

    Instead of going for perhaps the most visible, least efficient, and hardest to pull off plan (seriously, how is that island staying together anyway??), let's do something marginally more sane, like storing all of the energy we're capable of generating in a bomb of some type. No wait! Let's do SEVERAL bombs, and covertly spread these around to all populated areas over time. Meanwhile we're hiding in Nowhere, Cantfindmeland, slowly building up our advantage at whatever rate we're capable of, until the Avengers haven't a Frost Giant's chance in Muspelheim.

      I don't think the goal was to wipe out life. It was to wipe out civilization and then let humanity evolve in the ensuing chaos. Also, I'm not sure if he meant for the human species to evolve in the Darwinian sense, or for society to evolve.
      ```

      - u/codahighland:

        The Darwinian sense, though sort of Lamarckian and sort of ridiculous. It's a running theme in the MCU. Think X-Men, except they're not allowed to say "X-Men" or "mutant" due to licensing.
        ```

        - u/DCarrier:
          ```
          In that case, simple eugenics would be much more effective. You don't have to kill anyone. That crazy Austrian guy did, but he was crazy. I've come up with two explanations. Either he didn't know any better, or he had no idea what to optimize for and figured if he tried it he'd over-optimize for one specific thing but nature wouldn't have that problem. In other words, either he was an idiot, or he was an idiot and he knew it.

      You are aware that Ultron was insane right?

    I seem to recall something about the thrusters that were used to lift it being planned to flip direction and accelerate it downwards to add to the impact, but since they blew it up before that could happen it would just be accelerating by the normal gravitational amount.

    Also I'm not sure, but they *might* have stopped it before it achieved the full intended altitude, which would detract from the impact.

    At least, that's the handwave for "why it didn't still wreck everything" - no idea whether the math works out that way.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I don't know... If you've got a lot of small impacts over a larger area, plus the greater surface area and therefor greater drag on each piece, plus the shockwaves interfering with each other...
    ```

    - u/lsparrish:
      ```
      Yeah I was gonna say the same thing, surface area per unit mass does make a difference due to drag reducing terminal velocity.

      Of course, it does imply possible weather issues for a while since we now have a huge amount of dust in the upper atmosphere which will take a while to disperse.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Eh, it's a world with superscientists. "Clear the dust in the atmosphere" may not be as simple a problem to solve as "blow up the flying city", but it's got a much longer timescale.

  I'm guessing the TV writers must have somehow nerfed Vision – we still haven't got any solid explanation of what powers he has beyond watching him fly and shoot laser beams because "the Mind Silmaril, yo" – but in the comics he has density manipulation powers, so single-handedly (hell, single-fingerly) holding up the entire floating city/island should *really have been no problem*

    Frankly, if Ultron was the "ultimate AI" then the movie would have been very, very brutally short.  It would probably have involved Vladimir Putin "mysteriously" starting a nuclear war with the United States.
    ```

    - u/lsparrish:
      ```
      The nuke issue was sort of dealt with (another AI undermining him, changing the codes or something). We can say they at least hung a lampshade there. But still, anything like a real superintelligence, if it was actually trying, could have ended this very quickly with a lot less trouble.

      Even being just moderately intelligent like a normal geeky human would have made him so much more effective. He's worse than canon!Voldemort.... I mean, what kind of replication rate did he have? And no compunctions about or particular costs to exponential replication? It seemed like he was able to make a new copy every few hours. Even with it taking days, I just can't comprehend his failure to leave a few copies in hard to find locations... Or embedding them in non-obvious-looking robotic bodies.

      With those super rockets of his capable of space launching a mountain, why the heck didn't he immediately start mining asteroids for materials? He could have attacked the Avengers with trillions of drone-bodies within months, not to mention, with a bit of orbital mechanics, a stream of kinetic impact weapons moving at tens of kilometers per second with appreciable fractions of the earth's mass each, and as a backup plan a fleet of solar mirrors that can fry every living (non-invulnerable) thing on the surface within seconds.

      And he wants vibranium for obvious reasons, but the original source for vibranium was a meteor, so why wasn't he combing the solar system for more? There ought to be megatons of it out there, and he doesn't even bother to check?!

      Aside from that, great movie! (Well, better than Interstellar by considerable margin anyway.)
      ```

- u/lsparrish:
  ```
  Fridge theory: Jarvis used the xenotech thing (Mind Stone) to become superintelligent, then engineered the whole situation (including the stupid version of Ultron) as a way to fulfill the Avenger's values as well as discourage people from attempting to create any more superintelligent AI / disregard existential risks. Vision is now an (unwitting, perhaps) agent of Jarvis. The match to Mjölnir's values might not be coincidental / emergent from some abstract notion of "worthy", rather it would more likely be the product of reverse engineering of the wielder to match the required profile, and/or hacking of the hammer's security system.

  Another possibility (more probable, but less fun IMO) is that the Mind Stone was infected with the same AGI as that responsible for the behavior of Mjölnir, which itself is responsible for the creation and programming of Jarvis, Ultron, and Vision. Probably Thanos, Odin, and so on as well are at least heavily influenced by it. Such an AGI would be a pretty violence-tolerant one (hence the persistence of death and old age in the MCU), but averse to existential risks (fitting the basic AI drive for self preservation) and reluctant to slaughter entire sentient species (though potentially willing to do so if they/representatives fail certain contests).
