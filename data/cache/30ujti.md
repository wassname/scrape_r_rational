  From chapter 29:

  > "It snows pretty heavily here in winter, and whole towns can sometimes get cut off from the rest of the world for days, so it's hard to marshal a response in time. Most of the time no one even finds out there was a crisis until days afterwards, when nothing can be done," Vani tapped the table with his fingers contemplatively, as if considering something. "Or at least, that's what the hunters and the authorities like to say. Personally, I just think they're afraid of the Silver One."

  > "Silver One?" asked Zorian curiously.

  > "It's a rumor. A few years back, when the winter wolves first started acting up, there was an attempt to organize a wide scale cull and a large hunting party was organized. It ended… poorly. According to stories, several winter wolf packs worked together to lure the hunters into traps, separating them into smaller groups that were then defeated in detail. They acted more like an army than a group of wild animals, and survivors claimed they were led by a huge winter wolf with a shiny silver pelt. The Silver One – an alpha of alphas, as smart as any man and with the power to direct his lesser brothers against humans. There was an official attempt by the Eldemar's mage guild to locate and eliminate this winter wolf, but they found nothing – neither the silver wolf nor any evidence of multiple packs working together. A lot of the locals are still convinced he exists, though – they say that anyone who goes after the wolves ends up getting confronted by it sooner or later."

  Looks like the Silver One is real and hanging around the Iasku mansion. Perhaps it's a shape-shifted human mage (EDIT: with mind powers to direct the wolves)?

  Also, "Iasku" sounds like a setup for a joke.

  "Why do I have to carry all this crap to Iasku mansion?"

  "I ask you and you do it."

    Christ how do you remember that it was four months ago

      I remember it, but I just found the story within the last month.  Thanks to the people posting links here.

      Yeah. With the whole memory thing I'm starting to make a wiki for every character. I suck at all the admin stuff, but at least it'll mean someone could easily find any characters.

  If you think "I really should turn back", *you're probably right*.  You idiot.

    He's grown uncaring to the prospect of dying a horrible death at this point. He's starting to regard it as a painful inconvenience.

  I wonder if it is difficult to capture an eyebeast and pit it against the grey hunter.

  Zach's immediate movements post-start are inconsistent? So he's not carrying memory packets to red robe? Or perhaps he is, but the wandering is an extra layer of security?

    ```
    Depending on how ... chaosy the universe is, it might be a dead giveaway. If the entire system is deterministic and reasonably stable (outside of the loopers) then they just need to look for people who do different things each time loop. 

    However that entire enterprise might not be feasible without a national security state.

  Interesting chapter. A lot more content than most.

  1. The mayor is in on this, they're assassinating soul experts to aid the Ikosian invasion somehow. Perhaps they have some grand scheme to figure out like the Bakora gates? Contacting primordials? So either they abduct them for their knowledge or mind rape them for their knowledge or somehow weakish soul magic would allow someone to stop whatever scheme.

  2. He's skilled enough to kill assassins. Pretty fine. He should probably try incorporating some soul magic into his warding scheme, should be near impossible to bypass. I'm surprised no mention was made of interrogating the assassin.

  3. The fire animation spell looks pretty cool. He could probably use it to kill the Grey Hunter. Lure it in with those, set up a ward somewhere, draw it in, hit it with some potent non magical trap like a deep pit.

  4. Transformation is seriously useful. And plus it's very accessible to him- he just has to delve into the dungeons a few times, get rich, and he can purchase all sorts of useful potions.

  5. Sounds like he's levelled up. Too strong for wilderness trash encounters. But he needs more wards to protect him against attacks. A basic protection one should be obligatory.

  As to what he could do for the future.

  Crystallized mana. Presumably he could use this in spells? If so, very useful in setting a trap for enemies. 

  Trial 1 of Aranea contact. The Aranea will presumably want something from him for their help. He needs to find out what. To help him it would be excellent to have some help- that priest could do a lot of good for him in surviving any traps or overcoming any initial issues. Plus he may need a few restarts to master skills to get contact. He should try, near the end of a restart, to feel out the priest's reaction to him time travelling.

  Getting Silverlake's aid. The priest can burn selectively. With his aid he could capture an egg. Perhaps as a favor to him for saving him from undead. This would strengthen his soul magic protections and alchemy. 

  Mastering flee. He should make it a regular thing to get some sort of fleeing potion from Lukav. He often encounters fights where there are teleport wards, being able to transform into a bird at will would do wonders. 

  Getting a combat golem. His golem making and combat abilities would progress a lot faster if he raided a golem expert. Doing it from scratch is slow. 

  For the greater goals, I think getting powerful allies is key. The priest and the transfiguration expert would be excellent allies, learning how to convince them to help him would be great. Then they could help him defeat the mayor's necromancer.

  I always feel like Zorian is so laid back relative to his situation. There is magic that can permanently kill people even if they're in time loops, and doesn't the enemy *probably* know who he and his family is at this point?
  ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    Actually, Zorian has reliably spent multiple loops (or just the rest of the current loop) laying low whenever he thought someone was after him. For example, this chapter, the loops after the fight with Red Robe, and when he first investigated Zach. If the enemy knows who he and his family are, they would have acted by now.

    In addition, he is currently working his way through soul magic, the only known magic to help against perma-kill spells.

    I think he only sounds laid back, because he is spending months at a time practicing all of these valuable skills and it's hard to maintain suspense over such a long time period.

      It's also worth noting that although CONSTANT VIGILANCE is easy to say, it's probably profoundly hard to do. Staying in an aroused emotional state for long periods of time is hard, staying focused for long periods of time is also hard.
