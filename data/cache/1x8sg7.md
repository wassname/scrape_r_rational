## Has anyone been watching True Detective

### Post:

This show is not about rationality. But I thought the way they go about trying to catch the killer was flawlessly rational. I don't know much about crime investigation so I might be wrong. Even though one of them has a tendency to find pieces of evidence, jump to conclusions, and create a narrative that fits it, which is pointed out by the other detective, they don't always run with them without ever looking back, which is the case with Sherlock.

P.S. Rust Cohle's pessimism on the other hand I find disturbing. He says at one point that people incapable of feeling guilt generally have a good time. He seems to say that we're generally happy only because we're physically incapable of appreciating the weight of our own suffering, and all the suffering in the world, and if were capable of that we'd have psychological problems, social aversion and substance abuse to deal with just like him.

  I started watching this show actually on recommendations from /r/Lovecraft because [*spoiler*](#s "because of its bleak world-view and how the protagonists are slowly stumbling onto some cult conspiracy bigger than they know").

  I've been watching it. I've said in the past that detective shows really tend to err on the side of rational, specifically because the point of a detective is to solve a puzzle (the crime). And not only does the show have the puzzle of the crime, it's got the secondary puzzle of how the characters got to where they currently are, which is one of my favorite uses of flashback, and done very well here. I also like the emotion it presents. There's this bleak worldview being shown, mingled with the bleakness of office politics.

  I haven't seen the show, but based on that description of pessimism I kinda want to, as I tend to agree.
