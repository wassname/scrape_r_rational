  So the Drow are all sworn to the 'Sovereign of Moonless Nights'. What happens when Ubua finally usurps Cat's Mantle?
  ```

  - u/JBarca1:
    ```
    Oh no. That's an excellent, and terrifying, read on the situation.

    Or it was intentional, in case Cat is out of commission again and the Diabolist needs to take charge?
    ```

    - u/werafdsaew:
      ```
      I'm thinking that's exactly why the full oaths is to the Sovereign and not to Cat.  Back when Akua was controlling Cat's body, she was subject to all the oaths that Cat swore to.  Conversely this means that as long as she controls the construct, she is Cat for purposes of oaths to "I".  Given that the Sovereign is the full mantle itself and not the construct, I'm thinking that it works differently for oaths to the Sovereign.
      ```

      - u/Just_some_guy16:
        ```
        That was my take too, given how each title is a representation of who they are, if someobe controlled her body or even took up the winter mantle they wouldnt have the title of moonless nights, it would be something else and nobody woukd be oathbound to them
        ```

  - u/ProfessorPhi:
    ```
    Given that Ubua had to submit to Cat after she'd recovered from the Pilgrim's attack and how easy it was for Cat to recover her mantle, I don't think this is necessarily possible.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      This is Akua we're talking about- she's definitely going to back stab Cat before this is all over.
      ```

  >The worst part, I thought, was that she was perfectly aware that the name of the sigil and sigil-holder had been Berelun. She was yanking my chain. I knew that. She knew I knew that. And I knew that she knew I knew that. Yet if I actually corrected her I would lose, and that was just unacceptable.

  I love the banter the Woe get up to
  ```

- u/Agnoman:
  ```
  So for all the talk that Akua is incredibly dangerous and someone that Cat needs to keep on a leash... Cat's doing a fairly terrible job of keeping Akua leashed.

  I grabbed most of the times the Diabolist was mentioned in the last 2 chapters, and the picture painted is one of Akua getting what is effectively almost complete trust. Just look at all of this:

  >That was one way to call the gathering throng of the desperate and the ambitious Akua was keeping an eye on.

  Akua's in charge of keeping an eye on the Drow.

  > I said. “Ivah will stay with you. We’re moving in on the Berelun camp after Akua’s people pick up the bodies for an auction.”

  Akua has "people" now.

  >I’d been inclined to just cut them loose, but Akua had talked me out of it. 

  I thought the policy was to avoid listening to Akua on general principle? 

  >Akua had been inclined to limit bidding rights to the dzulu so that a warrior class would be created quickly, but I’d been of a different opinion. 

  Akua gets a say in the policy of how Callow's soon to be main military force is formed.

  >We’d crafted the system with our time constraints in mind.

  >It’d been Diabolist’s idea.

  She also gets to form the basis of said military. Hmmmm.

  >shunting off the alienation into the others who drew on the stuff of my mantle – Diabolist, as always

  Yep. This won't have horrible consequences.

  ......
  >“One hundred and sixty years, subjected to the full breadth of lesser and greater oaths,” Akua said

  Leave the Diabolist to handle PR with the Drow. Somewhat innocuous, but there's concerns expressed later that Akua might gain too much influence amongst the Drow, so maybe try to limit her contact?

  >I glanced at the shade and nodded. She’d helped me with both the ritual and the wording of the oaths, putting her extensive experience with diabolism to slightly more acceptable use.

  ....Sure. let the Butcher of Liesse, master manipulator, and expert of fine print draft the oaths that will bind your main fighting force into place. No way that blows up on you.

  >Her continued genteel horror was always good for a laugh.

  I mean, (a) mistreating your pet monster is a good way to ensure said pet gets free and kills you, according to story logic; and (b) this shows a pretty nonchalant attitude towards one of the most dangerous threats to team Woe.

  >“Diabolist,” I evenly said. “Report.”

  >She sat at my side without need for an invitation.

  Again, what happened to not trusting her on general principle? Not too long ago she wouldn't have been given this much slack and now Akua is being invited into Cat's planning more than her actual loyal teammates.

  >I was disinclined to let Akua Sahelian head what would effectively be my equivalent of the Jacks down here, but I might not have another choice. 

  ..... Sure Cat. Give the Diabolist a death squad. This is a great idea that will have no reprecussions.

  >“I’ll see if I can spare an ispe, but that’s unlikely until Lotow,” 

  Literally two seconds ago you described how this was a bad idea and would let Akua "sink deeper hook into the rest of the Drow"!!!


  >Keeping Diabolist useful without giving her too much power was ever a delicate balancing act.

  Self awareness = 0.

  These two chapters alone she's arguably delegated more power and responsibility to Akua than any other single member of the World has been given.

  Akua sits in on policy discussions and makes suggestions that Cat implements, and this coming right after a set of interludes talking about how the Woe  don't get enough of a say in what they're doing 

  She gave the idea on how to bind and incredibly dangerous fighting force, and then was given permission to help implement said bindings.

  She gets given tasks to undertake on her own, and will apparently soon receive her own death squad and powered-up lieutenant, even while Cat considers how this will let her solidify her hold over Callow's main fighting force.
  ```

- u/ahd1903:
  ```
  ...Cat has *all* the Winter, doesn't she. She can put slivers into every one of an army and hand off titles to an entire court, and it's not going to make a noticeable difference to her personal power. 

  Or she's not doing the math again.
  ```

  - u/fortycakes:
    ```
    I don't think it necessarily works as zero-sum. Putting shards of ice inside people that will freeze them to death if they disobey you seems like it "resonates" enough with Winter that it'll be easier to do that the amount of power it "should" use.
    ```

  - u/melmonella:
    ```
    Increases her personal power if anything, since she can use more powerful stuff without going all monologuing by shifting alienation.
    ```

- u/AurelianoTampa:
  ```
  The way Cat is seemingly so oblivious to Ubua manipulating all of this, and the way she's basically calling the shots AND convincing Cat into things she disapproves of, makes me wonder if shunting Winter off to Diabolist is having some unintentional and unconscious effects. As Ubua gets more Wintery, perhaps she's able to more easily influence Cat? She's becoming more of the true Sovereign of Winter than Cat is.

  Either way, I think we can all agree that the oaths were a good idea in theory and a terrible idea in practice, simply because she's letting Ubua run the show.

  Also, I think we can all agree that Archer is hilarious.

  shoddy oaths

  >under this name and any name you will ever bear I bind you by these oaths

  If changing the name can affect things, why not include "and have ever bore" for completeness?

  >“You will never slay nor harm nor hinder any in my service, or dwelling within Callow, save in your own defence or the pursuit of my laws,”

  Here she uses "me" to refer to herself but everywhere else it's Sovereign of... (SOTMN). Seems like if you are going to make a set of secure oaths that will last for a century, you should make it more reliable in this regard. For example, you could split the oath into several parts. 

  First, specify that Oathtaker in the text of the oath uniquely refers to Cat with two dozen identifiers so the whole set couldn't be stolen from her by someone taking her mantle, or her changing title or name or current profession, or what not. If done properly, it should make cat the "holder" of the contract no matter what kind of shenanigans happen. An example could be something like this:

  >Oathtaker refers to me, Catherine Foundling, ruler of Callow at the time this contract is signed, current holder of the SOTMN title, person currently in front of the Oathgiver, previously human female, with a penchant for not checking what the hell I am doing with very powerful magic

  This isn't a reliable descriptor here as I am not going to spend half an hour ironing out all the details, but the point would be to specify Cat uniquely in several different ways so that if you subvert just one of those ways you still wouldn't count as the contract holder. For example, if Ubua stole SOTMN title, she still wouldn't have been the ruler of Callow at the time of contract being signed, and would either be left with inactive oaths or would need to resort to time travel.

  Second, specify who is taking the oath, with a similar set of two dozen identifiers. As a hypothetical example, what happens if it's not Sekoran there in front of her, but some other drow pretending to be Sekoran? Would it even be bound *at all* in the current set of oaths, given that their name is *not* Sekoran?

  Third, specify what the oaths are (don't kill civvies, obey liesse accords, etc). Doesn't really matter what those oaths are, as long as they aren't shoddy.

  Fourth, specify how, if at all, this set of oaths can be changed. It sure seems useful to have an ability to impose conditional oaths on your soldiers when it is necessary without the whole ritual with the cup and the knife. It also seems sensible that you might want to pull back an oath which is good in general for a very specific circumstance. For example:

  >“You will never slay nor harm nor hinder any in my service, or dwelling within Callow, save in your own defence or the pursuit of my laws,”

  Suppose that Masego (in Cat's service) goes suddenly insane from demon corruption, and starts running around towns wrecking various havoc. Switching chickens for turkeys, beating up old ladies, dropping cats into pots of milk, all sorts of stuff. You'd like to be able to say "go find whomever is doing this, break their legs and bring them here so we can ask what is up with that". We'll also specify that for whatever reason Cat can't pass a law saying "that is illegal", perhaps because each time it's a new thing, and can't fire whomever is causing havoc, perhaps because they don't know who is.

  In this highly unusual circumstance it'd make sense to temporarily peel off a very good general oath in regards to this insane individual. Current set of oaths doesn't allow for it. Having a clause for how that can be done seems sensible. 

  However, some oaths (e.g. don't try to usurp my title) could be considered too dangerous to be allowed to be changed at all, lest a Hero exploit that, so you could specify which parts of the oathtaking could be changed and which couldn't. Similarily, you could add clauses for how Cat could temporarily cede control over the general drow management to Ubua, in a circumstance like in the Battle of the Camps where Cat was out of order for a couple days, and how much that control would be ceded.

    Those are actually good points, the second in particular was something I missed when going over the chapter. Amended the text accordingly.

    The rest of what you argue is a bit of stretch. First off, you're assuming that the oaths binding drow to the SOMN instead of Catherine in particular is a bug instead of a feature. It isn't. Second, you're assuming that a precaution as basic as an identity check wouldn't be taken before people are allowed to bid. Third, your entire argument about rules being amended in the future is essentially irrelevant since they're bound to take her orders regardless, something already ensured by oath. Fourth, your hypothetical with Masego is absurd since several things you describe - punching old ladies, messing with private property - would be illegal, and so covered by the last part of the same oath you quoted. I'll also point out that for it to even slightly hold up you had to nix the obvious solution (use of her authority to make things illegal) and assume she'd be enough of an idiot to not use her legal rights to imprison a threat to the kingdom. It's fine if you want to poke holes in the oaths, frankly I'm not a legal scholar of any sort so I could use the help, but at this point you're kind of making your own flaws so you can point them out.

      >First off, you're assuming that the oaths binding drow to the SOMN instead of Catherine in particular is a bug instead of a feature. It isn't.

      To what, let Ubua use them when Cat is out? Or to later make SOMN a hereditary title that Cat could give to someone else? Those are about the only things I could think of here. Leaving Ubua a clear path to using the drow really seems like a bug to me, but maybe I am missing some amazing exploit that'd make it all worth it. I suppose we'll find out eventually, so no reason for you to spoiler your own story.

      >Second, you're assuming that a precaution as basic as an identity check wouldn't be taken before people are allowed to bid.

      Bah. You make such checks at every point you can, assuming it costs you nothing, like here. No reason to leave holes for enemies to exploit.

      >Third, your entire argument about rules being amended in the future is essentially irrelevant since they're bound to take her orders regardless, something already ensured by oath.

      And if she orders them to do something contrary to one of the oaths they just gave? Like, burn down a house in Callow, or some such. I am assuming that "pursuit of its laws" refers to actually legaly passed laws, and not just whatever whim Cat has at the moment, so presumably that'd go contrary to the oath? Sure seems like having a way to lift an oath would be nice. Long-term orders probably work as a substitute for additions to the original oath, though I feel like "order" is lower priority than an "oath".

      >Fourth, your hypothetical with Masego is absurd since several things you describe - punching old ladies, messing with private property - would be illegal, and so covered by the last part of the same oath you quoted.

      Eh, that is fair. The idea I was getting at with the hypothetical was that someone could feasibly be doing something you don't want them doing which is nonetheless legal. How about a better hypothetical?

      Say there is a Hero with mindrape-like powers a-la Speaking. You know he planted suggestions in the mind of one of your subjects in some location, but you do not know who the plant is. Plant himself is honestly unaware of being a double agent, because suggestions are subtle and aren't activated yet, so they can't even be said to be comitting treason. Suggestion is to do something perfectly legal like (e.g. light a fireplace at home at 19 hours, drink a cup of water at 8 am, eat a chicken for dinner, whatever), so even when it activates they would not be violating any laws. However, this legal action would be helping the hero in some way, perhaps by letting them activate a ritual. Now, what you *want* is to leave an agent on the scene with an order like "look around, find out who the plant is, and then prevent them from doing whatever it is they were supposed to be doing" (we can postulate that suggestion is detectable once it activates, their eyes light up or something). However, the plant is a citizen, they won't be violating any laws, and you can't even say "lighting fireplaces at 19 o clock is illegal for the next week" because you don't know any details about what it is they have to do. So, how do you give an order here?

        Callow's not a democracy, as the ruling queen Catherine can pass a royal decree and pretty much remedy that instantly. And the trade of Night-for-oaths would be much less attractive if additional oaths could be added at any time - that would, rightly, be seen as extremely easy to exploit. It's one thing to make those oaths if they're a known quantity, another if Catherine can add another at a whim. What would prevent her from just enslaving them if she felt like it? Orders for a limited timespan are much more agreeable, and for the long-term issues she has her greater oaths.

        As for your last paragraph, why would she use the drow specifically in that situation? It's not like she wouldn't have other options. The oath-takers don't have to be the perfect tool for every context, just the ones she wants to use them in. Besides, even in your theoretical the order could simply be 'subdue the hero-touched plant when you see the sign'. Which assuming the hero meant to do Callow harm by using the citizen as a pawn, wouldn't break the oath as they'd be breaking the laws by cooperating, however unwillingly, with a plot against Callow.

        ```

- u/ProfessorPhi:
  ```
  We've never actually seen anyone try to break an oath with a Fae before. And these drow are making oaths with cat's blood involved, I.e. winter. These oath breakers appear akin to the Peter Pettigrew style ones where the power they've borrowed turns on them when they break their oath to the source of the power.

  In the stories, it seems like breaking an oath with a Fae doesn't necessarily have instant backlash and this makes sense when there are no slivers of power involved in every oath (say larat and cat's oath or even Ivah and Cat's first oath). Given the similarities between our stories and the guideverse, breaking an oath with a fairy usually gives them power over you, in the case of the drow, the slivers of power instantly kill their hosts.

  I state this because I think the Pilgrim made his deal with the queen in callow and while this is not as serious as the greater oaths made with Winter, him absconding still falls on the spectrum of reneging on his deal. Which means Cat will not have absolute power over him, but the Pilgrim will be seriously nerfed in his next encounter with Cat.

  Also, it seems odd that they can make oaths they don't understand. Are the accords and the meaning of the oaths explained properly to the drow? It reminds me of software TOS which might as well be in Crepescular for all I know. Given the nature of oaths, they can only be what the parties knowingly consent to. If anything, akua might have interfered with the oaths at the translation stage and the drow think they are making a different bargain
