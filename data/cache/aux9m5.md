  ```
  If I saw this cover I'd assume that this was an erotic novel about wax play.
  ```

  - u/erwgv3g34:
    ```
    _A thrillingly erotic tale of... self-insert litRPG portal fantasy?_
    ```

    - u/Kuratius:
      ```
      So you're telling me Power wank *isn't* erotic?
      ```

      ```
      You say it like that isn't a thing that  exists.
      Are you new on the internet? :b

    It reminds me of the Twilight cover.

    ```
    Profoundly unsettling.
    ```

  - u/Makin-:
    ```
    Wow, this is garbage.
    ```

  Well, it's not terrible, but it definitely doesn't really capture anything close to an accurate mood for the story.

  Also, WtC is a multiple book work, one cover wouldn't cut it.

  Personally, I would expand on your idea, and make each cover a shot of a table with a game laid out on it, with a small but supernaturally bright candle illuminating the scene into sharp focus.

  Each table would be set in a place from that book, like the first could show the abandoned gas station in the background.

  One of the covers could totally be a table with a game of arches in progress.

  Too much space above and below the text, not enough to the sides.  I like how the candle is balanced against the smoke on the page, but I think it would be more striking if the candle were colored.    [Like this.](https://i.imgur.com/kUiqOeO.jpg)

  ```
  It looks very neat, but I don't think I would be enticed to read based on this cover.

  What would make me more likely to read would be something like a picture of Amaryllis in the big battle against her family*.
  ```

  - u/abcd_z:
    ```
    That would be one hell of a chapter, since Quatach-Ichl is from Mother of Learning.
    ```

    - u/Namelis1:
      ```
      I'd read that, QI is awesome.
      ```

      - u/Hust91:
        ```
        Crossover time!
        ```

        - u/Kuratius:
          ```
          Well, if we ever get a Lich in WtC, we already have a nickname.
          ```

    - u/Hust91:
      ```
      Derp, I get the awesome confused. 

      Picture of Amaryllis in the big battle against her family?
      ```

  - u/erwgv3g34:
    ```
    >QI in battle against the group.

    QI?
    ```

    - u/abcd_z:
      ```
      He's referring to the incredibly powerful lich from Mother of Learning named Quatach-Ichl.  WtC and MoL are both highly-voted on this subreddit, so I can see where the confusion came from.
      ```

      - u/Hust91:
        ```
        Thank you.

        Oups.
        ```

    - u/Hust91:
      ```
      I confused the two awesomest stories on my mind.
      ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  Neat.
  ```

- u/generalamitt:
  ```
  Why is it called WTC?
  ```

    "Worth the candle" is an expression that means something (especially a game) is worth the time/effort/trouble. It comes from the old days when you needed to burn a candle to do anything at night, which was much more expensive than turning on a light is nowadays, so an activity had be worthwhile in order for it to be worth the candle.

    In the context of the webnovel, the phrase gets a pretty significant title drop in [chapter 36](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/27497037), during Juniper's prayer.

      A candle is again important in the section of the story at the Aethenium of Speculation and Scrutiny.
      ```

- u/sparr:
  ```
  The title of the book is about keeping a candle lit to read/play. A candle that has just been put out is the opposite of that.
  ```

    ```
    The [official art](https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/banner_29.png) uses a snuffed out candle as well.

  Made from [this image](https://dreamwalkeramrita.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/a-snuffed-out-candle.jpg) I found after googling "snuffed out candle".
