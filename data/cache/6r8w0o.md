## [Biweekly Challenge] Eschaton

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6okl44/biweekly_challenge_moores_law/), the prompt was "Moore's Law". Our winner is /u/Laborbuch, with their story, ["The Linear and the Quadratic"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6okl44/biweekly_challenge_moores_law/dkqz3iq/). Congratulations to /u/Laborbuch, enjoy your flair and reddit gold!

##### This Time

This time, the challenge will be **Eschaton**. Basically, write a story about the ultimate fate of the world, whether that's its utopic, dystopic, weirdtopic, or apocalyptic. (Usually there is some divine element to an eschaton, but it's often used in other contexts, and the religious association can be freely dropped for the sake of this prompt.) 

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, August 16th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Next time, the challenge is **Metafiction**. Write a story which in some sense acknowledges that it is a story. Characters realize that they're in a story, or simply accept that as fact. There's *some* overlap with genre savvy, though genre savvy characters don't typically realize that they're in a work of fiction, they've just seen enough fiction to not fall for the usual traps. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 8/16.** Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat will be posted later tonight.
