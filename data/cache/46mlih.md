  As always with Dinosaur Comics, don't forget the following after you've read the strip:

  [Mouseover Title Text](#s " apollo was like, damn, i keep getting owned on Earth.  i don't know why i keep hanging out on a planet that's full of people who just own me so hard like fifty times i day.  damn dude, i can't stop getting owned by mortals.  damn")

  [Contact Link Email Subject](#s " when cassandra said she was going to die of old age at 103, everyone was like, hahaha, what an idiot, that'll never happen!!  then she died and everyone was like, wow, her prediction came true just like EVERY SINGLE PREDICTION SHE'S MADE ON A DAILY BASIS FOR THE PAST 80 YEARS, wtf is wrong with us??  wow")

  [RSS Entry Title Text](#s " GANGSTER: i run an illegal gambling operation and i need a tough name for that / CHILD: bookie / GANGSTER: no, see, i'm a tough criminal who - / CHILD: BOOKIE")
  ```

  If y'all haven't read North's "The Midas Flesh", I highly recommend it. 

  The premise is, Midas is real, the entire Earth is gold (because its all touching his flesh), and aliens want to weaponize the flesh.

  Its pretty awesome, and fits this sub fairly well. The characters are all relatively intelligent and act in believable ways.

      Support your local comic book shop and buy it there! 

      It's a graphic novel, if I wasn't clear about that. It's awesome.

  But if she predicts that a killing will be successful then it will succeed, right? Because her predictions always turn out to be true. Her killer might not believe it will work but maybe he kills her by accident.

    She can see the future, so presumably she can do something about the future she sees. Other people won't believe anything she says about possible future events due to the curse, so she can leverage the power of the curse to change what would happen, invalidating that future she sees.

    This, of course, requires the assumption that the future she sees is mutable, rather than absolute. It would be a simpler solution to the conundrum, since the future she sees happening actually occuring despite information from the future would be by far more complex than the other possibility.

    It seriously hinges on the rules of her future sight, but I would say it's a possible outcome, since the curse was that nobody would believe her, not 'she couldn't change the future', and Apollo wouldn't have given her the power to see the future in the first place unless it would be a useful power to have.

  What's Frig got to do with any of this? Totally different pantheon.
