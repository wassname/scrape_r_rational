  This chapter was honestly one of the most nerve-wracking things for me to write. As mentioned in my [original self promo](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/k3grdd/introducing_salvos_a_litrpg_evolution_story/) post here in /r/rational, I was hoping to have strong undertones of Aspiring Rationalism for my fic.

  Now, my MC is pretty dense when it comes to Human culture. And she can get a bit reckless sometimes. Both things, I've used for comedy at various points in the story. But I tried to balance it with the inherent logic and capacity to reason that she was born with from the very start.

  Also, I hope my own personal logic in this chapter made sense. Salvos, here, is trying to point out how being *special* wasn't what really allowed her to survive in the Mortal Realm thus far (considering everyone is 'special in their own way'). But she exemplifies this through Lucerna who was higher leveled than her and had a faster leveling speed than her, and yet he died because he chose to forfeit his own life from the very beginning.

  Meanwhile, Salvos *may* have been lucky with how some people she's met wanted to help her, but she actually wants to survive. She actually wants to increase her chances of survival. Her chances to *actually* be special (in the sense of being stronger and higher leveled than others).

  Just because chance determines everything at the end of the day, doesn't mean you can't try to affect the course of events.

  I still think the survivorship bias influenced nonsense I hear from athletes is annoying. Man, if I ever hear another interview where an athlete says "I'll will win because I train harder", I will flip my shit. Literally your opponent trains as hard or even harder than you do ffs.

  Anyway, I'm curious to hear your guys' feedback over here in /r/rational about how I handled it. As I said, it's all undertone stuff. My story is supposed to be pretty light at the end of the day; it does have the comedy tag, after all. But I don't want it to just be something I don't put any effort into bettering.

      The question first is then what is talent? The concept in itself is too nebulous to define fully. 

      Talent can be their physical qualities that gives them an edge over others. For example, Sonny Liston in Boxing had abnormally long arms to give him better reach over his opponents. Shaq was abnormally tall which helped him with basketball. 

      But if talent is just purely the physical advantages you’re born with, why is Floyd Mayweather considered one of the best boxers of all time with glass hands and no special physical advantage over other boxers? Why is Michael Jordan, who is far shorter than Shaq and most other basketballers, considered the best ever?

      It can’t just be your physical qualities. There has to be something else to it. You have to combine both physical talent and mental talent. 

      Perhaps reaction time plays into it— other mental attributes like the ability to fully focus during tense situations and not be overwhelmed by your nerves. You can’t quantify this, of course. But you can ascertain from the fact that they aren’t the most physically gifted individuals, they therefore aren’t the most talented.  

      So the reason, IMO, why some athletes rise up to GOAT status like Floyd Mayweather, Lebron James, Roger Federer, Michael Phelps, etc is not just because of talent. It’s a combination of talent (as defined above), hard work, and chance.

      That’s pretty much the conclusion I made with this chapter— Salvos doesn't just want to rely on her talent. She will work hard and do whatever it takes to increase her chances of survival.
