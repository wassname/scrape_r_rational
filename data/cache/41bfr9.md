    I know it's not diplomatic but is that a polite way of saying he's an asshole? I can't read anything with unsympathetic characters as protagonists.

      Hmmm. Well I was using it to mean that his personal goals do not include making things better for everyone and he acts accordingly. You might find him an asshole, I'm not quite sure: it's a rather personal judgement. Callous, definitely.
      ```

        Wait, how doesn't he want to make things better for everyone? [He's currently working on making the smallfolk literate, keeping them happy and uplifting merchants to better positions. He actively tries to make their lives better as long as it doesn't get in the way of his plans.](/spoiler)

          I don't think you did that spoiler right. [](#s "As to the question, he's doing all that out of enlightened self-interest. The comments in-thread by Sir Rabby make it fairly clear that he doesn't actually give a rats arse about the commoners, it just so happens that the best way to get the most money and power is to invent mechanisation and a merchant class, which requires a certain amount of improvement to the lot of the commoners if one wants to avoid revolution.")

          [](#s "At the end of the day being a pointlessly cruel despot is simply counter-productive. Take a look at the limits of his mercy towards those who don't do what he says: he crushed that guild to dust for daring not to immediately bend to his will.")

            He has no qualms about being a *pointfully* cruel despot though. He has a dude tortured and everything.

              Yep, no doubt about it.

        Yeah, that sounds like something I'd hate. Thanks for the reply!

      Well honestly it takes a gigantic asshole to be unsympathetic if they are in the context of asoiaf. Being amoral is required if you want to make changes and not die much like self interest and leaving everything behind to enjoy riches is what most people would do if the have to choose between it and trying to make their way through King's Landing intrigue.

      Having read the story he's very pleased with himself and quite ruthless (he really enjoys having power and money unsurprisingly) but his main goals include making the smallfolks lives better and helping out his new family and friends...as well as making a ridiculous amount of money through industry.

        Also the reason why I haven't read R.R. Martin's books and probably never will. I don't like crapsack.

  I can recommend this one, I found it a while ago and I wondered why nobody had posted it. Understands its setting and doesn't pull shit that wouldn't actually work, like many SI fics do.

  This is the best GOT self insert I've read, though that is admittedly a small category.

    ```
    I think this is my first... I've seen crossovers with dresden files and naruto... but, no wait I guess Hiver's Multiverse SI visited GoT.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      > Hiver's Multiverse SI 

      I've seen this mentioned often, is it really that good? Is it like Sleeping with the Girls where in-universe concepts are explained to the reader so they don't have to watch/read everything they reference?
      ```

      - u/FuguofAnotherWorld:
        ```
        He's actually got two Multiverse SI, and gabbalis is talking about the one I consider to be the worse one (due to comparative lack of dragons).

        Hiver is an interesting fellow. Not a native english-speaker, the quality of his writing has increased greatly over the years, yet his early works are still readable despite all that purely on the strength of the rest of it. I would definitely call his writing enjoyable, with solidly applied munchkinry to fantastic settings and such. Logical thinker by and large.

        Personally I'd call the majority of his stuff good but not great, workmanlike would be the word I would use, I think. Also rather easy to binge on, and quite a lot *to* binge on seeing as he's been churning out updates daily on various stories for something like 4 years now. Not Quite Shodan (star trek) is probably his best work from my perspective, followed closely by the Multiverse SI with the dragons. I seem to recall I had to do some googling when he went out of the works I was familiar with.

          Oh, thanks a lot. I'll give it a try regardless, I'm hope I don't get too lost.

            No problem. kclcmdr keeps [a repository of links](https://forums.spacebattles.com/search/41939819/?q=Hiver&t=post&o=relevance&c[thread]=88160) that you'll probably find helpful. My preferred multiverse SI starts with "That First Step...". Have fun.

  Fuck you. Seriously. 
  It is 4:47 in the morning and I'm still reading. Fuck you.

  After all positive comments here I'm goign to give it a try.

  While we are on the topic: what are the best stories-praodies-whatever related to GoT you have read?
  ```

  - u/FuguofAnotherWorld:
    ```
    Well the only one I've not mentioned yet in this thread is A Song of Ice and Fires That Weren't All My fault (ASOIAF/Dresden Files). Which I think is extremely good, despite never having read Dresden Files.
    ```

    - u/Roxolan:
      ```
      I personally find this fic *much* better than A Song of Ice and Fires That Weren't All My Fault, as a data point.
