  Hey all, welcome back! Two things of note unrelated to this chapter: First, I finally got around to updating Chapter 1 to improve the characterizations of Red and Blue off the bat. Second, I finally completed and uploaded a digital copy of the full flowchart that Red used in Chapter 20 upon noticing that he was upset. I put it in an earlier post, and here it is again:

  All feedback on either is appreciated, as always!

  As for this chapter, I just want to quickly note that the grant application and endowment process for research is far more streamlined and rapid in the Pokemon world than ours. Red's experience, grueling as it is, is not at all representative of the full struggle researchers in our world go through.

  I'll get around to another major edit wave for the chapter sometime tomorrow. In the meantime, feel free to post any typos I missed in response here.

    I like the flowchart! Mind if I share it around?

  In a previous chapter, you mentioned that letting Blue win in his first match against Brock would have set a bad precedent storywise, that you felt it would reinforce a stereotype of him. Yet you also mention, and Blue laments, that the current Elite Four members were undefeated. I don't think this is something Blue himself would casually overlook. Why *doesn't* he manage to achieve what they did? What did they do that he didn't? What didn't they do that he did?

  As a rational fiction protagonist, he should perhaps want an answer to this before he comes back, and "use a stronger pokemon" shouldn't be the whole of his solution without some reflection, it would feel nearly as cheap to the story as being handed the victory in the first place. Now perhaps it can be part of it. Shiftry is Dark. Did Agatha win her gym trials with a strong lead of ghosts and poison? Did Bruno win with rocks and fighting? If so one might deduce that matching pokemon to your personal type affinity is important, and justify Shiftry.

  Or perhaps, the exceptional circumstances by which Blue's skill and friends for backup led him to own a massively overleveled pokemon ahead of the gym rating schedule (first badge, oh, and my guy's level 30 btw, pikachu, quick attack that rock to death) - in exactly the same way that the Elite Four have managed. Through personal risk and hardship, they get powerful pokemon ahead of schedule and so blow through the tiered ranking system that didn't plan for that.

  Or maybe I'm just full of it. What do you think?

    As /u/Alphanos said, Blue had delusions of grandeur: he's definitely above average in skill, but he was trying to beat the records of his idols, not just getting his badges faster than they did but also assuming he'd be undefeated. He lost because he simply didn't put in the time or training that he needed to make sure his pokemon were strong enough or well trained enough.

    As for "use a stronger pokemon," there's definitely more skill involved in that than in the games. They try to put a soft limit on how powerful your pokemon can get too early by making your pokemon occasionally not listen to your orders if they get too high a level: I believe the threshold before the first badge is level 30 pokemon and up stop listening to their trainer.

    But while a good idea and a cool concept to reflect the trainer's lack of experience making it hard to control more mature pokemon, it's poorly implemented. Level 25 is more than enough to beat the first badge, hell, level 20 is even overdoing it.  On top of that, the power difference is just so strong between levels that even if your pokemon stops obeying you all the time, as long as they get one attack off every few turns they'll still melt whatever's in front of them.

    So yes, Blue's idea (because he still wants to win quickly) is to put in the time and training not just with his other pokemon, but also to train his unruly shiftry for the raw power he needs.  Having such a strong pokemon is an invaluable asset, and taking the time to train it properly should be a high priority for any trainer that gets one.
    ```

      ```
      I believe the levelcap where pokemon start to disobey you only applies to traded pokemon, so that you can't receive a level 90 pokemon at the start of the game from a friend.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        I think you're right, which kind of makes sense. If you raised a pokemon from a young age it's probably more attached to you, though that kind of breaks down with the idea of just catching a really high level pokemon (usually gated in the game anyway, since you need certain badges to reach areas with high levels of pokemon).
        ```

        - u/iaido22:
          ```
          Nope, even your own pokemon disregard orders without the required badges.
          ```

          - u/NotAHeroYet:
            ```
            In more recent games, they will obey without the badges, though in some games they wouldn't. (note this only counts for your pokemon- not traded ones.)
            ```

  - u/Alphanos:
    ```
    > Yet you also mention, and Blue laments, that the current Elite Four members were undefeated. I don't think this is something Blue himself would casually overlook. Why *doesn't* he manage to achieve what they did? What did they do that he didn't? What didn't they do that he did?

    Blue had two competing goals: to win undefeated, and to issue and complete the required challenges in as short a time period as possible.  I believe it was mentioned that those who were able to complete the challenges undefeated took longer to do so.  It's only natural that it would take longer to be assured of success.  Blue impulsively tried to shave off time in his speedrun attempt, but he wasn't ready, so he ended up failing the undefeated goal by prioritizing the speed goal.

    Also, despite him being a main character of the story, there's no inherent guarantee that his talent and capabilities match all of the famous trainers he's comparing himself to.  Wanting something and working towards it aren't always enough.  Even among Olympic-level athletes, not everyone can be a world-record holder.

      And I suppose it's supported canonically, in that lance and agatha are pretty darn old themselves.

- u/Drexer:
  ```
  Also, on an unrelated note, I'm considering perhaps writing a short half-a-dozen-chapters fanfic in the same world you're presenting here, exploring a contrasting but similar perspective from the work you're doing here based on both the details of the universe you've explored so far and some suppositions/explorations I've mentally made of the same subject.

  Would that be ok with you?

    ```
    Absolutely, I look forward to seeing it!

    Haha. Reminds me of [this](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/e2/3a/75/e23a75e17a631d09b23eb5e69794e666.jpg).

      Your image is making me question why that book was so amazing. ~~definitely not just an excuse to re-read it!~~

        I've been waiting for the next book to be announced to do another reread, but I might do one earlier after I get my hands on Auri's novella sidestory. Such a great series deserves frequent rereads.

  >A month here


  That caught me off guard. I was still thinking of the story like the video game instead of a snapshot of someone's life.  I have been eagerly waiting to read about the rational and unscrupulous magikarp salesman.

  This was a good chapter and I would not mind reading more like it. Your character building is strong.
  ```

  - u/Nevereatcars:
    ```
    500 bucks for a magikarp when a single pokeball is worth that much cash? Why WOULDN'T you take the deal?

    That gyarados was my star.
    ```

    - u/liamash3:
      ```
      I'd imagine that Magikarp are not known to evolve into Gyarados by most people in-verse, perhaps, or that it takes a lot of time and training for a 'weak' Pokemon such as Magikarp to evolve when taken out of the game context.

      I mean, if you need to train and work with a 'mon who can only flop about until it evolves, it's unsurprising most pass it off as too much effort.

    I agree, it was all really informative, but at the same time it was like nothing really happened. Both red and leafs' parts felt like we were about to get into the story, then it just cuts away.

    Hey, thanks for the typo spot and the feedback. I actually thought of just showing what she writes, but had two problems with it: 1) It would mean a chapter with pretty much zero dialogue and all exposition, and 2) It would miss an opportunity to show Leaf and Laura's relationship develop "on screen" rather than as an informed trait.

    That said, I probably didn't get the balance of information and immersion right. I had the same problem with chapter 6 originally, and ended up rewriting it after publishing to make things more compelling. If I can think of a way to do that this time around while still respecting 1 and 2, I'll do so :)
