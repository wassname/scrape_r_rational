## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You/humanity has the ability to upload skills and memories into brains. (Like in the movie Matrix)

  (But not to make the brain faster. Or to mind control people directly. Or read unwilling minds, if willing they can still lie.)

  How would that impact society? What could be done with it?
  ```

  - u/Hust91:
    ```
    Evidently, you could make your population completely educated at a masters level in every subject at an extremely young age.

    Depending on the speed of upload (same rate as the Matrix?), unpleasantness and other limitations, but if memories can be uploaded why not upload entire lives of experience, especially the lives of extremely intelligent people?

    You'd on one hand gain a form of mind-copying-immortality for very intelligent people (or anyone who knows or pays someone to accept their memories), but all in all everyone could potentially have hundreds of lives of experience to draw from, and make choices with the benefit of the very best experts in any subject, much like how we today can watch youtube series by the very best educators on a particular subject whereas before we'd be limited to whoever taught it at our school.

    Hard to imagine how this would affect society, but I imagine whoever got the tech first would become an economic powerhouse of extremely valued hypercompetent citizens, though it's also possible some stagnation may happen as people are trained with the memories of older people that are set in their ways.

    A profession would likely open up where one would be manually educated in subjects so that they may sell their memories of the new lessons that humanity has learned (in addition to the memories of the people that made the new discoveries, including the step-by-step process and their own feelings on what happened).

    Altogether, I imagine it would be a *lot* harder to control these people against their will and in many ways you'd get a singularity effect that would leave society unrecognizable to anyone who was not brought up in it.

    There’s a lot hinging on the requirements; for instance is the hardware expensive or otherwise resource constrained, or can you grab a random baby off the street and stuff their brains full of kung fu. Is there a diminishing returns to the skills, or acclimatisation period? In *Matrix* Neo knew kung fu, but he still needed time to actualise the knowledge, so while the transfer was pretty much instantaneous, there was still an adaptation period to fully utilise the skill. Where do skills come from? As in, do I pour a dozen ‘X for Dummies’, ‘Advanced X for Dummies’, and so on books into a magical skill renderer, or do I need to grab a master in X and (perhaps destructively) extract the skill from their skull mush? Are skills completely replicable, are there a limited amount of copies/transfers per source, or does the upload of a skill use up the skill source? All these will impact the resulting society, but in drastically different ways.

    That being said, a couple scenarios:

    The vast majority of work force will switch to day labourers, if for any given position anyone can do the job. If anyone can have the skill to do anything, the skill of anyone doing anything will take a backseat to their willingness to work. 

    Alternatively, there may be synergy advantages that aren’t immediately apparent. If anyone can do anything, the teamwork cohesion may be a much bigger factor than anyone’s ability (or inability) to do a job. Expect any entrance test to be much more about the interviewees personality, and how well they will fit and comply to the expected position on a team or company. 

    **Skill =/= Talent**. The majority of work will be done by peons for minimum wage, since everyone is replaceable, but the real moneymaker will be those with certain talents. Anyone can manage people / program apps / bake cake decently well, but if you’re a natural born talent, you will be that much better at it. View it as a multiplier of some kind, normal people all have 1, but talented people will have 1.1 or 5 or something in the skillset they’re talented in. Depending on the skillset, this will reflect in their wage. A talented manager being 1.1 times as good as any other run-of-the-mill manager will make the more money, the more they can make use of their advantage. A similarly talented manager in a small company versus large company would safe the bigger one more money, and could therefore expect a that much higher wage, even though they’re not actually better than the similarly talented manager in the smaller company. 
    The more you can leverage your talent, the more you’ll be worth and above the peons.

    Kind of like cutie marks, except not.

    Interestingly enough this would incentivise talent search massively, especially early on in one’s life. People would change skills as quickly as often until they found something they would be better at than average, maybe merely marginally so. 

    On the other hand, if the **upload of skills is limited**, be that resources, capability, or time, spending the limiting factor to find one’s talent will be a sign of status. Particularly since I don’t expect people to only have one talent, but to be mostly on a spectrum for everything skillable. Imagine a rich person (that is, someone with a significant talent, or child/relative/protégée of such a person) idly jacking up skills to find a hobby and discarding things they have ‘only’ minor talents in, while a peon with a minor talent in cleaning or some such is cleaning up the neighbouring room. The latter could be the next Mozart, but never had the resources to try for the less numerous (but still well-paying) skill and just stuck with the first skill they had *some* talent in, regardless of the magnitude of the talent.

    Damn. The more I think on this, the more I want to write it.

    **Another scenario**: Assume harsh restriction on the skill. Either it takes a lot of money, or time (but still less than actual training), or the brain can deal with uploading skills only for very few times (reminded of *Rainbows End* here…). Past a certain point school may very well be a tasting ground for a big variety of skills, all to be trained to some small level, and then rigorously tested to ascertain if they have a talent for it, or simply enjoy it, and only then will the skill be uploaded. Instead of paying off student loans everyone will pay off skilling loans, and there will be quite a few people who are good at something, but don’t particularly enjoy it; false positive, for whom the skill selected was wrong, and they’ll be stuck with a skill they’re not good in and a big dept to pay off.

    Or **destructive scanning**: Master Miyagi is dead, but hey, at least you know kung fu, right? If the thusly acquired skill can be copied there’ll be a flourishing black market in skills less than legally acquired, but there’ll also be a big market for mastering useful skills and bequeathing the earnings. 

    Again, a whole lot of potential to explore here. The whole concept of skill uploads is a bit like Asimov’s Robot Laws; ostensibly simple, yet surprisingly facetted.

    Uploading memories is extremely abusable. Sure it doesn't let you mind control someone directly, but the only limit to your mind control is your creativity (and your ability to create the appropriate memory uploads). For example, I could upload the following memories to some victim X:

     * Memories of another person's life, in a world similar to our own but with better technology.
     * Memories of playing a virtual reality game where the virtual reality is indistinguishable from our reality, and the player gains memories of their character whenever they log in.
     * Memories of gaining the memories of the actual life of X.

    This could lead X to believe that he is in a virtual reality game, and that his real memories are simply the memories of his character. I can then manipulate his actions by changing the game objectives. For instance, I could make him think that this world is a virtual reality Grand Theft Auto game, and thus prompt him to go on missions like killing people I choose and robbing banks.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Oh, sorry. I didn't mean you would think they are your memories. It is more like reading a book/watching a movie/playing a game of someone else's memory. Most know those aren't their own memories. 

      But nice idea anyway. Lot's of potential. (Still not many would behave like in GTA, if they could feel the collisions and the pain or exhaustion.;-) ) But a memory of a person threatening your loved ones could do the trick. Or getting orders to spy on someone and then getting the orders to kill them.
      ```

      - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
        ```
        Ah. Okay, that makes it much safer. I would still be worried about issues like trying to upload a language skill module only to find you were tricked and the module actually contains propaganda or disgusting images that make you want to bleach your brain, but at this point the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. 

        ...at least until someone finds a way to get around the mind control restrictions.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          Well, propaganda still works. And it is some restricted form of mind control. It is really scarry in real life, cause it has an effect on you, even if you know it is propaganda.
          ```

  - u/appropriate-username:

    Remember me has a take on it.

    I think the more likely scenario than what dontnod (dev of above game) came up with is that everyone would torrent around/upvote memories until the biggest, best orgasm anyone's ever head floats up to the top and then most people would just wirehead all day long and society would collapse. That doesn't make for a very fun game though. 

    Alternatively, this would become a new type of drug and all the other memory experiences would become a new form of media where companies compete to provide the most thrilling memories while staying below the legal limit of an orgasm.

    Alternatively, someone comes up with a latent virus and sends it around along with a memory of an orgasm. Then you either have the book snow crash or collapse of society.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      It would be more like a memory of an orgasm. You would just know how it felt to the original. So there would be less risk of addiction.

      I like the idea of it anyhow. It would be much easier to understand drugs and how they feel. And how other people feel in their bodies. I would like to know how it feels to smoke a cigarette or use heroin and what is harder to come clean. But I don't like to smoke for months to find out. ;-)

      I read the plot of remember me, and it doesn't sound like it. (And I probably spoiled the movie for me.)

    it pretty much depends on the willingness of the government to let a company commercialize the technology, of if the government tries to regulate it.

    In the first case, and if I was the company accomplished this feat, I would probably start by collecting complementary "samples" from highly skilled people in order to build a "complete skill package". Once an "up-to-date" package is constituted, I would maintain different versions for increasing prices. And perhaps develop a "premium membership" where each subscriber can get updated regularly.

    Of course I would try to maintain my monopoly for a time, and I would *obviously* not include this technology in the package I sell, but with that much super-intelligent people around, the secret would not be long hidden.

    But at that point, I would have ensured an exclusive agreement with the greatest minds of the time in order to offer the best "data package" any company can offer.

    I am not sure about the second case. Uploading a full-package to everyone would definitely upset the balance of power, and even then we would probably have to wait for each citizen to reach majority for their personalities to "set in", or we would basically have a single mind in billions of bodies.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Nice

      I don't think (most) government could stop the technology. Of course they will regulate it (safety protocols, and forbidden/restricted skills like howtokill-martial arts or lockpicking) 

      But think of it more like Gutenbergs mechanicle printing. Your company would just be the only one selling books.

      And democratic government shouldn't force inprint people. But still offer it as education, without propaganda/biases if possible. The single mind in billions is something I want to avoid, so no direct mind control. 

      I think "complete skill packages" like you are describing, wouldn't be efficient. More data/skills means more needs to be trained at once. (Remember in Matrix Neo still has to train.)
      But schools were you could buy into courses that goes through one skill at a time would be nice. I like your idea of a company that sells the 'best' skills. With the right marketing they could have a good markup. And people could buy skills and say they are from Company. Like a iPhone or more like a prestige college.

      It would be very hard to inforce copyright. Since people could just copy their Company skills and resell them Government regulation would be needed for that.

  You gain the ability to use a save state in real life. At any point you can choose to save or load, where loading reverts reality to the last point you saved while maintaining your current memories and consciousness. The ability also has a fail-safe of automatically loading when your brain activity stops (i.e. you died) but you can choose to disable this at any point to avoid being perpetually trapped in your final moments. It's worth noting that you have no way of moving your save point _backwards_ in time from it's current position and that butterfly effects from your actions and quantum randomness will cause events to unfold increasingly differently with time. What would you do with this ability?
  ```

  - u/munkeegutz:
    ```
    Sure reminds me of *that timeline splitter from worm* in a few ways -- you're most vulnerable when you make a save state.  This imposes a few ground rules, such as

    * Don't get drunk/high in fear of accidentally setting your point
    * Don't move your point forwards unless you've reached the state you're assigning yourself to a few times, and are confident that it's safe
    * In timelines for which you intend to advance your save point, avoid alerting anyone about the nature of your ability until after your save.

    In general, if you play your cards right, you can become president / immortal / damm near anything.  Just set a save point when you turn 5 years old or so, and live a hundred lives.  It would be worth it to investigate if there are others with this (or any) supernatural powers, and if so, understand their powers well.  I would be most concerned about people who can disable or steal your power, as well as those who could force you to move your save point.  Otherwise, in most cases, a problem can be disappeared by a simple rollback of time (this is inconvenient if this runthrough is 50 years in the making)

    Save scum the stock market, halt natural disasters, fund promising research, give advance knowledge to researchers to accelerate their work.  I could convince my parents that I'm competent at 5, if I had todays mind!  Depending on how the mind interacts with the younger body, it might be worth going farther back even.  If you do everything right, you'll have functionally unlimited money.  Use this money to hire huge teams of individuals to compose the absolute optimal encoding of the information you want to send back to your "past" self.  Hire specalist tutors whose lifes work is teaching you this message.  Each time, when you arrive back in your 5yo body, write down as much of that information as you can remember.

    Just a little bit of bootstrapping, and you can accumulate a tremendous amount money using stock market and lottery future information.  Now we're cooking with gas.

    Each time you pass through life, doing this optimal encoding, provided that you are satisfied with this pass, you write down all of that information and advance your save point by a day or two (however long it takes for you to write everything down), afterwards going on to live the next life.  Essentially, you have become a future information pump, devoting an entire lifetime into sending back a few hundred pages worth of written content.  

    Concerns would mostly revolve around other people with powers, and shadowy governmental agencies getting on your case.  For this reason, it might be important to try and hide the nature of your powers.  Part of this would surely involve doing as many iterations as possible without alerting your 5yo parents that you have this power, or without them alerting the rest of the world that you do.  That would be somewhat tricky, but winning the lottery for them or making impossible stock predictions, might help.

    I'd use this to immediately get incredibly rich in the stock market. Once I had a massive organization built I would loop back to that point while working on improving my memorization abilities while also becoming a polymath with knowledge of nearly every field.         
    Eventually I would likely reach some sort of limit because going further would result in me becoming too out of it due to age to be of much use learning new things (or I would go back in time because AI tech is becoming uncomfortably far along). Thus I would begin imparting my knowledge to researchers under my employment and then learn all of the new breakthroughs they made building upon future technology basically using my time loop to develop centuries worth of tech.

    Now sooner or later I would use my knowledge to begin having extremely promising researchers (because while I'm clever I'm not the kind of genius likely to ever make massive breakthroughs) taught all my future knowledge of AI and work very slowly and deliberately on AI safety and AGI.

    Eventually I succeed in making FAI with my values. Then I'll live an absurdly long time until I've exhausted all the novelty possible at human level intelligence, at which point I'll slightly increase my intelligence to make everything interesting again. Rinse and repeat and after billions of years I'll be an absurdly large superintelligence. At that point I can have all of civilization merged into me in a sort of hivemind (just connected enough to count as extensions of me for the purposes of this power) once the heat death of the universe starts being an issue, then I'll go back to my save point and very rapidly kick off the singularity again.              
    At that point me and the rest of post-human civilization inside my head would exist in an absurdly long time loop potentially literally forever.

    1. Worry about my power basically killing everyone and replacing them with younger versions of themselves. 

    2. Ultimately fall to temptation and use the power anyway.

    3. ~~Kill myself from guilt.~~ Realize that in a world with something as absurd as time travel, there are almost certainly also afterlives, and thus there is no escape.

    4. Attempt to reduce guilt by rationalizing that other people, given this power, would also abuse the hell out of it. 

    5. Desperately hope that this is some form of time travel that doesn't kill the old timeline, such as having infinitely many parallel worlds.

    6. Worry that I'm now singlehandedly responsible for creating an entirely new timeline, and thus all the sentient beings within it, every time I load a save state. 

    7. ~~Wish that I had never been granted such a power.~~ Realize that such a wish would effectively cause more time travel to occur and thus result in more sentient beings created and/or destroyed.

    8. Give up on not hurting anyone and just keep abusing the power, desperately hoping to pull a karma Houdini and never be punished.

      I imagine trying to read a story with so much screentime dedicated to morality drama would get annoying rather quickly.

      >Realize that in a world with something as absurd as time travel, there are almost certainly also afterlives, and thus there is no escape.

      I think while it *would* increase the likelyhood of the character’s consciousness being preserved after its death, it wouldn’t increase it *that* high.

      > Conclude that I'm inside some kind of simulation or hypothetical. Worry about the real me now that this simulation or hypothetical of me has revealed myself as an evil person that is willing to time travel even if it kills everyone.

      That’s a nice one. I’ve been thinking about a similar premise for a HP fanfic for a while.

      > Worry about my power basically killing everyone and replacing them with younger versions of themselves. 

      Unless there are some higher-tier powers enforcing their worldview on mortal sophonts, what constitutes a murder (and a bad kind of murder that needs to be avoided) would depend on a character’s personal morality system. So no objective definitions of good, evil, death, murder, etc (unless there was a way to determine what the “administrators” of the experiment are expecting of the “test subjects”).

    Realistically you probably just use this power to become absurdly rich and famous for having superpowers and use your wealth to invest heavily into anti-aging tech (and try to stay really healthy). 

    If you live long enough to see a technological singularity then your ability could be used to generate arbitrary amounts of energy (by having your body changed into a galaxy spanning megastructure) thus allowing post-human civilization to not only avoid the heat death of the universe but continue expanding indefinitely.

    Quick question: Negate gravity means Earth’s gravity doesn’t affect me? Because there’s a bit of leeway, like, I’m now actively repelled by Earth, or actively repelled by everything in the solar system, or actively repelled by everything in the universe, and there a lot of scenarios where I go *splat*.

    So assuming local gravity is annulled, not inverted, meaning I can make double my mass weightless. Hm… 

    Okay, another question, does that mean I have to be part of the gravity annulment, or can I annul a crate double my mass and move that while merrily walking on the ground? If this is the case, follow up: what’s the distance limitation? Touch?

    Most ethical thing to do would probably be to become an infinite energy source, e.g. [SMBC.](https://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2305) I'd probably do that for a few years for appropriate compensation and then retire.

    - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:

      How would you become an infinite energy source though? Nullifying the gravity of two times your body mass doesn't immediately strike me as a method of generating large amounts of energy. The energy would be "free", but the production would be too low to make a significant impact on your life or the world. 

      Unless... you fatten yourself up to a ridiculous amount. Heck more than that, grow body parts in vitro and then surgically insert them into yourself ad infinitum, rapidly increasing your own body mass far beyond human limits and thus increasing the amount of mass you can nullify gravity on.
