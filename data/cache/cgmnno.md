## [MK] Munchkining super strength?

### Post:

Probably the most common superpower in fiction is super strength (along with super durability, stamina, reflexes, etc.) but it's also one of the most boring. Other than sticking a superhuman in a hamster cage to generate perpetual power, how can super strength be used rationally?

  The funniest thing about super strength to me is that, with invulnerability, you actually shouldn't bother punching things if you want to cause more damage... you should poke them.  

  If you focus more of the energy of your hit into a much smaller area, like a poke, you would cause far more damage. The reason average people don't do it is because their fingers would break or bend.

    Imagine Superman facing down General Zod so that the human race doesn't become enslaved.

    The dramatic music starts playing, the lights dim, Supes and Zod square up and raise their arms. Then they each extend their index finger.

    The next scene is entirely in slow-mo, to illustrate their superspeed as they feint, parry, riposte, and try to secure a lethal poke. Eyes are blazing red as they circle around, testing each other's footwork and even taking to the skies as fingers come from all directions.

    Finally, a brief moment of distraction has Supes' finger pressed against Zod's throat. A small moment of hesitation, then Superman steels himself, and yells (in superspeed, there's no way he can make the speech in normal time):

    > This hand of mine glows with an awesome power!

    > Its burning grip tells me to defeat you!

    > TAKE THIS!

    > MY LOVE, MY ANGER, AND ALL OF MY SORROW!

    > SHINING FINGER!

    Zod explodes. The end.

      I've always wondered at shonen anime fights where they monologue at each other - given they're clearly capable of perception of ~bullet time level punches/kicks/etc, wouldn't ordinary speech feel glacial in comparison?

      Or is it merely translating super-speed chipmunk speech into viewers' speeds lol?

        I have a theory that this is just a concession of the medium. In Naruto the ninjas yell "grand fireball" while literally in the middle of breathing fire, for instance. That has to be viewer convenience style translation too.

        DBZ's first villain, Raditz, can move faster than light.  Over the course of the show we see that he's pathetic compared to the fighters that come next, almost all of whom are much  faster and stronger. Yet the protagonists still scream and talk during the battles.  Forget chipmunk voice, this means DBZ characters are talking faster than light.

    Maximizing surface area would be good for some applications, particularly where even a dispersed force will still hit very hard.

      I would switch between poking and slapping then.

  The thing about super strength is that it's a power that machines already have - strong engines and motors can lift and move things even elephants wouldn't be able to. A person with super strength might still have an advantage  in applying that strength with precision, though; a human hand is extremely dexterous when compared to a backhoe or a crane. Ironically, one of the best things to do with super strength in the modern world might be to become an artist and work with materials and at scales a normal person couldn't.

    There's a manufacturing angle in there. Robots have to be programmed, which takes time and money.  Making just one of something with a robot is ridiculously expensive compared to making the same thing with human limbs and custom fixturing, even if you don't count the cost of the robot.

    If an mc can replace a hoist or crane with her bare hands that's a huge advantage and a few of these can have huge impacts on their region's macroeconomics.  I'm just not sure it's an interesting enough focus for a story.

      You can't actually lift that much weight even with unlimited strength because you'll destroy the ground you are standing on when all of that weight settles on your feet, plus it would be impossible to actually maintain your balance long enough to center it over your head.  Same thing for pushing, hitting, throwing heavy things etc. Someone with super strength doesn't really have the mass or surface area to use their strength effectively even with the invulnerability caveat due to the limitations of friction, inertia, the strength of materials, etc. They're essentially limited by physics to only using their strength to a fairly low level. They'd have one hell of a firm handshake though. Honestly I think the artistic take is really the most actual practical use you'd get. I mean, there are certain things they could do well in manufacturing but unless you have an army of them it isn't worth the additional overhead and headaches a couple special cases will cause rather than just doing everything the same way in all of your plants.

  Another avenue for making super strength more interesting for a rational, creative protagonist is making certain that there are multiple forms of super strength with different mechanisms and limitations ala the Parahumans series. Like a forcefield that can take any hit once before breaking and reforming after a momentary delay, or having the ability to massively expand your muscles while regenerating in the process, or having a field of vastly slowed time permeating your entire body that you can somehow move normally within. There are a lot of ways to make strength more interesting.

    That force field one sounds dope.

      It lends to some interesting combat decisions, for sure.

      There's an important character in Worm and its sequel series that basically has the force field power, along with flight and an emotion aura. I recommend giving it a read.

  Become the first stage of a rocket, and leap rockets into orbit (just make sure you aim for a nice ocean landing, so you don't hit anything important on the way down).

  Rescue people from collapsed buildings, fires, mines, or any other scenario that they can't send a normal-durability person into.

  Give some muscle tissue to scientists to study and replicate for use as a material for a space elevator.

  Could someone give me a definition of "munchkining"? All I can find online refers to the act of throwing powdered jelly munchkins from Dunkin' Donuts at people while driving by them. Preferably when they're wearing formal clothes, apparently.

  Super strength is also one of the powers most likely (at least in the stories I've read) to have a quasi-biological explanation, with mechanisms that are relatively easy to see (cue generic scientist character going: 'Incredible! I've never seen anything like it! etc...)

  One way to munchkin your power would be to go to school, train up in the medical sciences, and then get to work studying yourself. Figuring out how your super strength works, and how you might use that understanding to give other people super strength, could be a worthy goal for a rational super strong protagonist. Especially in a classic comic book universe where every alien civilisation already seem to have a super power that every member of the species possesses.

  A very significant problem with exerting super strength is leverage and inertia.  For instance, you're limited in how fast you could run or jump by friction with the ground, and material strength of the surfaces and objects you interact with.    In some ways it bears similarities to a normal human in zero G, in that you primarily have your own mass, inertia, and leverage via grip to work with.

  For combat don't punch or kick, grapple.  Then you can hold on with one hand and kick or punch with another limb, or just use both hands and twist or tear.  Additionally, thowing small heavy dense objects like large ball bearings or dense stones may be useful.

  For fast movement, dig your fingers into the ground or other surface and throw yourself in the desired direction, or pick up dense heavy objects like stones and throw them in the opposite of your desired vector.

  To move heavy or dense things, employ cables, straps, and levers.  Think of yourself as a crane or a forklift.

  Depends what the goal is, if it's money and fame, you can just go pro athlete. Funnily enough this would technically be the one of the optimal choices for rational beings that care about reducing the suffering and making the world better.

  &#x200B;

  Just donate the money to worthy causes and use your fame and influence to make people care about big problems they wouldn't otherwise. Saving people from being mugged is kind of suboptimal and cute in a naive way..

  Tungsten ball bearings in a big mittful with a full-power throw delivered by someone with enhanced strength is probably at least as damaging as a shotgun blast, if not more. In a pinch just stomp the ground and throw small bits of rock. There's a reason bombs are deadly and shrapnel is a lot of it.

  If you're fighting a lot of not superhumanly though opponents, this scene from [Citadel] showing a fight between a guy with super strength and a guy who can create fully autonomous clones of himself connected by a Hive mind. It underlines the ridiculous amount of damage you can do with super strength, durable cables with weights on the end, and momentum:

  >... Achala stopped running when he reached the center of the room but he didn’t stop moving.

  > He gave a little flick of his wrists, then Achala was holding a pair of… jump ropes?  The Hectors outside were too far to see in detail and the ones inside had their vision obscured by their gas masks.  Each had a small handle with a thin cord attaching it to a weight about the size of a gumball.

  > Achala spun them, one in each hand, in circles that never quite intersected but covered all of the area around him.  The cords stretched out about fifteen feet.  Every Hector within that area died in seconds, cut limb from limb as the cord or the weight passed through their bodies without resistance.

  -

  Take something flat and wide, like a shovel or just plank of wood and depending on the strength you have and the size of the tool, you can create walls of wind. With enough strength you could create tornado- and hurricane-force winds.

  Similarly, water. With the right size of tool and enough strength, you could generate gigantic waves similar to tidal waves or the ones generated in tropical storms.

  Actually, because water doesn't compress very well, I wonder if possibly you can run on water just by taking heavy enough steps with super strength. Someone call a physicist!

  -

  Speaking of water, purse your lips super tight and leave the tiniest gap you possibly can, now blow water out of that in a jet and if you're strong enough and durable enough to widthstand it yourself, you'll create a waterjet like they use to cut through multiple-inch-thick pieces of metal.

  -

  Never enter a room with hostiles via the door. Go around to an adjacent room and walk/run/bust through the wall to enter from an area they aren't considering. Or the floor, floor's always good. No matter where you come from, works better when there aren't hostages.
