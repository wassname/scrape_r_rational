  I love how much the in story meta-analysis of the 'story' has become part of the story. 

  I started Practical around the beginning of book 4. Before I thought it was a story that did something excellent with the ideas of tropes and patterns and stories. The last few chapters have really elevated it for me. The call backs to previous books and the consequences of past actions creating ripples to this slowly rising, likely, penultimate crisis. It's really raised my opinion of the work as a whole. 

  It almost feels like a slight shift in genre, that works in the pattern that the story has been moving in. As Cat gains vaguer powers, the powers and forces in the story begin to rely more and more on the narrative surrounding the characters. It first began to become really apparent when the fae were introduced. When she got those formless but pattern following powers, the focus of the story turned more towards the idea of patterns in stories than it had before. Now that what she can do through Sve Noc is only barely explained even after all these chapters, the focus of the story has turned more and more meta. 

  Personally I'm loving every second of it. I feel it has also addressed power creep in an acceptable manner. Cat is much more powerful than she was before. But in such a different way that you can't compare it to her previous state.

    >penultimate crisis

    I hope this isn't the end.  Yeah loose ends are being tied up a bit here and there but the stakes are as low as they've ever been for Callow, unless the DK has made a whole lot of progress while the group is playing around in fairyland.

    A finale centered on characters that weren't part of the original conflict would be just disappointing, especially if Malicia doesn't feature in it at all.

      Not sure if you knew this, but penultimate means second last.

  Hah, I see what you did there

    ```
    I only now got the meaning of that phrase, too. If something isn't worth the candle, it's so irrelevant that it's not worth burning a perfectly good candle for.

      ```
      Candles were costly things back in the day before electric lighting, so staying up late to do or study something better be worth the price.

      I looked it up pretty quickly into reading that particular series, interestingly enough it does originate from the worth of playing a game, be it gambling or just for entertainment.

        My theory about the title of that story is that, in addition to its normal meaning, it refers specifically to a >!Candle of Invocation, about which Juniper delivered a twenty-minute monologue while under the effects of unicorn blood.!<

        Or maybe that's just a red herring.
        ```

        - u/Ardvarkeating101:
          ```
          For a second I thought you meant marshal juniper and I was like, what???

            I'd love to see her on Unicorn blood. Might get her thing for Aisha sorted out.

          Would the current gm allow >!CoI shenanigans!<? That seems like one that would find all kinds of complications because of being too easy.
