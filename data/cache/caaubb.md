## Discussion: for those who have read the Mistborn series, what do you think atium/lerasium alloys would do?

### Post:

I've released the first three chapters of a Mistborn fanfiction and would like to explore the alloyed versions of the God Metals, atium and lerasium.

Atium alloyed with gold gets the so-called eleventh metal, malatium. Gold lets a Misting or Mistborn see a version of their own past self, while malatium lets them see a version of another person's past self.

Since atium's unalloyed ability is to see the near future of anyone nearby and perfectly react to their actions, my tentative hypothesis is that its base function is to swap a metal's application from self to other or vice versa.

For example: pewter and atium would allow someone to somehow empower another with strength, stamina, healthing, the whole brute package, while steel and atium might change the point of reference for metals that can be Pushed from self to another person.

Thoughts? Especially for lerasium, I don't really have any good ideas for that.

### Comments:

  I'm pretty sure that Brandon Sanderson has said that an alloy of Lerasium would >!change someone into that kind of misting!<, just as >!Lerasium changes someone into a full mistborn!<. (Spoilers for the end of Well of Ascension)
  ```

    From what we know, that's only for people who aren't actually Mistborn/Mistings. Lerasium burns differently for people who aren't Mistborn and for those who aren't. 

    At it's base, Lerasium forges a connection between burner and Preservation. Mistborns burning it increase their power. And if the person using it knows what they're doing, they can rewrite their Spiritual DNA as they wish basically.

    Thank you, I forgot about that.

  It's been a while since I read them, but I'm not sure the alloys work that way.  You can't alloy iron with, say, copper or tin to get a new effect AFAIK. The alloys also appear to work in opposites, so steel/iron push/pull, copper/bronze conceal/reveal, etc.  Atium looks forward and malatium looks backwards.

  Are you aware of the 17th shard website? They might be have more in depth information for you.  Also /r/cosmere is a good place to ask questions. There might be Words of Brandon (WoBs) about the subject, I think the 17th shard also archives them, or maybe that's the coppermind website?

  Will you post your fanfic here when you're done? I'd be interested in reading it.

  I think it's probably best to disregard canon malatium in systematizing atium alloys. For Doylist reasons its effects had to be a much closer mirror of gold than the systematic Watsonian understanding would imply; The Final Empire's plot wouldn't work otherwise. So given that, rely mainly on "[Atium's] alloys grant various expanded mental and temporal effects when burned."

  I'm going to write my ideas for each in repl(y/ies) to this comment. (Each sentence in those ideas is meant to represent a distinct possibility for what it could do.)
  ```

  - u/VorpalAuroch:
    ```
    **Steel**: Push on metals

    **Atisteel**: 'Store' pushes on metals which will take effect later. Push on the future positions of metals before they arrive. Fine-grained control of pushes to, for example, puncture a steel plate by pushing only the center of it.

    **Iron**: Pull on metals

    **Atiron**: See Atisteel, but with pulling instead of pushing.

    **Pewter**: Enhance physical attributes. (Brute, endurance, speed)

    **Atipewt**: Precise intuitive sense for how far you can throw things, what you can lift, etc. Judge the Brute rating of anyone in sight at a glance. Shunt the ongoing physical enhancement of Pewter from attribute to attribute, ex. make yourself normal strength but able to sprint even faster than a Thug pewter-dragging for a few seconds, then give up the speed for pure Brute a few seconds later.

    **Tin**: Enhanced senses

    **Atin**: See around corners and hear through walls. Sense who can perceive you/who is paying attention to you. Extend atium's effects to cover a much longer range.
    ```

  - u/VorpalAuroch:
    ```
    **Zinc**: Enflames emotions.

    **Atzinc**: Finer-grained control of what is being enflamed, up to Inception-level if the user is skilled. See what emotions the targets are feeling while you manipulate them. Inflict *excessive* emotions, effectively wireheading the targets with joy/despair/etc.

    **Brass**: Dampens emotions.

    **Atibrass**: Finer-grained control over what is being dampened, up to creating taboo thoughts with enough user skill. See what emotions the targets are feeling while you manipulate them. Inflict severe depression, anhedonia/an-whatever-ia way beyond anything naturally occurring.
    ```

  - u/VorpalAuroch:
    ```
    **Copper**: Hide allomantic Pulses

    **Aticopper**: Hide all use of investiture (like being surrounded by aluminum). Limited notice-me-not field. Block use of allomancy.

    **Bronze**: Sense allomantic pulses.

    **Atibronze**: Sense any use of Investiture including inactive wells of power (which Bronze can't see). Sense souls. Sense use of investiture before it happens.

    **Aluminum**: Wipes personal allomantic reserves

    **Atilumin**: Renders user temporarily immune to allomancy. Reduces/removes personal allomantic abilities permanently.

    **Duralumin**: Burns through entirety of active personal metal reserve instantaneously.

    **Duratium**: Instantly makes the user a savant of whatever metals they are burning. Allows a duralumin flare to be partial/spread across some duration. Enhances non-allomantic use of investiture.

    **Chromium**: Wipes allomantic reserves of touched target.

    **Chromatium**: Permanently reduces/removes allomantic abilities of touched target. Protects touched target from allomancy temporarily.

    **Nicrosil**: Burns through entirety of active metal reserve of touched target instantaneously.

    **Nicratium**: Instantly makes touched target a savant of whatever metals they are burning. Allows a nicrosil flare to be partial/spread across some duration. Enhances non-allomantic use of investiture.
    ```

  - u/VorpalAuroch:
    ```
    **Gold**: Reveals your alternate past selves

    **Atigold**: Hold the perspective of all those alternate past selves in your head at once, a la [Haunter](https://thefifthdefiance.com/2015/11/05/haunter-11/) or [Stephen Leeds](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Legion_(book\)). See short-time-scale past positions of people and things in your field of view (direct time inversion of atium).

    **Electrum**: Reveals your short-time-scale possible futures.

    **Atilect**: Reveals your possible future selves, who can share their perspectives but not convey information. See the ultimate personal consequences of possible actions (like duralumin+atium).

    **Cadmium**: Creates a bubble of slow time.

    **Aticad**: Create a bubble of stopped time. Grey Boy. Create cadmium bubbles at range. (Bubbles at range cannot include the creator.)

    **Bendalloy**: Creates a bubble of fast time.

    **Atibend**: Create a bubble of hyperaccelerated time. Grey Boy. Create bendalloy bubbles at range. (Bubbles at range cannot include the creator.)
    ```

  Coppermind says that Atium alloys create expanded metal and temporal effects. 

  With pewter then for instance, rather then giving someone else power I think it'd give you the capacity to use strength to maximum effect, like seeing physical weakpoints or straight up letting you see how much damage you'd cause. 

  Atium+Tin would let you see all the consequences of your actions before you take them

  Atium + Steel/Iron could cause delayed pulls and pushes

  now, Lerasium on the other hand seems to be about Connections, so maybe it could be the one that changes the target from self to someone else?

    > like seeing physical weakpoints or straight up letting you see how much damage you'd cause.

    Thank you for this! I think I'll use it.

    >Atium+Tin would let you see all the consequences of your actions before you take them

    Atium accompanied by a duralumin burst actually does exactly that, so I'm thinking tin would be something different.
    ```
