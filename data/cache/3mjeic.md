## [BST] How can you munchkin the item box/ pocket dimension/ inventory power that gamer type character have?

### Post:

* Items don't have magical game like properties like food healing you or anything like that

* You cannot store anything living inside

* Dead things that can rot will not rot while inside (because time, physics etc do not progress while inside)

* There is a weight/ size limit tied to your abstract level of strength or some kind of hard limit based on the size of the item box/ pocket dimension. For this we will assume 500lbs and the size of a small apartment. 

* You have to manually be touching an object to put it into your storage space, but it does so instantly. You can store anything you are touching with any part of your body (has to be bare skin that is not covered by clothes, though you could store your clothes and then use that bare skin to store things) 

* Things like gasses, plasmas, or "energy" like fire or lightning cannot be stored. Any liquids or solids can though, provided they are not alive. 

* You have to focus on storing an item and have line of sight, which means you cannot store anything that is solely on your back. You can for instance store a bullet that has been shot at you but you have to be looking at it and focusing on storing it AND still be focusing the instant it touches your skin, if you break focus you will not be able to store it. (This is not hard but getting almost hit by a bullet can break anyone's focus)

* Items are stored based on what the user considers is one item, for instance you can store a backpack on your back that you do not have in line of sight of by looking at and storing a strap of the backpack. This does though mean you can store parts of an object that you think of as it's own object. For instance you can store a bike wheel or the entire bike. No the universe is one bullshit. 

* Reflections can increase line of sight with no adverse effects. For instance you can store something behind you by looking at it through a mirror and touching it.

* You cannot transport things you cannot perceive.

* You can manifest or recall something at any part of your body, as long as it is touching you, at least for a moment. For instance you can recall an anvil at the tip of your finger to drop on your foes. Manifesting takes focus and a mental picture as well as line of sight. With practice you could manifest things in different positions or configurations such as manifesting clothes that are already on your body. The limit to the complexity is the limit of your mental model. You cannot for instance put in a Gordian knot and expect to untie it unless you can accurately go through all the steps to untie it in your mind. Manifesting is instant just like storing.

* Physics, time etc do not progress while inside storage and all movement stops while inside. This means that you cannot shoot back stored bullets or blast around on jets of pressurized air or water.

  Well, it makes you pretty impossible to trap.  If you're tied up or put in handcuffs, you can just stow them.  If you can concentrate and change your perception, you should be able to 'store' person-shaped holes through any wall or locked door.  If you're in a pit, you can use the same thing to dig out handholds and just climb out.

  You could get a job as a near-perfect surgeon: If someone needs a kidney removed, you can just put a hand on them and take it right out.

  An extra 500lbs of stuff for free with next to no volume restrictions is a pretty enticing offer to any space agency.

  You could store up multiple small sub-critical pieces of radioactive material, and then deploy them all at once, for a nuclear suicide bomb as a last resort.  Or just use it to work in nuclear power production.

  You could make little fast-collapsing bubbles of vacuum in a water tank as a party trick?  Or you might be able to strategically stow water around you to force yourself through water at tremendous speeds.

  In a fight, keep your 'stowing' power going; bullets, knives, and fists (A fist itself is not a living thing, it's merely attached to one.  It promptly becomes a dead thing when separated), will all just end up in your inventory, making you invincible until your space or weight limit runs out.  Unless they have laser/plasma guns, anyway

    Well unless someone shoots you out of line of sight, you could probably rig up some sort of mirror contraption to have a 360 view of yourself to prevent that.

  If items are stored based on what the user considers one item, can you store a piece of something that is physically connected?  For instance, if I have a sword that is cast as a single piece of metal, but I think of it as having a "hilt" and a "blade", could I store only the blade?  If so, it seems that I could cut any item in an arbitrary way just by changing what I think of as an object.

  How do you determine what is living?  If I am a reductionist, and I believe that living organisms operate by the same principles as other organisms, I presume I am still prohibited from storing a living thing, so exactly how is what is "living" determined?  Can I store a virus?  Self-replicating nanobots?  Self-replicating biological nanobots?  (And if yes, why can't I store cells?)  A normal robot?  A normal robot with an artificial intelligence?

  If I send through a part of a cell, does it count as alive?  If so, what parts of the cell count as the living part?  (Clearly it can't be "all parts" or I couldn't even send through water molecules.)

  The limitation on not transporting things I can't perceive seems like it can be munchkined around by the object rule.  If I store a block of metal, I can't perceive its interior, yet the entire block is stored, including the interior.  So I could store an "object" made of a tiny speck on the visible surface that is connected by a tiny thread of metal to a piece of the interior.

  What happens if I try to store a long object, long enough that the far end of the object has changed in the time since the light was emitted from it?  Even ignoring the possibility of the object changing, does the entire object get stored instantly from front to end or is there a speed of light limitation?  (If it's instant, I can send a signal back through time.)

    A bit above my pay grade but I would say yes if you can reasonably think of something having a hilt you can store just the hilt. I think the clincher is you have to actually believe it's one item not just say so. This gets into shade of grey, is a fist alive? What part of a human is considered alive or not? I'd say there's a hard rule that anything that is made of living (as in replicating) cells that you can perceive with your own unaided eyes cannot be transported. 

    I'm not totally sure about the other things but I'll give a hesitant yes to anything that isn't directly against the rules, which I think are strict enough as is. Feel free to list any ways you think you can use the power effectively as is.

      Everything is made of atoms that don't actually touch. Convince yourself of that, and you're golden.

        I don't actually think "item" is a well-defined concept.  At most, it means "it's useful for humans to think of the referent as a single unit".  But the fact that "item" is often a useful concept for humans doesn't mean that it's not arbitrary.  I *know* that there isn't any real difference between saying "this sword has a hilt and a blade" and "this apple has a top half and a bottom half", except that we don't have a single word that means "top half".

        If I was the protagonist, it seems like I could chop up an arbitrary object in arbitrary way.

        [13% of men and 10% of women don't know that clams are alive](http://www.styleweekly.com/richmond/are-you-a-girl-take-the-test-you-might-be-surprised/Content?oid=1389586).  If your hero is one of those, can he store clams?  There's a good chance that he doesn't realize that yogurt contains living bacteria.  Can he store yogurt?  Could he store an apple if he 1) forgets that the apple contains viable seeds or 2) forgets that the apple contains some living cells?

  Sounds like it kills (sterilizes) everything you put in it? or at least removes any living matter. Depending on how this works this could be useful. Perfect pasteurization without any denaturing of any proteins, plus obvious medical applications, and possibly an assassination technique that does not leave a body (at least until you get around to dealing with it).
  Otherwise there's no practical way to put anything in it at all in most situations because most stuff in the biosphere has life in or on it.

  What happens when you put cheese in your item box?



  Also, you are now very good at smuggling and stealing stuff.

  >Reflections can increase line of sight with no adverse effects. For instance you can store something behind you by looking at it through a mirror and touching it.

  Does it have to be a pure optical reflection, or can you (for example) point a smartphone's front-facing camera over your shoulder for what is pretty much the same effect?

  When you take an item out, does it have to be touching your skin to be 'placed'? (Or can you 'dump' an item out without it having to touch you?)

  Can you store an item and bring it back out in a different configuration? Examples: If you store clothes you are wearing while you are sitting down, can you bring them back out to a 'wearing' position while you are standing up, or do you have to extract them in their original position and then manually put them on? (Similarly, could you store a pair of glasses which had the earpieces folded down, but retrieve them directly onto your head with the earpieces folded out?)

  I assume that if you have to be touching an item to retrieve/manifest it, you can make it appear at any point and orientation as long as it's touching you? For example, you could poke a pebble with your toe to store it, and retrieve that pebble into your hand?

  This appears to be missing a certain [visual demonstration](https://youtu.be/S09mEDCqSx4?t=51) of munchkin-ing item storage for all it is worth.
