  Assuming which of the many kinds of vampires in popular fiction is coming after you, and basing your entire defense on it?  This guy almost deserved to get his blood drained.

  He needed a layered defense: "Where are the nearest black lights?  Where is the nearest garlic? Where is the nearest holy ground?"

  Starting, of course, with the magic word for fighting vampires: "[Abracadabra](https://vimeo.com/1739813)."
