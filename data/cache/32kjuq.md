  Heh, mistranslations.

  Ooh, so this is an explicitly *legal* distinction that gets reified a bit by philosophers. Interesting.

  >Humans even feared that their ROBOTS would kill their creators for some reason.

  Has... nobody ever created an artificial Being? Are there no serious differences of values between species (one species that eats their young and another that values protecting children, for instance?) Are there truly no interspecies wars or slavery (excepting the Thirona)?

  >EARTH animals with one or more traits of Beinghood have been described in human records. Why do you think they are not considered full Beings?

  Could be the lack of records, but there are exceptions - not sure how spotty their data is. (I believe both whales and great apes should qualify IIRC.)

  However, I'm guessing that it's because none of them ever applied to the Intergalactic Commission; the Travellers Paradox issue would make no sense if you were considered a Being *before* you had a technology base.

  EDIT:

  > Some schools of biology even theorize that onecan predict whether an animal will evolve into a Being by whether that animal can lie, thus purposefully masking its own thoughts.

  > Asub-traitof this is theability to imagineand conceiveof the future. Although it is nota necessary requisite for Beinghood, all known Beings are future-cognitive.

  I wanted to complain that these are present in pretty much all animals ... but then I realized that *animalia* is the only genus I know about that produced Beings IRL, so that actually makes perfect sense as a distinction made by aliens dealing with multiple such extraterrestrial genii. This stuff is really good :D

    All of these questions have answers (even if I only just thought of the answers) but for now I'll answer the robot question, because I can't see it coming up in the text.

    The Intergalactic Commission has artificial intelligence, but since these things were created, they are considered an extension of their makers. So if the humans in this story had created an AI that outlived them, the IG would consider that AI a non-Being extension of the Being humans, thus only entitled to a few Being rights.

    Unfortunately for all of us, this is a textbook about humans, not extraterrestrials. As evidenced by the Thirona Mistake, the IG government has different values than humans, who would unquestionably call it genocide.

    Thanks a ton for the feedback! I've had trouble getting comments on my writing so this means a lot.

      This seems to contradict the article. The article states a being is something which satisfies four conditions, and none of them are "was not "created"". It could be that those conditions are necessary but not sufficient, but it reads like they are supposed to be.

      I would also wonder why human reproduction does not count as 'creation', while a human building an AI which self-modifies and builds an AI which builds a robot which builds a robot which receives a copy of an AI which builds a robot which builds a robot which receives a copy of an AI does count as 'created by a human'.
