  I have read this book and it is not rationalist fiction.  I enjoyed it but don't jump in expecting anything crazy it's just fantasy.

      Sam Hughes, aka qntm. Hannu Rajaniemi. Peter Watts. Quintessential hard science fiction authors, with Watts in particular having a tendency to make his source citations almost as long as his books are, to contextualise the more outlandish-sounding phenomena he includes in his works.

  'A Darker Shade of Magic' looks to be an interesting book, but I haven't read it yet so I don't know if it is suitable for this subreddit or not. I just wanted to post about the free copy since otherwise the free offer would expire before I finished reading the book. It's appeal is from the world\-building with four parallel versions of London and how the main character abuses his rare ability to travel between worlds.

  Summary:

  >Kell is one of the last  Antari—magicians with a rare, coveted ability to travel between parallel  Londons; Red, Grey, White, and, once upon a time, Black.  
  >  
  >Kell  was raised in Arnes—Red London—and officially serves the Maresh Empire  as an ambassador, traveling between the frequent bloody regime changes  in White London and the court of George III in the dullest of Londons,  the one without any magic left to see.  
  >  
  >Unofficially, Kell is a  smuggler, servicing people willing to pay for even the smallest glimpses  of a world they'll never see. It's a defiant hobby with dangerous  consequences, which Kell is now seeing firsthand.  
  >  
  >After an  exchange goes awry, Kell escapes to Grey London and runs into Delilah  Bard, a cut\-purse with lofty aspirations. She first robs him, then saves  him from a deadly enemy, and finally forces Kell to spirit her to  another world for a proper adventure.  
  >  
  >Now perilous magic is afoot, and treachery lurks at every turn. To save all of the worlds, they'll first need to stay alive.

  Only available in US or Canada. Ugh.

  Solution: Temporary use of dark side epistemology

    You don't even need to. Reopen the window and click US, that's what I did. No real check of IP address. :D

  I've read it and it was good, but not hyper rational.  It's well written fantasy with a cool setting and realistic characters, but none of them have the "extremely intent on logical reasoning" quality that defines rational fiction.
  ```

- u/AmeteurOpinions:
  ```
  But what is *A Darker Shade of Magic* and why should I read it? Besides the blurb on the page, of course.

    ```
    Have patience! I can only type so fast to post a summary! ;)

  A friend of mine counts this as her favorite book, though I'd forgotten the title until I saw this post!
