  My guess is that Cat is going to invest her title into Callow itself, making it the Kingdom of Moonless Nights, so that all the power that she's acquired will be able to be used by any of her successors to protect Callow, this protection enforced by Fey promises ingrained into the title itself.

  As a call back, she could condense a sword of pure Winter and jam it into a stone for people to try and pull out to become her successor.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I like that last sentence, but I worry that imbuing Callow itself with the power of winter would have bad effects on its farms.
    ```

    - u/HeWhoBringsDust:
      ```
      Making it the Kingdom of Moonless Nights makes it sound *horrifying*. The only way I can think of her making it permanent is if she drags all of Callow into her domain, which let’s be real is probably within her power
      ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        What would that do to the geography of Calernia? Would there be a giant, Callow-shaped hole? Would all the people and places vanish into a parallel Callow, leaving an empty nation? Would it be like the Everdark?
        ```

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    Oh, right, a possibility that an *object* woud receive the title (though, how would that even work?).

    Kingdom of Moonless Nights sounds a little bit cheesy for me, close second to the “Black Princess of Night”, but making a regalia like the Deadwood Crown that would allow for the title to switch hands is very much in the cards.

    I hope, for the sake of variety, that the seasons would also change with it: can do only so much with a power built around not having sufficient resources to sustain itself. Maybe it would even be a Tyrant of Helike kind of deal, where the rising or falling influence of the country would call for different basis of power.

    Wouldn't that make Callow even more of a target for rising supervillains?
    ```

  - u/werafdsaew:
    ```
    I think Akua is wrong on both guesses, and if anything is getting sacrificed it's Cat's identity as Catherine Foundling, as her sacrificing pieces of herself is her MO.
    ```

    - u/Mountebank:
      ```
      Oh, so Cat is planning on turning herself into some sort of autonomous guardian spirit for the Callow?
      ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        No. She isn't.

        She's planning to transfer her title into the parchment upon which the Liesse Accords are written.

        There's her enforcement. Not only will each nation be signing a magically binding fey treaty which will kill them and their successors if they break the treaty, but every remaining Drow will also declare war upon them. The Mighty she is going to be binding might start bidding a thousand or more years, that threat will be around for an incredibly long time.

        This is going to work!
        ```

- u/hailcapital:
  ```
  This made me want to see if I could find an exploit in Cat's oath to Thief.

  (Chapter 29).

  Context: Cat asked Vivienne if she wanted "the soul" destroyed.

  >“For small slights, long prices," "Let Akua Sahelian see the light and taste freedom. Let her believe she has slipped the noose, so long as she remains of use.” “But there will be a day where the world we made no longer has place for her,” “When we have faced all the horrors before us. And on that day, when she has glimpsed victory?” “Snuff her out, Catherine,” “Slowly. Painfully. Excruciatingly aware of what is being taken from her.”


  The biggest potential exploit that seems likely would be if for whatever reason the individual we've been calling "Akua Sahelian" doesn't count as Akua. I can't remember if the Akua we have now is Akua's original soul or the copy of Akua's mind she put on another soul. If it's the latter, it could be that she doesn't count as Akua Sahelian. This would also I think be the best shot Akua has at a plausible 'redemption' arc in the eyes of Cat and the audience, arguing that while she's certainly similar, the soul is meaningful enough that she isn't actually the same person responsible for Liesse.
  ```

  - u/Agnoman:
    ```
    Personally I'd put the biggest exploit at the condition of:

    > there will be a day where the world we made no longer has place for her. When we have faced all the horrors before us. 

    This is a pretty broad set of conditions that would trigger the need to kill Akua. She's already working on making herself indispensable (and thus having a place in the world), and facing all the horrors in front of them is the sort of thing that might not have an end - there's always room for another threat, as Cat herself has proven.
    ```

    - u/BlackKnightG93M:
      ```
      Black too before her. Like that one Dread Emperor said, the only way to get true peace is to mind control everyone.
      ```

    - u/hailcapital:
      ```
      That’s another good point. I considered that smaller because while it should be easier to accomplish, it doesn’t fulfill or negate the oath, so it will still exist as a Sword of Damocles perpetually hanging over her head. She can prolong her life that way, and perhaps she can do it indefinitely, but she’d never have security.
      ```

- u/Iwasahipsterbefore:
  ```
  Well played Cat. The only real way I can think of to improve that contingency is to allow Ubuu to remember *incorrect* information as a layer underneath the idle chatter. Maybe having the idle chatter consistently be about something strangely specific, making Abaa deduce the incorrect keyword.
  ```

  - u/Dent7777:
    ```
    Ubua, Ubuu, Akua, Aqua. The list of names grows by the day.
    ```

  - u/XeL09:
    ```
    i dont think the keyword is particularly important other than for the 2nd command.  it could be any random word that is not going to be used in the questioning.
    ```

- u/Agnoman:
  ```
  >Most those bodies were already bereft of Night, their killers have wasted no time claiming their due

  This is probably unavoidable, but I still think the Drow chowing down on the Night is a vector for risk. You don't want Drow becoming powerful enough that they can test their bonds, or gaining knowledge on how to escape magical oaths.

  >“She can manoeuvre all she wants, she’s not getting the job,” I said. “I’m still debating who’ll oversee when I’m not around, but she’s not in the running.”

  Thank god. I'm not convinced Larat is *much* better, but he's probably better than Akua.

  >I have begun to worry, Catherine. Urulan was perhaps in the twenty strongest drow of Great Lotow, and likely close to the bottom of that division. It fought… better than I expected. You came close to death more than once.”

  Yep. Why is it Akua who always seems to be the one bringing up reasonable points? That's actually a worrying trend.

  But Cat better have some damn good contingencies for the upcoming fights, let alone for Sve Noc (who is apparently a Dead King level threat).

  >“I compel you to answer my questions and do so truthfully and completely,” I Spoke.

  Oh good. We haven't seen much of Cat reigning in Akua recently, so this was comforting to see.

  I feel like a (admittedly small) hole might open up immediately though. Take

  >“We have,” I murmured. “Have you walled off any memories or knowledge, or considered doing so?”

  >“I have not,” Akua replied.

  >“Do you have any hole or holes in your memories?”

  >“I do not,” she said, then cocked her head to the side. “I do not. Oh my, you have been thorough.”

  and 

  >“From and including the word ‘marker’ I spoke earlier today, you will remember this conversation as idle chatter from the moment this sentence ends,” I Spoke.

  And it becomes fairly obvious. Cat's checking for holes in Akua's memories, but apparently modifications to her memory can go undetected. It's a fairly small hole, all things considered (especially as Akua would probably have to erase the memory of considering to do so), but it's still a thing.


  >“Have you plotted or acted against my interests?” I asked.

  >“I have not,” she replied, sounding amused.

  >....

  >“Have you manipulated the greater or lesser oaths, or both, so that you can exploit them in any way?” I asked.

  >“I have not,” she said.

  This is all very good to know.

  >My only long-term objective is survival.

  Although this I find quite surprising. I'd have figured Akua would be a little more ambitious, whether she's backed into a corner or no.

  >I’d ask again tomorrow.

  A daily check in like this is definitely a much needed policy.
  ```

  - u/russxbox:
    ```
    As to the memory holes going undetected, I think this is the case only outside the marker. At least the way I read Akua's response to the memory question, the first command appears to restore the memories of previous check-ins in addition to compelling truth. Or possibly because of that compulsion.

    Of course, this opens up a second hole wherein Akua has time to scheme during the check and can hide the memories of doing so after the memory question is asked. So long as she uncovers them before the next time Cat asks, anyway. Might be best practice to ask the memory question at the beginning and end of a marker conversation.
    ```

    - u/Agnoman:
      ```
      I wondered about that, but the two commands have no such clause for Akua remembering her interrogations during her interrogations. I took Akua realising that this had happened before as being more of a logical deduction than a return of memories. But either way it seems like there's potentially a tiny gap.
      ```

      - u/russxbox:
        ```
        My initial thought on reading it assumed that to answer Cat's questions truthfully and completely, Akua would have to regain the missing memories. Having thought about it some more and reread that section, I think you're right. Akua's reaction is from deducing that these conversations have happened before without even leaving holes in her memory when she considers the answer to the memory question.

        However, I've become even more certain that the reason this one took place on screen has to do with my hole- Akua used the time after the memory question to scheme and it will likely pay off soon. Either Cat doesn't get the chance to 'ask her tomorrow', allowing the schemes to begin to play out or she does ask and it comes out that Akua began making plans against Cat, meaning she's become too dangerous and has to go back in the box despite how difficult it will make the rest of the Drow takeover.
        ```

- u/Ardvarkeating101:
  ```
  Finally some of that UST is resolved after all that naked "fighting" and naked fighting
  ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    Cat should just get another girlfriend already. It seems like it's a highly effective anchor to her humanity, and she's going to start needing those going forward.
    ```

- u/TaltosDreamer:
  ```
  Oooh. thank you!  This makes me feel so much better about what Cat is up to and makes me excited to see what other plans Cat has in mind.

  This was fun and I enjoyed the sexual interplay!
  ```

- u/hailcapital:
  ```
  One other thing that struck me which I haven't seen commentary on is how frankly bad a guess Larat is as Cat's designated successor. I'd have guessed Vivienne- the person Cat uses as her morality compass and who she's entrusted what's basically a kill switch for herself to. If not Vivienne, maybe Hakram. Heck, Abigail and Kilian would probably rank higher in the succession than Larat.

  Larat is her treacherous lieutenant. His goals aren't at all aligned with hers, the best she could do is make him swear a series of oaths that put him pretty much on rails but that'd require assuming context never changes and he can never slip the bounds given infinite time.

  So, has Akua figured out a way to lie? Still doing an Evil cannot comprehend Slightly More Pragmatic Evil thing?
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Yeah, even putting a regular legionary officer (Abigail!) in charge of the drow would be better than friggin Larat.

    Would be a good thing too, since the drow will need to be integrated into the Legion at some point if Cat wants them to stay around on the long term and not completely cause havoc. Getting them used to a regular military hierarchy would probably do them a lot of good.
    ```

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      She's going to put the Liesse Accords in control. She'll sacrifice herself to empower them, and they'll be enforced both by her own mantle and by the Drow.
      ```

- u/AurelianoTampa:
  ```
  > “Not your usual fare, I know,” she said. “But **you are no longer the  Squire in any significant sense.** Your repertoire has expanded.” 

  Uh-oh...

  > “**I compel you to answer my questions and do so truthfully and completely**,” I Spoke. 

  Taking the prior point as a bit of foreshadowing, would Cat still actually have the power to Speak if she's functionally Nameless? I would understand if it drew upon her mantle of Winter (as Ubua is bound to obey it), but I thought Speaking was always a Name thing? 

  If that's the case, perhaps Ubua is able to resist, either partially or completely (but acts otherwise).
  ```

  - u/tavitavarus:
    ```
    As I understand it Speaking is basically one person enforcing their will on Creation with might, narrative weight and sheer willpower. Similar in some respects to the way Ranger and the Saint have hardened their will so much that their intent is treated as fact by Creation.
    ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    She owns Akua's soul. She can order her to tear her insides off, she can rip knowledge from her mind, probably other things we haven't considered. I don't think Akua has a lot of room to maneuver here.
    ```

  - u/werafdsaew:
    ```
    Every Fae is effectively Named, and she's the Queen of Winter.
    ```

    - u/Iwasahipsterbefore:
      ```
      Nope, she's the duchess of moonless nights. We don't know if she's inherited the fullness of the power of winter, or only the strength of the original mantle.
      ```

      - u/Razorhead:
        ```
        She's surpassed that and become the Sovereign of Moonless Nights, and the last of the winter fae (before the recent Lord of Silent Steps), meaning she has essentially become Winter.
        ```

- u/Iwasahipsterbefore:
  ```
  Possibly not a crack theory: Cat climbs the tower and imbues the role of dread emporer with Winter.

  Praes and Callow already personify the same aspects as winter and summer: constant greed and treachery on winter/praes, as well as the direct equivalence of praes always needing callows food.

  Having one fae kingdom in the real world wouldn't work, so my guess is vivienne would become the summer queen and rule callow. This ***might*** be currently foreshadowed with Vivienne losing her role, though its quite a stretch.

  The main difference is these two courts would begin allied, and hopefully stay that way.
  ```
