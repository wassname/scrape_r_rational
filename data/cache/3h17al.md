  Well if you're looking for something that's probably the opposite of rational but nonetheless a valid deconstruction of a crazy lady in a magical bus, I'd recommend the Iris Wildthyme series(es) of books and audios. I think Big Finish Productions actually just released a new boxset of her adventures; if it's the same quality as their other Iris work, I'd recommend it.

  Yes, and it's been running on the BBC for over 50 years.

  I believe we determined that a level of effort for posts here higher than "How about rational _____?" was desirable. Therefore I am downvoting.

  That said, rational Magic School Bus would be pretty sick.

    that's probably the closest you're going to get to rational.

    If we're thinking of the same topic, then it was a *particularly* bad case. Requests for recommendations are generally okay IMO, and there was a plausible chance something might exist, as evidenced by the fact we got two different links. :)
