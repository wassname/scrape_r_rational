  Hector, for the love of god, please investigate Kim some before talking to her again.

    He can't do that when he took a stupid pill as soon as he woke up. It explains the last couple of chapters though.

  I've finished the trajectory for Book 2 and should be completing it apace.

  While I was having trouble deciding on a direction for Delphic, I started writing a [Star Wars self-insert](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/complete-detachment-star-wars-prequel-si.8977/). It definitely helped me clear my mind. Always on the lookout for feedback.
