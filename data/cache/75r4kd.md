  Childrens minds develop as they age and gain experience, certainly, but suggesting they cannot be rational is ignoring omnipresent counter-examples. 

  Children can play games.  they can understand risk/reward, execute strategies based on logical conclusions stemming from observation of their environment and the rules at play. 

  There are child chess and Go masters.  There are child math whizzes, and other prodigies.  these all imply they can think and act logically, make long term plans, etc.

  There are also children who have adapted to very harsh environments and can be quite adept at navigating real life dangers.  Children in warzones, in impoverished and crime ridden areas, or subject to trauma show a larger capacity for social manipulation, and ruthless survival strategies. 

  On the flip side, children can absolutely show altruism, kindness, and ethical thinking when exposed to models and examples that encourage it.  Your suggesting that these only form in later teen years is strange to me. 

  To say children can't be "rational" puts rationality on some mysterious and ill defined pedestal.  You seem to think rationality is some magical state of perfect reasoning.  But as you mention in criticisms of Piaget, mental development - and rational behavior - should be seen as a spectrum, in fact a many faceted spectrum.  People may be quite rational in some behaviors and not at all in others. 

  With this model in mind, children can certainly exhibit a range rational behavior across that spectrum.

    I agree with this, and also say that the Western notion of treating children as incapable is cultural and not biological. Check out The World Until Yesterday by Jared Diamond for some cultural counterexamples. Basically, when children are treated like adults, they act like adults, with some exceptions for, for example, their diminished strength. In cultures like the Piraha, it would be strange for an adult to tell a child what to do or what not to do.

    Well, yeah.  "Rationality" is a two-place word.  It can mean, "reasoning according to a fixed principle that creates correspondences with reality (or at least the local sensory statistics of reality)" (by which standard ANNs and human brain machinery are "rational"), but it can also mean, "reasoning according to prescribed, normative standards that are believed, if not guaranteed, to lead to hitting the ground truth rather than merely to useful models" (by which standard, the entirety of a great many intellectual fields are spent on being *rational*, since we do not at all do it by default).

  See the easiest counterpoint to this is simply the existence of child prodigies. Pretty much any measure of mental capacity you care to devise is going to have _some_ 10 year olds who can perform better on it than most adults, and assuming the highly rational children in fiction are extraordinary individuals shouldn't exactly be surprising.                        
  Plus having multiple children like this in a story isn't exactly statistically impossible either, calling many of these children prodigies would give you the false impression that children at adult levels of mental development in many areas are as rare as one's who can do as well as genius adults at particular tasks.

  Overall my point is that at 10 year olds capable of rationality are neither nonexistent nor even vanishingly rare. If you happen to have grown up in the same filter bubbles as me you've probably met a few of them (and my cultural bubble isn't really particularly prestigious or anything, I don't personally know anyone who's gone to an ivy league school).

    The measures I mentioned are: the ability to develop and execute long-term plans and the ability to model other people as well as an adult.

    Child prodigies are just fine in terms of memorization, working memory, computation, etc., leading to children who can and do excel in sciences, math, engineering, music, art, etc. Of course,  a child prodigy in more than one field is unheard-of, and these fields don't include anything that I mentioned.

    Show me a child king or queen who could meet or exceed the capabilities of his or her contemporaries (without regents). Show me a child prodigy psychologist or sociologist. Show me a child prodigy organizational theorist. In other words, show me a prodigy younger than age 11 who actually conceives of and executes long-term plans or can model and lead people as well as contemporary adults, or even better, as well as the child characters in rational fics.

      It seems as though you're deliberately picking areas where you wouldn't expect examples even if 10 year olds were capable of doing as well as an average adult in those areas. For instance children far enough to the right of the bell curve to be good at leadership despite lack of experience ought to be vanishingly rare. So when you consider that those prodigies would need to just happen to be born into a monarchy and thrust into leadership without any regents the sample size isn't really large enough that you should be tremendously surprised to not find any good examples.                                                            
      In terms of fields like psychology or sociology you may be forgetting that those aren't exactly fields where one can make breakthroughs on one's own particularly easily. Simply put the inability to make breakthroughs that can be confirmed easily enough that people can't discount them based on the characteristics of the person who discovered them would seem to be pretty important in terms of which fields have child prodigies. 

      But again this is sort of irrelevant because whether you expect child prodigies in every single area that are on par with the imminent geniuses in that field isn't actually relevant here. Because as you said this is whether they can be comparable to the average adult.

      In regards to long term planning it's sort of trivially easy to come up with examples of children even younger than 10 who save their allowances for years to get something they wanted (the fact _I_ did that despite not really being particularly impressive in any way leads me to believe that's probably not even that uncommon). As for for leadership ability I think you're forgetting that leadership is pretty massively about people's perspective of you.

      To put it another way I would wager that few if any people could, if their mind was placed in a child's body (and everyone had every reason to think they _were_ a child) lead people very effectively. So yes that's a point in your favor against rational fics, because adults aren't generally going to let themselves be led by a child.

  OK, so I'm going to take this in a different direction. 

  Most of the criticisms in the OP and comments I've seen basically argue that children aren't as smart as adults, but this isn't what rationality is really about, and I'm finding the claims made to be thinly supported. 

  The portion of rationality that I think children are actually very bad at-- and the thing that actually got the whole rationality culture started on Less Wrong -- has to do with *believing things that are true* and *susceptibility to bias.*

  As I argued in my first comment, I think children, especially prodigies, are perfectly capable of making logical decisions when presented with clear risk/reward conditions.  They are also equally capable of empathy, altruism, and ruthlessness.

  I think where children are much more vulnerable than adults to failing to achieve optimal results is in their ability to discern what is true from what is not.  

  Children are vulnerable in two ways.  First, they are impressionable.  Early development is about rapidly absorbing information from your environment, and this includes lots of worldviews and information that is false.  Children are far more likely to internalize and believe untrue things than adults, because they lack context against which to judge their merit, and by default are trusting of new information.  

  The second way children are vulnerable to untruth is from internal bias.  Learning to recognize and combat bias is a difficult skill to learn, and comes only with practice.  Children are more prone to be driven by emotion and impulse, to trust in baseless intuition, to suffer from unrealistic sense of self and ego.  They are very unlikely to have received the training necessary to combat innate human biases, and may even be MORE vulnerable to them if they are smart. 

  These two vulnerabilities are something that writers of rational fiction should be taking into account.  I believe HPMOR actually does this to a degree -- harry fools himself quite a bit, is prone to emotional outbursts, ego, and sentimentality.  The merit of the narrative actually lies in the conflict between his rational training and worldview and his childish nature. 

  Keeping these weaknesses and vulnerabilities in mind will help to build more compelling and interesting child characters, even if they are prodigies in other ways.

  Kids are perfectly rational. The data set for decision-making  they're working from is just realllllllly limited. So their decisions are rational on a much smaller scale in both scope and time. 

  Rational child thinking: I want candy (mental timeframe, unspoken: within the next 10 minutes). Mom, can I have candy? Mom said not unless I can buy it myself. I have no money. I still want candy but I also want to not get into trouble. If Mom does not see me eating the candy I know is in the drawer, I can have candy (candy in a kid's mind usually being seen as randomly generated loot, and not an object of real value  to which actual ownership rights apply) and she won't know. 

  Rational teen/adult thinking: I want a car. Dad said not unless I can pay for it. I can use my limited savings and get a part time job, and in a few months I can have a car to fix up while complying with all the rules and maintaining good relationships and trust.

  Well, the only rational fic I can think of that contains child genius is HPMOR, and Harry can hardly be called completely rational.

  > Should it not follow that the thought structures of a child cannot be the same as those of an adult?

  No, why? You can have radically different neural networks computing the same function, if they are complex enough.

  It might be improbable, but "cannot" is too strong a word, unless you show a proof. Also - if you accept the possibility of general AI, then assumption that kids can't be rational seems very strange. If Turing Machine can do it-  so can kids.

  > For example, according to Piaget's theory of cognitive development, children from the age of 7 to 11, roughly speaking, will be growing increasingly capable of limited inductive logic and reasoning

  > My point is that children are NOT capable of such thinking due to biological limitations of the brain's development, not simple lack of trying or training. For a child below a certain age to use true rationality is for the child to quite literally have the brain of an adult, and thus to be a genetic, biological aberration.

  These "laws" are just averages based on observation, they are descriptive not prescriptive, and there are exceptions in real life ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_child_prodigies ).

    General agreement with this person when talking about the bulk of the normal(ish) curve.  Absolute disagreement with this person's attempt to draw conclusions about the tail end of the graph, at least for people in the 10-14 age group (I think I agree even about the tail ends for kids who are 7 or 8).  There are clear existence proofs in the tweens that undermine the strict/strong version of his claim, though, causing me to uncharitably imagine that this is one of those people who's forgotten what it was like to be eleven.

    Also: Piaget is fantastic, but is no longer the be-all-and-end-all on developmental psych.

    Edit: reread claim; OP states "freaks of nature" not "impossible and don't exist."  Maybe I don't disagree with them at all?  But I suspect they'll have systematically less positive impact on eleven year olds, and elicit less growth and awesomeness, than someone who takes a different tack.

      My post posited that by age 15, + or - some small number of years, should be the earliest at which we see fully adult capabilities in terms of long-term consequences and modelling other people. 14 or even 13 may be within that range. Much younger than that and I'll need some justification by the author as to WTF. HPMOR eventually gives such a justification, for example.

      I've got kids. My wife teaches kids. I see how they think, and it's at least a little bit alien to an adult's thinking. I don't consider their thinking to be invalid, nor for them to be people, nor for them to be "at fault" or "lazy" for their lackings, but rather victims of design and biology. Kids do the best they can, but that's not the same as an adults doing the best they can. Kids think differently.

        Yeah, reiterating solid agreement for the bulk of the normal curve, and strong strong strong strong strong strong disagreement for kids as little as 3 or 4 sigma out.  I've been an educator for the past eighteen years, and have interacted with ~500 or so kids in the 9 - 14 age range, and have encountered 3 < n < 10 whose capabilities in terms of modeling long-term consequences and other people well exceed those of the average adult.

        Rare, but not as rare as you think, and I posit that lots of adults have strongly motivated reasoning to declare it rare (e.g. it allows them to dismiss the data provided by children and maintain a status quo in which they're on top, or it allows them to distance themselves from painful past mistakes by saying "but I was such a *child* back then" when if they were to admit that this is meaningfully predictive/reflective of their current state and abilities they would have to acknowledge failure/shame/inadequacy/whatever).

  Define "rational". 

  My understanding is that "rationality" is simply a mode of thought, it is correlated with intelligence and knowledge yes, but you don't really need much of either to be think rationally. 

  I mean, to give a silly example: consider the game world of tic-tac-toe. There is a rational way to play the game so that you never ever lose, and it doesn't take very long for even average young children to figure it out and then play rationally. And if they can play rationally, then obviously they can also think rationally. 

  >as if rationality is something everyone is equally capable of regardless of brain development or other biological functions.

  I wouldn't say that, since obviously no brain or dead body = no rationality. But you really only need a small amount to think rationally. After that it just becomes a matter of scale. The more you know, the more contexts you can apply your rationality to. The more intelligent you are, the more complex you can make rational plans in your head. The more experienced you are, the more heuristics and shortcuts you can take to make those plans faster. 

  Now, age is indeed a limiting factor on these, but you can always specialize. For instance, I wouldn't expect any child to be a super lawyer + politician + painter + architect + physicist + chemist + mathematician + pianist + guitarist + ... all at the same time, that's way too much information needed to cram into under a decade. But for just one of them? It seems possible enough if you sacrifice a bunch of other stuff. Read them physics books to bed instead of fairy tales. Give them only a piano for entertainment, no TV. Hell, take away all their other distractions like friends and loved ones and any happiness whatsoever. Drop them out of school to focus solely on one field even if it leaves them completely uneducated in every other area.

  You would probably count as a horrible guardian for doing so, but it sounds doable enough.

  I think that your big mistake is over-emphasizing the mean for kids.

  Kids are shorter than adults. Yet, by age 12, 5% of girls are taller than the average adult woman. Some of them will stop there, and were just early bloomers. Some of them will end up being freakishly tall. And that's 5% - as you get further to the ends of the bell curve, individuals will vary from the mean even more. People who are different enough from the mean to be substantially different are not rare enough to be freaks on a social scale.

  Go to a decent-sized middle school. There will be enough boys that are about as tall as an adult male for them to field several of them in their basketball team. Similarly, there will be a few of them who started shaving at a young age, or who had their voice reach a tone suitable for an adult (whether or not it will be THEIR adult tone). If you're doing a story about middle-school basketball players, several of your characters are not going to resemble the average child in their cohort in a number of physical metrics.

  Mental properties are not so uniquely privileged. Even the chart you linked to yourself shows that by age 10, a few percent of the kids have begun the formal stage, and more than double that number have reached a mature level of it by age 13. These are still middle school kids, and we're not even looking at fractions of the top percent. If you're going to be writing a story about smart kids, you aren't going to write about the average kids any more than you're going to use the average kids as the protagonists of your competitive basketball story. The main question then becomes "is the population these kids come from big enough to field this many kids this far from the mean?" If you have a group of 500 6-year-olds and somehow every character is a tiny adult, yeah, that's quite a reach, but if you have a small city of a quarter million and you hand pick the cleverest 13 year olds? They might not be able to perform at a respectable professional level _consistently,_ but it's not unbelievable that they'll be able to analyze and plan and delay gratification better than the average adult.

  Mind you, that is not a particularly difficult bar to clear, even. The average adult never got a college degree, has basically no savings, and works jobs that pay $12 an hour or less with no real plans for career advancement. If your baseline is career information workers, your expectations for the level of planning and self-control in adult behavior are skewed.

          From what I remember of HP from that fanfic (it's been ages since I read it and I skimmed a good bit), he didn't push the bounds of my disbelief *too* much for an 11 year old, and could have existed quite plausibly as a decently bright 14-15 year old who's read some pop-sci books and wikipedia articles and (in wanting nerd cred) tries to shoehorn references to them wherever is remotely appropriate. Not too crazy to conceive of an 11 year old with a more accelerated "intellectual" development (and maybe worse socialization).

          As for the SATs, I think the scale used for grading changes pretty often so whatever the score-percentile correspondence is now it could well have been different at some other time. Though having known a fair few good test-takers back in highschool (not 11 but more in the ~14-16 year old range; also, scoring maybe 1500-1600), some of them were quite smart for their age but plenty failed to particularly impress, so IDK how useful test scores are at suggesting the sorts of qualities being discussed here.

  Others have written in more detail (and my reading of this thread's contents has not been thorough), but I would like to poke the phrase 'Should this not include the capacity for full rationality(?)'.

  ...Ah, I thought of a fun way to portray my stance!  Word replacement:  

  "Consider the fact that the brain of a Zorblaxian (alien) is not physically or chemically identical to the brain of a human. Should it not follow that the thought structures of a Zorblaxian cannot be the same as those of a human? Should this not include the capacity for full rationality?"

  One could do a similar male/female (/female/male) word replacement.

  My thoughts on this:

  Let it be assumed that there is a biological requirement for what can be referred to as rationality.  As a basis for this, consider a rock without a brain, a jellyfish, an ant, a digger wasp that moves a spider to its previous position time and time again without adaptation.

  Given how adult humans have to jump through hoops such as statistical tests, double-blind studies and other means to try to get past issues such as confirmation bias and the [oh-so-many-fallacies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies) that humans are prone to, it's doubtful that we meet the requirements for an imagined 'full rationality', with or without our largely ad-hoc systems for defending ourselves from commiting irrational behaviour.

  If there is to be any hope of achieving a state of 'full rationality', it either depends on modifying our brains to behave according to a specific behaviour pattern, or 'full rationality' being defined in such a way that very different brains, with very different quirks and handicaps, can (with biological capabilities over a certain low threshold) self-analyse and reach the same equivalent position termed 'full rationality'.

  Or, to summarise this (spoken by an imagined person):  "HAH-HAH-HAH!  White male human adults, you think there's a 'peak' and a 'non-peak' for rational behaviour, and coincidentally YOU'RE at the top of the entire universe and I'm not?"
