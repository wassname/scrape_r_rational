  So far as I'm concerned, the pay-off for wandering in D&D land has to be meeting Bellatrix and seeing all the exploits of a skilled and intelligent wizard from the Harry Potter world. I know people have been somewhat down on these sections, but I'm really looking forward to when they meet Bellatrix.

  Also, using backstory as an exploit is exactly the sort of thing that I do all the time as a player - you just need a forgiving dungeon master.

    Well, it depends how Bellatrix is portrayed. She was in Azkaban for years after all. She may be skilled and intelligent, or just cruel, insane and talented with a few OP spells

    So we know that Milo really had someone "playing" him at some point. Presumably that's true of all the other characters. Which means at some point we might just meet the DM himself...and he will *not* be happy about all this Munchkinry.

      Have we not already 'met' the DM? What with the phrases like 'Disgruntled Mechanics' interfering with Munchkinry attempts that do not quite flow with the rules, or ones that give instant wins.
