## [RT] The Steerswoman

### Post:

I just read book one of The Steerswoman (if you haven't read it: It's a good story about characters trying to figure out things. I liked the characters quite a lot. And while many of the answers actually become clear to the reader early on, but it's quite interesting to see the characters figuring them out).

I couldn't quite follow everything, however, and was hoping someone else who read the book could explain:

[book 1 ending spoiler](#s " I've been thinking hard, but I totally can't see how they had enough information to conclude that the many shards are from a fallen Guidestar? How do you think Rowan figured it out?" )

### Comments:

- u/rdalex:
  ```
  It's been a very long time, but I think that was explained? Something about [](#s " extrapolating from the 'splash pattern' of the discovery sites")? And the fact that the angles were all wrong for [](#s " surface launch but right for orbital fall")?

  Okay now I have to reread this series.
