## [D] (Belated) Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I remember reading a short story a while back, but sadly I can't find it anymore. Lord knows I've tried.

  The story was about a city that disappeared and a group of people whose task it was to find out what happened. Thing is.. Nobody remembers the city. Whatever caused the city to disappear also deleted all the info there was about the city, it went into people's minds, erased all records,  everything.

  The the only clue they have is that the mechanism that deleted all info about the city is apparently bad at censoring all the adjacent stuff, so for example the roads that lead to the city still exist. Or their countries flag, which has a certain number of stars on it, each star representing a city. Except there's one star too much on the flag. And it's sloppy in other ways too, for example there's a song about the cities and at some point it stops rhyming because the one line about the missing city is gone. 

  If anyone here knows what this story is, i would be very grateful. I really wanted to read it again.

    This might be one of the many alexanderwales/cthulhuraejepsen one shots, because this exact concept appears in Worth the Candle with a very similar description, and he loves reusing stuff.

    ```
    This is *not* the story you're after - the flag part specifically isn't there - but "The Lost City of Ithos", fourth in John Bierce's rather fun Mage Errant series, contains literally all the other things you describe, so may be of some interest.

  - u/DangerouslyUnstable:

    Read the linked story, mostly enjoyed it, but I am _incredibly_ confused about what is gong on after the viewpoint shift. Is it supposed to be set after the first viewpoint? Spoilers:>!When both individuals in the first section are disappeared (if they in-fact are),someone re-discovers the project? Is the handwriting supposed to be that of Alexei or Fyodor? If so, how does the later group manage to avoid being disappeared by whatever is doing it?   
    Also:  
    >!Is the implication of the ending that the hinterlands actually had nothing to do with it and this is just being used as a justification for a war the government wanted anyways? Is the fact that it doesn't rhyme but was written after The discovery that Potyr was missing mean that an additional city has been disappeared? Or is it a poem frantically written about the first disappeared research group, before the last two are finally gone?!<

    I'm all for respecting the intelligence of the audience and leaving some things ambiguous, but this goes just a smidge too far, in my opinion.
    ```

    - u/plutonicHumanoid:
      ```
      Yeah, it’s interesting that we never got to see the poem. I assumed the poem >!mentioned that knowing about the erasing causes you to be erased, but apparently the country is fine? I think you have to know something in particular about the erasing to get erased. The only implication before the two get erased is that they figured out that other people who were solving this got erased, so maybe that’s it? I think that’s why it’s ambiguous if Francis got erased.!<

    That sounds immensely interesting, I like stories at characters trying to solve an anomalous mystery and relying on clues around them.

  Automod's scheduler messed up last week, and it ended up resulting in this week's post not getting up.  This should be fixed for next week.

  Here's what I'm currently reading. I can provide links if needed, but most / all of these were recommended here previously.  None of these are explicitly rational, though none have jumped out at me as particularly irrational.

  *Every update:*

  * He Who Fights with Monsters - Jason Asano has had a *very* rough week.
  * Beware of Chicken - currently my favorite.  It is a very sweet and happy story.  There are bad things in motion though.
  * Beneath the Dragoneye Moons - it is amusing to compare the protagonist Elaine to Ilea of Azarinth  Healer.  Same base classes starting out (sort of / mostly) but going in very, very different directions.  Ilea is a walking, talking weapon of mass destruction, using healing to fuel her rise in power and ability to kill stronger and stronger opponents.  Though she has founded a healing order recently... though they are combat focused as well.  Elaine, due to her Oath, avoids killing sophonts as much as possible.  She has seen a dramatic rise in power and station with recent updates.
  * Tower of Somnus - Kat is still a pawn of higher powers on all sides, she's got a long way to go to really determine her own fate.
  * RE: Monarch
  * The Shadow of Angmar - just released an update Feb 19th.
  * Ultra A.I.
  * The Last Angel
  * Power Corrupts (Gamer SI) - NSFW
  * Journey of Black and Red
  * I Am Going to Die in this Game-like Dimension - the author apparently responded to some feedback about Emma holding the idiot ball towards the end of Hub 3, and re-wrote one of the final encounters there.  I had purchased the Amazon published book 1 (Whispering Crystals), and was surprised that nearly everything in Hub 1 (the very beginning) was cut out.  The author also added more backstory for Emma with regards to her family and situation on Earth before being abducted.

  *Others:*

  I've kind of stalled out on SoulSmith (book 2 of the Cradle series) by Will Wight.  Not sure why.  I don't much care for the casual body modification that goes on in this world.  One of the characters recently acquired a golem arm with sword that is now permanently attached somehow. I'm fine with shadow arms that can be unsummoned or things like that, but having a 3rd arm attached to your shoulder permanently... not so much.  How do you sleep with that thing?  I also wasn't a fan of that other cultivator webfic where the protag (underpowered compared to his peers, a common theme) was going to replace his heart with this wacky construct he was building so that he could channel more Qi or whatever.
  ```

  - u/fassina2:
    ```
    Interesting you don't like the transhumanist aspects ? That's kind of rare on this sub I think. I like it a lot, like write a story where that's one of the main ways to increase in power ;)
    ```

    - u/ansible:
      ```
      I'm mixed on transhumanist stuff.

      If you lost your arm in a car accident, and you get a robot one, that's great.  If you want to completely reshape your body, and add a pair of arms that are properly integrated (redesigned shoulders or however), that's great too.,

      Adding stuff randomly though? Eh, not so much.  Maybe it was the asymmetrical nature of having a third arm stuck on somewhere that bothered me the most.
      ```

      - u/echemon:
        ```
        To try and motivate you to keep reading it- not a major spoiler-  >!Yerin's goldsign(s) don't stay asymmetric- the goldsign evolves over time.  She ends up with 4 sword-arms, I think, and uses them to fight as well as cast sword magic.  It's pretty dope.!<
        ```

        - u/Redditor76394:
          ```
          To add onto this, >!Considering that all the ascended don't seem to have any deformities or goldsign signs, I think part of the ascension process can reshape the body into whatever is desired including removing goldsigns or making them a manifested when wanted. !<
          ```

      - u/Dragongeek:
        ```
        The asymmetry and the lack of control/choice bothered me too. Like those people who just have poisonous insects fused to one of their arms is just *ick*.
        ```

        - u/Redditor76394:
          ```
          It's actually a plot point how the path you follow can have drawbacks and consequences. Sometimes, the choices you make result in >! Your lower face turning into a giant unhinging hideous snake maw. And now that you're hideous, your family disowns you and tries to kill you later. !< 

          Also I think it's appropriate that some of the paths to power, and some of the things you must do to survive have consequences that are not always aesthetically pleasing.
          ```

  - u/serge_cell:
    ```
    I'm not impressed with Cradle series for different reasons. While style is very good , some characterization is present, the plot and worldbuilding looks like cookie-cutter xianxia. Your average chosen boy,  save the world, power of friendship. No originality or inspiration, not even political axe to grind. Multitude of atrocious qidan translations with poor style and prone to incoherent rambling nevertheless have message and inspiration, unlike this masterpiece of mediocrity.
    Edit: orthography error fixed
    ```

    - u/plutonicHumanoid:
      ```
      The cosmic element is pretty neat. I haven’t read other xianxia before though, I don’t have a stomach for poor translation. From what I know of them however it does follow in their footsteps of taking ages to get to its best. I liked the first few books but I liked the next 4 after that much more, once the protag has some real power. 

      Don’t think it does power of friendship etc stuff though.

  I liked [Ultimate Rock Paper Scissors](https://mangadex.org/title/36067/ultimate-rock-paper-scissors): a manga about a rock paper scissors tournament between people with superpowers.  
  "If a telepath, a clairvoyant, a vice detective, a ninja with super reflexes, a spirit medium, an oil magnate, an extremely lucky boy, and an extremely strong man were to fight it out in a rock-paper-scissors tournament, who would you bet your money on? Just because it's a simple game with simple rules doesn't mean the matches will be simple. "

    Ultimate Rock-Paper-Scissors, much like Transdimensional Brain Chip, is one of those works that shows great writing can overcome low-quality art. Highly recommended.

  Last week I recommended [ACSCRMKB] (https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29027/a-city-stranded-cowboys-robot-mercy-killing-business), and people here seemed to dig it. Continuing with stories that got no/insufficient love, I'd like to shill for [AweksLear](https://www.royalroad.com/profile/120092/fictions) this time. He is another author that doesn't quite fit the Royal Road paradigm. Too unusual and with erratic updates. One of his story blurbs is a quote from Aristotle, which is a sure way to not get readers.

  His stories aren't rational, I don't think, but they have a tone similar to Pith and Worth the Candle, which people here seem to enjoy. The settings are dark weird dystopias that blend a lot of elements, including anime mecha fights, rpg tropes, and interdimensional scheming to overthrow YHWH. His stories are incredibly grim, and the protagonists are often straight up villains.

  He's another one of those authors I hope don't get discouraged from lack of feedback. He updates slowly, but hasn't given up yet.

  I'm not a regular visitor here, but my tastes are often adjacent. I have a recommendation that may not perfectly align with the sub, but it's delightful and I think it fits:

  [**Travelogue of the Stars Above**](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/travelogue-of-the-stars-above.68842/)

  *This being the records of Rigel ibn Amir, ibn Hassan, ibn Salib, in which he recounts his travels among the worlds above Mount Qaf.*

  A medieval Islamic scholar is abducted by an alien, who shoves a fish into his ear and proceeds to ask him many questions about his world. Our bold Rigel is most put out to hear his payment will be a memory wipe and being dumped near some precious metals. He argues that this would be a sin and he should definitely be given a ride to the alien's home university. Then, alas, pirates. 

  The fish may be a clue that this is somewhat inspired by Douglas Adams. It's funny, fascinating, and has a smart protagonist who knows that he's in a world of technology he barely has the tools to describe, but he's going to damn well figure it out. And the people, too, even if they are giant wasps puppeting hollowed-out clones, or arrogant jerks who dismiss lesser civilisations as barbarians. 

  It's *very* good. 

  For those unfamiliar with the site, there's a Reader Mode which just shows the story posts, and arrows to skip from one story post to the next in the thread itself.

  Recommending: Ursula Vernon's (as T Kingfisher) Paladin's Strength came out. She has the absolute best paladins I've read in any fiction. Seriously, the Clocktaur War is to some extent fundamentally an essay on how everyone else gets paladins wrong. I love it.

  Looking for: more web serials! I am insatiable! between my last request three weeks ago and now I picked up Heretical Edge and devoured it, along with SP, and that was a solid three million words of fun. (Text only. No fanfics. No murderhobos, no murderhobo dungeon cores.)

  - Lady Knight Volant (and sequels,
  - Worm/Ward/Pact/Twig/Pale, 
  - Just a Bystander, 
  - [a large variety of Worm fanfic], 
  - The Wandering Inn, 
  - Saga of Soul, 
  - [a extraordinary sufficiency of HP fanfic]
  - The Zombie Knight,

    judging from your post, you have similar taste as me - that is, you don't care too much about content and you just need stuff that's really long because you read way too quickly. 

    I'll recommend [the gods are bastards](https://tiraas.net/2014/08/20/book-1-prologue/), though you might have already checked it out as it's been around for ages. I was put off for a long time by the 'western' description, but the western stuff is actually barely there and it's mostly a story about a fantasy university in an industrial revolution setting. At least the opening is, it's so massive now that the story has branched out in all kinds of directions.

    also [Defiance of the fall](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/24709/defiance-of-the-fall), a fairly simple litrpg with xianxia elements. it's not gonna win any prizes (the main character basically doesn't have a personality or any character traits), but the author does a good job of moving things forwards constantly and keeping interesting things happening.

    Both of those should give you a good chunk of reading to get through
    ```

    - u/Dragongeek:
      ```
      +1 for *The Gods are Bastards* although I found it suffers a bit from character bloat and gratuitous side-plots later on. Last year I spent a week just binge reading it (I was sick and probably read for 10 hours a day) and got maybe halfway through (it's over three million words iirc) but when I tried picking it back up a couple months later, I'd forgotten who all the characters are and couldn't get into it. That said though, I did really enjoy what I read.
      ```

    - u/PastafarianGames:
      ```
      Defiance of the Fall is nice and long and isn't too terrible, so yeah, I'm chowing through it. It's a shame that the narrative is so uninterested in the city building, though. That part is way, way more interesting than any of the cultivation or litrpg wankery.
      ```

  - u/Dragongeek:
    ```
    Have you tried [Vacant Throne](https://tcthrone.wordpress.com/)? Nearly a million words and quite good.

      I tried Isekai'd Shoggoth just now, that first chapter was certainly something. Author expects the reader to get obscure references without explanation of what they are and info dumps the whole chapter. When author was called out for it in the comments, she was just defensive and didn't seem receptive to improving.
      ```

      - u/Dragfie:
        ```
        I skipped first chapter (as I usually do with Isekai's), enjoyed the rest immensely; only other annoying thing would be having all the other languages there only translated through the "footnotes" features which is annoying and personally doesn't give anything to the narrative.

  Just gonna throw out that I saw Dungeon Crawler Carl recommended last week in here and decided to try it. Unfortunately the first two books don't seem to be available on RR for free any more (though the third book is there, presumably until it goes to Amazon in April). Luckily, I had a free trial subscription to Kindle available and got the first two books for free from Amazon. It's a really, really fun read. Quick too; I binged the two in less than a week (and got the third one done from RR). I'd recommend it, as it has a lot of humor, good munchkinnery, and lots of foreshadowing for keen readers who want to guess how the protagonist will deal with the next challenge.

  I also read The Demon Lord's Lover, which was entertaining but not particularly rational. Lots of good world building, but ultimately it ends before it really takes off. It's a good deconstruction of tropes for the "group of chosen heroes must fight the demon lord" genre, and reminded me a fair bit of the game The Last Sovereign at the start (though without all the sex). It's not bad if you want something fun to read without needing to think too much about it.

  Finally, like some other people already have, I'm going to recommend Beware of Chicken. It's a fun take on xanxia/cultivator stuff, and while the main character is a Marty Stu, it's still a quick and entertaining read. The first book just wrapped up and I'm very interested in seeing where it goes next.
