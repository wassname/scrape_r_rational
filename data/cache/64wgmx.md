## Looking for a short story once posted here (about time travel).

### Post:

The story was a time travel story where, because there was only one timeline, everyone was basically killed because of the time travel. The time traveler replaced his/her brain with a silicon one and sent it back in time to the 21st century to replace his/her own brain. Thanks.

  He actually replaced someone else's brain with his own. Murder? Yeah, from a certain point of view. Of course, making the jump at all meant effectively murdering every sapient being then in existence. He noted how it's funny that the one feels more meaningful than the many.

    That's the one! Thank you.

    If time travel can reset to any point in time, no matter how far back, then we wouldn't expect to be living in a universe that's 14 billion years old - most of the seconds across all timelines are far closer to the big bang.

      Your argument is well-reasoned, but there are three flaws/counter-agruments:

      * Time travel only requires life with an advanced civilization, so it should only be resetting, at most, to the earliest point in time when complex life first appeared. Not back to shortly after the big bang where there is no life to take advantage of the time travel. For all we know, life does take 14 billion years to appear (a proposed solution to the Fermi Paradox).

      * According to the Anthropic Principle, even if time travel frequently resets to an early point in time before human civilization appears, we can only observe universes that has managed to reach 14 billion years in age without resetting. Hence, we cannot take the age of the universe as evidence for or against any hypotheses, only that it's possible to reach the age of 14 billion and not how likely the age is.

      * Another issue is that even if most timelines result in a reset, the resets can only go as far back as when the civilization can conceivably invent time travel. There is no reason for the timeline reset to go back to an earlier species (how can a human mind take over an alien mind?). Hence the timeline should be seen as a series of bursts of frequent resets with long stretches of uninterrupted timelines. This is true even if multiple species with time travel exist at the same time, as long none of them can interact with each other. Slowly over the corpses of numerous failed species, the timeline of the universe will gradually progress.
