  Punk is above all an attitude. It's a "the system is your enemy" mentality. So the stories tend to be about fighting back against oppressive regimes, especially when the oppression is disguised as utopia (like Brave New World).

  I can't give exact definitions, but in my experience, there are definite differences.

  **Realistic and rational:** the latter focuses on intelligent characters, while the former can be about anyone. You can write a perfectly realistic story about a bunch of idiots. Additionally, realistic stories do not need to challenge readers intellectuallyâ€”again, you can write a perfectly realistic story with deus ex machinas, no munchkinry, and no fair-play whodunnit.

  **Rational and rationalist:** the latter is didactic (tries to teach rationality and similar skills) while the former is not.

  **Punk and the rest of them:** tbh, "-punks" are a bunch of such wildly varying genres, I don't exactly see what similarities can they *all* have with the other three.

    Punk genre is exemplified by cyberpunk which was a deconstruction of many sci fi stories about utopian places where technology solves peoples problems. Cyberpunk is how technology would still enable the same human fallibles and problems that we have all been dealing with since day 1. To put it succinctly, utopian science fiction is about how technology will eventually help us overcome the problems that have, up until now, been endemic to human nature. Cyberpunk is about how technology won't."

      IMO, the only thing that unites "-punks" is "high tech, low life," the same as in your description. In that case, it doesn't really have much in common with the other three genres.

  Punk as a literary meta-genre is about rebellion.

  Cyberpunk, the most common genre in that category, is about rebelling against extractionary, extortionary capitalism-gone-wild. Cyberpunk is about how the corporation is both a leech and the Grim Reaper; cyberpunk is about how the individual is both exalted and powerless in the face of dehumanizing, inhuman institutions raised up as a prayer to Mammon. Cyberpunk is a literary genre that looks at the growth of corporate power and the decline of humanism everywhere from governance to the board room and says "This is the future we are building."

  Cyberpunk isn't the only punk, obviously. Steampunk is a rebellion against the sameness of industrialization and against the streamlining of the world, a rebellion against a world without frontiers and without adventure. Solarpunk is a rebellion against the collapse we're staring down right now, a statement that actually we could be doing things differently, that we could be building a sustainable and green future (even as we continue to light the future on fire to line the pockets of our modern-day robber barons).

  None of these have anything to do with realism or realistic fiction. No genre of "punk" fiction *can* be realistic past a certain level; at that point you're not really writing speculative fiction so much as ... I dunno, Age of Sail historical fiction, rather than steampunk. Solarpunk isn't reality because in reality instead of building arcologies or city-sized upper-story parks and zipping around in electric mass-transport pods, we live and work in concrete boxes and mostly drive petroleum-burning cars.

  Rational fiction and rationalist fiction are styles, which are completely orthogonal to other axes. Adequate definitions of those are in the sidebar.
