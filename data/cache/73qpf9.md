  "Are you?"

  Will this stop the theories that robber is the assassin?

  I think not. 

  Edit: how much damage could do  a pocket sun to the tower?
  ```

  - u/Oaden:
    ```
    A lot, we haven't seen the last of the sun THE SUN THE SUN THE SUN

    Excuse, that got the better of me all of the sudden. Anyway, i doubt it will be used against the tower itself. This battle of Callow and the tower is one of institutions and long lasting change. Merely bringing down the tower won't change anything. Praes will just rebuild.

    Its more probably that it will be used vs The winter king.

      > the sun THE SUN THE SUN THE SUN

      Ooooo, another fan of *Sunless Sea*, or is this a reference to another game/story?
      ```

      - u/Oaden:
        ```
        Yea its sunless sea
        ```

  - u/DCarrier:
    ```
    If anything it's evidence for it. Assassin can change her appearance, so the fact that Thief met her and didn't recognize Robber no longer means anything.
    ```

- u/nick012000:
  ```
  It's ironic that now that she's teamed up with Cat, she might actually be able to make the target she set for herself.
  ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    I'd imagine a sun is worth a lot more than ... well almost any imaginable sum of money.
    ```

    - u/nick012000:
      ```
      Yeah, but she didn't steal it from the Praesi, now did she? ;)
      ```

      - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
        ```
        Ah, yes. I was too focused on "money" and not enough on "revenge."

        Ransoming to NOT burn a city down isnt very Thiefy, so thats out too.
        ```

        - u/Ardvarkeating101:
          ```
          Makes a hell of a distraction when robbing a treasury though.

          Hell, that might even give the Kingdom Below some issues.
          ```

- u/hoja_nasredin:
  ```
  A lack of chapter from heroes POV makes me suspect they have a big ace in their sleeve.
  ```

  - u/mightykushthe1st:
    ```
    As is tradition apparently, so just another day I guess.
    ```
