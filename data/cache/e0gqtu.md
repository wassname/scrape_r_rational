  When I was in secondary school I moved deliberately to this sleep schedule. Home from school fall asleep, wake up around midnight or 1.

  So I could game with my American friends once they were home from the evening.

  I'm shocked no one on the forum thread considered jetlag or moving countries. Even just a holiday would surely be the obvious test if its related to the sky. There's a mention of a jetlag pill but not actually giving yourself jetlag 

  Also an even distribution of human sleep patterns would actually be amazing.

  The peak and trough system of current civil planning would be dampened a lot. Instead of insane rush hours traffic would be distributed across the 24 hours, true of everywhere.

  Keeping buildings and restaurants open 24/7 isn't harder if you consolidate a few together. The hardest stores are mom and pop stores who can't be open during peak hours because there are none.

  Subways and buses now that demand is not concentrated would run less often but would run 24/7.

  The places that benefit the most are cities while small villages and towns find their standard of living fallen. This will encourage more movement to urban concentrations which is good again for gdp and economic growth and efficiency. 

  However many stores already function without employees with cctv or even relying on human honesty alone. So this will encourage that kind of behaviour. Crime will be harder to because there's no period where the streets are empty and quiet.

  Internationally this will bring the world closer together as timezones become pointless. I guess they'll be eliminated quickly. Instead of companies operating on daylight hours three or four shift hours will be the pattern 0-6, 6-12, 12-18, 18-24 covers all 8 hour sleep patterns.

  I expect gdp to climb significantly after adjustment assuming even distribution. Its just so much more efficient to buy 5 computers used 24/7 then buy 20 computers which are left untouched for 14 hours a day. This is true in literally every single thing. Cars can be shared, even apartments and beds could work. If you and your friend have opposite sleeping schedules, save money and rent a 1 bedroom together.

  Socialised parenting will be necessary which increases the nuclear family to four to eight parents with up to a dozen children. Again such units living in a single home is more efficient.

    I think you're misunderstanding the situation.

    It's not that these people have 24-hour circadian rhythms that don't line up with those of other people, it's that they have circadian rhythms that are 23:55 or 24:07 (etc.) in length.  So, if their solution is to move time zones to fix the issue, then they have to move over and over again.  Let's say there's a four-hour window in which a "runner" can exist in line with everyone else in a timezone: if their offset is five minutes, they'd have to move 1/6 of the way around the globe every seven weeks.

    And you wouldn't just need to find a person who had an opposite sleeping schedule; you'd have to find someone whose "day" is exactly identical to yours; as much as a minute longer, and, even if you start out twelve hours apart, you'll be on the same sleep schedule within two years.

      Oh I was misunderstanding it.

      Didn't she switch suddenly from normal sleep to waking up at night?

      That's much worse. Still anything to relieve electricity, water, road, Internet, health services, etc peaks, you'd just work progressive shifts and so would everyone else. 

      If it's ten minutes every 24 hours, that's an hour a week. You probably need two hours before or after work of not working to be safe and not so tired.

      So 12 hours. With 8 hours of sleep it means you'd need to move your shift forward every 24 days? Call it a month because people have a lot more flexibility than that even with people on 24 hour cycles.

      Also I find that change far more improbable than shifting the circadian rhythm off. It's not like most people are bang on 24 hours cycle. If that was all it was then staying up an extra hour would be all you'd need like people who mess their sleep schedule up normally. Much better imo if all the normal indicators for sleep schedule is working normally but their body reacts slow to it (by up to a day lag). That would also mean that moving countries wouldn't work but initially I assumed it was magic when I was writing my comment.

      It also makes long term human relationships much more feasible since you'll be together after some months or years at the most. Worse for two runners one who is 10 minutes ahead and the other who is 9 minutes 59 seconds ahead. Those guys will take forever to meet.

        >  It's not like most people are bang on 24 hours cycle

        Most people respond to external cues, and that syncs their cycle back. The runners don't respond to **any** cues so the extra 5 minutes keeps adding up.
        ```

        - u/RMcD94:
          ```
          Oh so nothing has changed about their cycle they've just become unable to fix their internal clock from eternal stimuli? 

          In that case I think they'd be off by far more than ten minutes a day. Look at mind field episode where he was trapped in unchanging room for three days, he was already twelve hours ahead internally.

          No one has done an extended version of that because it is torture but I wonder if it stabilises or if they stay awake for 6 hours and sleep for a few.

          Could try it with multiple people to dent the isolation effects. But they will take signals from each other.

          People can't predict how long they sleep for even one night without external cues
          ```

          - u/Tenoke:
            ```
            It's more like they are on a whole new cycle, governed by something internal. 

            It's sort of handwaved, but the most charitable interpretation is that the virus(or whatever causes it) has hijacked the system so rather than an external signal it uses some internal one (their 'inner sun'). In dark rooms the body still relies on external signals - they just never come.

            >No one has done an extended version of that because it is torture but I wonder if it stabilises or if they stay awake for 6 hours and sleep for a few.

            Typically they seem to extend their 'day-sleep' cycle to up to 48 hours, by sleeping more at once and being awake for longer.


            *_____ 10 minutes of reading later _____*


            Having said that, I just read [this wikipedia passage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm#Effect_of_light%E2%80%93dark_cycle) and I think the whole story is based on it, without realizing that the cycles often become hours longer, not just  minutes

            >The rhythm is linked to the light–dark cycle. Animals, including humans, kept in **total darkness for extended periods eventually function with a free-running rhythm**. Their sleep cycle is pushed back or forward each "day", depending on whether their "day", their endogenous period, *is shorter or longer than 24 hours*. The environmental cues that reset the rhythms each day are called **zeitgebers** (from the German, "time-givers")...

            >Free-running organisms that normally have one or two consolidated sleep episodes will still have them when in an environment shielded from external cues, but the rhythm is not entrained to the 24-hour light–dark cycle in nature. The sleep–wake rhythm may, in these circumstances, become out of phase with other circadian or ultradian rhythms such as metabolic, hormonal, CNS electrical, or neurotransmitter rhythms.

            So I think he read the '*is shorter or longer than 24 hours*' part (possibly even on the same wiki), and didn't dig into it to see that it's way more frequent for cycles to extend than to shorten and very frequent for the cycles to be longer by hours.

  That is a fantastic cover illustration for this story.

    I don't know. It and what Laura draws and says during the first scene made me think that the sun was literally up and Sam just couldn't perceive it due to some mental block.

    I get that Egan wanted a hook, but this makes the opening   unnecessarily disingenuous.

      I dunno, I never got the impression that the picture was literal. It's meant to convey a mood and idea, and it does that perfectly.

  Excellent.

  I was hoping until the end that the story will work well both on the personal+societal level and on the mystery level but that wasn't the case.

  I liked it but in retrospect, it feels like a very well written but simple execution of the premise.

    One thing that I like in Egan's work is that he takes care to try to make different philosophical beliefs about the world cash out in different predictions about reality.

  I really like it. My only question is why is the street light on during the day.
  ```

  - u/Tenoke:
    ```
    It represents that it's night outside but her sun is shining. It is a bit of an overkill to represent it both in what she draws and the sky though. More charitably, the total disconnect between different light sources and between the level of lights signifies that everything(one) is separate from the rest and operating on their own rules.
    ```

      Thanks. Turns out I'm a lost redditor. I thought I was in /r/ImaginarySliceOfLife and that this was just a picture, not a story. So I didn't even scroll down far enough to see the text after clicking the link.

        I like the art and idea of that sub. Thanks for the link.
