  If I had a nickel for every time a story involving hallucinatory cactus people was featured in this sub, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice.

    Huh. You missed either *Universal Love, Said the Cactus Person* or certain fun chapters of *Unsong* (admittedly by the same author).
    ```

    - u/Brassica_Rex:
      ```
      i didnt want to include both because one is a reference to the other and so it wouldnt really be fair to count both

  This is really good. Not exactly rational, but good. I'm getting Haruki Murakami vibes, like Hardboiled Wonderland and the End of the World vibes.

  - u/PeridexisErrant:
    ```
    As per the endnotes it's partly inspired by Ted Chiang's [*Hell is the absence of God*](https://www.google.com/search?q=hell+is+the+absence+of+god+ted+chiang), which has much the same flavor.  For a 'steel-manned' or more realistic version, I'd recommend reading CS Lewis' *The Great Divorce*.

      The story did not hold my attention. Perhaps it is because it is too similar to "Hell is the absence of God", and I've read that already.
      ```

  I was wondering from where I recognized the author's name--he translated the excellent Three-Body Problem.

  The whole time I was reading this was as unsettling and ominous as when I read Hell is the Absence of God. I'm not sure if it's the subject matter or the tone of the writing, but it speaks to the author's skill when awful events in the plot don't relieve the sensation of waiting for the other shoe to drop.

    If you liked this story Ken Liu has published several short story compilations with many gems like this one in them.
