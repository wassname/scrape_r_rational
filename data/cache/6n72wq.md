  This is a self-insert litRPG portal fantasy, and I would have made it a Groundhog Day loop if I thought I could fit that in.

  > loosely based on my personal experience of falling into a portal to another world and discovering that I had a character sheet attached to my soul. This story uses some custom CSS for the character sheet and definition tags to allow mouseover on various game terms

  I can tell I'm going to love this already.

  Update: Yep. Definitely enjoying this so far.

  [potentially spoiler-ish](#s " the character sheet text that's greyed out is unreadable without highlighting, which means it's completely unreadable on some mobile devices. The 'skills' listed show great promise. Reminds me of Erfworld (http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0001.html) a bit. Before Erfworld became a confusing series of huge text walls.")

    It's supposed to be "unreadable", i.e. unknown to the player but viewable by a sufficiently interested reader for a peek at what's ahead. More on that next chapter.

  Really enjoyable so far!  I'm curious to see how the main character's personal history will influence the story.

    Thanks! I don't for sure know how long this will go, but I'm hoping that the weaving of candid personal information and narrative is at least entertaining.

      It is.

  ```
  Worth noting that this work is now up to Chapter 5.

    Ch 6 should be up late tonight and I will make another post to the subreddit tomorrow morning. I'm writing fairly quickly and mod/community preference is to not have serial works posted more than once a week.

      Holy shit, you are awesome. I just read 1-5 and was going into withdrawal.
      ```

- u/Gauntlet:
  ```
  I'm enjoying it a lot. So far the world seems really well thought out and I'm enjoying the blending of Joop's reality with the fantasy world a lot more than I expected at the beginning.
