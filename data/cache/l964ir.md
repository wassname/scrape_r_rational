  while i think the chapter itself was well written, unless something comes directly from this it'd be more suited to an extra side-chapter like in PGTE. Then again idk if EE has a full-time job like SS does, and if so idk how much free time each has. (even if all were equal, can't fault someone for not writing faster than they're able)

    I wish of all these various fine asides that happened in Delve we narrowed down to just a few of the extra POVs. This was a fine chapter but if we don't shine a spotlight on these people again for another 20 it falls a bit flat in the larger scheme.

  Lovely chapter, but I do hope Rain-King and Amelia-Queen plus Ivan are keeping close by. Though they actually don't have enough firepower to protect the camp as well. Gar, Brovosi and Mr. Drill-a-man-from-behind could take the whole team out in five seconds. 

  And the whole Ascension camp in a minute. 
  Not that they have been given reason to escalate but if they feel backed in a corner/threaten/shamed, they can blast their way thru all of them without Amelia to stop them. (and Amelia is currently optimized for static D against monsters)

  They have an imperfect read on them. But Brovosi was the first person to instantly deduce that Rain must be a dynamo, because of his language acquisition, can see thru Ivan and doesn't even care to hide that fact.
  Rain's standoffish approach was foolish, he should just be inviting them over for drinks and make friends. 

  I don't really see how Rellagia could get by with unawakened formations and is not already conquered by the Empire.
  Exponential power scaling makes this seem not feasible.

    ```
    Between *themselves* Rellagia has a gentleman's agreement not to use Awakened in their militaries. But that doesn't mean that they can't use Awakened to defend against someone using Awakened to attack them. They may well have an Awakened Defense Force in waiting, for just such a contingency.

    ...*and* they probably have agreements with each other that, no matter the situation between themselves at the time, the moment an outsider tries to use Awakened in a military conflict without Cause, well, then that's Cause for *all* of their Awakened Defense Forces to *hammer* on the aggressor who broke the rules.
    ```

    - u/DoubleSuccessor:

      These aren't the kinds of agreements that actually last in real life between countries that aren't already friends anyway. The only real half-example we have of it is nuclear treaties, and it's not like countries don't obviously stockpile nuclear weapons to use against each other in case of emergency, instead of eschewing them altogether.
      ```

      - u/CCC_037:
        ```
        Oh, yeah. This whole not-using-Awakened-in-wars agreement sounds to me like something that can only happen between countries who are friends, and who only ever deploy their armies in the country-wide equivalent of brief sparring matches - that is, they'll all march out, yell at each other a bit, deal some survivable injuries to the other guys, then the generals all get together, decide who 'won' and make any appropriate minor tweaks to the official borders.

        It's *not* the sort of agreement you make with anyone who is *not* a friend.
        ```

      I suppose...but still, I feel like having a sneaky beacon providing buffs to unawakened soldiers would be brutally effective and hard to detect, unless there is a way to detect such a thing.
      ```

      - u/CCC_037:
        ```
        Maybe no-one thought of that.

        ...or maybe they did, and each country there has one of those guys ready as an ace-in-the-hole, for desperate times. ...only times have never quite got desperate *enough*, yet.
        ```

        - u/zombieking26:
          ```
          There's absolutely no way that no one thought of it.

          Ans I don't mean it as an ace in the whole thing, I meant it like someone granting a 25% strength buff that the opponents can't see.
          ```

            You underestimate bad writing!
            ```

      - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
        ```
        Mana sight should detect that.
        ```

    - u/DavidGretzschel:
      ```
      Ah yeah, that could work really well.  
      This probably could also limit any conventional military conflict from escalating into a total war or a genocidal campaign.
      ```
