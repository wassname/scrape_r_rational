## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  How would you reconstruct [Evil is One Big, Happy Family](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsOneBigHappyFamily)? I'll focus on the superhero genre, but feel free to reconstruct it in other fictions. 

  The trope where evil characters recognize themselves as being villains, and despite having a variety of ideological, personal, and cultural differences, the villains see themselves as being on the same team, as having natural kinship with other villains. This happens even when their goals don't align and they lack similarities aside from being designated evil.

  If you have your villains working together for practical reasons, then this trope isn't in effect. They also can't share a worldview, unless that worldview is capital-E Evil, opposing righteousness through a variety of means. 

  It's easy to *de*construct since even cruel and/or self-interested people don't usually identify as evil (at least they don't wear it as a badge), and villains who are willing to see themselves as genuinely evil don't necessarily imagine themselves on the same side as other people considered evil, unless there are more concrete things tying them together.

    Sure... it's *easier* to accomplish narratively if there's a charismatic leader, or critical mass group trying to convince everyone that those who oppose the status quo are natural allies. Your mileage may vary on how much you consider this a "cohesive non-evil worldview"/goal alignment. 

    But it could pretty realistically just be an equilibrium. In the above case or as an equilibrium, they could each have distinct, primary driving goals that nevertheless benefit from the weakening or overburdening of the society's protective institutions. If I'm just robbing a bank and you're over there eating people's faces, I'm not gonna come mess with things while the police try and stop you. Likewise, if I just want to practice mad science in peace (legitimately, mind you! For the good of human kind! THEY CAN'T COMPREHEND MY BRILLIANCE AND THAT'S THE ONLY REASON THEY WANT TO INTERFERE!) it's to my benefit that there are more attention-grabbing psychos around to keep the police from looking for something to investigate and realizing bodies are missing. 

    In practice, having protective institutions aligned against Evil makes it more likely that Evil will consider itself a "side", because the enemy of my enemy is my friend. In universes with superhero protectors, a Justice League or whatever, it's therefore almost a foregone conclusion that they'd consider alignment.

    The institutions and rules almost force Evil to align if they can't accomplish a goal on their own. I need some muscle or protection for a job--what am I gonna do, go ask some civilian to work with me? No, I need people who I know are willing to do things that society considers "wrong". Maybe I don't like those people--maybe I think that unlike me, they ARE wrong! I mean, face eating!--but the more repressive the society, the fewer options I have.

    The Good Heroes are powerful.

    No, wait, that doesn't get the full effect across.

    The Good Heroes are ***powerful***.

    That's better.

    One-on-one, Team Good can take out pretty much *any* other team, flat-out. Team Good could take out *all* the Evil guys at once, as long as they work together.

    However, at the same time, Team Good can only be in one place at a time.

    So. In this world, there are two sorts of Evil. The first sort is the sort known as the Loners. The Loners are Evil Villains who like to go it *alone*.

    They get very promptly wiped out by Team Good.

    The *other* sort of Evil are the Team Players. They work well with other Evil groups, as long as their goals do not *directly* conflict.

    The only reason that the Team Players are still around is that they all communicate with each other. And Team Good knows that if they stomp on one of the Team Players, then yes, they will win - but only after a drawn-out battle. And the *rest* of the Team Players will descend on the Innocent Village while Team Good is out defeating that *one* group of villains.

    So the Team Players survive.

    And in this way, before too long, the Team Players are the *only* villains left. They're one big, happy family...

    I would say this is likely a combination of a sharply polarized population with two common but completely different views on morality which is then combined with a protagonist or unreliable narrator who can't recognize the distinction between 'different' and 'evil'.

  I'm thinking of starting a Rational!RWBY fix, since no one seems to have done it yet (to my satisfaction at least).

  Does anyone have any glaring plot holes that they want to see addressed? 

  I'll go first: (spoiler tagged just in case)

  * >!In the latest season, it's revealed that Ozpin's cane holds a store of kinetic energy he's accumulated over multiple lifetimes. I don't see why he held back on using that when he fought and died to Cinder during the fall of Beacon Academy. !<

  * Jaune should never have been permitted into Beacon. 

  * >!Adam should never have tried to blow up Mistral Academy. It's an empty building that's already owned by an ally. It doesn't help the White Fang. Even then, he never should have been foiled by sudden Faunus from Haven. It's the teleporting dragons from Game of Thrones all over again, there no way the distance should be crossed so quickly and conveniently. !<

  * Awakening someone's aura should have some sort of drawback, or else there's literally no reason not to do it for other people. Remnant is a deathworld filled with monsters, an unlocked aura could easily save lives. Even if training is required to use it well, it still heals people automatically.

  My idea is that an unlocked aura attracts Grimm to the individual. Aura is the light of the soul, and Grimm already hate humanity. An unlocked aura should thus make humans shine "brighter" to Grimm. This also means that unlocking aura for the general populace would be disastrous, as it'd massively increase Grimm attacks for relatively little gain. Thus, someone having an unlocked aura but not training to be a huntsman would be seen as a massive burden on society and widely looked down on by others. 

  * >!Characters conveniently forget when they have abilities applicable to situations. Team RWBY manages to fall into an endless void when two of them can outright fly. !< 

  * >!Mobilizing a giant mecha to fight individual huntsman you dislike is a terrible waste of resources and simply isn't justified imo. !<

  * >!No way Penny should be so easily hacked, she is military hardware. And even once she was hacked, why not return her to Pietro to unhack her? Why gamble on using an unknown artifact to cure her? !< 

  * >!Adam and Ironwood in general. !<

  And that's just what I can think of for now...

    As someone who reads a lot of RWBY fanfiction, but thinks the show itself is quite bad this is very intriguing to me. I'll try to give a semi comprehensive list of parts of the show I have issues with.  


    * First Volume:
       * Jaune not knowing about Aura and the lack of reasons not to unlock it are giant plotholes that have just never been addressed as you pointed out.
       * I agree Jaune should have never made it to Beacon. To follow up on that, he should have been so miserably behind that he could never have possibly caught up at the most elite combat school in the world. You can't just do a few weeks/months of hard training and catch up with people who have been training for half their lives like that. If you want to keep him around for some reason, come up with a good reason Ozpin would let him in despite him being worthless or buff him.
       * The team selection is fun, but extremely irrational. Almost any other method would probably create better balanced teams than what we see in the show. A rational Ozpin would come up with something else, or be manipulating the results behind the scenes to produce teams he thinks are good.
       * Also Blake is just kind of hugely awkward. A rational Ozpin would probably take more precautions with a known former terrorist than we see in the show. She'd also obviously change her last name at least. 
       * The team conflict is swept under the rug a bit too easily. Weiss pivots on a dime with one inspiring speech to unquestionably support a leader who she has legitimate complaints about. (Don't get me wrong, I like Ruby, she does have flaws from a leadership standpoint though.)
       * The bullying arc... ugh. What a disaster.
       * Weiss/Blake conflict. Another situation that resolves too easily.
       * The docks and Torchwick. This should tie more into the overarching V1-3 plot. As is its a really bad look for Torchwick/The White Fang that random students mess them up so badly, and the stealing dust plot goes nowhere in the show itself.
    * Second Volume:
       * God damn Emerald. She breaks the world in half. The fact that no one anywhere has something like Worm's Master/Stranger protocols is a massive worldbuilding fail. She either needs a power nerf, or the world needs to be massively overhauled to rationally respond to the existence of people like her. 
       * Students running off to fight terrorists is just... I don't know. I'm not sure how you can rationally solve this without just scrapping the Beacon arc almost entirely. (Which I think wouldn't be a bad idea.) Not to mention the massive collateral damage they cause and get off scot free for. Also just not Torchwick's style up to this point.
       * The dance arc... well I definitely didn't personally like it. It actually rubbed me extremely the wrong way when both Ruby and Blake were pressured into it and too conform. That might be my personal bias though.
       * Cinder's "infiltration." Its absolutely absurd that she was caught in the act, but then nothing was done about the virus she planted. Also the security was just god awful.
       * Again, students should not be sent on a "training" mission to hunt down terrorists without a damn good reason. That they would try and do it anyway is not a good reason. 
       * RUBY SHOULD NOT BE THAT INCOMPETENT WITH JUST HER FISTS. This annoys me so much. If she's is strong enough to swing Crescent Rose around like she does, she would have to be ridiculously buff. Even with almost no training she should be able to punch damn hard, especially against the pathetic white fang grunts who don't even seem like they have aura. Its also absurd that she is so clueless when her father and sister are both fist fighters and she has trained with them a lot.
       * The Breach was weird, pointless, and no one in universe seemed to care. This should be a big damn deal, but its just kind of forgotten after the finale and never comes up again.
    * Third Volume:
       * Just in general the Ozluminati is hilariously incompetent and moronic.
       * The tournament is weirdly setup and makes basically no sense. Its a tournament though so they can kind of get away with it.
       * Do something else with Winter. Her first impression of slapping her sister then getting into a destructive fight only to be immediately yeeted for 4 volumes is terrible. What the hell were they thinking?
       * The Schnee semblance is weird, and the fact that its just randomly hereditary unlike every other semblance is a bit of a worldbuilding fail. Semblances in general just make no impact on the worldbuilding when they should be hugely influential.
       * Both the defenders and the attackers should be massively buffed in competence. 
       * Probably should rework the maidens. A rational Ozpin would have never created them as they exist in the show in the first place. The vaults are also weird and don't make a whole lot of sense.
       * God damn Atlas is horribly incompetent. I know Fascist governments tend to be a pack of morons run by the lowest common denominator, but come on. 
       * Basically I have nothing good to say about the second half of this volume. I know most people loved it, and maybe it kind of works on an emotional level, maybe. It doesn't redeem the clown fiesta of nonsense it represents in my opinion.
    * Fourth Volume:
       * Just what is this. Volume 4 and 5 are a giant waste of space. What a disaster. Definitely the worst volumes of RWBY.
       * So yeah Salem. I guess this is as good a time as any to get into a critique of the Grimm in general. In most of the show Grimm basically exist to be meaningless chaff the heroes style on with cool animation. They just don't feel threatening at all. Any real fight is going to be against a human enemy, which is just massively wasteful of their potential. That said, how the hell has Salem not won already? Not only has she not won, Humans have goddamned flourished. They have setup a technological civilization with rough parity with modern Earth in a world full of Eldritch monsters. It baffles me that in the show they can act like Grimm are a threat at all with the context of how well humans have done. Either Grimm should be less threatening than they have ever been at any point in history, or humans should have lost already. If Salem is capable of challenging the civilization we see in the show in the slightest, then she would have easily annihilated a less modern civilization. This whole disaster mess of worldbuilding should be completely redesigned in my opinion. Don't even get me started on how trivial it should be to get around Salem's vaunted immortality.

    Honestly I'm going to stop there. I don't see much point in going on harping on individual plot points any further. Any rational rewrite that gets this far is necessarily going to look completely different I think. Also I'm kind of tired of going on writing more atm haha. If you want more of my ranting/feedback on my problems with later volumes feel free to tell me and I'll write it out later.

  Please suggest ridiculous political parties which could exist within a high magic fantasy universe. No wrong answers, and petty disagreements are preferred over practical policy concerns.
  ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    - **Heaven**: Actually a group of lawful-good-aligned Clerics who have decided to try to push the will of their gods through the political process. Their major aim is to set up the rules in such a way as to encourage people to be good. Slogan: "Do The Right Thing"
    - **Hell**: A group of lawful-evil-aligned Clerics who saw the Heaven party and decided to have a go at trying things their way, instead. Slogan: "When We Come Out On Top, You'll Appreciate Having Helped Us"
    - **The Eldritch Brotherhood Of The Eastern Star**: A group of mages who have not yet mastered the art of speaking in short sentences. Very much in favour of more attention being paid to the development of theoretical magic. Known for their multisyllabic public statements, and their intense opposition to the next group. Slogan: "The Optimal Choice For Your Vote Is The Eldritch Brotherhood Of The Eastern Star"
    - **The Eldritch Brotherhood Of The Western Star**: To most people, this party and the above party are virtually indistinguishable. They are both similarly long-winded, similarly unable to shut up, and similarly interested in the advancement of theoretical magic. However, both parties absolutely *hate* each other, and completely refuse to work together (apparently it has to do with some obscure differences in magical theory that one has to be a highly-trained mage to even *notice*). Slogan: "The Advancement Of Magic As Exemplified By The Eldritch Brotherhood Of The Western Star Will Always Be The Optimal Choice"
    - **The Society For The Betterment Of The Realm**: An Elf-supremacist party. Is in favour of denying the vote to gnolls (along with goblins, dwarves, humans, and everyone else who is not an elf, but they're trying to get the ball rolling by just cutting out gnolls for the moment). Slogan: "A Long Life For Long-Term Aims"
    - **Party Name Here**: A party that consists entirely of a single golem, designed by a wizard who was told to "get me control over the country". Runs every year on the understanding that, if elected, he will immediately abdicate in favour of the Black Wizard Alf the Mad. Does not care that Alf the Mad has been dead for several decades now. Never gains more than a scattering of votes, but stubbornly runs again every single year. Slogan: "Vote For Party Name Here"
    ```

  - u/Norseman2:
    ```
    * **The Antidivinationist Party:** Well known for their flyers and cartoons which mock diviners as being perverts who walk around cities with one hand down their pants to stroke themselves off. Generally casts diviners as peeping toms, busybodies, eavesdroppers, thought police, liars, and perverts. Passes and proposes legislation restricting legal uses of divination as well as limiting access to supplies and training required for divination. Their opposition portrays them as a party which 'mysteriously' has a lot of support from some very wealthy and powerful people. Campaign slogan: "They're looking at your children right now!"

    * **The "Party Party":** Best known for their drug-fueled raves, orgies, and wild parties which generally involve large amounts of alcohol, psychedelic mushrooms, and a 'fuckload of hella trippy illusions'. Popular among illusionists and enchanters, though all walks of life may be found in the Party Party. Passes and proposes legislation which advances sexual freedom, access to birth control, freedom to use drugs, illusions, and mind-altering enchantments, as well freedom to summon creatures for prurient or mind-altering purposes. Opposition parties often portray them as stoners who can be found drunkenly bleating at sheep in the wee hours of the morning. They do not argue with this portrayal. Campaign slogan: "Fuck us or fuck off!"

    **The Chaos Order:** 

    A while ago, wizards got together and decided that they really, *really* don't like when religious folks use the power of their Gods to perform future-telling magic such as prophecy, precognition, or future divination which is unavailable to mere mortal spellcasters. They saw this as unfair, deterministic, and generally believe that knowing the future is a violation of free will. To fix this issue, the wizards discovered that sources of extremely raw chaos could butterfly future events today, but only if that chaos is introduced at a high enough level. 

    Because of this, the Chaos Order maintains a small but consistent voter base among wizards who ensure that one of their own sits in the council/senate/congress. This single representative abstains from all policy decisions and votes; they simply occasionally yell random words or perform random actions while politics is in session. Others find this annoying, yes, but this small introduction of a chaotic element at the highest level of power is enough to butterfly away even divine precognition for longer timespans.

    ```
    **Neighbour Party**: Very concerned with making sure that everybody has good neighbors, which entails (1) entrenching the rights and powers of (or, if need be, inventing) homeowner's associations and (2) making sure that everyone has a horse, because that necessarily means that everyone has horses for neighbors (and as everybody knows, horses are perfect neighbors). Very NIMBY, except where horses are concerned, and would like to ban glue factories, violins, and certain paintbrushes. Often just called "Neighbour."
