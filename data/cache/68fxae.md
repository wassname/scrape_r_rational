  One of the things that's always bugged me about this show is how it contrives reasons to push the "immortality is inherently bad and inhuman" aesop. "oh no you'd better not try to be immortal or you'll turn into a scorpion monster and eat people for some goddamn reason"

  It's hypocritical as fuck coming from the Doctor, too. He's always the one getting all upset at the slightest hint that humans might have found a way to not die. In this episode he set out to put a stop to it *even before he knew about the scorpion monster part.* Buddy, if being mortal is so great, maybe you should precommit to killing yourself in 80 years? No? Why not?
  ```

  - u/Arandur:
    ```
    Immortality is only for Time Lords. If humans became immortal, then whence their inferiority? Got to maintain the status quo. And if you have a time machine, you can very easily maintain the status quo everywhen at once.
    ```

    - u/CeruleanTresses:
      ```
      Pretty much, yet the Doctor always puts on this show of envying our mortality. "Oh, that's what makes you human, that's what makes you special, I hate myself and my eternal existence is a curse etc etc etc" But his words are so obviously hollow, since he has the option of dying at any time and chooses not to take it.
      ```

      - u/Arandur:
        ```
        I don't really think he's consciously aware of his superiority complex. I think he doesn't want humans to change because he likes them the way they are. You know... like a pet. 

        Actually, it reminds me of what the families of trans people say when they indicate a desire to transition. "Oh, but you're great just the way you are! You don't need to change! Just learn to love yourself!"
        ```

        - u/CeruleanTresses:
          ```
          That's a great way of looking at it and lends him some more character depth. I wish they'd make that more explicit in the show, have him get called out for it properly, instead of defaulting to portraying his anti-immortality speeches as timeless wisdom.

          Unless they have actually called him out on it lately? I haven't seen any episodes since that _fucking_ season finale with Missy. God that pissed me off on so many levels. Cheap, lazy, and honestly offensive writing.
          ```

          - u/Arandur:
            ```
            I haven't watched it since well before that. And I don't think that the writers share our viewpoint, so the prospect of seeing that kind of commentary seems rather unlikely to be.
            ```

      - u/TheUtilitaria:

        The interesting thing about this is that the 10th doctor **is** blindly attached to his own life. Unlike all the other doctors he's terrified that regeneration means real death and his last words are 'I don't want to go'. The War, 9th and 11th Doctors were serene or cheerful at the very end (as were most of the classic Doctors), while 10 was bitter and angry. He agonises to Wilf about how the next doctor won't really be him in End of Time. He's vain (according to his own words as 11), and thinks his personality is unique. He cheated regeneration, using up a remaining life to prolong his own in the S4 finale.

        **Reading between the lines, the Doctor is probably as afraid of death as Lazarus and I can't help but think this scene is him trying to cover up his own cognitive dissonance.**
        ```

        - u/DaystarEld:

          10th was my favorite doctor for many reasons, and his flaws were one of them. 

          Also the actor is amazing. That scene you mentioned with Wilfred, when the 10th Doctor was sitting across from him in the diner, and explaining what being "immortal" is like for Time Lords:

          >I can still die. If I'm killed before regeneration, then I'm dead. Even then, even if I change, it feels like dying. Everything I am dies. Some new man goes sauntering away... and I'm dead.

          The look on his face, his tone of voice... David Tennant is such an amazing actor that he made me look at someone in his mid 30s sitting side by side someone in his 60s, and believe that the younger man was hundreds of years older.
          ```

    Exactly, he looks like a total hypocrite in this scene and I don't think the writers even appreciate the irony
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    That pretty much sums up my feelings about Doctor Who and its blatant hypocrisy, yeah.

    Mind, it is canon that, "You spent a billion years evolving into downloads" *at some point*.  The question might be at what point within human history that all happened, and what that meant for civilization.  I could see the Doctor going full Culture and saying we need to achieve some level of enlightenment or sanity before being able to handle immortality.

  >No, Doctor, *avoiding* death is being human. It's our strongest impulse - to cling to life with every fiber of being.

  I really like that quote in particular.
  ```

  - u/TheUtilitaria:
    ```
    Lazarus was supposed to be a selfish maniac villain of the week, but he's actually a tragic, Quirrell-style fallen rationalist hero that the Doctor is too stupid to really understand. The whole scene reminds me of Harry and Dumbledore talking past each other in HPMOR, except it somehow got written that way by accident

      In other words, [the strawman had a point](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanHasAPoint).

      It even has an entry on *Doctor Who*, albeit not on the Lazarus episode in particular. Perhaps add it in?

- u/TheUtilitaria:
  ```
  Yes, he's the designated bad guy and he's killed a few people, but you can't help but feel sorry for him anyway and realize the Doctor's arrogance and hypocrisy. Lazarus wanted to save everyone's life and defeat death after some horrible childhood experience seeing people vapourised around him during the Blitz, then the experiment goes slightly wrong, forces him to kill others to stay alive, and the Doctor shows up to gloat right before murdering him.
  ```

  - u/TheUtilitaria:
    ```
    I suspect the murderous instincts were part of the whole scorpion monster thing, and that it wasn't Lazarus doing it entirely of his own free will, which makes his story all the more tragic. And this *was* significant progress just like Lazarus said. You don't give up on a Jesus machine like his just because of fatalities in the first round of human trials - you work around the bugs.

        Scorpions are bugs though? The common usage of bug doesn't mean insect, it's all land arthropods.

  OMG I'm starting to hate it when writers try to make their story sound deep and meaningful because they seem to almost always end up spewing crap like this.

  Why are the rationalist-analogue characters always portrayed as the villains or as dumb sidekicks.

  Like it's not like most people have a deep seated prejudicial hatred of rationalists. Most people probably don't even know what a rationalist is. But shows like this try to appeal to a wider audience, and I don't see why they would need to always make straw-man rationalist analogue characters to knock down if there wasn't a common deep-seated prejudicial hatred of rationalists.

  I just don't get it.

    >Why are the rationalist-analogue characters always portrayed as the villains or as dumb sidekicks.

    Suppose there are a series of tropes. Some are rational, some are not. The rational ones are accepted by everyone. The irrational ones are accepted by non-rationalists, who non-critically accept tropes.

    Since stories are based on conflict, when there are irrational tropes, they are assigned to the protagonist and the antagonist is assigned the contrary *rational* point of view. We pay more attention to this because no one likes their ideas being associated with the bad guys.

    When the trope is rational, it still gets assigned to the protagonist, and that's when we get irrational antagonists. People here are less bothered by irrational antagonists because, after all, they're the bad guys who lose in the end.
    ```

    - u/Sailor_Vulcan:
      ```
      That seems like a lazy way to design an antagonist and a protagonist and make them fight. Wouldn't making them on more equal footing in their own kind of strength make more sense? A story about two supergeniuses or two superpowered warriors fighting each other is more entertaining than a story about a superpowered warrior fighting a supergenius with the help of his smart friend. Like for instance in the sonic the hedgehog franchise, it seems overwhelmingly obvious that either metal sonic should have been the main antagonist, or tails the fox should have been the main protagonist. Tails vs Robotnik and Sonic vs Metal Sonic would make for much more interesting stories then Sonic vs Robotnik with Metal Sonic as a minor antagonist and Tails as a sidekick. And yet no one ever notices this. *EVER*.

      So why would the writers choose Sonic vs Robotnik over Sonic vs Metal Sonic or Tails vs Robotnik? Clearly this is some sort of pattern, the choice of conflict is too consistent across too many stories for it to be mere coincidence. I just don't know why they always get written like that. It shouldn't be any easier to think of Sonic vs Robotnik than Sonic vs Metal Sonic or Tails vs Robotnik. I'm pretty sure that if a random person who wasn't absorbing irrational warrior hero vs evil science guy stories all their life, who knew nothing about Sonic the Hedgehog at all was told that Robotnik was the main antagonist then they learned about all the other characters, they would think that Tails was the Protagaonist. Likewise with Sonic if they were told that Metal Sonic was the main antagonist.

      Do writers think Sonic vs Robotnik will appeal more to readers for some reason? If so what is that reason, and if not why do writers keep choosing to make less interesting conflicts?

    It’s also frustratingly common in anime titles. It’s like if they need to introduce a character that’s [supposed](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute) to be clever they just look at the “How to produce a generic anime” flowchart and see that the next step should be making that character spew some random “philosophical” (and\or cynical) sounding nonsense.

    >Why are the rationalist-analogue characters always portrayed as the villains or as dumb sidekicks.

    1) In general, a rational character would be making at least some decisions that would not go well (or would be perceived as evil) with the general audience, because the audience itself isn’t rational (or is even irrational — which is often the case with Doctor Who, for example). And since the audience identifies itself as “the goodies”, the rat!char automatically slides into being the baddie. 

    2) [Tvtropes.org/TVGenius](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVGenius) + [Tvtropes.org/BrainsEvilBrawnGood](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainsEvilBrawnGood)

      With a charismatic enough protagonist, you can get the audience to root for basically anything. See most italian-mafia movies, most heist movies, the matrix movies, etc.

    - u/Sailor_Vulcan:
      ```
      So it's not an explicit prejudice against rationalists, the prejudice is implied by their not wanting to see themselves as the bad guys? That sounds like kind of a stretch. Surely the general audience understands the concept of a relatable or sympathetic villain, and knows that sometimes people in the ingroup can do bad things too. The idea that "someone who is like me but who isn't me can make these sorts of mistakes and end up as the bad guy of someone else's story" should be common knowledge among everyone, or at least all adults. I mean, if the Sword of Good were turned into a movie, would a general audience hate it because [spoiler](#s "the irrational warrior protagonist who they relate to turns out to be the accidental bad guy")?

    Sometimes I think it's that people are inherently far too morally and spiritually *clinging* to their magical thoughts, and seriously feel *harmed* by having to take the Enlightenment side in [Enlightenment vs Romanticism](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticismVersusEnlightenment).

    Then I usually wonder if that's a sign we're living in a dangerously reactionary, irrationalist culture and there's some horrific tragedy coming in which the sheer chaos of uncontrolled, undisciplined irrationality will vomit itself out as mass death.

    I mean, it's not like recent events have falsified that hypothesis.

          Or they could have just waited five years and taken a ship to Britain, then met the Doctor in 1930s London instead of 1920s New York, thus avoiding all the temporal weirdness.

            Yeah, that whole thing was super contrived. Moffat-era Who in general was really overwrought and disappointing considering what classics his individual episodes were in the Davies era.
