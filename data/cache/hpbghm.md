## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You are an anartist, you create anomalous art using something called [flow](http://www.scp-wiki.net/flow-hub).

  Periodically, in the course of creating artwork, you tap into something greater than yourself in the form of some emotion, sentiment, idea, or concept that you wish to communicate to an audience.  Your artwork then gains supernatural effects according to what you are trying to communicate.  Your artwork retains these effects as long as it is periodically interacted with in a way that lets it continue to communicate the original intent behind it.  When placed in a context where the art's message becomes sufficiently different, its powers may change.

  With practice you can exert some control over how the art's power manifests, although it is still a largely uncontrolled process.  You can try to create practical working art pieces, but you need to have an artistic message behind it, the exact power is difficult to control, its power may change over time, and you need to give the art regular interaction that supports its message.  So for instance, if you wanted a classic, useful magic item, such as a "bag-of-holding" you would first need artistic skill in the relevant areas (leather-work or fabric or fashion) and you would need a message... perhaps a statement about the bottomless desire of consumerism.  It would take some skill to get the power to come out right and practical, and it might have any number of quirks corresponding to the message driving the power.  If the bag-of-holding communicated the endless desire of consumerism, it might compel you to regularly fill it with new purchases, or it might be literally bottomless, with some additional artifice required to retrieve objects tossed into it, or it might teleport objects stored into it back into your dwelling place instead of storing them.

  You will find your powers grow as you effect more people with your art and the more powerfully you affect them.  You will also find yourself skilled at making use of other types of magic and anomalies... but primarily in re-purposing them into artwork.  You might also develop a sixth sense for anomalies over time.  Your ability to produce anomalous is also connected to your sense of passion and creativity, uninspired artwork is likely not to have any anomalous effects.  Repeatedly producing identical anomalous art pieces is all but impossible they will either not have anomalous effects (if you are bored) or you will find the powers differ unpredictably and possibly dangerously (if you do manage to retain your passion while churning out copies.)

  You have only recently gained these powers.  Another anartist recognizes what you are and gives you a few warnings.  Powerful government organizations will seek to conceal and suppress your anomalous artwork and detain you or possibly even kill you.  Collectors of the supernatural will try to buy your artwork at barely any markup (compared to non-anomalous art) and then resell it for much higher prices... and will resort to threats of violence to get you to sell and they have been rumored to engage in kidnapping and trafficking of anomalous artwork.  Other anartists often lose sight of their morality and will create artwork with dangerous effects.

  Ideas for useful/practical magic items, knowing the limitations in practical applications?

  Ideas for artwork that can fly under the radar in terms of avoiding the wrong kinds of attention, while still having enough effect on people to grow your power?

    Consider making internet memes.

    * They don't require any purchases to make, while you could be tracked down using the physical components of a material art piece
    * They are easier to publish anonymously, using TOR for example, rather than having to go through fallible middlemen and proxies
    * It is accepted that people will share memes to wider audiences, so their propagation will earn you plenty of attention without seeming implausible to those with the desire to contain you

    In terms of the artistic message, consider a broad topic like "We all see the world differently" which should hopefully constrain the anomalous effects to the subjective and could be passed off as unusual but mundane quirks of neuroscience. Examples of what you could aim for are That Dress, the McCollough effect, and Scissor Statements.

    EDIT: Once you've developed your talents as an artist enough, your next step should probably be to gather information, perhaps with a website that draws people in to reveal the most important secret they know as a commentary on the anonymity and exhibitionism of the internet. Your sense for the anomalous might help you pick out the truth from the confessions you collect. 

    There's clearly more to the world than what the public is aware of, so it stands to reason that you're similarly ignorant of important facts that you should know before pursuing your next course of action. For example, if you could create an anomalous reality anchor with a global scale, would that save or doom humanity? Are there aliens out there that also deserve moral weight? Is there an afterlife?

    Road trip and putting graffiti all across America in places that are a tourist attraction due to being graffiti attractions.  Tree in the forest type thing. Gain power from however long it isn't covered up (may be watched by hostile entities)

    There's also the option of joining the dark side and making a self replicating monstrosity that 

    1. Imprints itself into the views mind (when they are not you).

    2. Give the urge to have the viewer replicate the art piece N number of days after viewing it.

    2.5. Or show someone the original work.

    3. Showing friends and or family the fresh memetic hazard

    4. Instills complete loyalty to the creator of the original art creation.

    Though someone's probably tried and failed at such a venture and has as such ruined the effectiveness of that tactic.

    Dance is art so maybe dance to have specific effects happen? Become a YouTube dancer that has 'editing' effects happen in their videos? Plenty of power through the views.

    Take up pottery and or metalworking to make unique one time charms that'll grant a 'Somebody else's problem' field around yourself. Changing it up to apathy, avoidance, forgetfulness and various other mind altering effects once the first charm loses it's juice. After enough time has passed they could be remade as they'd be novelty in making something old but with a new twist to it.

    Perhaps coding is art and as such maybe a code that infects every camera to not register you on screens. It'll always be interacted with because depend where you are in the world there's bound to be a camera that has you on screen somewhere.

    Hymns.

    You have strong control over both the context (people frequently sing from hymnals but almost never use them as napkins) and meaning of the artwork (you literally get to write out exactly what you mean). The cultural context of religious artwork would mean a strong background of supposed miracles for camouflage as well as an incentive for the religious community itself to popularize and spread your art while maintaining the appropriate religious context surrounding it and supernatural collectors are unlikely to bother extorting you for your art when a copy can be obtained simply by attending your church and having it handed to them by a smiling deacon, free of charge.

    As for the actual content, I am tempted to crib some imagery from [James Russell Lowell](https://www.bartleby.com/42/805.html):

    "Careless seems the great Avenger; history’s pages but record	   
    One death-grapple in the darkness ’twixt old systems and the Word;	  
    Truth forever on the scaffold, Wrong forever on the throne,—	  
    Yet that scaffold sways the future, and, behind the dim unknown,	  
    Standeth God within the shadow, keeping watch above his own."
    ```

  I'm reading *The Long Dark Teatime of the Soul* (a Dirk Gently book) and there's two very interesting, inconsequential-seeming powers in the book that I thought might be interesting:

  - A woman who recites yesterday's stock market prices. Essentially, she's doing the work of a live stock market ticker but with a 24 hour delay. 

  - A man who says what Liam Neeson is about to say, so maybe one second in advance. He cannot say anything else. [and in the book the celebrity was someone else who I forget]

  Yesterday's stock market ticker seems profoundly useless, and while  you could take  advantage of the liam neeson prophet by getting Liam to say things in response to other things (not that you necessarily have the access or the power to do that), the one second in advance thing plus it depending on people speaking makes it profoundly difficult to take advantage of. 

  Yeah, either one of these could win a supernatural challenge prize, but I don't have ideas for how to use it beyond that as they both seem so pointless.

  I haven't finished the book so if these two characters (that I think were throwaways) actually do use their unique talents to save the day, no spoilers!
  ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    Assuming you can get your hands on Liam Nelson, you can shave down the delay by electrically inducing Liam to speak (or at least groan) and then monitoring the activity of the speech muscles of the precog. You still only get ~1 seconds of precognition and only one bit of information (maybe a few more if you have very fine-grained control of the muscles). 

    But, maybe you can back-chain. Make Liam groan if Russia declares nuclear war **or** the precog starts groaning. That lets you instantly answer questions from as far into the future as you can keep the two men alive and wired up. And you can ask multiple questions to get multiple bits of information (though learning one answer could potentially compromise the previous ones). Pretty OP.

    No idea about ticker price woman. If only she had been born before the telegraph...

      I love that the answer starts with "assuming you can get your hands on Liam Neeson" and ends with having two men chained to beds for the rest of their natural life.

    It's a long shot, but worth checking if either of then violates the speed-of-light limit. That one I can see Douglas Adams using, even. There's a joke like this in Terry Pratchett.

  In a modern-day setting:

  You're a mobster. You were hired by someone you think is the government to get in contact with any superpowered individual in a city. You did encounter a specific superhero while they were out of costume, and you successfully seduced the superhero for an evening's paid sex work in costume. You got the proof of contact that your contact wished for, and your contact pays you your reward, which does barely cover what you paid the superhero.

  It's a week later.

  The superhero has probably changed their alter ego's phone number and haircut.

  In a modern-equivalent setting, how might you find them again?
  ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    Where did you encounter them and where did you go to have sex? Is it plausible that the hero will be there again in the near future, in or out of costume, for the same reasons?

    If the costume was more than, like, a ski mask, presumably it exists so that people can recognise it and have continuity with previous interactions. What do they do with this public identity? Join a group? Claim authority over a territory? Put up or reply to classified ads? Pay taxes? Much depends on how exactly masked heroes are integrated in society, in your setting.

    ~~Is it set in the future? We're well on track for universal facial recognition (and costume recognition), and that's without tinkertech. Depends on how secure all this data is though; may or may not be in reach of a mobster.~~ e: sorry, missed the "modern-day".
    ```

    - u/red_adair:
      ```
      The mobster encountered the superhero at an anime con in the city's convention center; they had sex in a hotel room. The convention center is at a stop on the major hub. I like what you're suggesting about revisiting the convention center. At the very least, the alter ego will probably visit the con again the next year. There might be another anime-related con at the convention center between this con and its repetition next year.

      The superhero's empowered appearance is partly an aspect of their power; it doesn't look too much like their alter ego except in terms of height and gait-recognition cameras.

      I really haven't thought about what use this superhero and their associates have put their powers to, yet. I know that they're public enough to be identifiable as specific superheroes, but I don't have a good idea of what a bunch of post-college rogues would do as capes.
      ```

  - u/Trew_McGuffin:

    Basically stalk their superhero persona. If they go into a building it either means they mix with the populace of the building or there's an alternative exit. Find the other exit (tunnel, teleportation device, etc) and access it. 

    If they mix with the crowd then compare their heights, general shape of their face.

    If they go out into the middle of nowhere it'll be easier and harder as they'll probably be the only person there but they'll most likely have a form of surveillance that'll let them know someone is around.

    There's also the option of tracing the origin of  the maybe defunct number. Find the carrier and access their records for the number, it'd probably give a name and maybe a address. It could be done through accessing major carriers and seeing if the number was in their logs. Or calling the carrier and posing as the hero's alter ego.

    If they move too fast to be followed by foot or car then investing in drones and having said drones follow. If that's too risk or obvious then slowly plotting out where they generally arrive from while a crime happens in the same area could help sort out where to go. If they teleport or travel from far away really fast the plan is a bust.

    But above all call the number first before doing any investigative work. Because they only MAY have changed it, at least going off the prompt.

    All in all kind of interested but uncomfortable about the whole having a sexual service with a hero but the implication that it was recorded and then handed off to an unknown entity and for some reason there's a drive to find them once more a week later.

    All the while there was access/knowledge of their phone number which was presumably given freely but then wasn't used for a week.

    All in all it makes me feel icky but so very curious to see where it'd all end up.
