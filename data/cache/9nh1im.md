  >My sigil, huh. That was one way to call the gathering throng of the desperate and the ambitious Akua was keeping an eye on. Two thousand, by now, though we were still thin on Mighty...I’d already made my peace with the fact that we’d have to grow our own pack through harvest

  Sounds like Cat has become a Drowkemon trainer.

    I think it was more a reference to being a tipping point where her numbers and Night reach a critical mass.
    ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  So... Cat is holding auctions where people, who were recently uprooted from their way of living, and had their clan destroyed in a way that, in their culture, is synonymous with death and slavery, are offered permanent and temporary power-ups and status upgrades, that are basically the only way they know to escape the old "you've outlived your usefulness" treatment. There's a lot more candidates than there is power to distribute. 

  They're going to bid centuries of service, aren't they?
  ```

  - u/Anderkent:
    ```
    They can share the power, each getting say a tenth of the night from some mighty guy. So might not be that extreme.
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      Yeah, but there's no reason any of them would back down from a bid. They'd all desperately want the shares of night offered, and they're all used to serving someone else; so there's no reason they wouldn't promise ridiculous durations like "I will serve 10'000 years!", because as far as they're concerned, it's either "get the night" or "get shafted down the line".
      ```

      - u/lecupra:
        ```
        Possible resolutions?

        Cat needs an army now, more than she needs them in ten years (with the crusade over, her intention to abdicate, etc.).  The rules of the auction could be set up to reflect that by making the first years of service bid worth more than subsequent.  The further Cat goes, the stronger the enemies are meaning more Night and (possibly) more who will attempt to fight rather than surrender.  So do you bid now to avoid being left behind, or hold your valuable first bid until there's a larger prize?

        Or if Cat/Akua is capable of dividing up Night, the auction might be "pool the bids, and divide proportionally" rather than "highest bid takes all".  In this case, there would be a point where after enough bids are made, the amount of Night gained is not enough to raise you out of the left-behind class and you're better off waiting for a less contested auction.
        ```

    - u/sparkc:
      ```
      Has it been mentioned that Night from a single person can be shared? If not then i would hesitate to assume that's possible
      ```

      - u/Anderkent:
        ```
        Wasn't Ivah drained of all-but-a-little-bit of his Night? If you can drain someone partially, then you can share - the first person drains everything form the body, then the next guy drains partially from the first one.
        ```

        - u/sparkc:
          ```
          > “What stands beyond you was toppled and disgraced, harvested of all but a sip of Night and sent to die in the Burning Lands as final mockery.”

          Yeah, you're right.
          ```

    I know right? But im sure we all saw this one coming, we wont find out what happened to black for a while i bet
    ```

    - u/Zayits:
      ```
      I fear this is going to be just Cat noticing a scar on Pilgrim's cheek next time she sees him. An underwhelming way to go, but there's a narrative (both in-universe and errata's) need for Amadeus to make way for the new villain, and there's no *satisfying* way to do that.
      ```

      - u/Just_some_guy16:
        ```
        No i dont think so, blacks death is going to have lasting repercussions i think, people will definately know

          ```
          I still hold to the theory that he animated the dead and sent them to shore .   
          A "This is Why We Don't Fuck with Bioweapons" type of deal.

          Yeah, Pilgrim, you killed him, along with most of a nation + some foreigners.

  > *Akua’s people*

  Red flag!

  Reading about Cat going through drow settlement after settlement makes we wonder: where are the children? Does Cat's growing contingent of Nisi include a bunch of teenagers and children?
  ```

  - u/narfanator:
    ```
    Yeah, that's something I've been wondering, too. How do you get more nisi?
    ```

- u/cyberdsaiyan:
  ```
  wait... no... it can't be this short !
  ```

- u/MilesSand:
  ```
  How does that bidding system work? Years of service would be like bidding with borrowed money so they're limited to what she's willing to "loan" but what's to stop them from dying and thus forgoing the repayment.
  ```

    - u/signspace13:
      ```
      This, she seems to be learning to model her own power after that of the Sve Noc, likely culminating in her devouring the mantle of that power as well. This is going to be a very awesome next few chapters.
      ```

      - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
        ```
        >she seems to be learning to model her own power after that of the Sve Noc

        except instead of incentivising infighting and betrayal, she's incentivising *service*. I love it.
        ```

        - u/signspace13:
          ```
          Exactly, she is building an army of loyal Super soldier sworn to her and bound to follow their oaths by winter, and when they die she can just retrieve their power and pass it to the generation, who will swear the same oaths as their predecessors.

          Another question to ask is whether this is evil, my gut says it is, but when I consider it more I think that if she wasn't doing this than the Dwarves would just be curb stomping the lot of them and every semblance of their culture, she is instead recruiting those willing to serve in a way that would be productive and sustainable above, and giving them tangible benefits in return for their service.
          ```

          - u/werafdsaew:
            ```
            I don't think it's evil as it's equivalent exchange; the Drows always have the option of not getting extra power like every other race on the continent.
            ```

    - u/MilesSand:
      ```
      What about when they die of old age and still have years and decades. There's a point where she might as well start imbuing rocks with winter for all the benefits it brings her
      ```

      - u/Nimelennar:
        ```
        I get the feeling that, like Names, Fae titles make dying of old age unlikely, if not impossible.
        ```

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    Given that Cat's undead are pretty much lesser fae, there's a big chance that once the indebted drow start dying, she'll just say "Your service isn't over yet, get the fuck up!"
    ```

    - u/signspace13:
      ```
      Oh my god yes! This would be so cool, heck it's distinctly possible that whatever part of them is far will keep them alive until they are finished service, making sure they stick to their oaths.
      ```

  - u/BaggyOz:
    ```
    If they die then the Night is still out there either in their corpse or in the drow that killed them.
    ```

    - u/ZeroNihilist:
      ```
      Also, there's a slight possibility that the Drow who harvest her sworn soldiers will end up getting the Winter with the Night. That might make them a much less attractive target, unless they're okay with ingesting poisoned gifts.
      ```

  - u/Taborask:
    ```
    I think the bigger problem is that since most of them have no better options, promising future payment wouldn't cost much. Especially given that they'd receive power and protection as compensation, I'd imagine that they'd be willing to swear to extravagantly long terms of service. It would cease to mean anything when everyone is bidding a lifetime.
    ```

    - u/MilesSand:
      ```
      Exactly this. They're not bidding anything of value past the next few hours or days. (At which point those who lost all their bids die)
      ```

- u/Croktopus:
  ```
  Dude I'm really starting to like Ivah. It's even a bit less traitorous than her current fucked up lieutenant!
  ```

  - u/narfanator:
    ```
    Yeah, Ivah is getting to be pretty awesome.
    ```

- u/narfanator:
  ```
  I suspect that pre-fall Drow culture was more-or-less before the magic cannibalism was promoted; imagine being able to pass down your skills to your next generation. Nothing (or much less) is lost; you can much more literally "stand on the shoulders of giants".

  Then maybe the mantle of the Sve Noc changed hands, of the Sve Noc changed their mind, and started encouraging the back-stabbing and what not... so now everyone's trying to take what exists, instead of making more, and it all goes to shit. 

  (Notably: Sounds like problems we have here, too! In corrupt places, there's no point in accumulating wealth, since someone more powerful than you (or sneakier) will just come and take it).
  ```

  - u/magna-terra:
    ```
    if this was true they would have reached critical mass of ability, probably causing bardic interference
    ```

- u/AurelianoTampa:
  ```
  So this was awesome, but I always feel like the other shoe is waiting to drop when things start going so well for Cat. Any thoughts on what that's going to be? Off the top of my head, potential issues (sooner or down the road) could include:

  * Sve Noc is the biggest immediate issue. Cat's new army is being bound with oaths of both Night and Winter. That means Sve Noc withdrawing her power could shatter Cat's new forces, and significantly weaken the ones who remain. So Cat needs to recruit, dominate, or harvest Sve Noc for her power... and if drow culture is any indication, her morals are going to be a bit conflicting with Cat's. Each of those options has drawbacks - recruitment means Cat needs to offer Sve Noc something valuable. Domination means always having a dagger at her back, as betrayal is the bread and butter of the drow. And harvesting means Cat takes on Night, which she is (rightly) very reluctant to do. 
  * No matter how Sve Noc turns out, her power brings issues too. While the drow army isn't entirely Evil, it definitely has significant Evil parts to it. Which throws it back into the narrative flow and potentially calls for a bolstering of Good's forces in turn.
  * Cat's drawing on Winter quite a bit, and that seems like it HAS to have large consequences at some point. On a more meta level, it brings Callow closer to Winter... who knows how that'll turn out. But it also means that Cat becomes less human, and even if she's shunting off the alienation for the most part, that will also have some effects on her minions. And it is pretty much stated as a certainty that Larat will eventually betray her, so that's a hurdle that will approach at some point. And then there's the deal with the seven crowns... what happens when she fulfills that? Does she lose Winter? Does she become Fae in truth? Or... what happens if she reneges?
  ```

  - u/turtleswamp:
    ```
    My bet is that it turns out the night goes away when Sve Noc is destroyed leaving her with a much less useful army than she thinks she's getting. 

    Alternatively, the gloom doesn't and Cat finds herself having failed to fulfill her contract with the Dwarvs, or at least being held as having weasel-worded her way out of it and gaining resentment rather than respect from the dwarves as a result.
    ```

- u/aeschenkarnos:
  ```
  Interesting that the description of fighting with animated shadow is so similar to the Black Knight's methods of doing the same. Coincidence or connection?
  ```
