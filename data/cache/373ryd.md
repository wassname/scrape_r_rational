  Yet another really good chapter.

  I am curious about what Orochimaru is doing with the vivisections and how that relates to the wheelchairs. If his characterization is as it seems (which, it very likely could not be, as we saw with Quirrel in HPMOR - layers and layers) there must be a practical purpose to it commensurate with the cost. 

  If we knew if the subjects were civilians or ninja before or after the process, that might also be useful in determining the goals or reasoning. 

  As to the Naruto situation, I'm going to take the standard tactic: assume this plot went off without a hitch. What was the goal?

  Lets look at the results:

  * Naruto is seriously injured and convalescent. He cannot leave the village at least until he recovers.
  * The rest of the team will not leave without Naruto, so their SERE is also on hold until then.
  * Hinata has discovered she can kill to protect Naruto.
  * Hinata and Naruto have entered a romantic relationship, and both were isolated and alone before.
  * They both will likely wish to remain together.
  * Orochimaru now only needs to convince one or the other to stay in the village in order to get both of them.

  Lets look at the emotional states of the team:

  * Hinata and Naruto will likely wish to stay together.
  * Naruto is desperate to get stronger. Orochimaru understands this - see the 'training' by the river in a previous chapter.
  * Hinata wants to escape her family. Orochimaru is trying to provide an out.
  * Orochimaru knows that Anko is emotionally attached to Hinata. If Hinata stays, Anko likely will stay as well to protect her.
  * Shino is logical. He's the most like a rational actor in the group. Orochimaru has attempted to convince him to stay through rational argument and discussion, because he is the one least likely to fall prey to the emotional manipulations Orochimaru is using on the rest of the group.

  So, every action up to now appears to have been taken for the ultimate goal of getting the team (in whole, but specifically several parts) to stay in Sound permanently.

  The parts Orochimaru is most interested in convincing to stay seem to be in order:

  1. Naruto - Kyubi. Incredible Chakra pool.
  2. Hinata - Byakugan? Keep Naruto Docile?
  3. Anko - Keep Hinata in check, already trained, effective Jonin.
  4. Shino - Logical, great recon, Kikai genetics?

    Interesting speculations.  I don't want to give *everything* away, but I will say that [this is apropos.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQTp8Ozj1JQ)

  This got finished on Friday; I just realized I hadn't actually posted it today!

  I've read hundreds, if not thousands, of Naruto fiction over the years. (Shout out to Two Halves, for being my first one) So I've definitely seen a lot of the typical twists and tropes of the genre. So I gotta say, I'm impressed with your abilities to keep things fresh. It's an enjoyable read so far, and I'm eager to see how things turn out. My only concern is the pacing, as it seems fairly sedate so far, in so much as the power growth of Team Anko is concerned. The training's mostly been minor, and now Naruto is laid up for however many chaps. I'm assuming though, based on your previous work, that this'll be addressed satisfyingly once it comes about. Overall, really well done, can't wait for the next update.

    Thanks, I'm glad you like it.

    I'll warn you that the power growth and combat stuff will happen, but it's not the primary part that interests me so it won't be a major focus.  I did the 'war story munchkin fight' in 2YE; Team Anko is more about relationships, espionage, and intellectual combat.  I'm interested in how the Naruto-verse could look if an intelligent, rationalist, psychopathic altruist were dropped into it and given immense personal and political power.

      Ohhh, interesting. Out of curiosity, who's the "intelligent, rationalist, psychopathic altruist" or is that a secret we're going to learn on the way?
      ```

        ```
        ~~My mistake, I should have said "sociopathic."  Does that help?~~

        EDIT:  Interesting.  I just went and verified the definitions and it turns out that I had them backwards.  Psychopaths are the methodical planners who avoid risks to themselves, while sociopaths are the impulsive and erratic ones.  [The character in question ](#s "Orochimaru, if it wasn't clear") is definitely a psychopath and not a sociopath. I'll have to go back and fix it in the earlier text.
        ```

          Despite the two words having technical definitions, everybody either thinks they're interchangeable, or arbitrarily assumes the definitions one way or the other. If you want to use words to communicate, these particular ones are just plain bad at their jobs. I'd suggest just tabooing them both, and trying to paint the idea into the reader's mind instead of just clinically referring to it.
