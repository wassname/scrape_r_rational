## Blindness - Harry Potter fanfic

### Post:

[Blindness](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness) is a Harmonian HP fanfic where Voldemort's killing curse ended up leaving Harry with a much larger scar on his face, and rendered him blind. However, Harry developed a new form of mage-sight, allowing him to see the colors of magic and life. 

Dumbledore has no use for a blind Chosen One, and Harry's left with his Muggle relatives - fortunately, his blindness has also compelled his aunt Petunia to have more compassion for him, which in turns influences Vernon and Dudley. Thus, Harry's home life is far more pleasant than in canon - especially after he meets Hermione Granger, a Muggleborn witch whose parents withdrew her from Hogwarts after a nasty incident with a troll in a bathroom. 

Together, they begin to study the magical world with far more scientific methods than most wizards or witches would think of using. Much like in *Methods of Rationality*, this Harry is just as intelligent and studious as Hermione, and their rational approach to unravelling the world of magic is a central part of the story.

TL;DR - quite well written, definitely worth checking out, although it's much less comedic than HPMOR.

  I'm amazed I keep missing fics like this one, somehow, in spite of searching quite hard.

  Sounds quite interesting. Will definitely check it out.

  &nbsp;

  [Edit] I'm on the last chapter right now, and it was definitely worth a read. Quite enjoyable.

  I particularly like the following quote (may be slightly spoilerific?): 

  >Harry paused, shook his head. "I'm not *breaking* any rules. Magic isn't, either. It's taken me all summer to figure that out. There is reason and rationality and rules to all magic can do, just like there is with everything the muggles have figured out so far in nature. What we call magic is simply another force to consider mathematically, one whose limiting factors have not all been discovered. More complicated than most, of course, because I am almost positive that if there is some sort of math to it it is capable of changing based on the user and how it is used, or, better put, its environmental factors."

  Finally. *FINALLY*. 

  Other analytic HP fics I'd read were often.. less than stellar on this point. They called magic unexplainable and that was that, and some were even *smug* about that, somehow.

  I could hug the author.

  Oh, and the author also has a 700k word HP story on her profile. If it's of similar quality, I think I'll enjoy myself a great deal.

    Glad you liked it. :-) Oh, and make sure you leave a review on the story at FF.net, if you haven't done so already, compliments and honest critiques are like fuel for fanfiction authors.

  The story has some great potential, with innovative ideas with the magic sight and the way it helps unravel magic. The "if neville had been harry" plot outcomes also make a great parallel timeline, with lots of fun responses (like voldemort's) to the new situations. The "supporting cast" as it were, is very strong.

  However, Harry is a pretty frikkin massive Marty Stu, and a bit of a bore to read about. He is smarter, stronger, nicer, cooler, and morally better than everyone, has no weaknesses (he isnt even actually blind!) and gets the girl by default. He also has this weird monk aesthetic going on, being "above" petty childish things like pranks or lust. And most of these abilities are informed; when he makes magical discoveries, its not like the story had some problem it presented to us, and the reader thought "man, how would i fix this", then harry pulls from existing knowledge and shows his genius. instead he simply "discovers" solutions to problems we didnt know existed.

  it is also being held back a bit by the "omniscient 3rd person narrator" style; dialogue is infrequent, scenes tend to be sketched out from afar instead of lived, emotional developments often happen off screen, and we dont get to see people's thought process too much for the main cast. This improves as the story goes on, but is still a problem, and i think contributes to the blandness of the protagonist.

  Overall a decent read and good premise, but some flawed execution and a very unlikable main character. Good effort on the author's part though! Great to see writers tackle an interesting premise.

    Yup. What broke it for me was the Ministry being interested in Harry's Transfigurations. HPMoR has Harry do stuff that they'd be interested in too, like partial Transfiguration, but they're quite rare and rather important/unique. Plus, the story goes into how difficult it was to create them, like going evil after facing a Dementor and having to rewrite his mind manually to do partial Transfiguration. Blind!Harry here just sort of glosses over them, which makes it perplexing when we're told they're apparently so important when it didn't cost him anything we saw. 

    It makes him look, well, overpowered, along with other Sue warning signs - having more powerful equipment that no-one else does despite it being available in Diagon Alley (see many, MANY fics in which he gets a trunk, HPMor included, that is as powerful as Moody's despite him being the only one to have one in canon and having a powerful artefact for an eye, suggesting the trunk is rare too), having a "disability" that is quickly or immediately nullified by a magic sense that is even better (see Princess of the Blacks for an example done well), and Harry being neglected in favour of a different, wrong Chosen One.

      Re the trunk: There aren't any other magical trunks, but we do see numerous magical tents with similar space expansion that are treated casually, so it's not really a stretch to assume space expanded trunks aren't that big a deal.
      ```

        I mean, if Hermione made her bag, then I think a shop could definitely make some trunks

    Harmonian is shipping slang, it means that it's a story with a Harry/Hermione pairing.

      So I guess with Luna it would be Lunarian? :p There a list somewhere?
      ```

      - u/Pencil-Monkey:
        ```
        Actually, Harry/Luna is often referred to as Huna or sometimes Lunarry, again using the same naming scheme that gave us such delightful portmanteaus as Brangelina and Tomkat. Threeway Harry/Hermione/Luna relationships are also quite popular, and are often referred to as "Lunar Harmony".

        There's [a good organized list here](http://fanlore.org/wiki/List_of_Harry_Potter_Pairing_Names), and [a massive list of rather amusing although less-than-serious possibilities here](http://forums.fictionalley.org/park/showthread.php?s=&threadid=4591).

        My personal favorite when it comes to shipping names (as opposed to favorite ship, which is an entirely different kettle of fish) is Honks = Harry/Tonks. :-P

  I'm a little more than halfway through this, and it's pretty good.

  Thank you for the recommendation.

  Edit: Just finished, half an hour later. It is definitely quite excellent. Again, my thanks for the rec.

  Just reading the first few chapters raises up a bunch of red flags. 

  First is the standard manipulative!Dumbledore cliche.  Apparently Dumbledore doesn't really care at all about Harry's well being and only wants him because of the prophecy.  But since he's blind he can't learn magic or something so Dumbledore abandons him?  Dumb.

  Second is that apparently the wizarding world is  incompetent and doesn't even know how magic works.  It's up to two muggle raised children without any real experience at all to discover how magic works.  Even though wizards have been living and studying magic for thousands of years yet they're being outdone by a pair of schoolchildren.

  Harry gets a staff.

  The contrived relationship between Hermione and Harry.  

  Etc.   This is mediocre at best.
  ```

  - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
    ```
    Without having read it (and only in response to your second point), it's not neccessarily unreasonable that two muggle-born children could figure out so much more about magic than all of the wizardign community.

    Humanity as a whole progressed extremely slowly up until the discovery of the scientific method, which allowed for huge advances at a much more rapid pace. The wizarding world has been cut off from the muggle world since way before that time. I think it isn't crazy to posit that the wizarding world has been making it's same plodding progress the way humanity did pre-science and that a couple of muggle born kids who aren't embeded in that culture starting at 11 and who therefore might get exposed to the scientific method could make some pretty basic discoveries pretty quickly.

    It doesn't require them to be geniuses of the entire wizarding world to be idiots. They are just the first ones to be using a new, vastly more powerful analytical tool.

    I don't think it's too unlikely that Dumbledore wouldn't be too interested in Harry under the right circumstances. If you just swapped his treatments of Neville and Harry from canon with each other that would be entirely reasonable as a matter of prophecy interpretation. Dumbledore is support of Neville but to him Neville is just another student. 

    Probably this could have been portrayed better in this fic with Dumbledore offering Harry a place at Hogwarts anyways and giving him a magical eye (like what Mad-Eye has) so that he can see and learn, and Harry not being willing to gouge out his eye, potentially losing his mana sight, for a chance to see? There are a lot of ways you could go with it.

    It's worth noting some of the plot elements (Dumbledore being a dick, Harry getting equipment not used in canon like the staff, or unique discoveries magical discoveries that aren't game changers but make Harry stronger) are pretty much standard HP Fanfic fare.

    Oh! Thanks for telling me. :-) 

    I was about to ask whether you were, in fact, the author, but a quick check on the story's review page seems to indicate that's not the case. (Really good and detailed review you left for the author, by the way.)

  Man the beginning was good. Everything went too well and the characters were a bit boring, but still a fun read.

  Now I want to see a fic with the opposite setup, where Harry is just regular blind and has a hard life, but gets to go to Hogwarts and is still targeted by Voldemort. Harry is way less good at fighting but is the moral / strategic voice and plot McGuffin, Hermoine gets to be awesome, and Ron ~~can jump in a lake~~ gets ~~replaced by Neville~~ interpreted as a more awkward, sympathetic character.
  ```

  - u/Pencil-Monkey:
    ```
    Good idea, but if I may be so bold as to offer a suggestion? ;-)

    > Ron can jump in a lake, gets replaced by **the Giant Squid** interpreted as a more awkward, sympathetic character.

    Not that there's anything wrong with Neville, mind you, but even the Squid would be a better candidate than Ron Weasley. (It probably wouldn't want to share a lake with him, either.)

  2 chapters in. how does harry know about wands and "muggles" before entering the magical world?
  ```

  - u/E-o_o-3:
    ```
    and how does he know what colors the auras are with such high specificity if he is blind?
    ```
