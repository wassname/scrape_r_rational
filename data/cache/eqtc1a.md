  I should probably make the meanings of the flowers that are the chapter titles available somewhere, right? 

  This chapter is **Rhododendron: "Danger. Beware."** which is rather ominous sounding, isn't it?

  So here is where we start *very quickly* ramping up for one of the major conflicts of the story, which happens in Chapter 9 (I am so excited to share it with you, it just needs some more polishing to make sure it's *perfect*). Lucia and Elodia from the interlude are introduced properly, Lucia in particular showing her Chaotic Neutral side (I have a big crush on Lucia, if that's allowed?). 

  We get Lucia, a character who just dumps a bunch of exposition on Red, and leaves us with some rather worrying revelations (Red now knows that vampires can mind control!? Sounds like a problem...). We also have:

  - vampire gifts
  - sweet tea
  - a small lovers' quarrel
  - vampire servants being paranoid
  - misplaced optimism
  - my attempt to indicate the subtleties of formal vs informal you in English prose, when my mastery of the concept in French is passing at best considering I live in probably *the* least formal anglo culture
  - outfits from the 1840s or something
  - me doing research in an *actual 1910s encyclopaedia* for you all (thanks project gutenberg) - much to my shock it had an entry for janissary.

  Also, I was honoured when /u/callmesalticidae recently gave me this compliment: "Itâ€™s not Animorphs the Reckoning but dangit sometimes I just want Visser Three and Marco to sit and drink coffee for ten pages and maybe kiss". 

  (and he's officially finished the story, such as it is, even the "here be dragons" stuff from the real end while I'm still working out how philosophical about the nature of morality we want to be, that needs to be completely overhauled and expanded).

  ```
  This is a good fiction, I just don't know what to talk about. It doesn't pose any questions, there's nothing to theorycraft about. It just happens. We need dangling threads.
