  Chapter 47 is [here](https://heroessavetheworld.wordpress.com/2017/02/21/sharp-as-sword-blades-ch-8-simon-martin/), if you don't want to use the arrows or something, and the Table of Contents has been updated. 

  In accordance with the new rules, I'm going to be updating only on Tuesdays. If nobody else posts the Friday update, then Tuesdays will have the Friday update in the link and the Tuesday update in the comments.

  This thing with the colors is very suggestive. I wonder: What are they? Something like gods? Factions along guiding principles or morals? Factions of some other sort, related to something alien?

    I'd guess something like a god, but not a personal, anthropomorphic god. It seems that Viejo and the rest are angel-esque emanations of the colours based on allusions to the Bible and Quran, referring to powers as "virtures", etc., pre-existing the empowered children but not necessarily aware of their greater whole beyond the vague allusions to rules and goals they have to follow.
