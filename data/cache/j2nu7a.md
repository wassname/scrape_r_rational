## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  In a fantasy VRMMO how do you motivate players to stay in character? Not necessarily play a specific role but at least not do blatantly non-fantasy things like discussing the latest action movie or arguing about sports teams.

  * The goal is to sell subscription to an "immersive" game mode, where the target audience wants to experience life in a decently  realistic fantasy world while they beat dungeons and farm monsters for epic loot.  
  * There are weak AI systems available that can understand human speech almost as good as a human.
  * Players can earn money playing the game, potentially even make a living. 

  My idea is that every day you "stay in character" as determined by a weak AI watcher you get a 1% bonus to all your actions, applied after all other modifications. Damage, quality of crafted items, movement speed, almost everything. This bonus caps at +20%.      

  Going "out of character" resets your bonus to 0% and you have to stay in character for 20 days to reach +20% again. 

  This makes having full bonus necessary to compete in almost any area.

  Obviously malicious or repeated offenses results in your character being permanently transferred to a non-immersion PvP server, and you are permanently banned from immersive servers.     

  Would this be enough?

    Having an accepted social convention for switching into out of character works in real life. Like MMO RP servers with a /ooc command, or covering your name tag when LARPing. It's a combination of having a social pressure to demonstrate that you fit in, with an actual release valve for doing the thing you want to do (because people do want to talk out of character sometimes).

    Not sure what your actual goal is, but you might be able to achieve it with special effects on the /ooc command. Like you only ever talk out of character inside a Cone Of Silence spell.

    Overlord is a vrmmo turned Isekai, but still handles the topic of the difference between the game world and meat world interestingly in the brief mentions of the past. The meat world is a corporate dystopian hellscape with barely breathable air that everyone hates and doesn't want to be in, much less interrupt their recreation time with discussions about it. Throw in long standing cultural pressure to make a clear divide between the two worlds and all you have to do is make a vague allusion to things and let your reader's cultural osmosis of everything from Robocop to Mad Max fill in the blanks.

    It seems like you're trying to go for the carrot over the stick, but this ends up being the stick anyway. Losing a 20% all-around buff that takes three weeks to get back is severe. Players wouldn't see it as a bonus, but a standard thing to have that can be taken away if they screw up. And players are going to screw up, you can't expect perfect role-play from anyone. Groups having to cancel raid night because your healer accidently talked to their friend about a new movie sounds awful. More importantly, living in constant fear of screwing up and calling down the wrath of the AI doesn't sound fun, even with a community that signed up for hardcore immersion.

    That's not quite a deal breaker if the server and the community in it are extremely serious about immersion. But I think there's a way to do it that would ruffle less feathers. I would have breaking character put some kind of nasty debuff on you that only lasts for a very short time, maybe a minute (severity of the debuff and duration can increase or decrease based on severity). If you do it again relatively close to the first infraction, the debuff duration and severity grows exponentially for every infraction until the AI just kicks you.

    If you do it that way, minor infractions can just be a slap on the wrist and a reminder that players need to take immersion seriously. Players can mess up and break character, take their lumps and move on. A player who constantly triggers that reaction but ducks the threshold for a perma-ban gets a reputation for it and would find themselves having a hard time getting into serious parties.

      Adding to this, I'd make the debuf be something like Stark Raving mad, causing the character to move randomly, do humiliating things, and babble nonsense syllables.

      I'd also set up some combination of prediction and variable delay, couple with the debuf having an ambiguous startup period, in order to be able to have the AI cut to it a few seconds or so *before* the actual offense, and decide in a sneaky retroactive way if it was an actual offense or not, in a plausibly deniable way.

      Finally, I'd give players an option they can flip between at will, that delays their speech further, and lets the AI do slight rewordings and replace isolated non-immersive terms. With this switch on you have to worry a lot less about accidental slip ups, but obviously the delay on communications is not acceptable in fast paced combat situations, and some would have highly specific ideas for how their character talks or issues with free speech/will, so it'd need to be an option.

    If you break character for X seconds, you're mute and inactive for the next X seconds. (Your avatar looks confused/dizzy.)

    Simple, inconvenient, and proportional. That's how you want a penalty to be.

    You can multiply the freeze time for people who break character repeatedly. But as long as the AI can spot OOC on the fly, the "freeze" will be enough to stop any ongoing conversation that's OOC.

    People who want OOC will find even a mild penalty enough to go to a non-immersive server.

    What matters isn't the size of the penalty, but its speed and consistency in application. If your AI is good enough for real-time intervention you shouldn't need more than a nuisance penalty to push OOC players to another server.

    Every time I played on an RP server other players will just yell at you.  It worked well enough.
