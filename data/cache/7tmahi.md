  Good to see this story updating again. 

  Quite interesting that in an effort to rescue Nic, Dizzy effectively sacrificed her own father. It seems like the demon invasion will happen regardless of what Nic did though this sounds more like a backup plan. I think the primary door was still meant to be open in Ransom.

  Not related to the story, but does anyone happen to know how to set a GravityTales account to *send* email notifications for new chapters of things I'm subscribed to, but *not send* notifications about other unrelated stuff that I'm not interested in?

  All I can find in the account settings is a single checkbox for "Send Email Notifications" with no further granularity.

    Just use RSS.

      I do use RSS for plenty of things, but I do most of my reading of serial fiction from my phone (in bed, while out and about, while shitting, etc.), which is a less convenient form factor for my RSS reader.

      Problem's solved though; mooderino's own website has email subscription options.

    You can sign up for email notifications at the author's [website](http://moodylit.com).

    Just go to the bottom of any chapter of *The Good Student* and click subscribe.

      Sounds like a plan, thanks!
