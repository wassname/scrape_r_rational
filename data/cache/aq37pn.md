  The interlude's are often superior to the regular Cat POV chapters for me. Part of that is that EE has an array of interesting side characters and has a knack for gifting them novel and intriguing voices, part of it is that the interlude chapters are often full of plot and important happenings, but the other part is that the interlude chapters refresh my interest in Cat herself.

  Seeing Cat from the outside and the larger than life way she's viewed - part maniac, part genius, part selfless friend and part fearsome power - is a nice change of pace. We get a perspective switch from Cat the self depreciating, self doubting and all too human to a more mythic, larger than life figure.

  So now there's renegade priests in the Legions, from what was once the House of Light. And Queen Arson The Mad herself is now high priestess of the Light, with a capital N. Is she going to end up inadvertantly doing missionary work for Below again ?

  Also, completely unrelated observation but there's a distinct lack of Brandon Talbot or his knights around there.

    Given the [Orthodox-style schism](https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2019/january-web-only/orthodox-church-ukraine-russia-moscow-patriarch.html), yes, this is puzzling. Or foreboding.

      I can see the Knights being the ones who stay in Callow to defend it. They are the last line of defense, both story wise and in terms of fighting Praes due to their magical and faith based nature.

      &#x200B;

      Fighting against Procer means using normal armies (as much as Praesi Legions can be considered normal with their mages).
      ```

    - u/Dent7777:
      ```
      I can't imagine the knights are interested in leaving Callow defenseless, and I don't think Brandon would abandon Cat at this stage of the game, while the Dead King steps onto the stage.

  I'm guessing Vivienne's the source of the leak on Keter, to discredit any rumours that they tried to make a pact with the Dead King. Clever.
  ```

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    The timing doesn't add up, the Woe were informed about the Laurean conclave during the negotiations with the Dead King. It's weird, to be honest.
    ```

    - u/MythSteak:
      ```
      No, you just havent realized that there were more than one conclave. Hint: the first one was *about Callow* the second was *from Callow*
      ```

      - u/Zayits:
        ```
        I do know that, which is why i specified *Laurean*, but the declaration about the crusaders being graceless was done before Cat got to Keter. Guess they did it again for good measure or something.
        ```

          It’s actually a pretty faithful recreation of what happens in real world religions (vs what people assume about religion)

          In the real world, people generally assume that everyone in their religion (across space and time) believes the same exact thing as their local group.  When in reality, everyone everywhere actually makes it up as they go, as the memes and traditions that make up that religion are constantly evolving.

  Hakram. You get Hakram on it.

  ```
  This chapter is a bit confusing. The legion has lost a quarter of the city but are holding them at the frozen river but  Cat needs to go through the burning part of the city to leave the city and crack the river from outside the city? I'm confused.
  ```

  - u/Ardvarkeating101:
    ```
    The enemy is dug in just inside the city, past the bridges/river.  The can be pushed out with Drow assistance, but that's only going to work temporarily, IE if they're receiving reinforcements from over the bridges then they're just going to push right back in and we'll have lost too many troops to stop them.  Cat can't go outside the city to blow up the bridges/unfreeze the river because the other side has cavalry and all Cat has is light infantry until the sun goes down, so they're going through the part of the city that leads to the bridges but isn't occupied, because it's on fire.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Catherine is betting that no one is mad enough to think she’s mad enough to think walking through a burning city is a good idea. If you constantly have worse ideas than your enemies think possible they’ll never be able to defend themselves against you when they work.
      ```

      - u/vimefer:
        ```
        Eh, it's not incompetence if you do the unpredictably stupid things *on purpose*.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          The line between sanity and madness bends further as Catherine tries to push it outwards for more room on her side. She isn't one to toe the line so she moved the line elsewhere. And she isn't quite sure which side she ended up being on but as long as she can do what she wants she doesn't care.
          ```

          - u/Dent7777:
            ```
            Isn't it wonderful when plot armor kicks down the door, dashes through the house grabbing valuables, then swan-dives off the roof?
            ```

- u/russxbox:
  ```
  Have we been shown so directly yet that she's no longer Fae-style bound by oaths she made? She promised Hakram no drinking while on campaign (although it's possible that one was fulfilled when he rejoined her and not made again before they split to go to the Everdark and Callow, I suppose). 

  If the oath was still being kept, though, not only is it no longer binding for Cat but the Sisters also feel no need to enforce the terms on her, which would have consequences for the Drow bindings. 

  I could be way off base, but is she trying to bring a temporarily allied force back to Callow with no levers to ensure they remain allied? She's First Under the Night now, but that's a title she was granted and it could be taken away for any or no reason, as far as I understand. Didn't we spend a large part of book 4 trying to figure out how to settle the Drow in Callow without the possibility of them becoming a major threat by keeping to their natures?
  ```

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    She mentioned in the first chapter that the oaths on her former army were broken. Her command of the drow stems from her status of high priestess, and the agreement with the Sisters after leaving Everdark is probably a goodwill one. Until the Liesse Accords are signed, anyway, and then it would presumably be the same kind of constraints for everyone - probably more oaths and careful geopolitical balances.
    ```
