## How would a rational Fortnite story work?

### Post:

Non ironically. Based on what we know, it’s an endless loop where it’s reset after you die.

  You could write something like [sisyphus](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1vwndq/sisyphus_harry_potter/), maybe, a psychological horror look into what it would be like being trapped in a samsara of endless war.

  The problem is that it would be very difficult to reconcile that kind of story with all the shitpost/irreverence otherwise present in Fortnite's material -- travis scott concerts, the dances, all the nonsense.

  It's probably possible to write something poignant, but the world isn't a natural choice for that kind of story and I'd be surprised if anyone was interested in giving it a real shot.

    Shitpost/irreverence could work by leaning into the "this is all for someone's entertainment" angle. Like, the juxtaposition between endless war and the silliness that's in the game just makes it worse.

      Yeah, you could probably make it work by leaning really hard into the absurd, surreal horror of things like dying in horrific pain only to wake up immediately on the battle bus, again.

      Make it a *Dungeon Crawler Carl* sort of setup where you're rewarded for being entertaining.

      Or, alternatively, start the story centuries into the setup, with most of the cast literally driven insane by that point. Though that would probably result in a somewhat different flavour of silliness. (Or maybe not, I don't know anything about *Fortnite*. Is there a character whose comedic gimmick is being an insensate vegetable? What about an ultra-violent cannibal rapist? This might still work if you go the pitch-black humour route, with trigger warnings: yes.)

  Worth the Candle opens with Fortnite (or possibly PUBG), though it's not an endless loop and the main character escapes early on.

  I might be missing some of the backstory, but is it canon that the characters in one match are the same people as in a previous match?

  In games like TF/TF2/Overwatch, the canon is that there's just one continuous storyline and when people die they die; the recurring match system is outside of the story canon.

    Fortnite technically has lore between map changes, environment changes, trailers, tie ins, and everything with the council
    ```
