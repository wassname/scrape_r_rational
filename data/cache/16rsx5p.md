## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Does anyone have recommendations for historical fantasy with a focus on English nobility?  It doesn't even have to be England; any fantasy works if the vibe is similar.  

  Some examples would be Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell and Temeraire.  I enjoyed both but I'd also appreciate something a bit more ratfic-y or with more of a focus on cool stuff happening.

  Thanks!

    I just finished *JS&MN*, so let’s see what I can do.

    *Prince of Nothing*, mentioned below, is styled after the early Crusades. Except the equivalent of one of *Dune’s* Mentats has shown up, and is about to start hijacking the society for his own ends. Great attention is paid to the court politics and retainers. I am not enough of a history buff to say if it’s accurate, but it feels viscerally realistic. I would say it’s a step past *ASoIaF* in plotting and grittiness, but also brutality. Seriously, this is one of the worst worlds I can imagine in which to be incarnated. It is NOT comparable to either of your examples.

    Though…I’m assuming you’ve read *ASoIaF*? If not, do yourself a favor and start there. They really are quite good.

    I haven’t yet read, but have heard good things about S.M. Stirling’s *Island in the Sea of Time*, in which an American community loses all technology past the Middle Ages. They end up reconstituting some relatively medieval power structures as they try to rebuild. Kind of the opposite of American portal fantasies like Eric Flint’s *1632*.

    It’s more on the Arthurian side, but have you read Tolkien’s *Silmarillion*? For obvious reasons, it captures an older style of myth and legend while remaining aggressively English. Get into the right headspace and it’s very compelling.

    I can’t believe this is the best I’ve got. If I think of any others, I’ll edit them in.

      You may be thinking of Stirling's [Emberverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emberverse_series). His [Island in the Sea of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nantucket_series) is set in the same metaverse, but the plot is vaguely similar to that of Flint's *1632* series.

    The Peshawar Lancers by sm sterling is very good.

     From Wikipedia:
    The Peshawar Lancers is an alternate history, steampunk, post-apocalyptic fiction adventure novel by S. M. Stirling, with its point of divergence occurring in 1878 when the Earth is struck by a devastating meteor shower. The novel's plot takes place in 2025, when the British Empire has become the powerful Angrezi Raj and is gradually recolonizing the world, alongside other nations and empires that were able to survive.

    Tad Williams' Memory Sorrow and Thorn is a medieval english chosen one story. I think the new series he's writing in the same universe, Last King of Osten Ard, has more politics in it. 

    Kushiel's Dart series takes place in basically medieval France, with a lot more relaxed stance on sexuality and pleasure. The protagonist is a courtesan, and a lot of politicking happens. 

    Are you specifically looking for English-like nobility? Since you did say it doesn't have to be England. Here's a curveball rec, Shogun by James Clavell. English captain washes up in 1600s Japan, gets embroiled in the politics. A really solid story that's better than the sum of its parts.

    [Chasing Dragons](https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/chasing-dragons-asoiaf.453741/) is an ASoIaF fic where Rhaegon managed to escape across the narrow area instead of dying at the Trident, and Robert chased after him instead of becoming King. It's probably the best fic in the fandom, and it's complete to boot!

      It was good. It gets across the idea of someone ready to do what they think should be done, at least at the start.  
      Though I think it has character issues, where it feels like the author keeps providing moments for the characters to have growth.. and then they just don't take them up on it. (>!Aspen deciding to kill an expected 100 people by dislodging that part of the ship and then having that argument with the PUF!<, >!Aspen keeps getting told to think about the fact that these are convicts, some of whom committed violent crimes, and refuses to consider it, until way later in the story where it seems to be portrayed as a negative facet!<, >!Aspen keeps realizing that he hasn't been planning ahead, especially for when they actually land, and just continues not planning ahead!<, >!It kept pushing a bit for Sands to have some character growth, and he served as a good counterbalance - with his own issues - to Aspen. But then it just decides to completely drop that!<, etc)  
      Some of this might be justified by >!possibly hinted AI manipulation, since all the captains had paranoia kicks for a time!<, but I'm skeptical. >!Also it drops the AI plot very very suddenly. It felt kinda meh. Like the author just wanted to not have to handle those extra characters anymore!<   
      I liked the first 40 or so chapters (hard to keep track), but the issues kept coming up more and more often. Still worth a read, though.

Fair warning though, it gets pretty damn weird.

    [Ward](https://www.parahumans.net/2017/10/21/glow-worm-0-1/) fits, which is the sequel to [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/).

Alternatively, [Trailblazer](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/trailblazer-worm-gundam-au-complete.680881/) is a fantastic fanfiction of Worm and various Gundam series that also fits for similar reasons to Ward.

      (copy from when I wrote this about three months ago for the same question)

      De-rec on Budding Scientist.

      I found the protagonist... problematic. She's supposed to be a young teenage girl but her behavior is all over the place maturity/intelligence-wise and she generally takes herself far too seriously. Characters taking themselves seriously isn't bad, but the author also takes her seriously and this makes it a bit goofy to read.

      Generally, it feels to me like the platonic embodiment of Dunning–Kruger where the protagonist, and by extension the author, posits some scientific theories that they half-understand at a highschool level and then pat themselves on the back for having solved the riddle (eg "magic mana particles obviously act just like electrons!!" or whatever) that the stupid, science-lacking fantasy world magic people could never understand, because their collective society across all of their history lacks the big-brain energy that some random Isekai teenage schmuck has.

      Also, who tf uses "Budding" as an adjective to describe young girls? When I see that, my internal red-flag system goes on alert, just as it would if I encountered someone who only calls women "females".

        Does the author use it specifically because mc is a young girl ? I thought phrases like a budding prodigy etc were common?

          I wouldn't say that it is common but it is out there.

          I'd say Budding Scientist keeps to the wholesome side and avoids the creepy use of it like you would see in Stephen King novels.

        I'd appreciate an uplift story which actually took this into account. Something like the protagonist gets an idea to make some magitech and when they go to talk about it the locals reply "Ah, yeah, that. Guy in fantasy-Greece came up with the idea a thousand years ago. Interesting idea, but it's not really feasible to build"

        So it's not exactly fleeing into outer space, and the MC isn't opposed to living in a fantasy setting *in general*, but I'd argue it's similar.
        ```

      - u/Relevant_Occasion_33:
        ```
        Why would you think that? Even if you account for magic, it would have to be a pretty contrived magic system where living in space is worthwhile in terms of safety and comfort as compared to just hiding on the fantasy planet. 

        Just getting necessities like water and air in space is much more challenging than on a planet. Growing food, maintaining shelter, and having a worthwhile standard of living isn't even doable in the real world.

    I’ll continue the Westeros theme with [Zero Requiem: Lelouch in ASoIaF](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/zero-requiem-lelouch-in-asoiaf.745138/). An up and coming mastermind manages his relationships with his house, his bannerlord, and his subjects. Lots of plotting but minimal magic.

    The *Prince of Nothing* rec elsewhere in the thread is my gold standard for a certain kind of courtly politics. It’s low, brutal fantasy despite setting conceits which suggest a much higher world. Grimdarkness warning.

    For something rather more off the wall, I read [Set in Stone](https://setinstonestory.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/chapter-01/) ages ago. Humanity has been reduced to Stone Age technology, but retains a much higher level of coordination and institution-building. A designed society rather than an evolved one. There is significant science fiction in the background, but the story itself centers on interpersonal dynamics and problem solving. I remember thinking it was really cool.

    [Dread Our Wrath](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dread-our-wrath-asoiaf-si.870076/) is a fanfic of A Song of Ice and Fire that you might consider checking out. The MC is an SI born to a minor (and new) noble house in the Stormlands, quite a bit of time before canon. He mostly focuses on improving his lands and the quality of life of his people by introducing what technologies he can recreate from memory, while navigating the local politics of the Stormlands. He interacts with the neighboring lords, his overlords, and petitioning smallfolk.

        It takes place something like 150 years before canon, so it mostly does its own thing. It might still reference canon, but it's been a while since I read it and I'm not up to date with it right now.

        If you're waiting for the books to be finished though, I'm not sure you'll ever get to stop. It's been over 13 years since the last book was released, and GRRM might have given up on finishing the series.

Take *Perdido Street Station*: I wanted to love it. It’s prime New Weird; gothic grimdarkness and lurid details are a feature. And yet I was left annoyed, feeling as if the promises of the novel had not been fulfilled. Like it was an amusement-park tour when I was looking for a bottomless vortex.

  [Ends of Magic](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/57697/ends-of-magic) is basically a standard Isekai magic system with science mixed in as an OP cheat, as the classes and skills tend to develop through insights. I wouldn't necessarily say it's anything special, but it does have science lectures mixed into the dialogue, which is something I'd like more stories to have.

  I might compare it with [A Chemist's Rise in Another World](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/69221/a-chemists-rise-in-another-world) which is very YMMV, but it has very different downsides than that fic. For one thing, Ends of Magic is not a kingdom builder fic, it's mostly about a person working on their own litrpg system character build (and their friends, to an extent) with an anti-slavery crusade in the background. For another, unlike A Chemist's Rise, EoM has no inappropriate relationships (explicitly romance-free per author note), but it focuses kind of a lot on the MC's internal monologue including how he notices everyone around him is hot (and he's bi, so that's twice as many people) and how he talks himself out of pursuing a relationship with anyone. This perhaps builds some relatability but won't be everyone's cup of tea, if for no other reason than adding pointless fluff. Another somewhat iffy thing I'll mention is that the story has him make some pretty edgy/risky decisions >!like using a rage build!< without seeming to have an edgy/risk-tolerant enough personality to justify it. He's pretty much always in control, and never e.g. turns into a control freak or causes his teammates worry that he will. So it's a bit Marty Stu -- we hear that he has rage issues, which worry him internally, but they don't seem to cause problems for him.

  It does have some good points worth mentioning in terms of writing style. The fantasy world characters have sayings/aphorisms that make sense well enough to be read fluidly while not being directly ripped from English (for example, "blood in your eyes" means exactly what you'd expect), and the MC intentionally avoids making too many references because he knows people won't get them. It's not free of a bit of aphorism bleedover, but the comedy trope where the MC won't shut up with in-joke references and the side characters start imitating or complaining about them is thankfully absent here. He also encounters characters who are smart and insightful, and science is mostly only not spread because of a cultural tendency to hoard insights.

  Anyway the main thing I like about it is the aspect of real world science being explained to other characters (with attention to prereqs) so that they can make use of it in developing magical insights. He manages to spread the OP science based magic to some of his teammates, so there's payoff. This plot device is perhaps not as well leveraged as it could be (and I'd say there's less science density overall than A Chemist's Rise), but it does occupy enough story time to not feel like pure escapist entertainment.

  The story has two completed books and third one is in progress. First book will be stubbing in 10 days.

  - u/AnotherShadowBan:
    ```
    Derec for EoM on my end. I think it started out alright but the world seemed to lose it's characterization the longer it went on. I dropped it at around chapter 40 since it started to turn into a generic nothing can go wrong wish fulfillment fiction. 

    I think when the MC decided the best build was getting really angry is when it started going downhill for me, it just became very generic and lost what had made it unique at the start.
    ```

  - u/Jokey665:
