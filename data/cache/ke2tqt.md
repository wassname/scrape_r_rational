## The Mandalorian?

### Post:

I started watching the Mandalorian tonight. I know I'm a little late to the party.

Despite all the hype I found myself not very impressed. I watched three episodes and Mando seemed to survive purely on plot armor at every turn. Below this are spoilers for the first three episodes.

In the first episode he lets his bounty wander off alone on his ship. Yes he follows him and subdues him, but not before the guy gets a good look at the weapons locker (could have taken something and been a problem), and a free minute to do whatever (I thought the bounty would contact someone to come save him, since he kept bragging about having money).

In the second episode he has such bad situational awareness that he nearly gets eaten by a local cow/horse/raptor creature after stepping off his ship. He also can't draw a blaster fast enough to take the thing out.

Next he is scoping out the enemy encampment and I actually get excited at the idea of him being smart and sniping and clearing the camp in some intelligent way. Instead a drone comes up and blows the element of surprise in the dumbest way possible. Ok, sure, the droid is the dumb one initially, but why would you run down and join it?! And during the actual fire fight the droid seems far more effective than mando.

He gets ambushed after getting baby yoda. Its cuz he was walking down a canyon and people could easily get the drop on him. He is lucky they are only wielding melee weapons in a universe where most people use ranged weapons. Otherwise they could have easily shot him.

He has to fight a giant rhino thing to get an egg to pay back the jawas that stole parts of his ship. (side note: a stripped down ship really looks like a piece of crap, how the hell are those things ever space worthy). His lighting equipment is crap in the dark cave. He definitely should have died if not for little yoda saving his life. I get the story telling aspect of having little yoda save his life. But I never felt it was well established that he was actually a badass bounty hunter. 

In the third episode he infiltrates the local imperial base.  I initially thought he was gonna draw stormtroopers out and be stealthy, but then he blows a hole in the wall after getting an open door. Once inside he can't seem to pick between being stealthy and beating up storm troopers or just using his blaster and getting instant kills. The storm troopers also can't decide between shoot to kill and wait and negotiate.

Once he escapes he gets confronted by all the other bounty hunters. I'm not sure if this was super unexpected for him. But maybe he could have tried to plan for it? Also the trackers seem like super OP technology to be handing out like candy. Like they can track a person by DNA or blood or something from how far away? And there is no way to block it?

My main question is just about his competence though. I was thinking this was supposed to be a badass bounty hunter. Instead it has more of the feel of a player in a video game that fudges by on the easiest difficulty setting.

  Honestly, The Mandalorian is exactly what it's supposed to be: a spaghetti western set in outer space. If you want rational plot and character development then you're going to be disappointed. It's 40 minutes a week of Star Wars characters running around shooting each other.

  It's not going to get better. There's gonna be plot armour and (in)convenient coincidences when needed. If you can't enjoy it for what it is and spend too long thinking about why stormtroopers are such bad shots when the main characters are around then it really isn't the series for you.

    Hey, at least the show outright lampshades how bad shots they are!

      ```
      I've heard people bitching about how Stormtroopers are supposed to be crack soldiers, like... guys this is five years after the Battle of Endor, these guys aren't the crack soldiers. All those guys and the people who train those guys all died on the death star. This is what's left.

        Doesnt mean they should stand in the middle of doorways and shoot at walls

        ```
        They're also shit in the original trilogy. Though I guess both occasion where our heroes confront them in long firefights (on the first DS and on the ground at Endor) are technically cases in which they've been told to lure the opponents into a trap.
        ```

  - u/Bowbreaker:
    ```
    I mean I haven't seen many rational stories in mainstream TV series, but the Mandalorian is in my opinion even worse than average. The plot is riddled with holes. People do stuff for no reason other than "results in (supposedly) cool stuff". I honestly don't get why it's so beloved other than the green mascot. I mean I'm not much of a Star Wars fan but if they treated my favorite settings this way I'd be very disappointed.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    It's not a western in any sense except rare aesthetic moments. It's basically Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in space. There is absolutelly no tension, the thing is episodic, no one important will ever die, and the plot is reset after all the episodes besides the finale.
    ```

    - u/SkoomaDentist:
      ```
      And it's still the best Star Wars screen content we've gotten since the original trilogy.
      ```

      - u/Pirellan:
        ```
        I would argue the prequels are better than Mando.

  - u/KilotonDefenestrator:
    ```
    It also bears a striking resemblance to the classic old manga *Lone wolf and cub*, where a ronin samurai travels with his kid in a wooden stroller, taking jobs (mostly to kill people). Each episode starts and ends with the main character and his kind, alone.
    ```

- u/JanusTheDoorman:
  ```
  Yeah, I mean, in general Star Wars is about as far from rational fiction as it gets. The central plot centers around remnants of a religious warrior cult playing out a prophecy concerning a mystical life force's influence on the galaxy. The climax of RotJ is Luke willingly surrendering himself to two of the most powerful Sith Lords in history basically just because he has faith it'll work out, and it does.

    My favorite bit of the EU's vast madness is the "etheric rudder," a contrivance  explaining why the ships in the movies fly like they're moving through air. Whoever came up with that is as brilliant as any rationalist writer!

      Tbf if it were possible, a way to fly like a plane in space would be much better than newtonian physics. You would have a much better ability to outmanuever your opponent.
      ```

      - u/Dakadaka:
        ```
        You don't really need to outmaneuver that much when in reality the engagement range would be measured in light seconds and not close enough to see the other pilot.
        ```

        - u/Dufaer:
          ```
          Not quite.

          [Children of a Dead Earth](https://store.steampowered.com/app/476530/Children_of_a_Dead_Earth/) is the most realistic space combat simulator I know of (because it was designed to be that) and you cannot destroy anything there at light seconds. That's way too far.

          Kinetics projectiles are too inaccurate and easily dodged at that distance. Laser energy is proportional to the inverse square of the distance and you won't be able to make it an effective weapon at light seconds, unless your laser is basically a megastructure.

          Of course, you can do it with missiles, but there is very little distinction between "missile" and "unit" in space combat.
          ```

          - u/Dakadaka:
            ```
            Engagement range is when you come into range of weapons like said missiles. Really aside from "close range" knife fights and defensive fire it's pretty likely most if not all weapons would be missiles. The Lost Angel series by proximal flame has some pretty good space fights in it as well.
            ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    And then the sequels blew up what little consistent world building there was, and that was that.
    ```

    - u/KilotonDefenestrator:
      ```
      They really did not care one iota for the established worldbuilding. 

      Seeing the sequels, the dominant weapon in the galaxy should be bits of space rocks with hyperdrives. And that's just one example. Really irritating.
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        Well, that would require some smart engineers, which they clearly lack given that their bombers got downgraded from Y-Wings to whatever that idiotic monstrosity at the beginning of TLJ is.
        ```

        - u/Nearatree:
          ```
          It's not clear how many characters in star wars can read/ to what extent. It's pretty much a setting where everyone uses super tech with zero understanding of the actual mechanics, at least that's my take.
          ```

          - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
            ```
            Many things in Star Wars look like they're just fumbling around with technology they can't fully reproduce or understand. A completely technologically static universe would make indeed a lot of sense to explain *most* of what happens in that world. The problem is, some things instead fly in the face of such a concept. A few examples: the Death Star is an obvious one, while it's developed from plans of unknown origin in the movies (I won't consider the EU canon for these purposes), Rogue One still shows that there's obviously a lot of top tier engineering work that goes into building the thing. New ship designs emerge all the time - in some cases with a clear connection, look at the Clone ships in the prequels and then the Imperial ones in the sequels. Prosthetics advance too. When Anakin gets a replacement hand, it looks nothing as nice as like Luke's, even though in principle he should have had a lot more resources and reasons to get a top-of-the-line model. 

            Concerning this specific point, even if we suppose that no one truly understands how hyperdrives *work* and they can only ape existing designs without improving on them, it's clear that new ship designs are created all the time (TIE Fighters are designed at some point between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope; TIE Interceptors and TIE Advanced even further down the line. The same likely goes for the Rebellion's own X-Wings, Y-Wings, A-Wins, Mon Calamari cruisers, and so on). So they do know at least how to stick together existing parts in different hulls and arrangements to get different performance out of them. And if they can do that... why, oh why, would they replace the existing bombers, like Y-Wings and B-Wings, which are basically just heavier fighters that fire rockets forward, with those pachydermic contraptions that get annihilated by the dozen at the beginning of TLJ? Unless of course everyone in charge of such things is a moron, or unless the writers of TLJ simply liked the idea of a very literal WW2-like bombing scene and didn't care about anything else.
            ```

            - u/Nearatree:
              ```
              Some of this I blame on droids and computers actually designing things based on clumsily entered parameters but yeah there's a reason some people describe starwars as fantasy and not Sci-fi.
              ```

        - u/KilotonDefenestrator:
          ```
          Nevermind the state of engineering sense at the time of the movies, it should have been discovered around the same time the hyperdrive was invented. By the time of the movies "hyper missiles" should be as ubiquitous as turbo lasers. 

          I wish I was Jeff Bezo so I could buy the Star Wars IP and put down some ground rules...
          ```

          - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
            ```
            The Star Wars universe never was especially consistent or with some really hard sci-fi world building, that much is true, so I wouldn't want to enforce super rigid rules for it. However there is a certain "feel" to it and a sense of loose rules that is hard to pin down. The original trilogy established it. The prequel trilogy mostly kept to it (except for the very badly received, never mentioned again concept of Midichlorians), and screwed up in other ways, mainly having really terrible dialogue and often poor character writing for a story that was supposed to be a lot more complex and political than just the original trilogy's pew-pewing. 

            The sequel trilogy looks like it was made by people who watched the original movies once, went "ok, so, it's in space, there's space samurai and space explosions? Got you" and then just made their own thing. JJ Abrams tries to simply jam random fanservice in them while Ryan Johnson seemingly wanted to make some kind of subversive statement but *also* really liked the idea of that sweet Disney money. If your concept is "a Star Wars movie, but it actually shows how foolish it would be to be so hotheaded all the time (Poe) or stuck to old traditions that might be flawed (Luke Skywalker)", I'm absolutely not against it, that's a really cool idea. But that concept can't possibly fit in canon, let alone in the middle of a trilogy, and it requires a lot more serious thought than was put in TLJ's script anyway. I'd see it more working as a Watchmen-esque deconstruction movie set in an universe that's a clear expy of Star Wars - something like a dark version of what Galaxy Quest is to Star Trek.
            ```

            - u/cae_jones:
              ```
              Someone on /r/IsaacArthur once asked if it would be plausible to set a Star Wars expy entirely in / around Saturn, and this sent me down a rabbit hole of trying to figure out how to get from the world we have now to an STL version of Star Wars, set in our Solar System. As usual, AI and nanotech ruined everything.

              On the other hand, the Empire being managed by a UFAI who long ago destroyed the only candidate opponent AGI (who was hard instructed to not back itself up in case it went rogue) makes the Empire more threatening ... but, like, more threatening in the sense of ant Vs Asteroids. I think the Rebels were supposed to be trying to resurrect their AGI on Titan or something, and the Empire was building a giant doom-laser to launch an attack on Titan, but I'm still completely lost as to how space-wizards with laser-swords fit into things. Something something wands filled with nanobots?
              ```

              - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
                ```
                I wouldn't bring AIs into it, frankly; the way droids work and are treated in Star Wars makes me think they're supposed to be limited in their abilities - maybe on purpose? Could the Star Wars society be the remnant of a previously post-singularity society that had to put down a dangerously rising AI threat, and thus is full of legacy technology it doesn't really understand?

                But yeah, the thing you're describing doesn't seem to have much more of Star Wars. If you want to go for something more realistic you might as well ditch the idea of lightsabers appearing out of thin air and make them simple metal swords that heat up (like that one guy made on YouTube - a pretty crazy item, frankly). They obviously don't make sense as *practical* weapons, but just give them an explanation in ritualistic or traditional terms. They look more like dueling weapons after all.

  >My main question is just about his competence though. I was thinking this was supposed to be a badass bounty hunter.

  It seems like you went in with improper expectations. It's codified in [Pixar's rules of storytelling](https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-22-rules-of-storytelling-according-to-pixar-5916970) that we admire characters more for trying than we do for their successes (in fact, it's the first rule on the list!), so it should come as no surprise that when you start watching a Star Wars TV series on Disney Plus that it's made by people who understand that a person who *tries really hard* is going to appeal to the audience more than someone who wins every confrontation effortlessly. Viewers want to see Mando get knocked down, because it shows that he has what it takes to stand back up again.

  After all, this is made not only for the Disney Plus audience, but for the Star Wars audience. And while opinions amongst the Star Wars fanbase are split on many things, the thing that they all seem to universally agree upon is the fact that The Empire Strikes Back was among the best movies, despite most of the movie consisting of the "good guys" trying really hard and barely scraping by by the skin of their teeth. (A huge part of the movie is a *training arc* for Luke: we only forgive Luke for being a badass during the opening of Return of the Jedi because he *earned* it.)

  If, as Pixar says, we admire characters more for trying than we do for succeeding, then there are two options: you can ratchet the difficulty up, or you can ratchet the character's competence down. *Die Hard* opts for the latter: Bruce Willis is a badass, but he's dealing with an entire team of guys with automatic weapons when he himself is armed with nothing but a handgun and the shirt on his back.  The Mandalorian can't really ratchet up the stakes too much, because the main thing that sets it apart from the Star Wars movies is the smaller stakes: he's not trying to save the galaxy; he's just trying to save a child (and also act as an errand-boy for a number of small bit players in the Star Wars universe.) The real badasses probably have much bigger problems to deal with.

  Our protagonist's highest goal is "be likable."  (Protecting baby Yoda is, in a way, just a means to an end: protecting the adorable puppet will make him seem more paternal and more likable. But not *too* paternal: he has to kind of resent being made into a dad, because this makes him more relatable and thus more likable to the audience. It also gives him an "arc," which it should be noted is a thing that has no "logical" or "rational" reason to exist, but which audiences will generally notice the absence of in a protagonist.)

  >Instead it has more of the feel of a player in a video game that fudges by on the easiest difficulty setting.

  Video games are actually a great comparison, partly because video games illustrate a great point about metatextual communication with the audience. (Which is to say, beyond the mere lore connections, The Mandalorian exists in conversation with the rest of the Star Wars universe, much in the same that each Zelda game is sort of in conversation with every other game in the Zelda series in terms of game design.) The Mandalorian, in many ways, operates by the film equivalent of "video game logic." Examples of "video game logic:"

  * Regenerating health: An NPC shoots you three times, and apart from red blood splotches obscuring your vision, you are no worse for wear.  A fourth shot would be fatal, but luckily you manage to dive behind a rock, wait for 10 seconds, and your bloody vision clears and you are 100% fighting fit and ready to dive into the gunfight once again.
  * The unit of currency in this world is gold coins. You easily carry 30,000 gold coins.  The currency is stable: a merchant that sells a potion for 100 gold coins will never change their prices.
  * A questgiver tells you that he needs six boar pelts. From this, you immediately know that 1) you will easily be able to find boars without traveling too far from where the questgiver exists, 2) that no matter how you kill the boars, their corpses will yield usable pelts (even if your method of killing them involves fire, explosions, etc). 3) that you are the only person in this world that can fulfill his request for six boar pelts, despite basic laws of economics suggesting otherwise. This will be true even when playing an MMORPG, where *by definition* you are crossing paths with hundreds of other people who can (and in fact do) complete this same quest. (Actually, it's *especially* true when playing an MMORPG.)
  * You need a bomb bag to store bombs. Despite bombs being a common item in this world (enough that nearly every merchant in the world offers them), nobody has thought to mass produce and sell bomb bags. Despite how much money you obtain, you will never be able to buy a bomb bag: your only option is to dive into the inner catacombs of a dungeon where the bomb bag will conveniently be accessible without having to use bombs. (However, obstacles *later* in the dungeon will *definitely* require the use of bombs.) Despite the apparent rarity of this bomb bag, you are the only person who will ever seek it out; you can wait as long as you like to obtain it without fear of anyone beating you to the punch.
  * The big evil villain is about to enact his plan which will cause mass destruction. Before going to confront him, your companion notes that this seems to be a point of no return, and suggests that maybe if you have unfinished business to attend to, you should take care of it before confronting the villain. Despite the urgency and high stakes, you take your companion's advice and decide to spend the next 3 days fishing. Nobody thinks this is weird, and the villain has gained no advantage during this time.
  * All keys in the world are fungible, and immediately break upon being used. Exception: a few keys in the world are not fungible, but are conveniently color-coded: blue key goes in blue lock.
  * Any time Link is told about "six medallions," you immediately know that you need to obtain all six of them and there is literally no other way to complete the main quest. You also know that each of the medallions will require an approximately equal level of effort to obtain (though the later medallions will be slightly more challenging).

  (The Mandalorian follows it's own sort of video game logic: when Mando is told that he needs to obtain an egg, we generally understand that 1) the egg exists, 2) only he can obtain it, 3) attempting to obtain it is necessary for his quest to progress, for reasons that are more-or-less identical to the boar pelt example above. Mando is basically fetch-questing his way through the galaxy in a way not all that different from an MMO player.)

  All of these are examples of what many people would call *good game design*.  Regenerating health doesn't make sense, but being able to get back into the action after waiting a short period is more fun in an action game than backtracking to scrounge for health packs. (And both regenerating health and health packs are more fun than getting hauled off to a trauma center and spending several months going through physical therapy before diving back into the fight because you got shot three times in the arm.) When you're playing an open world game, the player wants to have time to do all the open world activities before "finishing the game," irrespective of the urgency of the ending of the plot: players generally *hate* unmarked "points of no return," and so the game designers mark them, despite there not really always being a sensible in-world explanation for them.

  Video games, despite this seeming "illogic," are *remarkably consistent with their own logic.* In part, I understand the logic of puzzles in Zelda 4 because I played Zelda 3.They don't follow *real world logic*, they follow *video game logic*. When you find a locked door in a Zelda game, the game designer is clearly communicating to the player that they need to find the key.  And when the door has no keyhole but has two unlit torches on either side of it, it's obvious that Link needs to find a source of fire to light the two torches and open the door. (We're not really meant to question *why* this dungeon was designed by a person who created doors that would open when those torches are lit, nor are we meant to ever wonder whether the mechanisms that they put in place might ever malfunction.)  You *intuitively know these things* when you find them in the world, despite there being no logical *worldbuilding* explanation for them, because the game designers are using the conventions of game design and a sort of shared language to communicate them to you.

    In much the same way that game designers use this kind of shorthand to communicate with the player, filmmakers rely on shorthand to communicate with the viewer: we know in the first 5 minutes of Star Wars (A New Hope) that the empire, due to being called "the empire" and being led by a guy named "Darth Vadar" in all black with a  mask (and the stormtroopers all having uniforms that hide their faces) are the bad guys, and we (correctly) assume that the rebels are "good" mostly on the basis of their opposition to the empire and having uniforms that don't conceal their faces so that we can see the concern and fear in the actor's faces. Every direction choice is serving this goal: There's just a certain way that evil characters *sound* evil, probably because when James Earl Jones is recording the lines for Darth Vadar, the director is telling him that he's voicing an evil character, so he gives a different performance than he does when he's recording the lines for Mufasa in *The Lion King*.

    You could poke holes in the worldbuilding of Zelda games all day, but all of the things that are "illogical" are the same things that make Zelda games enjoyable. There is no logical real worldbuilding reason that Link should be able to step into a thing called a "dungeon" and, by completing a series of puzzles, always be able to come out with the macguffin he needs after a series of challenges that are perfectly calibrated to whatever items he had collected at that point. Link's quest to defeat Ganon in nearly every Zelda game (BotW being a notable exception) is absurdly fragile: Ganon could put a halt to Link's entire journey by going into a single dungeon (pick one of the half dozen or so scattered across the land) and destroying a single key.

    Hallmark movies also operate by their own internal logic. In the same way that a Zelda player will hear about "six medallions" and understand that Link's journey must end with obtaining six of them, a Hallmark movie viewer will see the hometown hunk in the first ten minutes of the movie and understand that the main character's journey must end with falling in love with him, and that doing this will be the result of her following some plot that is completed in the same amount of time that it takes for them to confess their love for each other. (e.g. stop the big corporate retailer from shutting down the local mom and pop store, receive handsome romantic partner). 

    I think this thing is best fully understood as "genre."  When I pay $2.99 for a self-published Kindle book labeled as a "romance," I know it's going to end with a happily-ever-after, not because of the logic of the setting, but because of the genre. (And when the author breaks that promise, people will revolt!)  It is *fully rational* for me to expect that, irrespective of anything that happens in the plot. The author is being rational by catering to the audience.  And if I bought one of those novels expecting a highly successful self-published Kindle author who built a career by churning out dozens of approximately identical romance novels to buck those expectations, *I* would be the one acting irrationally.

    In the opening episodes of The Mandalorian, the possibility that Mando might "break bad" and decide to sell out baby Yoda is presented as a possibility in-world, but as a viewer, I know it's not on the table. The Mandalorian is Star Wars, made by Jon Favreau. (Which can be quite different from e.g. Star Wars made by Rian Johnson.) Jon Favreau's Star Wars, much like a Kindle romance novel, challenges the viewer to approximately the same extent that viewers expect to be challenged. Which is to say, it understands that there is a reason you are watching The Mandalorian on Disney Plus, when you could be watching a David Fincher movie on HBO Max, or a Christopher Nolan movie on A. Or, as other commentors have put it much more succinctly, "The Mandalorian is exactly what it's supposed to be: a spaghetti western set in outer space."

  I think the whole point of Mandalorian--and also it's charm-- is it's supposed to be a low stakes Star Wars series. None of the Skywalkers are involved, no epic plots or messing with canon. It's also clearly not supposed to be high art. It's just Mandalorians and yodas traveling through space, shooting stuff and helping people. I like it because of baby yoda and Pedro Pascal, tbh. It's also nice to know that if I *don't* want to watch it, I'm not missing anything that's canon.

  I don't know why you expected more. I like the series, but its star wars. Its fantasy in space, and its is more about themes and cool shots. Internal consistency was never a part of the franchise.

  I manage not to be bothered by most of that, although the one thing that i can't seem to ignore is the fact that he never bothers to lock or even close the door of his ship.

  Rationalizing Star Wars can lead to stuff like midichlorians. That said, the show has its moments.

  Din Djarin was raised and trained by Mandalorian religious fundamentalists. He's a competent combatant, well-armed, well-armored >!especially after getting his new armor!<, and honorable to the point of near-absurdity. He is a competent, but not brilliant pilot. He also has a willingness to negotiate to get the job done.

  The last point lends itself to a trace of rationalism. As long as his principles are not at risk, the Mando is a live-and-let-live sort of guy. Empire, New Republic, neutral species? As long as he can work and channel his money and Beskar back to his folk, he's fine with everyone. This attitude works very well through the series.

  Much of the rationalism in the show is left understated - shown, rather than told.

  * Din refuses payment in Imperial credits for a job, accepting payment instead in Calamari flan. The implication here is that the Empire's days are numbered, and everyone knows it.

  * The Client attempts to bribe Din into killing (rather than recovering) the Child. The Imperial remnant is factionalized. >!In season 2, we discover Grogu is being used as a blood donor to awaken Force powers in "volunteers". The Client must have found this repugnant, but had his orders.!<

  * Troop and gear quality vary widely among Imperial troopers. The factions, again, are at work here.

  To avoid it getting to the quarry before him? Especially seeing how it turns out Mando wanted it alive, and the droid, well, didn’t.

  A classic case of mistaking the features of rational fiction for the marks of good fiction.

    ```
    "Good" fiction is inherently subjective so i see no problem with associating rational fiction with good fiction if you happen to like rational fiction.

    But I'm not passing judgement on the series overall. I understand that people can like it without me liking it. I was just hoping for a competent main character. This shouldn't pose any problem for rational fiction vs "good" fiction ... unless you think incompetent main characters are a hallmark of good fiction?
