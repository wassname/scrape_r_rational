## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  I watched the first season of Supergirl. Or to be more precise, I hate-watched it.

  I think there's a certain laziness of writing that tends infect science fiction sometimes. It's like the writers think "okay, well this doesn't really make sense, but the whole concept is kind of out there so whatever". Similar to the argument that you'll often hear when someone asks "But how did he travel from the Wall to King's Landing so fast?" and the response is "It's fantasy, it's a show *with dragons*," which is not actually an answer to the question.

  Supergirl has that in spades. Yes, I get that people watch superhero shows in order to get a power fantasy and/or get warm fuzzies, and yes, there's an element of both camp and fan service, but that doesn't absolve bad, contrived writing.

  (I think one of few highlights was the DEO getting called out on keeping people imprisoned without trial, especially the comparison to Guantanamo Bay, which is the kind of Real Moral Problem that I think makes the best sort of story for overpowered superheroes.)

    Minor digression:

    There's this very widespread legal idea of [*n* Guilty Men](http://www2.law.ucla.edu/volokh/guilty.htm), with the most famous formulation being Blackstone's Ratio, "It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer".

    Let's say that you have ten supervillain prisoners. For each prisoner, you have 90% confidence that they actually committed the crime you think they did, and each is responsible for more than a hundred deaths. An supervillain released into the world due to a not-guilty verdict at trial will offend again 50% of the time, costing on average a hundred lives.

    If we follow Blackstone's ratio, we're basically saying "better that five hundred people die than one innocent suffer", which seems obviously incorrect from a utilitarian standpoint.

    I suppose this argues for extreme prejudice in the case of supervillains to an unpalatable degree; I'd have to do the math, but at the very least it's better for twenty innocents to suffer than a single supervillain be allowed to go free. Though I guess there's probably an argument to be made that the government putting innocent people in prison is much better or much worse than a supervillain killing them.
    ```

    - u/ketura:
      ```
      I think the lion's share of the issue is how frequently villains go free in comics. CRIMINAL INSANITY DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY, aherm. If you have the Joker or someone brutally murdering and mutilating 100 people, he's not getting out of that once caught. Imagine if Bin Laden had been given an American trial--do you think he would have gotten off even if he was hearing voices and drooling all the time?
      ```

    - u/Kylinger:
      ```
      An important thing to keep in mind is the effect punishing innocents has on the society at large. If your population cannot trust the system to fairly judge you, why abide by it's rules at all? If whether you are innocent or not doesn't entirely determine whether you will be *found* innocent or not then there is less of a reason to follow it's rules, since even if you follow every rule down to the letter you may still be arbitrarily punished.
      ```

    - u/buckykat:
      ```
      Blackstone's ratio isn't purely utilitarian, but also tries to account for a profound distrust of government. That's why Franklin's restatement of it inflated the ratio another order of magnitude.
      ```

    - u/Gurkenglas:
      ```
      Innocent supervillians might help a lot of people.
      ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Yep. This is why the Renegade system flips that ratio around in Pokemon. When the "supervillains" have the power to level cities, the idea of risking letting one go free just to potentially save 9 innocent people seems bizarre and suicidal, from a societal standpoint.
      ```

    - u/trekie140:
      ```
      I agree with you analysis, but I'm unsure what inspired it. Most of the superhero stories I've read/seen feature villains escaping from prison rather than being released, which has its own problems with rationalization.
      ```

  - u/trekie140:
    ```
    Speaking as someone who does like campy superhero stories that appeal more to my emotions that intelligence, I don't like Supergirl. I only watched the first few episodes because I didn't like the characters, the writing, or the plot. The closest thing I can compare it too is The Flash, which is by no means rational but still understands what kind of story it's trying to tell. I thought Supergirl was boring at best and nonsensical at worst, I don't know why so many people seems to like it.
    ```

  - u/legendofdrag:
    ```
    There's a lot of this in the Flash TV show as well, but I've managed to enjoy that a lot more. I'm not really sure what the difference is between the two, but it just doesn't bother me as much there.
    ```

    - u/trekie140:
      ```
      The biggest reason I like Flash more is that I think the characters are much better. They aren't all that rational, but they still have motivations I empathize with and don't do anything that stupid. Whereas Kara just decided not to use her powers for arbitrary reasons, Barry is wholeheartedly committed to helping people even before he gets his powers. Kara's boss is an asshole and her family is bland, while Wells is an enigmatic mastermind and Joe is an intelligent father figure. Even the sidekicks and villains are more fun.
      ```

  - u/Meneth32:
    ```
    What bugs me most about Supergirl (and Flash) is how the heroes lose battles they should've won easily, with their super speed and reaction time.
    ```

    - u/trekie140:
      ```
      I chalk that up to a combination of them learning as they go, holding back a little because they don't want to kill anyone, and the show's lack of a budget. To be clear, I think Kara is a moron who doesn't use her powers effectively at all. I like Flash a lot more, but there are still episodes where I think the creators are being lazy and padding out the plot.

  So I finally got around to getting a simple hex grid spawning in Unity!  Whoo-hoo I guess.  This has been long overdue, but things have kept cropping up to steal my spare time.  


  On the design front, the final blow to the leveling system was dealt this week.  It’s been a bit of a difficult holdover from the canon pokemon design, trying to fit the rigid level 1-100 concept into the other systems that were more free-form and built around diminishing returns rather than hard caps.  


  In canon Pokemon, every creature had three different numbers that fed into any particular stat: the *base stat*, the *intrinsic value (IV)* (generated at creature creation as basically a randomizer), and the *effort value (EV)* (stats earned directly through battle).  Base stats were defined at the species level, so all Rattata have a base Attack (ATK) of 56, for instance. 


  When a pokemon leveled up, it would receive 1/50th of its Base Stat as a reward.  This meant that at level 50, a Rattata would have base 56 ATK, and at level 100 it would have 112.  


  How frequently it leveled up was determined by its Growth Formula, which had several different archetypes that varied the amount of XP required per each level.  This meant that your Beedrill would hit level 100 while your Dragonite was still level 60, given the same XP.


  And then of course, what moves a pokemon learned and when it evolved was determined by a straight level requirement: Rattata always leans Bite at level 10 and evolves to Raticate (starting) at level 20.  

  I *think* those were all the major ways that Level tied into the various mechanics (it also modified damage dealt and how much XP was earned, but those are more minor details).  Each of them has slowly been replaced with other mechanics, with stat growth being the last to fall this week.  So, here’s what each of these concepts has been replaced with:

  * Moves, as mentioned a few weeks ago, are tied to Aspect mastery and anatomy/stat requirements, which makes the move learnable whenever the prerequisites are fulfilled rather than at arbitrary times


  * Growth curves have been shifted over to instead impact EV growth, which has taken a larger proportion of the stat impact (see below)


  * Base Stats have been redefined as “how many stats are awarded on EV growth”.  So rather than being awarded in increments each level, you now receive points equal to your Base_ATK for every 100 ATK EVs earned


  * Evolution has been shifted to a system similar to Moves, with more specific requirements than just level, which is detailed below.


  All of these mean that the final nails have been put into the coffin that is the leveling system.  RIP levelups, we hardly knew thee.


  ----

  Evolution, as mentioned, has been made slightly more free-form.  To level up, certain stat requirements need to be met (an Abra with 3 INT just isn’t going to cut it as a Kadabra), as well as a certain amount of evolutionary “dust” needs to be procured.  


  What we’ve decided is that the pokemon world is inundated with some sort of catalyst that triggers evolution--it floats in the air, it’s embedded in living tissue, and it’s produced and metabolized by pokemon themselves.  So breathing in the dust in the air, consuming fallen pokemon, or pushing the body are all things that will increase the amount of evolutionary dust in the pokemon, and bring it one step closer to metamorphosis.  

  Because we’re cheeky, we’ve decided this dust should be called Evolutionary Xenos Particulates, or EXP for short.  


  But where this system gets *interesting* is that Silph Co has found a way -- whether through synthesis or…*extraction* -- to produce a concentrated version of EXP, which has different flavors depending on where or how it was produced.  

  In short, evolutionary stones.

  A pokemon can thus be fed EXP stones to accelerate their evolutionary timetables -- at a great opportunity cost.  You see, when a pokemon evolves, any EVs it has accumulated in a lower form get “baked in” to the base stats after evolving.  If you are patient and spend time developing your pokemon, those one-time stat gains from EV baking can be enormous--but if you’re *not* patient, well, all Silph Co affiliates have *very* competitive prices on an alternative.    


  TL;DR the last remnants of the old experience grind have been swept away.  Rather than worrying about arbitrary level gates, the player is now expected to be concerned with sick gainz instead.

  Is anyone here addicted to constructive feedback?
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    I have peaks and valleys. I worry that asking for feedback is often just asking for validation or attention, because I get those things from feedback. It's like "hey, read this story!" even if the intent is "help me improve this story". And I love talking about things I've written, but sort of worry that time spent talking about writing is time not writing, or its fulfilling some of the same creative desires without actually being creative. For me at least, it's a fine line to walk to ensure that constructive feedback is actually helping me.

    And sometimes I just want to sit in a small room beneath the stairs and write without anyone talking to me or knowing what I'm doing.

      I've found success in mitigating that by saying something along the lines of, "Looking for feedback, particularly which parts struck you as particularly well done, i.e. made you think or feel an emotion strongly, and parts during which you noticed your interest or suspension of disbelief slipping, or where you didn't think of the characters as actual thinking people."

      Unfortunately the number of people who respond also drops by a significant percent.

    I can empathize since I know all of the perfectly rational reasons for cryonics and how they are compatible with my moral values, yet I still feel an inhibition towards it. I can only speculate that it's similar to knowing that being a vegetarian is objectively better for the environment, yet I don't want to make any effort to eat less meat.

    - u/gbear605:

      Do you have any conscious reasons for your inhibition?
      ```

      - u/trekie140:
        ```
        I don't know if I'd call something purely instinctive conscious. Something about it just feels wrong, like I'm cheating death instead of overcoming it. It somehow seems inappropriate or perverse to preserve my body in the hope of resuscitation without knowing if I will be. What's weird is that I don't have any qualms against mind uploading or freezing a person while knowing they can be woken up later.

        I can imagine scenarios where I can be convinced to participate in cryonics, but even then I would still feel uncomfortable during the process. I guess it feels selfish somehow, like the fact that I might live more than others is unfair and I should just accept the life I got like everyone else. I don't have such an opinion of other forms of immortality, though, so I'm not sure where this prejudice comes from.

  Hey, so, Eve Online recently went pseudo-free-to-play. I played for a few years a while back and am thinking of hopping back in. 

  Is anyone else interested in forming a corporation together? I've got the ISK to fund us for a little bit at least, and it's a chance to try out the infamous meta nerd game if you haven't already (or, like me, are looking to return). Thoughts?

      That would be up to the people, I think. My inclination is to make either a highsec Corp with frequent roams and then eventually graduating to lowsec, or just go to provi. But if others have other preferences, I'm down for other stuff.

  And [NIKO IS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op-HF0u1Ssc) has a unique style and great flows and interesting videos.

  I'm 3 chapters into writing my first fanfiction, and it's way more fun than I thought it'd be. It is as intrinsically rewarding to plan/write/revise fanfiction for me as playing video games, reading about stuff I like, etc. Falls below seeing friends and good food, but not far below. 

  Man, if I'd known it was this fun, I'd have started years ago.
