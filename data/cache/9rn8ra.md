  Isn't it funny how the thread for recommendations is once a month, but straight up posting a link - arguably the most in-your-face recommendation there is - is whenever?

  Either way, here's _World Trigger_, finally out of hiatus after almost exactly two years. The first chapter may be found [here](http://mangaseeonline.us/read-online/World-Trigger-chapter-1-page-2.html).

  **World Trigger** - sidestepping the "is it rational" debate entirely - has significant rational-adjacent qualities. It's not as explicitly brainy as the first arc of _Neverland_, and it definitely doesn't try for anything more than the thinnest veneer of science, (here's your phlebotinium, now use it) and the exact reason I feel like suggesting it appears to change from time to time. Still, if I had to try, I would put it as a combination of a couple of obvious things, and a number of smaller things.

  **The initial premise** is nothing new. We have a Japanese city, we have an alien (dimensional, technically) invasion, we have a mysterious organization that appears in order to mount a defense using exotic weaponry, we have a middle schooler with a mysterious connection to that organization, and a mysterious transfer student. The series revolves around battles fought against these invaders, and between members of this organization.

  (Neither of these are the obvious or small things I was talking about. I just realized I hadn't actually said what the series is about yet.)

  **The obvious things** are just that. A handful of overused tropes are quickly defied. The main protagonist is a positively sub-par combatant, and has to rely on creativity and wit. Strength of will does not overturn significant differences in power, skill, luck or strategy. Strategy typically matters. Clothing is functional and non-revealing. There's more, I think, but I honestly don't read enough in the genre to compare.

  **The smaller things** aren't necessarily subtle, but don't paint the whole picture by themselves. Characters generally follow their motivations sensibly, even the superficially irrational ones in serious matters. Even when nobody's actively doing battlefield tactics, the birds-eye-view considerations (Who's where, traveling where, in the way of whom, etc.) are shown and accounted for. The wits-reliant protagonist is smart, but not a genius, the plots he manages to pull off are within that scope, and other characters are clever as well. The entire organization is generally competent, with a few caveats. In large enough battles, the entire cast is equally relevant, and that's with more named characters than chapters, at some points. Exotic technology is generally consistent.

  I'd like to pause here, and say "What it all adds up to is X", except that if I could state X in a clear an concise fashion I'd have done so to begin with. I suppose it either projects or demonstrates a lot of values that we associate with rational fiction, even though it doesn't commit as clearly to them as we would expect from a (good) rationalist fanfic. One label I've been considering is _reconstruction_, with regards to battle manga, because it does remain firmly in that genre, if with a different spin than usual.

  Consensus is it's a slow start, (would have been slower, if not for executive meddling) but I don't expect anyone to jump in at chapter 165, (Unless they're already a reader, of course. There may be fandom overlap.) so I'm not sure what exactly I'm trying to accomplish here. Either way, I shall be happy if it catches someone's eye.

  (/r/WorldTrigger is reasonably active, especially now in post-hiatus spring season.)

    I read World Trigger up until the hiatus and promptly forgot about it until now. I agree with pretty much everything here and would second the recommendation. My personal take on it, from what I remember, is that it's a battle manga done right. The later fights feel like there's actual thought put into the strategies and progression making it feel more like small scale warfare rather than two groups throwing powers at each other.

    One thing I think should be noted is that many of the characters, save for a few, aren't particularly memorable. Part of this is the same-face syndrome that inevitably affects character design without crazy hairdos or facial structures. I didn't quite become invested in any of the characters until many chapters in which probably contributes to the general consensus that the story had a slow start.

    Overall, I think if you're someone who enjoys battles and fight scenes but wants to see a deeper level of depth to them, you should give World Trigger a shot.

    Oh, and, (I know there's an edit button, but I'm trying not to make that comment longer) there was an anime adaption, covering chapters 1 though 120. It was generally faithful to the plot, but poorly animated and often prone to cheap pauses and the like. Consensus is to read the manga first unless you really don't like the format, or have really low standards for anime.

    Mangastream.com can be expected to produce the best fanmade scans/translations from now on, but they only recently picked the series up, (that is, two years ago, one chapter before the hiatus) so the best version of anything prior to that would be the official release, which has been conveniently uploaded to mangasee.us, which is what I linked for the first chapter.
