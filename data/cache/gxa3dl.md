## [WtC] Arthur's dumbest possible universe

### Post:

In the backstory of mome rath, Arthur proposed a game of Dumbest possible universe, he mentions that Joon is on the right track with his Author-verse, but in the end refuses to propose his own.

“Dumbest possible cinematic universes, go go go.”


“Alright, fine, fine,” said Arthur. “Assume that they have to all be connected to each other somehow, either by genre, theme, plot, characters, or something like that.”


“You’d need more,” said Arthur. “And I agree, it would probably work best to pick someone who’s got a lot of different works, if you’re going dumb. Hard to think of though, because so many of them just get into a rut writing the same thing over and over. Oh, Sanderson is another who’s basically done all the work for himself. We’re pretty much never getting movies though.”


“Nah,” said Arthur. “After. Yours was already so ridiculous and disconnected from the base material that I think you might have me beat.”


I think he was going to say a tabletop verse. A crossover between all tabletop, d20 style games. Every game Joon has run, with characters, races, places and powers. This would be dumb, as it would be unworkable, impossible to balance, and absurdly complicated. (Well done Alexanderwales for doing it anyway, and well)

I think Arthur came to this verse thinking it was his own creation, just not on the same level as Joon.

  yeah this is my read as well, although this implication had not occurred to me:

    I think it would also explain a bit better why Arthur was just so sick of Aerb.

    from his mirror speech:

    "The coincidences, the improbabilities, the way that things seem to fit  just right, character arcs that are completed in the final seconds of  the last battle. I don’t know how much of my biography you’ll have read,  or how much you’ll have learned about me, but if you don’t see the  patterns in your own life, I’m sure you’ll see them in mine. Looking  back, it all seems so trite. So many NPCs with their sob stories, so  many love interests, paraded around in front of me before their  inevitable deaths. I’ll admit to being affected, at first."  


    It seems to me that Arthurs problem isn't just the lack of perceived stakes and the often discussed problems of narrative but that one of his major problems was that he lacked immersion which he had a bit in the beginning but which faded over time if it hadn't been thrown in his face every other day (game notifications, the horrible quest text puns etc.) that he was in some form of game his time on Aerb would likely have been a lot different . With that situation him realizing some time along the way that he actually came up with this world would be even more soul crushing for him. A hell of his own creation.  


    Do we have any info on when in the Aerb time line Arthur fought a Mome Rath? Might pin together nicely his descend into an ever more grim character.  


    I really hope that we'll get a lot more information of Arthurs relationship with the DM/Vervain  


    Anyway OPs theory is now definitely my head canon

        'Mome Rath' is on the list of names that Uther gave Masters.

        It's not clear if this is because he fought one, or because he remembered the name from the conversation on earth.

        However, the antimemetic effect seemed to keep Joon from being able to remember the name Mome Rath until he fought and killed one, so if Arthur could remember, that suggests he might have fought one.

        (Unless Juniper actually just forgot what Mome Rath was because he was forgetful, or something.)

          Can you remember every random idea that you discussed briefly with friends, even with a traumatic event clouding your memories of your relationship with that friend?  Juniper never included it in a campaign, it was literally a one off idea discussed right before watching a MCU movie a few weeks before Arthur’s death.

        >As far as I recall, there's no indication he did.

        hm, I just skimmed the relevant sections and you're right, but I was fairly certain that Arthur faced one, too - maybe just because there are multiple Mome Raths and so surely Uther the should have fought one
        ```

        - u/Makin-:
          ```
          Weak evidence against it is that Uther is a powerful spirit mage that could store knowledge of the Outer Reaches in his knights' minds, bypassing the antimemetic effect. It would be weird if they had fought one and he didn't let Raven keep the knowledge.
          ```

          - u/Gr_Cheese:
            ```
            And even if Arthur did not enable Raven's memory of the Mome Rath, he would have had to wipe that memory for Raven to not have recalled the Mome Rath when she was in its presence again--like Joon did. So there's an additional hurdle.

            Arthur could have encountered one pre-Raven, but it seems unreasonable to assume this was the case.

        How would we ever know? We're certainly not within 3 miles of the antimeme

      The author keeps a Google Doc with progress updates (no content), we're at least another week away from the next batch. Probably closer to 3.

  He's actually working on a Mistborn screenplay at the moment, although I don't remember the timeline. This won't have aged well!
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Of course, he's working on the screenplay because Hollywood was doing such a bad job of it that he decided to do it himself, which doesn't speak well to the chances of a good Mistborn movie being made.
    ```

  - u/Makin-:
    ```
    The screenplay for Artemis Fowl was finished in 2003.

    The movie is coming out a few days from now. And that's with Hollywood backing it from the start.

    I like videos like this because they remind you of the swinginess of combat with real/normal people.  That guy in the black shirt has the naked guy dead to rights, swings a punch at his head... and totally misses
