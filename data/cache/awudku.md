## Wandering Inn just released it's volume 5 finale

### Post:

Originally heard of the series here, and while it's characters aren't extremely rational, but they believable pursue their goals.  I'd say it ranks around WTC in that area, and I feel it tends to tick the right boxes that a lot of people on here enjoy.  

Anyway, 5.62 is the latest volume conclusion and I think it's worth checking out if you haven't already, or catching up if you stopped in the past.

Synopsis: Normal people from earth find themselves transported to a new world where fulfilling requirements will give people classes and Skills.  The Skills range from the supernatural, like harder skin, to mundane, like knowing how to better cook.  The world's been stagnant around a medieval level of tech as a lot of people tend to rely on Skill knowledge instead of pursuing learned skills.  The world also tends to be a bit more violent, as conflict causes people to gain levels and become more powerful.

The story mostly follows Erin Solstice who's just a normal person without any exceptional scientific knowledge who brings a bit of our sense of right and wrong into a hostile world.  It also has many interludes and side arcs following several others.  I've found I enjoy almost every side story characters, as well as how they tie together with the main thread.

Edit: Reread the post, found out I mistyped characters are extremely rational, instead of aren't.

  The Wandering Inn is very good serial fiction and it is extremely effective at evoking emotion, but I would hesitate to call it “rational.” It’s more *realistic* in its characterization of people than many fantasy stories, but not very rational.

    >It’s more realistic in its characterization of people than many fantasy stories

    I mean, I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't even say that. Some of the stuff with Ryoka really stretches the suspension of disbelief even further than the average fantasy story.

      Maybe I’m more likely to consider Ryoka to be a realistic sort of person because I actually know *two* people who are quite similar to her in most respects.

        Ryoka was very unpopular with a segment of readers, but yeah, I always felt she was amazingly infuriating but not actually in an unrealistic way.

    For something by the author that might appeal more to /r/rational, her Erfworld fanfic [The Last Turn](https://erfworld.com/blog/view/50734/the-last-turn-part-1) is pretty good once it gets going, and revolves around some extreme munchkinry.

  Wandering Inn is a great story, but to call it a story of interest for /r/rational is absurd.

  - u/appropriate-username:
    ```
    There are at least 3 comments here saying this with 0 details. What's irrational about it, in volumes 1-4?
    ```

    - u/SnowGN:
      ```
      Erin Solstice, the main character, is a truly and remarkably irrational and intellectually uncurious character, who takes no substantive steps towards learning more about the world that she's in or finding a way back home to earth. She doesn't even read any books. Examples are endless. I'd compare her a lot to Monkey D. Luffy from One Piece, which makes her a very fun and unpredictable character to follow, but she is not a rational actor in any sense.

      Ryoka pretends at rationality with her actions (refusing to start the arms race), but anyone with sense could see, after the phone call at the end of volume 1, that things are now far beyond that. The fact that she continues to work as a [Runner] with the knowledge she has is a joke and a complete waste of potential, whose only redeeming value is her relationship with the powerful, mystical characters of the world that she meets.

  When does the wandering inn start to take off? I've read to chapter 21 and nothing spectacular have happened yet. Should I continue until chapter 72 before calling quits?
  ```

  - u/PastafarianGames:
    ```
    The Wandering Inn hits its stride once Erin re-encounters chess. If that and the subsequent chapters don't interest you, you probably won't like the serial.

    I'll give you a data point. TWI clicked at chapter ~40? for me. In two chapters I went from bored to invested. Then it clicked again, *another* *100* chapters in. 

    Truth is an editor would probably throw away half of this rambling nonsense of a webserial. It's quite a *Meandering* read. Get it? uh. 

    But, from time to time, it sparks *magic* - and all that word vomit becomes worth it. Well, most of it.

    I’ve started WI multiple times due to the recommendations here, slogging a little further each time.  It never ‘took off’ for me.  The wandering theme is very strong.

      >The wandering theme is very strong

      Nice burn. 

      I agree, I read quite a bit and it never seemed to actually go anywhere. The second human PoV was especially awful.
      ```

- u/NZPIEFACE:
  ```
  so, before i continue reading this, is ryoka back yet?
  ```

  - u/SnowGN:
    ```
    She has a very small re-introduction at the very end of the last chapter. She is not back in Liscor.
    ```

    - u/NZPIEFACE:
      ```
      ffs i just want my ryoka back ;_;
      ```

    - u/morgf:
      ```
      Do you mean in the interlude that is only available to patreons at the moment? Because going by the publicly available chapters, I do not know what Ryoka reference you are talking about.
      ```

      - u/SnowGN:
        ```
        Yes.
        ```

  I recall a particularly jarring set of retcons surrounding the idea of a level cap where people were initially complaining about level cap cultist but had never heard of the idea in later chapters. This was just the most visible change to accommodate the protagonists being unprecedented geniuses. It seems the rules and personalities of people often switch around to make whoever is the POV seem competent (as in you can make more accurate predictions about the world by questioning "what would make X look badass" than what has been directly stated in previous chapters). It's amusing in places ( I fondly remember the chatroom interlude) but it's no WTC.
  ```

  - u/synonimic:
    ```
    > level cap cultist

    A certain horned adventurer?  I'm not sure I know who you're referring to otherwise.  My memory's not great and I binged this pretty into it's writing so it's possible I've forgotten that detail.

    As for the protagonists being geniuses I might've just forgotten details of the previous volumes since 5 focuses so heavy on Erin, I feel like most of the protagonists are protagonists because they're exceptional, as compared to say the some of the >!Heroes!< that get introduced around the Clown arc, and >!the other people from earth!< that the Lady finds and keeps.  

    The worst I can really think of is how a blind guy kinda stumbled into the system and ended up getting a good shake of things completely by chance, but the direction he took it in helped make it sit better with me.

      One of the earliest chapter has people act squeamish around Ryoka when they find out she's refusing to level up because she's one of those weird people who think you can only level so many times. Skip ahead 2 books and Klbkch has never heard of this idea and neither has seemingly anyone else. Erin goes from outwitting stupid monsters with traps to trouncing world famous adventurers without any explanation. 

      And well...

      Is this a normal person or very influential and powerful one?  Are they needlessly confrontational or a subtle manipulator? Are they a racist xenophobe or exceptionally open minded? 

      The answer is probably yes. 

      This is a somewhat difficult accusation because you can always claim character development but inevitably seems to be the \*same\* character development every time. Its always a fun sort of development don't get me wrong but it's sort of like seeing an anime constantly going "Masaka?!"  It never quite stops being amusing but it does become predictable.
      ```

      - u/Solaire145:
        ```
        What? I was always under the impression Ryoka didn't level because it felt like something was trying to control her. I think she theorized there might be a cap but I never ascribed that as a reason she would not level period. Also she theorized that levels stack in terms of difficulty. Someone already level 30 in one class will find it difficult to level something else from level 1. Not a game changer but important. It's why Klbkch was worried about his own classes. He used to be mostly Slayer but after several resurrections over the years, Slayer got lower and he picked up other classes which made progression in Slayer harder.

        In my opinion it is the best. As a fair warning it is still being written, although at 880k words it is already extremely long.

        it’s head and shoulders above every web serial i’ve encountered except worm
        ```

      - u/LLJKCicero:
        ```
        It's the rare LitRPG that *isn't* a blatant shonen-esque power fantasy, even if it does share a few of the same trappings. And it's vastly better written than almost all web serials, and basically all LitRPG's.
        ```

- u/Laborbuch:
  ```
  How well is the end of the volume suited to pause at? For a time I read WI as it was published, but these days I find it more satisfying to read web serials in bursts, stopping at convenient places in the story, and I wonder if this is such a spot, or if there are cliffhangers dragging me with them for a ew updates.
  ```

  - u/Jarwain:
    ```
    It's definitely a suitable pause point. The goblin lord arc reaches an end, and the next volume will probably start with the repercussions of how it ended. What's left is more 'anticipation' than 'cliffhanger'
