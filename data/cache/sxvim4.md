## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

    i think i stopped halfway. When the MC just reached the dark elves.  
    It was getting stale.  


    Did it improve after that?
    ```

    - u/comomellamaba:
      ```
      In my opinion that was the weakest section of the series, so I would say yes, it did improve. However, while it is a slog to read through, it did establish some important characters for later in the series and provide crucial character development to some of the protagonists, so I can't really recommend skipping it.

    It's ended a little weak (for how much build-up the ending got) and has quite a few pacing issues, but overall has a pretty compelling premise and consistent quality — if you don't mind slogging through some parts of the story at times. Doesn't hurt that it starts off really strong. 

    I think it's overrated and won't last the test of time, but it's a good way to kill several hours.

  I wanted to recommend something different this week: interactive fiction. Interactive fiction, or IF, are a genre of games that are primarily textual. Some are parser games, like the old Zork and Adventure. Others use web interfaces and are more hypertextual. IF has had a huge renaissance since the 90s that has continued through to today. A hallmark of IF is playing with genre expectations and matching the story to the implementation, and I think r.rational would enjoy quite a few of these.

  Here are some specific recommendations. Many of these don't require installing software, look for a Play Online or Play Now button, though it can be harder to save in some cases.

  [Counterfeit Monkey](https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=aearuuxv83plclpl) — You're trying to escape from a repressive government on an island with technology based on word semantics. (I feel like Scott Alexander would approve of this.) Emily Short really thinks through what technology based on accidents of language would look like, and the puzzles based on word transformations are fun. There's something that happens mechanically about 2/3rds of the way into the game that is a true pleasure.

  [Spider and Web](https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=2xyccw3pe0uovfad) ([Play](https://eblong.com/zarf/zweb/tangle/) — This game has the best single puzzle I've ever encountered in a game. (The worst single puzzle is from [Hard Puzzle](https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=81afnluyffpxa8iv).) The game hinges on nested framing narratives—>!what you're doing in the game is what you're telling an interrogator what you did, not what you might have actually done. You have to pay close attention to subtext and put it all together to escape.!< The last sequence is slightly weak, but the moments of realization are something else.

  [Superluminal Vagrant Twin](https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=5xzoz5wimz4xxha) — Explore a universe that is at once large and small. Whole planets are described, and explored, very simply and evocatively. There's a simplicity and a depth to this game which I quite enjoy. You're on a quest to collect enough money to rescue your twin, and must explore a galaxy to do so.

  [Midnight. Swordfight.](https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=2cuwjlvpybg8oaf0) — This game came up on the sub a few months ago. You can only take one action in this game—your part is scripted. And after your one action, you will die. But what if you could step outside the script and change the lines? And what if there's more to the world outside the script than there initially appears?

  You can [see the top-rated IF games on IFDB](https://ifdb.org/viewlist?id=k7rrytlz3wihmx2o). If people get into these, ask for more recommendations on another week, as I've played most major games in this genre and have others that people here might enjoy.

  If you'd like to download and play these games on your phone, I recommend [Frotz](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/frotz/id287653015). On your computer, which is probably the easiest place to play, I recommend [Gargoyle](http://ccxvii.net/gargoyle/).
  ```

  - u/megazver:

  - u/Amagineer:
    ```
    > If you'd like to download and play these games on your phone, I recommend Frotz. On your computer, which is probably the easiest place to play, I recommend Gargoyle.

    it's worth pointing out that there are web players for the parser-based IF too! if you hit the "Play On-line" button in the upper right of the download section of the IFDB page you'll be taken to one even for games that don't have a web-native release. (for example you can go [here](https://iplayif.com/?story=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fi7%2Fcounterfeit-monkey%2Freleases%2Fdownload%2Fr10%2FCounterfeitMonkey-10.gblorb) to start playing Counterfeit Monkey, without fiddling with any standalone software stuff)

    for those interested in the details, the ifdb link takes you to https://iplayif.com/, which is using [Parchment](https://github.com/curiousdannii/parchment), which, if i understand correctly, is in turn using [Quixe](https://eblong.com/zarf/glulx/quixe/), which is also usable standalone.

  People like fanfiction, right? Here's what I've enjoyed since, like, September.

  [The Trial of Winterfell](https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/the-trial-of-winterfell-what-if-cersei-and-jaime-were-discovered-at-winterfell.509717/reader/) is a well written albeit unfinished A Song of Ice and Fire fanfic where canon is immediately derailed and Ned Stark has to organise the trial of Queen Cersei Lannister and her brother Jaime Lannister for high treason. The story does an excellent job of faithfully portraying the setting in tone and depth and the cast act rationally. 4/5.

  [Towards the Sun](https://archiveofourown.org/works/19252807) is a well written and unfinished but also kinda melodramatic and contrived Avatar: The Last Airbender fanfic. The plot is that Zuko, having been imprisoned during the events of series 3 instead of joining the Avatar, is freed from prison following the defeat of the Phoenix King's airship fleet and made the figurehead of the Fire Nation for the duration of the crisis to deal with the problems that rapidly crop up. The characters rationally pursue their goals as best as the genre will permit them to. I give it a 3/5.

  [Local Teen Given Intervention for Normal Behavior](https://archiveofourown.org/works/25450684) is a short and complete Batman comedy fanfic that runs roughshod over characterisation (but Batman has so many canons that it doesn't matter). 5/5

  [Do Kwamis Dream of Magical Sheep?](https://archiveofourown.org/works/35559718) is a complete Miraculous Ladybug fanfic where the Ladybug and Cat Miraculous are swapped, only for Plagg to fall in love, as far as a Kwami can be said to fall in love, with the mayfly he has been assigned to. 4/5.

  [Dreaming of Sunshine](http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7347955/1/) is a long, unfinished Naruto self-insert that has been on hiatus for a long time. The writing is pretty good and the characters are as rational as they can be in the limits of the genre. If you enjoy it and get to the end, you'll be pleased to learn that it has an extensive fanfic-of-fanfic community with a few rational works. 3/5.

  [Mary Me](https://archiveofourown.org/works/27627943) is a short and complete Pride and Prejudice self-insert with excellent attention to detail and characterisation. I give it a 4/5.

  .

  Also, stuff that isn't fanfic:

  Cruelty Squad is a very good video game and I can't believe I've only learned of it so recently. 4/5.

  Well There's Your Problem is a podcast about engineering disasters with over 100 episodes. It's hit or miss, with some episodes being 5/5 and some being real stinkers.

    Since you mentioned Dreaming of Sunshine, I recommend all of [wafflelate's](https://archiveofourown.org/users/wafflelate/pseuds/wafflelate/works?fandom_id=13999) recursive fanfics. The "Many Gardens of Shikabane-hime" spinoffs are all pretty great.

        ```

        - u/ADotSapiens:
          ```
          Some of the stuff is discord-only, some of it is randomly scattered around FFN, AO3, snippet threads on SB/SV, Tumblr, Wattpad, Livejournal, Dreamwidth, Patreon, the official subreddit(!) some misc fanfic forums and maybe QuoteV. These are only really collated as a list on the discord but most of it is in either the various threads of the [We're all just dreaming on sunshine FFN community](https://m.fanfiction.net/forum/We-re-all-just-Dreaming-of-Sunshine/180237/) or AO3. About 500 stories, representing about 5% of the total recursive fanworks with some 200 of those representing about 80% of the good recursive fanworks, can be found at the [Heliocentrism AO3 community](https://archiveofourown.org/collections/Heliocentrism).

          For most people the AO3 community is good enough even though it has only collated about two thirds of the DoS fics on AO3. The discord, which I can't get an invite link to atm, has managed to collate 95-99% of the entire corpus of recursive fanworks on the internet but you've gotta be a wee bit mad to wanna stay in the recursive fandom to go that far tbh.

          Edit: Bat and Robin specifically can be found [Here.](https://archiveofourown.org/series/1530206)

            It could be worse. For example, in the recursive *Worm* fanfic [Emissary](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/emissary-a-deputy-recursive-crossover-worm-au-canon.532150/threadmarks), the Taylor from the fanfic [Deputy Commander](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/deputy-commander-worm-au-sequel.518383/threadmarks), which was a sequel to the fanfic *Deputy*, which was, in turn, an AU sequel to the Worm fanfic *Internship*, finds herself in the *Worm* canon and meets the canon Taylor. In the same author's [Ambassador of Blood](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/emissary-a-deputy-recursive-crossover-worm-au-canon.532150/page-142#post-39504145) she finds herself in the [Queen of Blood](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/queen-of-blood-worm-castlevania-complete.363842/) universe and meets the local Taylor.

            As /u/ChucklesTheBeard once said, it makes *Ambassador of Blood* "a spinoff of a crossover between a web serial and the sequel of a fanfic of a fanfic of that same web serial, where the crossover is actually between another fanfic of the web serial". Which I *think* is technically correct, although it misses the fact that *Queen of Blood* is a fanfic crossover between a Web serial and a computer game universe which is loosely based on Bram Stoker's version of *Dracula*.
            ```

              I see this kind of thing, then I look at those 70-years-plus-life copyright terms, and it just makes me despair. If nothing else, I think this fanfic-of-fanfic has a kind of richness of culture that legally cannot be found in published work.

  Hi, I'm fairly new to the community and have just started HPMOR. I work in quantitative finance and am wondering if there are any rational fiction works focussing on the financial world and its connection to everything else. Like the paragraph on muggle money - wizard money arbitrage in HPMOR.
  ```

  - u/andor3333:
    ```
    The Baroque Cycle by Neal Stephenson involves a lot of clever plots by rational characters using economic principles like arbitrage and inflation, intercepting bank transfers, and investing to achieve political or personal goals. It is a bit of a doorstopper book, and I wouldn't recommend it if you aren't also in the mood for very dense historical fiction about England and the Royal Society (Newton, Hooke, etc...)

    [The Cambist and Lord Iron](http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/the-cambist-and-lord-iron-a-fairy-tale-of-economics/?xcbv) is a short collection of economically themed fables. They are mainly focused on how people value things, not anything too in depth or complicated about financial systems.

    [Asteroid Monetization](https://sprague-grundy.github.io/asteroid_monetization/) is a short story about a novel investment strategy.

    For a deranged DnD campaign with lots of interplanar trading: [Tale of an Industrious Rogue](https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Tale_of_an_Industrious_Rogue,_Part_I)."Tale of an Industrious Rogue is the story of how a simple dungeon feature and a party's thirst for gold combine to create a rollercoaster ride of greed, ingenuity, and global economic meltdown."

    Not related to the real world at all, but you might enjoy Max Gladstone's Craft Sequence. Three Parts Dead has a magical lawyer dropping out of magic law school (literally) and going to work on the bankruptcy of a church - which involves performing necromancy on the body of their god, to wind down all of his pending contracts. Five Full Fathoms has religion as venture capital, with a literal pool of deities.

    [The Baru Cormorant series](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/23444482-the-traitor-baru-cormorant) follows an accountant on a quest to dismantle a colonial empire from within. Clever economics play a major role in it — it's the primary tool of both the protagonist and her enemy. And if you're looking for stories focusing on "connections between the financial world and everything else", I think this is a particularly good fit: the protagonist's perspective on the world is starkly coloured by her specialization.

  I've been enjoying [Hermione learns a thing](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/hermione-learns-a-thing.991079/) this week. It has a pretty fun premise, what if Hermione discovered magic a few years before the Hogwarts letters went out? (and was also like 50 iq points higher) My only quibble is that the intelligence boost leaves Hermione unbelievable as a very young child, but the process of slowly working out a new system of magic is delightful.
  ```

  - u/grekhaus:
    ```
    Disagree.

    The central premise is that Hermione (an eight year old child with no prior exposure to existing magical theory) makes dozens of unique discoveries which no other witch or wizard (including the muggleborn ones, so it's not even a question of worldview or mathematical education) has ever come close to learning about, despite the wizarding world having had literal millennia to investigate the question and every incentive to do so. 

    In effect, Hermione just has access to do-anything psychic powers which the narrative insists are definitely for realsies part of the existing magical system of Harry Potter and which any wizard who was as smart as Hermione could have figured out themselves. And not only that, it can be taught to muggles which is one of the very few things that the existing setting rules out as definitely impossible to do.
    ```

    - u/sl236:
      ```
      > which no other witch or wizard (including the muggleborn ones, so it's not even a question of worldview or mathematical education)

      To be fair, in canon the wizarding world is very small, and wizards are universally presented as holding the idiot ball pretty much the entire time, even the muggleborn ones - cf. any interaction with muggle technology at all ever. 

      Moreover, we see almost no indication in canon of school actually teaching anything at all except the recital of teachers' passwords by rote (what this says about Rowling's own experience of education is left as an exercise for the reader). All canon teaching is presented as just-so stories; no time AT ALL is ever spent on learning how wizards came to know what they know. No orderly building of knowledge brick by discoverable brick based on existing foundations is ever presented; no theories are formed, no experiments take place, no proofs are discussed, no coherent models of the world that might help one identify and fill gaps in one's understanding are constructed, no incremental knowledge-gaining process is described. The only canon way to learn facts about magic that the teacher has not yet taught you by rote is to read ahead in the textbook and memorise the contents.

      Nothing in canon supports the theory that systematical research into magic is a thing that has ever taken place or that can take place - one might accidentally stumble upon knowledge when trying things at random, but existing knowledge is never shown to yield any insight or pattern that might help one learn new things, nor is there any connection between the barrage of random factoids the teachers teach. (Nothing rules out rational research, either, of course, but if any happens in canon, it happens entirely offscreen).

      Being muggleborn doesn't help here - kids are indoctrinated into this world and mindset from a preteen age, and so would have to already be, well, Hermione or HPMOR!Harry at that age to stand a reasonable chance of escaping the effect.

      So building a rational work on top of these underpinnings does require a series of radical departures - a child genius, or a herculean effort of worldbuilding to fill in - not even so much the gaps in the canon world as the ENTIRE REST OF THE WORLD around the few tiny islands of canon Rowling has populated - or both.
      ```

        ```
        > The only canon way to learn facts about magic that the teacher has not yet taught you by rote is to read ahead in the textbook and memorise the contents.

        Snape inventing spells as a student is a major plot point in the sixth book. Bill invents a spell to keep people with the Dark Mark out of an area. Dumbledore and Voldemort both create novel forms of magic. Nicholas Flamel invents the Philosopher's Stone. The Weasley Twins are seen inventing all sorts of novel enchanted items. Hell, if Pottermore is to be believed, even Gilderoy Lockhart (who is presented as being basically an idiot) manages to reverse engineer the Dark Mark in order to display his face instead. Pandora Lovegood dying as a result of a magical experiment gone wrong certainly suggests that magical experiments are a thing that can be done.

        Magical research is clearly both possible and ongoing in the setting. It's possibly *unsystematic*, but given that they're trying new things, writing down the results and iterating on past discoveries, I would hardly call it *unscientific*. Which is entirely beside the point - even if it were all unscientific, it clearly produces results. So it would be *deeply weird* for an eight year old child with no theory to stumble across novel results which no other witch in the Harry Potter universe has ever accomplished, despite numerous other young muggleborn witches having been presumably in her position (knowing magic exists, having a vague idea of how to get accidental magic to occur, wanting to do things via magic) and failing to accomplish anything remotely similar.

        Now, if I didn't know better from the author's prior writing, I might maybe be willing to entertain the premise that this is a deeply AU version of the Harry Potter setting where *all* magic works according to the principles of Psionics as presented within this fanfiction and the Wizarding World looks nothing like the setting depicted in the Harry Potter books or films, aside from the names of the characters. But I do know better and I will literally film myself eating a hat if that turns out to be the case.
        ```

        - u/IICVX:
          ```
          Judging by his notes in the margin of the book, Snape "inventing" a spell was literally just a process of trying random words until one of them worked.

          - u/SpeakKindly:
            ```
            So would systematic magic research in the Harry Potter setting look like putting a lot of wizards into cubicles and randomly generating pseudo-Latin spells for them to chant until one works?

            Considering that HPMOR!Harry has a good reason to be the way he is, that's not a particularly convincing argument. 

            Granted, a lot of how much suspension of disbelief you're willing to give has to do with how much you trust the author. Given that this one is written by the author of Distance Learning, there's not a lot of trust on my part.
            ```

    - u/Airgineer1:
      ```
      Fair enough, however the only people the "magic" has been taught to has been members of Hermione's family and it is on the level of floating a pencil being exhausting. I'm pretty sure the author is trying to put forward magic as being genetic, and that muggleborns are the children of squibs that reintegrated into muggle society. (and thus would have a liiiiitle bit of magic)

      Also, we actually haven't seen wizarding society as a whole yet in story, so there may be a bunch of AU shenanigans going on.
      ```

      - u/grekhaus:

        I mean, maybe. But based on Distance Learning from the same author, I'm inclined to think that everyone who isn't the main character is probably going to have the idiot ball surgically implanted into their forehead.

      > Without: Civilization V

      It would probably physically hurt me to play Civ V without [Vox Populi](https://forums.civfanatics.com/forums/community-patch-project.497/) at this point.

        The Omnimatter mod series may be of interest to you. It replaces all ores with omnimatter, which must then be crafted to create anything. It makes the game simpler in some ways, as logistics becomes easier since all ore patches are interchangeable, but it also dramatically lengthens recipe chains, because in order to get plastic, first you must go through the whole process of turning omnimatter into water and oil, and going through that whole chain.

    Kerbal Space Program, especially modded. You may want to wait for the sequel to come out later this year, though.

    I've been playing Slay the Spire pretty regularly since some time in 2019, and Celeste on and off since either middle of 2018 or so. Both have basically no skill ceiling (or at least no skill ceiling that I'm likely to ever hit), and are well designed to let you smoothly get better at them, so have a lot of capacity for just keeping playing and getting better at them.

    I can't think of any other examples though - maybe some from back in the 90s when there was less to do (e.g. it's not impossible Civilisation 2 was this).

    Edit to add: I guess it also depends on how you count. I've e.g. replayed Chrono Trigger multiple times, with several decades between the first and most recent time I've played it, but I wouldn't really say I've got decades of play out of it.

    Total War Warhammer 2. 3 just came out, but it's been a buggy release and some odd campaign mechanic choices mean that I can't really recommend it all that strongly for a few months.

    The series builds on the previous versions though, in that by owning TWW1 you are able to play as those races in TWW2, and on a huge "Mortal Empires" map combining the two games' maps. 3 is going to have one combing all 3 games' maps, called Immortal Empires, but that's not coming out for a few months probably.

    Skyrim after heavy modding - I hear [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/) makes Skyrim modding much easier now, though I haven't gotten around to trying it myself.

    I've enjoyed other games a great deal and put a lot of time into them, but other than inherently replayable multiplayer games I don't think any have lasted for 2 years. Terraria with friends, maybe, if you include long gaps between playthroughs?

    Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup. Roguelike, play in your browser, free and open source.

    Heroes of Might and Magic 2, 3, and 4 - three is considered the best. There's a mod that makes it HD and some small QoL tweaks. Turn based strategy game. Very cheap on GOG.

    To echo a point about online competitive multiplayer games - they're the only games I can replay each time since the competitive aspect changes how you view it - more like a sport and less of a game. I find myself analysing gameplay like I do with basketball or tennis.

    Games I've played for years:

    1. Smash Bros Ultimate - Online infra is awful, but still incredibly fun, I play regularly with a friend and we've versed each other so much we're really hyper aware of the others faults. Rivals of Aether is a really good version for PC, though it's got a very small community in comparison.
    2. Rocket League - car soccer is incredibly deep and at the higher levels, probably looks like what quidditch seekers would play. I'm still mediocre, but it's still a great game I come back to.
    3. Overwatch - the game that got me back into fps's again. Instead of twitch reflex, it's a lot about map awareness and ability use and baits. Reminds me of playing a fighting game in many ways.
    4. Apex Legends - never thought I'd enjoy a battle royale but it scratches the same itch as overwatch without so many of it's problems (avoids the lows but misses the best parts).

      if you haven't seen it before, it sounds like you specifically may be interested in [Spy Party](http://www.spyparty.com/) an asymmetric 1v1 game where one player is a spy at a party trying not to get found out and the other player is a sniper trying to spot them.

    Dwarf Fortress is a construction and management simulation and roguelike indie video game. You control a team of seven dwarves building a home, attracting migrants, engaging in trade, and dealing with monsters and environmental challenges. Very steep learning curve ... you MUST use the Dwarf Fortress wiki for help. On the plus side, it is a free game.

    Edit: BTW, Dwarf Fortress inspired the folks behind Minecraft ... in fact, DF is like Minecraft for grown-ups! :-P

      Dwarf Fortress is a colony management sim. Rather than jumping in now, I'd wait until the steam version is released (it's supposed to happen this year), as it will help a lot with the learning curve. The game has changed a lot in response to arguably better implementations such as Rimworld and Co, but jumping in on the current public version won't let you see much of that.

    Factorio is definitely up there. It's been my go-to comfort game for something like 4 years now. There's something so satisfying about putting together a giant factory with a bunch of logic-controlled trains.

    Minecraft multiplayer was the game I consistently came back to in high school, but it hasn't been able to recapture my interest.

    Competitive games are great for this - for me it’s Super Smash Bros. Melee w/ thousands of hours over the last 5ish years

    DOTA2, Factorio, FTL, Into the Breach, various XCOMs, and Starcraft 2 are the ones that come to mind.

    Idle Apocalypse, which despite the name is not very idle. It's a resource management game where you run a doomsday cult stuck in a time loop and *this time* you'll manage to destroy the world!
