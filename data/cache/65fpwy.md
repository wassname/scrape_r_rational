## Is it possible for a character to be superintelligent but not Rational?

### Post:

I've been toying with the idea of a character who wishes to max out his INT score, but doesn't think to do the same to his WIS score, so he ends up having a vast intellect but not really knowing how to use it (e.g., he can quickly figure out a riddle if given the clues but often overlooks fairly obvious details, or he can figure out the answer to a question fairly quickly  but struggles to ask the right questions in the first place). He might be aware of the principles of rationality on an intellectual level but fail to put them into practice.

Obviously, we're talking about an intelligence that can't easily self-modify, but other than that, could such a character be written in a consistent manner, or would contradictions start popping up?

  Try a character who thinks really fast (and can therefore brute-force problems he knows how to do easily) but isn't great at synthesizing information, and falls prey to logical fallacies relatively often.

  Real life people are wildly inconsistent.  Hardcore Vulcan in one area. fuzzy headed Hippie in another.  It's absurd.

  Being superintelligent will let you guess the consequences of actions and predict events with uncanny clarity, but it doesn't in and of itself help you understand what you want.  At the least, deception should be fairly easy to spot, but without introspection from such superintelligence implicit assumptions will still go unchallenged and contradictions can lie in wait until they make a problem 'unsolveable'.

  It should be trivial for a person with superintelligence to start noticing internal inconsistency through introspection, but with the INT/WIS divide you're dealing with I have to assume such influences are forbidden.  Thus, your character is not just superintelligent but also forbidden from using that superintelligence for introspection.  Perhaps they're limited to just normal human cognition for such a task, or their seeming internal contradictions can only be removed through buffing WIS.

  The rules that human brains tend to come packaged with sort of derive from our core values, but also from expected context.  Certain lines that you can't help but see as sinister, for example, because our brains come packaged knowing that most usages of that line are sinister, so it's okay to just automatically read the line as sinister.  If it's not sinister, this leads to dissonance in the sense that we 'know' that it's a sinister line but can't see any reason for that.  Superintelligence should let your character realize that it's just *usually* a sinister line, but not automatically, and note that the reflex cannot be trusted, but with the INT/WIS divide all that can result is they notice confusion but trying to analyze the situation is like slamming their head against a brick wall.

  If you want a descriptive way to present it, you might be able to say that he looks inwards, but gets caught up in the minutia of his thought and the workings of his thought processes are far too intricate for him to comprehend, leaving him frustrated and unable to solve the problem, as if his own intelligence became a trap ensnaring his attempts at introspection in a web of detail and useless information.

    I think what I had in mind was more along the lines of a character who knows what his common errors are, but lacks the patience and discipline necessary to train himself out of them.

  They were so caught up with the fact that they *could* that they never stopped to consider whether they *should*.

  It could be written as the type of personality which is easily sidetracked by intellectual possibility. Or one which has little to no self-awareness (or will), and thus tends to do what they're told (or what's suggested) without regard for longer-term consequences.

  One literary example which is sort of in the same ballpark is Terry Pratchett's [Leonard da Quirm](https://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/Leonard_of_Quirm); the sort of person who doesn't bother to check if they're about to walk off a cliff because they'd probably be able to figure out a solution to falling - or gravity - before they hit the bottom.

  Several people have pointed out that nominally intelligent but irrational characters are rife in media, but the hard part isn't just making a Lex Luthor or Dr. Strange, it's rationally constructing a character who's believably very intelligent but also irrational.

  I think this is quite doable, because such people exist. Issac Newton is a perfect example; blisteringly intelligent, but going in the wrong directions an awful lot of the time.

  As you point out, in order for a very intelligent person to be irrational, there has to be something blocking their intelligence from engineering its own rationality. As far as I can tell this usually manifests in two ways: Hardware and Firmware.

  Hardware is when they've got a pathological mental state. This was a big factor with Newton--he poisoned himself pretty badly with mercury and other chemicals that left him more than a little crazy. He had pretty bad paranoia that manifested in his lashing out at friends over imagined offenses and engaging in very odd practices and behaviors.

  I've heard that there have been some studies that posit a link between extreme intelligence and mental illness. Mathematical modeling of neurons suggests that humans are about at the limit of how far you can push that processing architecture before error rates start to soar. In other words, if you get someone whose brain works abnormally fast, it will probably encounter an abnormal amount of errors. Can't find the source for that right now, though, so take with salt.

  The second way brains malfunction, which is usually present along with the first but doesn't necessitate it, is Firmware. In human terms, epistemology. Without an epistemic basis conducive to rationality, the ability of even a very intelligent mind to self-correct toward that state is severely hindered. There are smart people who gamble, are religious, or [work very hard on pseudoscience](https://www.quora.com/Pseudoscience-What-are-some-of-the-craziest-ideas-held-by-Nobel-Prize-winners).

  What if they were prone to reacting badly to things and getting iveremotional? No-one is super rational when they're angry or afraid (or in love, for that matter)

  There's a comic called The Gamer where the main character did that literally. But his intelligence is mostly just used for getting lots of mana rather than actually solving problems, so it doesn't feel like much of an example.

  In Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, he often runs into problems from not having enough wisdom. For example, he came up with some theory for how magic didn't really depend on the words you say and that it was just to make you focus on the spell, put tons of work into this whole set of experiments for it, and then found out that he was completely wrong on the first experiment. He just assumed his theory was right and wanted to test details of it.

    I don't think the HPMOR example is him being irrational.

    I mean he had a hypothesis and he tested it. That's the basis of scientific inquiry. It doesn't mater that he was wrong.

    I guess maybe your point is that he put too much effort into thinking about future tests to try in the event that his first test was a success?

    Even if that's the case I still don't think that's exactly irrational so long as he didn't use up time/resources that he absolutely should have been spending on something else.

      A better HPMOR example is when he abused time travel to "win" an argument with Snape.

      He did all this ridiculous stuff to "beat" him, and almost ended up leaving the school and alienating some very powerful people, just to "win".

  Is it possible\plausible? Yes. Will including such a character harm the story’s quality though? Likely, if done incorrectly or with a wrong character (especially with the protagonist).

  Here are several ways in which I see such a combination working:

  * high intelligence that’s running on inefficient principles:
   * highly intelligent but not rational character — the high intelligence in this case could be defined in terms of memory, reaction time, imagination and visualisation, abstract thinking, reading speed, “processing power”, etc. The Intelligence attribute in *[The Games We Play](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/RyuugisTheGamesWePlay)* was kinda responsible for these kinds of things, for example. And it’s possible for the character to have all these enhanced qualities and have no idea what to do with them, how to use them efficiently, rationally, and wisely.  
   * highly intelligent but not wise character — depends on how Intelligence and Wisdom are defined in your story, but overall still workable.
   * highly intelligent character with an ineffective worldview system and principles — a prejudiced or biased intelligent character, for instance, will have some blind spots and a pattern of making certain types of bad decisions (e.g. Voldemort).
   * highly intelligent character with certain psychological inhibitions — e.g. an intelligent character with [learned helplessness.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness) 
   * highly intelligent character with severely limited worldview — The protagonist of *[The Girl with All the Gifts](https://www.goodreads.com/series/202735-the-girl-with-all-the-gifts)* is like this at the beginning of the story (then it slowly slides into being an [InformedAttribute\).](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute) She was described as being very intelligent, but all the information about the outside world she could get was the unbalanced and measly bits and pieces received from her teachers, so she didn’t have much ground to work on. 
  * highly intelligent character that has bad emotional control — an intelligent but lazy character, or one that can’t make themselves stop caring about revenge even when it’s harming their long-term goals. Or one that’s having problems with focusing on delayed gratification.
  * highly intelligent character that has an outbalancing mental disorder — paranoia, for example, or delusions.

  Lots of characters are like that in mainstream media: Take super villains like Lex Luthor for example.

  Not the way you'd like them to be. "Superintelligent" typically means "Thinks better than a human" and "Rational" means "Thinks well". They're evaluative claims that include the observer's standards of good thinking. If you have very high standards for what qualifies as good thinking, then you can have a non-rational superintelligent character, but that is trivial since "rational people" is probably is an empty set in that case. 

  As other commentors have noted, you can have characters that think fast but not well, or characters that know lots of things but apply the knowledge poorly. I would avoid explicitly labling your contrasting properties as "rational" and "superintelligent", though.

  This sounds a lot like a manwha I picked up a while back called The Gamer. Main character basically for REASONS OF PLOT^TM gains classic-era RPG character properties (inventory, numerical stats, skills, etc), and decides to dump most of his points into INT. Has a massive mana pool and can memorize and recall facts instantly and in great detail, but outside of his personal specialty of essentially being a korean MMO grinding addict, he's actually not that bright, having left WIS almost completely at base stats.

  He seems pretty internally consistent, often having to brute-force problems with more magical firepower rather then by outwitting his foes.

  This sort of character appears commonly in fiction; it's the 'mad scientist' archetype. They have the raw intelligence to solve whatever problem attracts their attention... but even if they aren't actually 'mad' in the sense of being afflicted with a mental illness, they tend to be obsessive and narrowly-focused.

  Such a character may well come across as inconsistent, if written poorly. To get around this, you need to demonstrate their reasoning to the audience, especially if it's flawed. The mad scientist shouldn't make mistakes simply because he picked up the idiot ball. Instead, perhaps he got bored partway through and went to do something else... or, inversely, was so totally focused on his one specific project that he neglected to handle some critical but mundane detail.

    Humans are *really* good at compartmentalizing things. Being able to apply bleeding-edge statistical techniques to your research on immortality elixers does not necessarily mean you're good at finding your keys in the morning, even if, say, constructing a probability distribution of places-your-keys-generally-are and finding an efficient search pattern looks like a very similar problem.

  Larry Niven's Pak. They're superintelligent but have some nasty hardwired goals that make cooperation almost impossible. The Pak homeworld is covered in radioactive craters. The Ringworld almost gets destroyed like twice because basically every variety of Pak has the same problem. Louis Wu ends up having to trick himself to get rebuilt as a human to keep his Pak nature from messing him up.

  OK, maybe this could be "Larry Niven can't write superintelligent characters" but they're not completely unconvincing.

  One variant of this that I have enjoyed playing in RPGs is the very clever but does a poor job of considering the long term consequences of their actions variety. Good at coming up with creative plans for solving the immediate problem that they are faced with, but often having longer term consequences (for example when the web of lies finally collapses) that are totally ignored.

  I suppose, for example, a character who is very good at the deducing, but for some reason has very... questionable assumptions. Simplest way is to make said character a bit insane, which can be played for laughs, I guess.
