    Or even just use of Bayes theorem properly. It is expected that after drinking they'll want more drinks, so there's no reason to update.

      Actually you should just update before even taking the experiment, rather than not updating after :p

      Right but the point is that their drunkenness causes them to fail to use Bayes' theorem properly, in a way that they don't realize, again because of their state of drunkenness.

      Thus why you need the Schelling Fence.

  Are statistical modelers unpopular?
