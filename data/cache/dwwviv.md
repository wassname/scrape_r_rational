  Readers familiar with Skybreaker's Call might notice that the incident at the end didn't unfold quite the way it was described in the original serialized version. There are several reasons for that, one of which will become clearer in the next installment.

    I've been enjoying this a lot, thanks for writing it! Its been a long time since I read skybreaker's call, so I don't remember the incident. If I was going to read back and check it out, where should I go?

      It's Flicker's excuse to Doc for why she stopped regularly partnering with Journeyman in Chapter 5 here: https://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/67179812420/skybreakers-call-chapter-5

      It was weak writing at the time (I wince reading it now) and I can no longer find a plausible way to write around all the details even as an excuse.  So they are going to change slightly when I eventually edit Call to put it into book form. (It needs to be edited anyway to change Flicker's age to 16.)  That's the other reason the details are different.

      What isn't going to change: Flicker had a traumatic experience with social spontaneity with Journeyman that strongly affected their relationship, and she didn't share the details with Doc.

        Interesting. “Flicker tried to cuddle” vs “Flicker gets naked and propositions sex then stalks him around the world until she corners him for a final confrontation” are very different scenes to me.

  I wonder if he teleported out because Flicker scared him or if something else was going on. Also, I'm kind of surprised that Flicker seemed to fall asleep without meaning to. She is usually fairly deliberate about all of her actions. I guess it shows how comfortable she is around him.

    ```
    He wasn't *physically* frightened, but there are plenty of other reasons to be scared, and several something else's are going on 8-)
    Flicker is comfortable around him (and sleep deprived), and she completed all her 'things I need to do before sleeping safely' checklist while she was in a place where it was easy to fall asleep.
    ```
