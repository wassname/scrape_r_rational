  I am pretty convinced this is intentionally over the top. The truth is too convoluted, and too dangerous for public consumption- I think Harry knows perfectly well that the inner circle is going to question him, and he will have to explain things, but I think he is creating the public facing myth- he knows that this event is going down in history no matter what, and he has already seen how the stories get out of control, he is simply laying the foundation for the best public outcome.

    Now I'm wondering if deliberate gimcrackery is *normal* for their world's historians and historiographers.

    Oy gevalt.

  I am worried that he's going to get away with this conspiracy scheme. [I mean, come on](http://lesswrong.com/lw/uy/dark_side_epistemology/):

  > Once you tell a lie, the truth is your enemy; and every truth connected to that truth, and every ally of truth in general; all of these you must oppose, to protect the lie.  Whether you're lying to others, or to yourself.

  [And:](http://lesswrong.com/lw/v2/prices_or_bindings/)

  > If you'll lie when the fate of the world is at stake, and others can guess that fact about you, then, at the moment when the fate of the world *is* at stake, that's the moment when your words become the whistling of the wind.

  But there are only five chapters left, so I have no idea how this new plot is going to be resolved unless Harry gets away with it. How the hell could anyone trust him after telling such an enormous lie like that?

    >Once you tell a lie, the truth is your enemy

    True, but in this case he doesn't have much of a choice. 

    He just discovered that he is Voldemort's eigenself. Then he took the Stone, which it turns out combined with the True Patronus Charm is a resurrection device. Then he killed many Death Eaters, many of whom were very politically connected, and erased and transmuted Voldemort to bypass his defences.

    In addition, he lost his greatest and most powerful political ally in the process. Possibly both of them if Malfoy finds out Harry killed his father.

    That is not information that is conducive to him living a long and/or happy life in any way shape or form if it gets out to the generally irrational and still-much-more-powerful than him rest of the world.

      Eigenself? 

      Sorry, Google isn't turning anything up. Wiktionary gives "own" or "self" as possible meanings and I think I'm getting the idea from there (and context), but it's a better idea to just ask like somebody who's been living under a rock.

      - u/CeruleanTresses:
        ```
        It basically means a copy of yourself that splits off at a given point in your existence and then goes on to do its own thing. It shows up a lot in *Accelerando.*
        ```

        - u/PeridexisErrant:
          ```
          When most people say "clone", they're thinking "eigenself", not "identical twin".

          This sometimes gets silly, with eg. Naruto's 'shadow clone' technique.
          ```

      - u/JackStargazer:
        ```
        It's a term from some science fiction stories, most notably to me *Accellerando* by Charles Stross.

        An eigenself is another person who, at one point, was either a copy of your mind-state or branched off for the same original mind as you did. In some stories it also covers people who are from different Everett branches (alternate reality selves) but I use it here in the first definition.

        Eigenselves will retain the memories of their progenitor, and likely most of their morals, but will have different life experiences and so can still change significantly.

    In this universe, he can reasonably decide to tell someone only after they become a perfect Occlumens.  He can even tell them beforehand, "Hermoine, there are some things I haven't told you, and I can only tell them to you after you become a perfect Occlumens."

    I'm not saying it won't damage trust and all that other stuff, but in this world/society, if someone tells you that kind of secret AFTER you become a perfect Occlumens then it seems like it would be easier to forgive them lying to you until that point, especially if you warned them that there were secrets you'd been keeping from them.
    ```

    - u/kaukamieli:
      ```
      He can also say the secret is related to the incident, but he can't say how, because it's a huge magical secret, which is true in many ways.
      ```

      - u/PeridexisErrant:
        ```
        "I refuse to share information relating to Atlantean artefacts or covered by the Interdict of Merlin.  Multiple prophecies and an unbreakable vow are involved."

        That should do it...
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          There was a lot made of how all wizards seem to know, even if only Quirrell seemed to always remember, that if a wizard firmly tells you you can't know something magical (e.g. how come your patronus killed that dementor) you don't push.

          It'd be interesting to see how that balances out with grave yard full of headless corpses, a resurrected student and a forgetful Voldemort.
          ```

  - u/MoralRelativity:
    ```
    Harry's effectively saying "I wasn't involved" but Dumbledore is going to be able to contradict that when (if?) he gets back.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I suppose it wouldn't be beyond Voldemort to have a minion polyjuiced as Harry Potter on hand as leverage in case Dumbledore managed to interfere. He can probably at least get reasonable doubt with that given that he was sitting under a widely discussed banner at the Quidditch match with everyone else the whole time. As long Dumbledore takes more than a Time Turner resetting day to get out of the mirror any evidence to the contrary might be gone.
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        The bigger issue is explaining how the Cloak of True Invisibility went from being in Harry's possession, to Voldemort's possession, back to Harry's possession. Because if Harry were telling the truth, and Dumbledore saw what he saw, then you would expect the Cloak to be at the crime scene, which it isn't.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          Ah, yeah, good point. That might be the one piece of physical evidence that turns it from "Dumbledore knows what he saw" to "and he can prove it".
          ```

- u/RandomDamage:
  ```
  Not the best way to play it, McGonnagal might get to wondering how he's aware of some of these things. Especially when she is able to discover them herself and he doesn't *need* to reveal them.
  ```

  - u/JackStargazer:
    ```
    That's only if you assume that McGonnagal can step outside what she expects and notice that she is confused.

    I don't think she will. Harry appears genuine here, she was never privy to all the information about his scar, and Dumbledore is not around to contradict him or inform her.
    ```

    - u/RandomDamage:
      ```
      Forced status changes have an amazing ability to jar people from their mental boxes. My guess is that something he said here triggers her suspicions and that is how things go "not exactly to plan".
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        The idea that HPMOR Harry Potter's most important plan fails because he's too clever about it, the theme of overly complicated plans only working in plays has come before after all, would be an interesting way to wrap up the story.
        ```

      She upgraded to PC after Hermione's death. She knows.
