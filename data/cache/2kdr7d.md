  I have to say, I'm really enjoying this story the most out of all the HPMOR spinoffs.

  The characterization is close, the plot is good, and I like the use of the True Patronus Charm and the Interdict.

  I don't know, Draco seems too easily convinced in this chapter.

  It seems he become better rationalist than Harry, and his only flaw is being too gullible towards Harry.

    ```
    Probably this refers to learning the True Patronus Charm.
    ```

      And teaching it to others. So all that obliviating isn't going to help.
