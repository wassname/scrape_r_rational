## WtC - How far would Amarylis go?

### Post:

Amaryllis has stated would bash in June's skull if it helped save the world.

She's also quite willing to modify her own soul to remove her romantic feelings for him and improve herself as a person.

So here's a sobering thought: would she go so far as to manipulate his soul to make HIM a better person?

From chapter 146:

>Amaryllis placed her hand on my shoulder, with her thumb touching the base of my throat. She closed her eyes, and began frowning in concentration. She should have been at Essentialism 15, which for me had made the process far from automatic, but still doable in short order with some effort. I wasn’t sure how long it would take her to make her survey, nor whether I would know if she were infected, so I was left to wait, and with nothing to do but look at her.  
>  
>We weren’t usually so close to each other. We were almost never touching. If she was paying attention to my heart rate as she tried to find the pathway to my soul, it was possible that she would feel my pulse speeding up, just from our proximity. Back near the beginning, when we weren’t so close, I’d had some fantasies about Amaryllis, fantasies that I’d done my best to squash, and fantasies that were returning, unbidden. She was too pretty, like every line of her had been made by an artist’s hand, and if I let my guard drop for even a moment, it was easy to be mesmerized.  
>  
>I found myself wondering what I was waiting for. Why hadn’t I tried to make a better case for myself? Why wasn’t I trying harder to be the person that she wanted me to be, especially if it was the person that *I* wanted to be too? Uther was my point of comparison, and while I didn’t want to be him, the things that he’d accomplished before leaving were so far beyond what I had managed to do that they seemed more like myth than reality. Amaryllis … left to her own devices in a parallel timeline, she had conquered as much of the world as she possibly could have, with only a slight bit of cheating. I wanted to be with her, whether as a friend or not, and I knew that if we were going to keep things copacetic between us, I would have to be more like her, more driven, more ambitious. I knew that I should be anyway, even if she wasn’t around.  
>  
>I should have gone home and faced whatever terrible thing the Dungeon Master had planned for me there.

I find the last paragraph interesting.  Mary starts connecting to his soul, and immediately June starts reconsidering his motivations and resolving to be better - specifically, to be \*more like Amaryllis.\*

Now, the default reading is that this was just a natural result of his experiences in the library and reading about the "Cypress" timeline.  No meddling required.  But the nasty part about soul magic, applied carefully and subtly, is that small boosts to things you already care about would be virtually undetectable.

I'm not claiming this is what happened, but I think it's an interesting hypothetical. ;)

  The theory that Amaryllis manipulated his soul there is as old as the chapter, and has been pretty extensively discussed. The fact that so many people seemingly independently have had the idea is, in fairness, a point in its favour.

  There's much to say on the subject on whether she *would* do it, given the opportunity. Equally important, however, is the question of whether she *could* do it, and as it stands, the answer is no, because that's exactly the sort of thing the meme protects against, a fact which has been reinforced in later chapters.
  ```

    ```
    Didn't they taint each other with the meme and then spirit-proofed themselves for safety? That would be a simple and quite unbreakable protection. They should be able to modify each other souls.
    ```

    - u/LupoCani:
      ```
      That's exactly what they were doing in that scene, meaning Amaryllis did not yet have protection from the meme. Juniper inoculates her a few paragraphs later.
      ```

- u/Watchful1:
  ```
  But we know that the soul reverts to its default state relatively quickly. Soul mages have to either take advantage of the new loyalty quickly or reinforce it every few days, neither of which happens here.

  I think it's mostly a trust exercise as a plot point for us readers. Just a way for Juniper to think about his relationship and thoughts about Mary.
  ```

    ```
    changes to the soul do take reinforcing to maintain - but what if it's a value the person had anyway, and that is being reinforced in non-magical ways?  what if it's just a small tip at a balance point to help the person have a realization or thought that becomes self-reinforcing?  it wouldn't require constant intervention if it's something he actually does want, but isn't acting on yet.
    ```

- u/burnerpower:
  ```
  Juniper checks his soul and spirit a couple chapters later when he fights Harold and finds no changes. She definitely didn't meddle with his soul. Even from a purely utilitarian perspective this would be a terrible move anyway. If she actually was going to do this she should just make him a Fallatehr style slave as that would be more effective and unlikely to backfire.

  Besides in this same scene she gets hit by the meme. She never had the opportunity anyway.

      I don't like arguing on a narrative level, but yes Amaryllis does think that way. That's just more reason why she wouldn't bother with even subtle modifications. A narrative hates secrets and from a narrative perspective the moment she transgresses it is destined to come out at the worst time. She has argued multiple times against secret keeping using this exact logic in the story.
      ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I don't think she changed his soul, but I also don't think her only motivation there was to innoculate herself against the meme. Instead I think at that point she had stopped modifying her soul to prevent herself from loving him, and wanted to check his values regarding her to see how much he might reciprocate. Also to see how much he was over Fenn's loss, since she likely doesn't trust him to be more honest about it than his own soul.
  ```

- u/AStartlingStatement:
  ```
  This has been discussed quite a few times. I personally feel that Amaryllis did not and would not do this simply because she understands narrative better than anyone on the team, and doing this would - by story rules - not only *absolutely* result in an inevitable shocking reveal, but it also would happen at the worst possible time in a trust-shattering revelation that would end in disaster.
  ```

  On a completely unrelated note, I just read that bit from the same chapter:

  > “I don’t think you understand how many entads I had,” said Amaryllis. “Poison wasn’t really a concern.” She took a breath. “Anyway, I saw Lisi at those dinners. We were close enough in age, reasonably ambitious, reasonably talented, and we’d both come to the attention of our aunt Rosemallow.”

  FORESHADOWIIIIIIIING!
  ```

  - u/wren42:
    ```
    to Mary's mom?
    ```

- u/Norseman2:
  ```
  This is a good point. I'm assuming that there are entads or magical means to readily discern lying or compel truth, and I'm sure Amaryllis would be worried about being forced to admit to having tampered with Joon's soul if she were to carry out such a plan. However, since memories are stored in the soul, and she now has the ability to tamper with her own soul through essentialism, she could conceivably take some time to locate and remove the memory of having done so. She could even write herself a note with some vague explanation relating the memory editing to some other justifiable self-modification, and then remove that memory, see the note and bluff herself into thinking that she's modified her own memory just as a test or something.
  ```

  I feel like this is kind of in the same category as 'what if the DM adjusted his mind!'.  Like, presumably anybody who does the mind control gig will adjust the value of 'do I mind if I get mind controlled' such that even if anyone finds out it'll be no big deal.

  If the protag isn't original flavor Juniper, but is in fact DM flavored, or Mary flavored, or Bethel flavored or whatever else...I kind of don't care?  Like, the updates since these hypothetical events haven't seemed worse, to me, than those before.  So...I'm alright with it?
