  From the comments there:

  > A minstrel is someone who tries to do good in a court setting
  ```

  - u/ZeroNihilist:
    ```
    Simpler to say "a Minstrell is a court Singer".
    ```

  ```
  Is it my impression, or have these chapters become shorter and shorter? Anyway, I guess we finally know why Aaron tried to compare Ana to the Comet King's wife.

  >SEVEN MINUTES, JALA. THAT WAS SEVEN MINUTES AND FOURTEEN SECONDS. 

  I googled "bible 7:14" and got the following verses (It's probably Isiah, although it *is* his second meeting of the day):

  Isiah 7:14:
  >Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel.

  2 Chronicles 7:14
  > if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land.

  Alternatively, he was in there for 434 seconds, which has [interesting correspondences](http://www.biblewheel.com/GR/GR_434.php), especially relating to birth and to thrones.

  > I'm pretty and charismatic

  Um, that wasn't the demonstration of charisma I expected. More.... painfully blunt. Though I guess it was the right thing to say to the Comet King, so she read the situation correctly and maybe that's a demonstration of charisma?
  ```

  - u/ulyssessword:
    ```
    She's utilitarian-charismatic, not deontolological-charismatic.  She does things that end up with people following her and being inspired and devoted to her, not things that are traditionally associated with that result.

    Also, "charisma" is an interesting word choice, as [one definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charisma#Divinely_conferred_charisma) has charisma being divinely granted gifts/abilities.

  > Robin Minstrell

  [She's going to be eaten?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yciX2meIkXI&t=16s)

    ```
    Possibly she will be mocking people as they run away from their problems, too.
    ```

- u/Taborask:
  ```
  I immediately thought of Batman's sidekick Robin, not that she gave off a boy wonder vibe.
  ```
