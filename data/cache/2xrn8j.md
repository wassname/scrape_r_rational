## Writing in present vs past tense?

### Post:

Hi! What are your thoughts on writing in present or past tense? Which one do you prefer? Which one do you think is better?

  I find present tense stories quite jarring.  I also feel that it  makes it harder to use narration / exposition, as having the narrative voice in present tense is odd.

  Present tense can make a story feel urgent and present, giving a strong sense of pace, but it can also be jarring and off putting. It can be quite exhausting to read something that is set in present tense. It can also constrain the type of stories you can tell in a way that past tense does not. For an excellent example of where it works, try reading the Night Circus (which is a lovely book anyway).

  I definitely prefer past tense. That said, in my own writing there is one exception. When my villain who as just returned from death mind reads a main character, she does so very extensively, and I made it stream of consciousness. That would really not have worked in past tense.

  I almost always write in past tense. I tend to prefer stories written in past tense. However, there are a few exceptions:

  * [Sam Hughes is great](http://qntm.org/fiction) and most of it is present tense
  * Neal Stephenson mostly writes in present tense
  * Charles Stross has written a few books in *second person* present tense

  Mostly I think it's a matter of getting into the style for me - I won't put something down because it's in present tense, but I does take me out of the book up until the point that I get used to it. I've found that this is true of a lot of choices authors make about style and voice.

  As for pros and cons, the large point of picking out a tense is what you want the reader to feel on a subconscious level. People often make the claim that immediacy is the big benefit of present tense, and that grounding is the big benefit of past tense. I'm not entirely sure that I agree, but it's a popular line of thought.

  Note: I'm not much of a writer; this is exclusively from the perspective of a reader.

  Anyway, in my experience, either tense can work. As long as the story doesn't randomly change between tenses, I tend to be fine. *However*, an interesting pattern I've found is that it's much more jarring for me to read a past-tense story after spending a lot of time on present-tense ones than it is to read a present-tense one after spending a lot of time on past-tense ones. Kind of an interesting asymmetry.

  I'm currently writing a story in second person present tense with occasional digressions into past and future tense, and it is the most enjoyable way I've ever written fiction.

  My advice would be to slam out a couple paragraphs in each tense, making full use of the toys that tense gives you, to see which you enjoy writing in most.  If you enjoy working with the constraints you set for yourself, it will show up in your work, and your enjoyment of the work will be infectious.
