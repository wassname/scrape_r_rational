  [Addendum from Wildbow:](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/76zqqe/twig_has_ended_worm_2_on_thursdaysaturdaytuesday/dohyxtp/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=Parahumans)
  >Interim chapters start next update day, not Parahumans 2 chapters.

  [And more clarification on what comes next:](https://wildbow.wordpress.com/2017/10/17/an-end-to-the-twig-experiment/)
  >Worm 2 (Technically it’s Parahumans 2) is rolling out soon.  In the meantime, I’ll be dropping some very super minor tidbits on the Worm website.  These interim pieces will serve as kind of unofficial/prelude/tone-setting bits and will go up on my usual schedule, just as things for people to see if they’re keeping to their usual routine of checking in.  They will not be full-length chapters and may not even be 500 words long.

  >This will go on for a couple weeks (5-10 segments on the usual Tues/Possible Thurs/Sat schedule) and the final installment in the set will link to the site for the Worm sequel.  Links will also appear on all of my sites.  This will give me time to hopefully get some final preliminary work done, wrangle the mailing list, and (ideal world) fix my currently scattered sleep schedule.



  But yeah, go read Twig if you haven't. I don't think I can oversell how great it is.

              The power to generate additional dicks on hyper-arousal has incredibly interesting consequences, though! Is the matter to grow the dicks drawn from your body or created ex nihilo? Could you accidentally transmute your entire outer surface, or even your entire body, into dicks? Does this give researchers access to a limitless supply of dickmeat for in-vitro study so long as they can keep you aroused? Can we learn how to replicate this power and genetically implant it in embryos as a roundabout cure for ED? Could we modify the organ which replicates on arousal, or even make it possible to regenerate any organ or body part on orgasm? Is this power the one which will lead us down the road to immortality?

              All interesting questions to answer. All questions which can be scientifically examined. Let's begin, shall we?

        I feel like Parian's true power is either going to be a climactic reveal, a too-late moment of despair, or a doesn't-matter-anyway.

        I.e.:

        "Aha, but I can *also*..." *or*

        "Oh God, I could have been ... all this time?" *or*

        "But what if I ... inste— [murder noises]"
        ```

      - u/LazarusRises:
        ```
        Isn't Parian's true power just any kind of small-scale, fine-control telekinesis? Like Shatterbird but with anything small enough, i.e. sand, needles, rocks? I know this is a big mystery but given what we know about her power this seems very likely to me.

    I’m glad there’s a brief ‘breather’ of sorts. I need some time to dwell on the fact Twigs finished and it’s characters’ journeys have ended before getting hype for Worm 2.

      Agreed, due to Wyvern, my mind is very tightly woven to Twig. I definitely need some time to un-tangle.

      Wildbow has deliberately not released an official e-book, because it would make the process of proper dead-tree publishing harder. He's still plugging away on the Worm editing process in the background.

      That said, you should probably just give in and read it. =)

      You can find unofficial ones online. I made one for my sister and girlfriend because I loved it so much.

        Wildbow has asked people not to share this stuff around, because it has actual, tangible effects on his ability to turn his series into officially published works.

  Far from being excited about Worm 2, I'm actually quite anxious. While world building is amazing, for me Worm is mostly about Taylor,  who is extremely unlikely to appear in Worm 2 in any capacity beyond a passing mention or a as historical/religious figure, let alone a protagonist.

  I am also enjoying a steady supply of some great Taylor-centric Worm fanfics, and so I'm worried Worm 2 is going to pull away a significant chunk of the fandom, causing current authors to switch to stories about new characters that I don't care about.

  As for Twig, I started reading it the last time a notification about it ending was posted here, and I've just finished Arc 4. While it is certainly better than early Worm, in almost any 'objective' metric I can come up with, it has also failed to hook me in the same way Worm did, and is, at points, a bit of slog to get through. But yes, if you have not given it a try yet, you absolutely should.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    You didn't like Taylor until you read Worm. Neither did all those fic authors. If they start writing about Worm 2 characters, that will be because they like those characters enough to do so. Give it a chance before drowning in fandom anxiety.
    ```

  - u/sir_pirriplin:
    ```
    Re-reading some of the best Worm interludes might reassure you that the author can make a variety of characters interesting, not just Taylor.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    In a way, I'm glad that Taylor is getting sidelined a bit, because that means people may start to see appeal in anything else than Taylor fics.

    Seeing the hyper popular fics follow the stations of canon but never leave Brockton Bay gets old really fast.

    Tabloid pops up as something that I think should be more represented in Worm fanfics
    ```

  - u/UnfortunatelyEvil:
    ```
    For me, Worm is like jumping into a cold ocean. There is excitement, ups and downs. Twig is like sitting in slow acting quicksand, and only realizing after trying to get up.

    It also helps that I can relate a lot more to Sylvester than most other characters in fiction.

- u/play_Tagpro_its_fun:
  ```
  Oh boy, I can finally start twig. How does it compare to Worm and Pact?
  ```

  - u/storybookknight:
    ```
    Quite good, but less compulsively readable than Worm even if it is 'better written'. One of the reasons Work became so interesting was its subversion of existing ideas, and Twig's universe is so different from a lot of our touchstones that it doesn't quite inspire the same sense of fascination to me.
    ```

    - u/Fresh_C:
      ```
      I agree. Twig is really good (haven't finished reading it yet btw) but a lot of the arcs feel kind of self contained and episodic. So it didn't really give me that "I have to immediately continue reading this!" feel that Worm did.

      Rather I was more inclined to read an arc, go read something else, then come back and read another arc. But the actual arcs themselves, especially the character dynamics, were great.

      I rate it above Pact at least.

  Huh, I've been waiting for the 'polished version'[1] for a few years now to re-read it. While it is awesome he'll start releasing the 2nd one, I wish I had time for a re-read first.

  >1. (From /about) Worm finished in November of 2013.  A polished version is in the works for print/ebook release.

  Edit: Fuck it, guess I'll re-read it normally.

  No, wait! My body is NOT READY FOR YOU RILEY AGBGLgblab...
