## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You can choose an object and affect it with a force directed along the line connecting your and object's centers of gravity, either pushing it away or pulling it to yourself.

  The effect of it is equally distributed over the whole object. You are affected with equal but counter-directed force, equally distributed over your body. 

  There is no upper limit for how much force you can project. You have to continuously think about it to support the effect.

    Galactic/Universal Destroyer: Apply nigh infinite force on yourself and any object, giving both you and the object nigh infinite kinetic energy, which will explode in all directions upon impacting anything, creating a sphere of destruction that spreads outwards at near light speeds.

    But let's suppose you want to use your ability while staying alive. The fact that the force is equally distributed over your body means you won't be injured no matter how much force you apply, up until you hit something. Like your clothes. Or air. Sadly you need to breathe, so this limits you pretty hard. You could fly around in a vacuum at utterly insane speeds, pushing and pulling around planets and stars, but only for as long as you can hold your breath. And tolerate the exposure to vacuum. 

    On the other hand, even without applying ludicrous amounts of force, your ability can still be useful. Applying small pushes over and over against a rocket in space can help it move faster and faster without needing as much fuel.

    I can fly!

    All I need to do is push away from the Earth - once I have enough height I can drop that link for an instant to pull a distant object closer and get some forward momentum going.

    Now all I need is a Superman costume and a relatively out-of-the-way place to practice and I'll cause a ruckus on all sorts of conspiracy websites.

  You can switch the linear momentum of bodies. The switch is instantaneous. You cannot alter the bodies' mass, so the only thing that will be affected will be their linear velocity. You must either be touching or have an unobstructed line of sight with the bodies. The bodies must be big enough that you are able to distinguish them. You have a range of 100km (no switching momentum between the Earth and a pebble or between a guy and a star). You can only switch the momentum of two bodies at a time. You can use lenses and mirrors to aid in the line-of-sight requirement, you cannot use monitors or projections.

    You get to break the first law of thermodynamics right off the bat; if you impart a net transfer of momentum from a large object to a smaller one, the kinetic energy of the two-object system will increase (at least in the simple case below).

    Let's say we have a large object with mass M and velocity V, and a small object with mass m and velocity 0. The total momentum of the system is MV, and the total kinetic energy of the system is (1/2)MV^2. When we swap momenta, the total momentum of mass m remains constant at MV, so the velocity of mass m is (M/m)V. The kinetic energy, then, is (1/2)m((M/m)V)^2, or (1/2)m(M^2 V^2 / m^2), or (1/2)MV^2 * (M/m).

    It would be easy enough to turn this kinetic energy into stored chemical energy, perhaps by dropping large rocks off a cliff and using their momentum to propel small rocks to turn turbines which raise the rocks back up the cliff. How consequential would this be? [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline_gallon_equivalent) gives the energy content of a gallon of gasoline as 33.41 kWh, or a little over 120 megajoules.   If we drop a 1000 kg rock off a 10 m cliff, we get 10 kilojoules of potential energy converted to kinetic; if we use that to power a 1 g pebble which then turns a generator, we get (1000000 g/1 g) a factor of 1000000 increase, which gets us to 10 gigajoules - nearly 100 gallons of gasoline's worth. These are reasonable numbers; we could easily add another order of magnitude or several to them.

    No Fall Damage: Jump down from ridiculous heights, and keep swapping your linear momentum with other objects in line of sight so you hit the ground with low momentum. You can even use this as an attack: fall at high speeds, swap momentum with a target.

    Actually upon further thought, I wonder how this ability works at all. Momentum = mass \* velocity. The earth is orbiting the sun and spinning, so everything on earth already has  massive amounts of momentum. If you swap the momentum of something heavy, like a building, with something small, like a pebble, won't the two bodies now move out-of-sync with the Earth and cause utter destruction?

    I guess you could get around this by using your own body as the frame of reference, but that only works if you're standing still. If you start running, suddenly everything that was "stationary" before now has momentum equal to your velocity times their mass.

    - u/Roneitis:
      ```
      Nah nah nah nah nah. Absolute velocity doesn't exist. Saying that you should move relative the earth is just as arbitrary as saying you shouldn't. The frame of reference is almost certainly just gonna be earth, and if you wanna good justification for this sorta thing, check sandersnoot (he has some nearby body of mass justification that allows you to do shit relative trains, but the idea is pretty much gold for this sorta velocity physicy things)
      ```

      - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
        ```
        >  The frame of reference is almost certainly just gonna be earth 

        And therein lies the exploits. If the frame of reference is something that makes it difficult for you to abuse your ability on Earth, then it is almost certainly based on something located on Earth. A magical artifact buried somewhere, or the Gaian force of the Earth itself, etc.

        If it's a magical artifact, locating it will let you pull of abuses of power just by moving the artifact around.

        If it's the Earth itself, get yourself into space. Pretty much every object not attached to Earth in some way will have its momentum (according to the Earth's frame of reference) drastically changed over time as the Earth orbits the Sun. Your ability can abuse this to make spacecraft change velocity in space without needing fuel. (Note: the 100km restriction only means you need to give an object inside the spacecraft momentum, which will make it push against the spacecraft to move the spacecraft.)

    You would be an extremely valuable asset in a military. So long as you have enough time to react, you could stop basically any projectile weapon by transferring the kinetic energy of the projectile to something else. Any hostile planes or helicopters you can see would fall out of the sky by transferring the momentum of their chassis or blades into the ground or something. You could use a telescope to transfer the momentum of a car into a person or vulnerable part of a structure.

      >you could stop basically any projectile weapon by transferring the kinetic energy of the projectile to something else 

      I don't think this will work. The rules are you need to be touching the object, or have a line of sight to the object and the object can be distinguished. Bullets fired by most guns will move so fast that you cannot distinguish them, and so cannot stop them. And if you're touching a bullet it's probably already too late.
      ```

      - u/sicutumbo:
        ```
        I was primarily thinking of using it to defend like an aircraft carrier, but you're right that even then bullets would be super hard to see in time.  If there's a lot of bullets, you probably wouldn't be able to stop enough of them to matter. Against missiles though, it could work.

  Vibration magic from WtC. You can alter the amplitude and frequency of vibrations within your range, which is roughly half a mile in radius, along with an additional sense of vibrations in that range.  "Vibration" is defined rather broadly, and encompasses sound of all kinds, biological rhythms, and at the upper end the generation and manipulation of light. Vibration magic uses up your personal mana bar, which can replenish from nothing over the course of maybe an hour. Modifying vibrations down is nearly costless, modifying amplitude at the expense of frequency or vice versa is more costly, and increasing both is the most expensive. In practical terms, you can dampen vibrations basically indefinitely if you aren't doing anything else with your mana, you can create a sound loud enough to kill someone about 4 times before you run out of mana, and you can use your entire mana to generate a sound loud enough explode someone's head. Creating something like an earthquake, even an extremely local one, isn't possible for a single vibration mage without assistance.

  Standard means of attack are to generate a sound loud enough to cause pain and then kill with something else, generate a sound loud enough to kill through organ damage, and making someone's head vibrate enough to kill them. The soul gives some resistance to vibration magic, and stopping someone's heart is possible but not clearly superior to attacking their skull. Similarly, you can't realistically make someone run slower by slowing the pace of their legs. Your own soul doesn't provide resistance, so you can alter your own biological rhythms without additional difficulty, but without any inherent protection from altering your own rhythms in a way that might harm your body.

  Vibration magic senses are extremely fine, and they can use this sense to feel the vibrations within objects or in a large area around themselves. Combining their senses and sound manipulation allows them to hear nearly anything within their range that they are paying attention to, use echolocation, etc. Other vibration mages can counter these tactics though, if one is available.

  Alexander Wales has already explored a number of combat and utility uses for Vibration magic, but I'm wondering if someone here could come up with additional uses. I have a preference for the non-combat uses, the ways that magic affects society, but additional combat uses would be neat to see as well.

    So, you can pause biological processes for basically no mana? Why do you even need to kill the person when you can pause their brain? Cryogenics could be created in this world with basically no risk of death during the freezing process, though the revival part is still the hard one.
