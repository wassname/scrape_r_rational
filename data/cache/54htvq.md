  Well of course the raid boss has one of the Five Dragonballs.

  What else were you expecting, Zorian?

      The five keys are the right leg of Quatach, left leg of Quatach, right arm of Quatach, left arm of Quatach and the crown of Quatach. Playing them all wins you the game insta--err, what were we talking about again?

    You know...that would make a LOT of sense. Back in Chapter 26, after Red Robe wormed the info on the aranea out of Zach's mind, Quatach-Ichl said "The aranea were never part of--" before being cut off by RR leaving, the unsaid part most likely being "the time loop". I always wondered how he would know, since his only info should have come from RR - but your explanation provides a very good reason why he might know so surely.

    The one contradicton, though, is that he *is* also the one who dumped Zorian into the loop via soul-blending. I mean, that particular result *was* unexpected in every sense possible, but if he really did use to be a looper, you'd think he'd have a more sophisticated plan of attack against a potential time looper.

        > QI is totally going to be the acceptable target

        Er, no. The professional opinion of the Filigree Sages was that the Cyorian aranea had zero chance of reading the lich's mind. That thing's had a thousand years to gather every kind of magic it can find, with no moral compass worth mentioning. Even if you could somehow get into his mind, you might as well invade hell: highly unpleasant and quickly fatal (or worse).

            Chapter 45, quoting from Memory of Sublime Glories:

            > You say the previous aranea found out something important about that facility? Well, I don't think they did it by reading the minds of Ibasan invaders. Admittedly, I cannot tell that for certain without getting access to some of their leaders, but they seem to neither know nor care about what's down there. Except for the lich, and as we both know, they'd never succeed in reading that thing's mind.
            ```

        - u/GodKiller999:
          ```
          Well considering how Araneas can't fight someone using mind blank, it's not very surprising they'd consider QI unbeatable. Zorian might  be able to figure out ways around that though.
          ```

  - u/Makaveli80:
    ```
    > Also making a wild guess- the lich may actually be the ancient emperor who was supposed to be in a time loop himself on the other side of the sovereign gate.

    Sounds plausible to me

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    > a scepter held tightly in one of its skeletal hands

    Reckon that's another piece? It's not entirely clear whether Zorian's marker is specifically telling him that the crown is nearby, or whether it's just saying that there's a piece, and Zorian remembers that a crown is one of them.
    ```

  - u/melmonella:
    ```
    >nothing ever made a mark on the bones. What the hell was that thing made of?

    Some golden flame spell cast by one of the defenders in the loop when the primordial was released melted some of them if I remember correctly.

  Mother of Learning fanart I made while waiting in between chapters:

  [Zorian and Quatach poster.](http://i.imgur.com/z7W9gc7.jpg)

  [No text version.](http://i.imgur.com/DZcUowt.jpg)

  I originally drew this as a poster to have printed for the wall, but it can also be used as a cover for anyone who wanted to print out a hard copy for offline reading.  It looks pretty badass in full-res.  Detail shot [Zorian](http://i.imgur.com/l9plevE.jpg) and [Quatach Ichl](http://i.imgur.com/o6eJ6Db.jpg).  

  I followed the written descriptions as best as I could, but filled in the gaps with artistic license, thus the schoolboy uniform for Zorian.  Here is the original rough [concept sketch](http://i.imgur.com/UCsdjau.jpg) and an older drawing of [Red Robe](http://i.imgur.com/4RyBayz.jpg) shooting purple laser beams, whose design was inspired by the wizards of Magicka.  He's not as cool and imposing as Quatach Ichl.






  **EDIT**:  [**UPDATE FROM NOBODY103**](https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2016/05/01/mol-links-fanart-translation-etc/#comment-95)

  >I am very much in the ‘use your imagination’ category, which is why I never bothered to describe people too much. Turns out people don’t really like this much, so I probably should have put in wordier descriptions. Oh well. Anyway, the only thing definitive about Zorian is that he is thin, has glasses, and that his hair and eyes are brown.

  Looks like there is no definitive canon depiction.
  ```

  - u/melmonella:
    ```
    Sweet drawing skills. Can you do Xvim?
    ```

    - u/lonsheep:
      ```
      Xvim basically has no physical description, but [I tried anyway.](http://i.imgur.com/a4hsbdL.jpg)  I drew him as I what I thought a hardass mentor would look like, telling Zorian to wax on and wax off.
      ```

      - u/PhilanthropAtheist:
        ```
        I had the inkling thay Xvim would be Asian looking. Cause you know... Xvim Chao.

          He definitely strikes me as a sifu type.

    I liked RR’s drawing more, to be honest. It feels more real and atmospheric.

    I don't like it when they describe people either, since I forget. What I like most is having fanart of the characters.

  - u/TaLampaRoger:
    ```
    >A sudden gust of air blew the dust away and a gaunt humanoid figure stepped into view. Zorian actually gasped in surprise as he took in the appearance of the thing in front of them. It was a skeleton wreathed in sickly green light. Its bones were black with a strange metallic sheen, as if they were not bones at all, but rather a facsimile of a skeleton made out of some kind of black metal. Encased in gold-decorated armor, with a scepter held tightly in one of its skeletal hands and a crown full of purple gemstones, the creature looked like some long-dead king risen from the dead.

    Pretty sure your Quatach-Ichl is the wrong colour
    ```

  - u/tyes77:
    ```
    Zorian hair is more spikier if you look at his patreon art of the mc but otherwise, good job.

    Edit:dunno why ppl are making him look so Harry potter-y since the hair is longer and spikey lelz
    ```

    - u/bludvein:
      ```
      There's no "official" art. The one's on the patreon are all fanart submitted by readers. The only description of Zorian we have is that he's thin and has glasses.

        >The only description of Zorian we have is that he's thin and has glasses.

        It's funny how that's all the description he really needs, though.
        ```

      - u/tyes77:
        ```
        Thing is, the spikier hair was the first one done early 2015 and for the longest time the only one that the writer said looked like he envisioned aside from taiven until august of 2015 where everyone wanted to make him look like harry potter. i consider the first one canon tbh

      If you're talking about [this](https://sketchmemo.wordpress.com/2015/08/22/109/) image, I thought it was fanart by a fan.  I saw it and used it as inspiration for my version, but as far as I know, it has not been named as official artwork.  So I also used my interpretation of the character and the in-story description as my basis.  

      I think all of us have a little imaginative license to see characters as we want to.  If you have read books where the cover artwork is wrong or just off, you are not expected to accept it as 100% canon.
      ```

- u/Fredlage:
  ```
  Well, congratulations to whoever guessed correctly about Quatach-Ichl's crown...
  At least now Zorian has an effective way of tracking him, even if it is not long range.
  This attack ought to be very interesting.

  Also, I'm curious at just how skilled in soul magic Alanic actually is.
  ```

  - u/melmonella:
    ```
    Considering that Zorian kicked QI's ass at least once already, that key just walked right into their hands.
    ```

    - u/Cheese_Ninja:
      ```
      We have very different definitions of ass kicking.  He managed to temporarily incapacitate him when his guard was greatly lowered.  If QI only takes a day or two to put himself back together, getting and holding onto the crown would be a much more difficult prospect.

      Gotta give one thing to Quatach-Ichl, he chooses only the most stylish of accessories.

          How much do you want to bet that, as they locate each new key, they think, *Okay, never mind what we said before, we're going to need to get* ***this*** *one last*?

          - u/kaukamieli:
            ```
            Well, they need to get them all in the restart they leave, right? Thus they do need to find them all first. They have time to get more powerful to steal the crown later. Except that it ofc has useful powers.
            ```

    - u/bludvein:
      ```
      That trick is unlikely to work reliably. It's incredible enough that it worked the once, but it depends too much on appearing like a bystander. If they show up with a force to attack the invaders QI is unlikely to fall for it.

      They need a surer method for the final loop rather than depending on QI's arrogance.
      ```

    - u/TheAtomicOption:
      ```
      yeah I'm still kinda shocked that he hasn't grilled Kael about how to recreate the ring that decoupled the lich's spirit from his body. Even if it's hard to get the lich to touch something, it'd be a handy thing to have available.

        It's soul magic, so Zorian couldn't do it anyway
        ```

        - u/sambelulek:
          ```
          It's a formula'd coin. Zorian only need to know the formula. Knowledge about it's inner working is unnecessary. But hey, Zorian learned much about soul this restart, he might be able to custom craft it in the future.
          ```

          - u/Fredlage:
            ```
            My understanding is that spell formula cannot do something the person creating them doesn't know how to do.
            ```

            - u/sambelulek:
              ```
              Interesting, from which passage do you infer this? I remember the first time Zorian came under Nora tutelage she mentioned that people just take a working formula and modify it until it fits their need. It is sufficient. Only ones who wish to be a master should understand all aspect of spell formula so they can make the most efficient formula for their purpose.  

              An exception came when Zorian start making physics communication discs (no, not really). Without a psychic to test the creation, spell forge cannot design a working formula. However, if the formula design is to be leaked, any spell forge can just build them.
              ```

            - u/Cuz_Im_TFK:
              ```
              That's animation spells specifically (and to a lesser extent, the "puppeteering" flavor of mind-control).
              ```

          - u/GodKiller999:
            ```
            To make a spell formula the user has to be able to perform the spell itself. Nora mentioned it was a reason why having good shaping skills would be useful for someone who makes spell formulas.
            ```

            - u/sambelulek:
              ```
              From what I understand, there's a different between designing and building. To design a working formula, you need to know where to limit mana flow to create a flawless execution of a spell. To build a working formula, a suitable material and some alteration spell is all you need. I suppose I understand it wrong from your reply. Can you tell me?
              ```

              - u/GodKiller999:
                ```
                Here's a quote from chapter 10 that should help:
                >what I had been trying to build up to was that spell formula are… support magic. Magic affecting other magic. By itself, even the most elegant spell formula is merely a theoretical exercise. You need to actually cast the spells and anchor them to the spell formula before it's of any use. I note this because Ilsa seemed to think your skill in invocations would do you no good in my subject, which annoyed me because it revealed a fundamental misunderstanding about the nature of the discipline.

                Meaning that if you can't cast the spell you can't make an actually functional formula.
                ```

                - u/sambelulek:
                  ```
                  That passage clearly explain the important of invocation skill in testing unfinished spell formula. But, the word 'anchor' confused me. Isn't the spell formula act as mana shaper? You supply it with mana, and boom, a spell is invoked.  

                  But I suppose a formula is a tool which it's user need to know what limitation it has and how to use it. Otherwise, you cannot cramp 3 spell formula into one tiny ring (it involves overlapping geometry that only activates if supplied with correct mana shape) or use multiple kind of magic missile in just one spell rod. If I understand this right, Kael must be really good at making his banishing silver coin. Zorian only need to supply it with mana and it worked just fine.
                  ```

                  - u/GodKiller999:
                    ```
                    What you're thinking of are auto casters, very hard to make and not very useful beyond basic spells. The rods we saw at the start allowed to skip some of the steps to allow for very quick casting, but they still needed someone with a soul to cast the spell. And anchoring the spell is the act of casting the spell for the spell formula.

                    The spell formula has to constantly drain mana to stay active, if it runs out the spell has to be recast. Here's a quote from the author on the matter:
                    >Wards, not having souls, cannot cast anything. So once the spells used in their construction are cast, they never really turn off. If they were to ever completely shut down, they would have to be remade from scratch before they could work again.

                    I think you're confused because of what spell formulas have been shown to do, but what you have to realize is that by putting lots of mana into a defensive ward you're just strengthening a spell that's already there.

                    Also the coin had been anchored with Kael spell, so Zorian didn't have to do anything, the coin was likely just staying active thanks to ambient mana. Once it touched the lich it "released" the spell Kael had already set up on it.

  I am starting to think that this arc will be longer than the two first combined. We had 4 and a half chapters covering just one restart, and we are still not done. 

  With Zach on board, there are clearly less opportunities to say "Zorian practiced mind magic with the spiders for 3 restarts in a row, and nothing else happened". Something will always happen.

  On theorycrafing side of things, the information about simulacrum spell is intriguing. Does it have some sort of soul simulation or even a crude copy powering it up?
  ```

  - u/FeluriansCloak:

    In all fairness, this was a really important restart (as Xvim and Alaric were brought into the loop, so to speak).  I suspect that we'll have less restarts skipped over as the number decreases.

  So these Keys are probably useful in more ways than as advertised right? Sure there's some prestige associated with wearing/owning one but I'd bet that the Lich has some utilitarian purpose for wearing it.
  ```

  - u/-Fender-:
    ```
    Most likely. Wasn't the first Ikosian Emperor the one who was claimed to have traveled to another world using the Sovereign Gate? So it's likely that they are artifacts created by the same person who created the Gate itself, and who gifted them to the Emperor. I doubt that the Emperor himself was the one who created them, else he'd have no need to travel through the Gate in the first place, and he'd have left behind more of his creations before he died.
    ```

  - u/bludvein:
    ```
    It's undoubtedly a magical artifact beyond being simply a key. I don't think the lich is vain enough to wear it simply because of it's historical significance.
    ```

    - u/bassicallyboss:
      ```
      I think Quatach-Ichl is probably that vain.  But I agree that the crown probably has non-key magical properties.

- u/TheAtomicOption:
  ```
  I'm still curious if/when he's going to kill the spider and go back to Silverlake. Soul magic seems central to getting a grip on what's happening considering how much it's used by the Sovereign Gate, Quatach Ichl and presumably Red Robe. Alanic is clearly not willing to teach him many aspects of it, so he's going to have to get *someone* else. Even if Alanic did agree, it'd be worth it for the same reason that going to different spider tutors was worthwhile. 

  My money is still on the spider eggs being an ingredient for a potion that Silverlake thinks will solve one of his problems. Perhaps giving Zorian external soul sense to compliment his growing self-soul perception.

      Personally I'd be ok with a morally unacceptable way to soul sight at this point. It's a big enough level up, and presumably anyone killed would immediately be back the next restart... Additionally he has a lot of good fodder for blood magic rituals or whatever in the form of capturable invaders.

      You don't want to make it routine, but for things that are major enough to be huge shortcuts to power Xvim is exactly right that he needs to be taking more advantage.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        > capturable invaders

        Um...maybe, but even then, Zorian might consider performing blood magic on them to be going too far. It's one thing to be willing to kill enemies in wartime, but we still don't approve of torture, for example. Even with enemies, there are boundaries.

        And where would he even find someone who could instruct him? Kael certainly doesn't know how to go about such rituals, and probably wouldn't *want* to know.
        ```

        - u/TheAtomicOption:
          ```
          >we still don't approve of torture

          Is blood magic definitely torturous? My understanding was that you just need to get the blood out. As deaths go, that's actually pretty not-torturous. 

          >where would he even find someone who could instruct him 

          I think with his mind magic it wouldn't be that hard to find it if he really wanted to.
          ```

- u/sambelulek:
  ```
  I was expecting this chapter to be invasion defense chapter. A colorful one, considering Xvim and Alanic awareness about it. Instead, it is a transition chapter to that. However, I am pleased that it is revealed that Alanic has another esoteric magic to teach to balance out Xvim's nefarious suggestion. Brilliant planning!
  ```

- u/DerSaidin:
  ```
  Also remember, they will need to get all 5 artifacts in the same loop.  If they beat the lich and get the crown, that is not a savepoint. They still need to consecutively beat whatever guards the others.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    >  If they beat the lich and get the crown, that is not a savepoint.

    Maybe, but I kind of wonder about this. The five parts of the Key are tied to the loop, and for a Controller to collect them is significant (it increases his/her authorisation level). It's not unthinkable that they would follow a Controller who collected them - especially since you have to present them to the Guardian, and you can only visit it via projection. But yes, it's also entirely possible that they have to be collected in the same iteration.
    ```

  - u/TheAtomicOption:
    ```
    They're described as keys. I'm curious whether each offers different abilties. Like if they get one, that gives them authorization to learn about the others, or another gives authorization to learn the commands they have available, and another gives authorization to learn about the creator(s) of the gate itself or something.
    ```

- u/narfanator:
  ```
  Hmm. An interesting development here.

  In a normal story, obtaining the crown would be saved for last, there would be an epic showdown in the Final Loop, a mad scramble for the gate with moments left before the End...

  In this one, I see a few things -

  1. They'll try to get QI's crown at the end of EVERY loop from now on, unless they don't make it to the invasion (aka, die early)

  2. There's a mad scramble at the end and they DON'T make it to the gate before the End... but there's an admin failsafe that dumps them into Guardian-space anyway, because that would be sensible.

  3. They'll try to get QI's crown at the end of every loop, but it'll come down to the last few possible loops anyway just because it's just so freaking hard.

    To be fair if QI gets pissed and messes with their souls even more the whole game ends.

  So...what skills would a Controller practise inside a black room?

  I can think of:

  - Soul awareness meditation

  - Deep memory probing, *if* Zorian/Xvim/someone can bully Zach into admitting he needs to get checked.

  - Learning new spells (hexagonal shield!), and/or making casting flawless. This depends on whether they have a resilient target inside the room, and whether their mana recharges normally. (Of course, given that Zorian's magic missile training method involved dropping the power of the missiles, Zach could probably practice it on him if need be.)

  - Unstructured mental defences, for Zach.

  - Going through the contents of any caches they find, eg the ones mentioned by Zach (lich sanctum, demon-worshipping cult treasury, vault under Marbolkano).

  - General reading, especially whatever they can find about the Ikosian emperor.

  Any more exciting possibilities?

  - u/bassicallyboss:
    ```
    Shaping exercises come to mind.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      Yeah, several items above are basically that, especially the unstructured mental defences. Zorian surely has the patience for it, given that he survived Xvim; we'll see about Zach.

      Hey, should they bring Xvim?
      ```

      - u/bassicallyboss:
        ```
        Yeah.  I just thought of them in particular because Zorian used to do them while he wandered around in the countryside.  I'm not sure if skills-training shaping is something Zorian should prioritize.  Given that he's probably good enough at shaping to proficiently cast most spells, and that there's now a time-limit, I think it'll be more useful for him to take books and add spells to his arsenal, as you've mentioned.  Zach, on the other hand, could certainly benefit from additional skill at shaping, but I'm not sure if it's important enough when compared with the other options.

        One thing that occurred to me while writing this, however, is that by bringing in tools and materials, Zorian could spend the whole time making golems and working spell formulas to prepare for the invasion or the likely key-collecting boss fights.  That's lower-priority until they know where all the keys are, though.
        ```

  - u/TheAtomicOption:
    ```
    > whether their mana recharges normally

    This is an interesting question. I would guess that it would, however I think the isolation might *also* isolate them from the increased ambient mana that they are normally absorbing from the well while walking around Cyoria.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I'm not excited for whatever happens next chapter. This chapter is called "One Step Forward", which sets up an obvious juxtaposition with "...And Two Steps Back".

  Also, I'm pretty damn sure, by this point, that Zorian is going to escape the time loop and Zach isn't. Zach is too effective.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    > Zach is too effective.

    I actually don't think so. He has never beaten Quatach-Ichl before, never succeeded in fending off the invasion - and once they get out of the loop, the invaders will be able to summon a horde of high-level magic-resistant demons on top of everything else. And if the primordial actually gets out and needs killing...yeah, Zach is not overpowered.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Maybe it would be more accurate to describe him as "too effective in comparison to Zorian." Zorian is better at thinking, and at some specific things, but there are a lot of cases where Zorian leans heavily on Zach. It would be an interesting development to have only Zorian escape.
      ```

      - u/sicutumbo:
        ```
        Zach is an incredibly potent combat force and given the time he's spent in the loop he doesn't have many glaring weaknesses left, but Zorian still surpasses him in some things. His shaping skills are better, allowing him to do more esoteric things that Zach would need to spend a lot of time to learn.  Being able to make artifacts well allows him to use any preparation time he has to counter specific threats, while Zach relies heavily on battering them down through force. Even aside from magic, Zorian seems to be a better planner and better at diplomacy. They complement each other very well. Neither has the same weaknesses as the other.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          > Zorian seems to be a better planner

          This. It's not coincidental that Zorian is the one who transfers notebooks, collects wads of cash every time, and learned to interact with his soul and marker.

          Zach has dated almost every girl in the class, but the one time Zorian even gave off the appearance of dating, he learned to sense his marker and gained a cool new ability (manual loop reset). Zach messes around, Zorian doesn't.

  The more time goes on, the more I realize that Zorian is a super unreliable PoV about his brothers. In this chapter, we see:

  >"That is an interesting idea," Zorian said after a short pause. "I'm not sure how effective it would really be, but it's worth a try. In fact, it kind of reminds me of the fact I do have some small amount of reflected fame myself, courtesy of my older brother. It might be a good idea to see if I can get something with that. That didn't work too well for me in the past, but back then I clearly wasn't a magical prodigy like Daimen. Now, I can effectively pass myself off as a second coming of Daimen by demonstrating some of the magical proficiency I picked up in the time loop."

  >Zach gave him a surprised look.

  >"Yeah, I know," Zorian said unhappily. "It kind of rankles to rely on Daimen like that, but desperate times call for desperate measures."

  >Zach just shook his head in amusement, not saying anything.


  Obviously, Zach is surprised that Zorian is willing to do anything involving Damien, but Zorian interprets it as "Zach, like me, thinks everything involving Damien is awful. This is a normal thought." My vote to Zorian for most thickheaded empath! 

  When Zach punches Zorian on the train platform, Fortov comes hurrying over. When Fortov sees everything's okay, he leaves without speaking to Zorian. Afterwards, commenting on it, Kirielle points out that Fortov can be considerate, in his way...

  > "He knows that neither of us can stand him, so he keeps away," Kirielle said casually, doing her best to snatch the little animated water drakes flying around her out of the air. Zorian and Zach had competed earlier to see who can create more realistic-looking drakes out of the surrounding rainwater, so the entire shield bubble was still full of them. Zorian was pretty sure he won, but Kirielle was the judge and she claimed she couldn't tell the difference. The little traitor.

  > "I don't think he's that considerate," Zorian scowled. "He just didn't feel like spending time on us. He had better things to do than waste time on his younger siblings."

  > "No, I'm pretty sure he knows you hate him," Kirielle said, shaking her head. "He even said so when we were alone once. It's why he tries to avoid you if he can help it. He thinks he's doing you a favor."

  > Zorian frowned. He supposed he hadn't been terribly subtle about his opinion about Fortov, so he wasn't really surprised that Fortov knew. He did find it hard to accept that Fortov's behavior was motivated by anything other than his selfishness, though. If he wanted to do Zorian a favor, why was it that he still came to Zorian from time to time to ask for favors? That was the worst reason possible for approaching him – the whole reason why he hated Fortov was because he always had to make up for Fortov's failures to do his job in addition to his own duties.

  >"So you think I'm being too harsh with him?" Zorian asked curiously. Before he had gotten stuck in the time loop, the mere insinuation that this was the case would have been the equivalent of throwing a lit match in a bowl of lamp fuel. Now he found himself honestly curious about what Kirielle thought about the topic.

  >"No. Yes. Maybe," Kirielle said. "I mean, he's still a jerk and I don't like him either. So I know how you feel. But maybe us being mean to him back isn't the correct thing to do. Maybe he'd be better if we were more patient with him. I'm not. I try being nice to him sometimes, but he makes it very hard."

  >"Yeah, I'll bet," Zorian snorted derisively.

  >"You know, I'm getting the idea that your family is a little messed up," Zach said.

  - u/Rheklr:
    ```
    While I agree his opinions of his brothers are wholly subjective, I think Zorian was confirming Zach's surprise that he would use Damien's name rather than thinking Zach thought Damien wasn't good. Much of his dislike for Damien comes from how he thinks everyone loves Damien while he knows how bad his brother can be. I doubt he considered Zach an exception to that.

    No point. Based on how mind magic seemed to be working so far, you don't get a list of all memories of a person, you ask questions and get answers from their memeory. And Zorian can do that by just, you know, asking Xvim directly.

          Zorian is far past the point where his mind probes would actually kill or significantly damage the target, so comparing it to torture is a bit much. The main problem is privacy, not pain.

          Thing is, Xvim is already sharing skills, so how much can mind probing him really help? Sure he could possibly be keeping his better skills to himself, but there's no indication of that yet.

- u/-Fender-:
  ```
  This is a bit late, but here's a prediction for the next chapter:

  The polyglot teacher, Zenomir, the one who initially told Zorian about ancient Majara language, is one of the high-ranking members of the Cult of the Dragon Below. Not only was he familiar enough with Majara language to know what language it was upon hearing an imperfect transcript of a spell heard only once, months before, but he was also able to accurately determine that it was a soul magic spell. The latter would imply that he is familiar with soul magic himself, and the efficiency with which Zorian was targeted afterwards to be assassinated seems to be too much of a coincidence. 

  For that to happen without Zenomir himself being a member would mean that either Zenomir immediately informed the wrong person about Zorian's experience without making efforts to confirm his claims, and that he also specifically mentioned Zorian's name to that person. Or alternately, that his mind was read after he mentioned this to the wrong person, which would also be careless and odd, coming from a teacher at that institute.

  So yeah, Zenomir is most likely involved with the Cult. That's my prediction.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    Yes, Zenomir will probably be revealed as a cult member at some point - and actually, with all of Zorian's cult investigation, it's a bit odd that he never investigated why telling Zenomir got him assassinated.

    However, I doubt that it will be in chapter 60. I think this one will be an epic fight, ZZ+Xvim+Alanic against Quatach-Ichl. *Is Xvim smart enough to actually find a way to beat an indestructible ancient lich?*
    ```

- u/thrawnca:
  ```
  Re taking over the rat swarm: I don't think that Zorian needs a specialised item to bind a rat to the swarm. His existing mind control and locator spells should be sufficient.

  If he dominates two cranium rats, he should be able to make them telepathically connect to each other. He should then be able to dominate them as one entity - which would still be weak enough to easily control. Then he can use locator spells to find more rats, and add them to his competing hive mind. Until a) the original hive mind stops and talks to him; b) he takes over *all* of the rats; or c) he reaches the limit of how large a hive mind he can control, at which point he has probably largely achieved his objective (subverting the swarm) anyway.

  At some point along the way, his swarm will probably even become large enough to reach out and collect the disowned rats without needing to dominate them first.
  ```

  - u/GodKiller999:
    ```
    I assume that by doing things the way he is, he'll be able to take over the whole thing instantly instead of 1 by 1 like you're suggesting.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      > take over the whole thing instantly

      Nah, not really. Besides the time and effort needed to design and construct the spell formula, he then has to negotiate with the swarm, which may or may not be willing to talk terms.

      Whereas if he simply starts tracking and collecting rats, then he immediately starts gaining minions, and has bargaining power: "If we can't agree on terms, I'll just take over completely."
      ```

      - u/GodKiller999:
        ```
        Who knows, he might not even be able to dominate that many at once or the mechanics might be different then we think.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          > might not even be able to dominate that many at once

          That's the reason I suggested making them link to each other, forming a weak hive mind that should be controllable as a single entity. He ought to be able to simultaneously control enough rats for that. The only question in my mind is whether it's possible to force someone to use their telepathy - probably yes via Domination, though maybe not via Puppeteering.
          ```

- u/thrawnca:
  ```
  > "He might be old and mighty, but he's still just one mage."

  You know, Xvim is not the type to bravely-yet-suicidally charge into battle. If he's saying this kind of thing, then he probably has an actual plan in mind, something more nuanced than "find a spell that can deal damage." Something that could bypass QI's near-indestructibility.

  Chelik the golem (chapter 46) springs to mind. Hardly anything could hurt him, but he was still vulnerable to the earth swallowing him up and pinning him.
