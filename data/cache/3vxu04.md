## What was that story about a ring that dictated the most practical chain of actions to its wearer?

### Post:

I am reading [tGWP](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/rwby-the-gamer-the-games-we-play-disk-five.341621/) ATM, and the story reached a point where the protagonist starts getting vague hints from his [game interface](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenGameInterface) about how to complete his quests.

Not long ago, there was a short story recommended here about a ring that whispered similar “optimal” solutions to its owner to a degree where eventually the owner essentially converted into a philosophical zombie’s brother, being controlled by the non-evil ring.

Does anyone remember that story, to share the link?

    Nice!

    I'm put in mind of the Prologue part of the below (no prior knowledge required for just the Prologue), which I recently read.

    Oh my goodness, this is by the author that wrote [about a girl who had a distinct habit of godbothering](http://squid314.livejournal.com/336195.html).

    Yes, that’s the one — thank you very much.

  This reminded me of ["Wayfinder" from Fred Saberhagen's The Book of Swords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Swords_of_Power), except that it is sort of the opposite.

  > Wayfinder's chief power is guiding its bearer to whatever it is they seek. Not only will it lead one to their ultimate goal, it will also intelligently guide them to things that are required to successfully accomplish its mission. Wayfinder seems to do better and be more kind to its user when the request is broad and general, and less so the more specific the user is. Its main drawback is that while it picks routes that will eventually lead its master to success, it never picks the safest route, if one exists. It is the opinion of many of the past owners of the Sword that it actually picks the worst, most dangerous path for its user to follow. Thus the Sword does indeed "add unto their risk."

  My first thought was the ["Lord of the Rationality" omake](http://hpmor.com/chapter/64) in HPMoR but if you're looking for a non-evil ring then that's *probably* not it.

    Where was the fic on GDocs that continued this (though not with Bilbo)? That was *so* good. That should have been posted on the sub a while ago, but I can't find it.

    EDIT: Found it. It's more of an inspired alternate continuity. Never thought I'd say this, but thatnk Google for keeping links to [every document users view.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DOI7TQK4BomhcZxOoJ2m3jD_ozk37ZF7MrAR4jQ-eO8/edit)

  Welcome to the front of the future shock wave! 

  Enjoy this piece about a fast food managerial software that works just like your earring: http://marshallbrain.com/manna1.htm

  Also there is a story running around somewhere on reddit about an employee being told to use the closer bathroom, they had wasted 30 secounds to walk to the other one... Dont know if thats true though.

    Yea, I love this story, I've read it twice. It's an interesting look at what could happen if big corporations continue on a sort of soulless trajectory. And what scared me about the story is, aside from my skepticism at such a software being made and implemented so easily, it felt sort of plausible. Hyperbolic in some instances, but it never felt like some unbelievable fairy tale. It seemed like it could happen.

    just read manna. It was awfully scary.

  Whoah. You made me think of Ra, which I haven't for a long time. The idea reminds me of the interface, but it's obviously not quite the same.
