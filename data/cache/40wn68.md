  I would like to seem the same in universe commentary for different countries or even cities and counties, seems like it'd be hard to stretch that logic to everything. A grain of sand has no wandering of the desert period, though I guess you could just say it hasn't happened yet. 

  Wish real world religions put that much effort into making everything make sense.

    It's not hard really. You have bazillions of ways to stretch it to fit by translating into Latin/Greek/Hebrew, summing up letter values, truning them into Roman numerals, taking synonymes as equivalent, etc.

    Funny experiment is to look at alternative patterns that could fit better for each explanation, but haven't occured, so the author had to stretch it somehow. For example George Washington could have first name Adam, and you wouldn't need to explain how George is farmer and Adam is dirt so basicaly the same thing.

    As for other countries - I can try my :)

    Polish history started with migrations of Slavs to Europe from Asia (through the Pontic steppe most probably - so basicaly a desert), but the turning point was much later  in 966 after prince **M**ie**s**zko I (**M**e**s**co in Latin) united many western Slavic tribes into one country, accepted christianity and baptized the country.

    BTW Mieszko was blind until he turned 7 y.o. according to Gall Anonymous chronicle. Moses was blind too for a while.

    BTW2 Polanie tribes and Poland got their names from burning primal forest and using these clearings (polany) for farming. Buring bush, anyone?

    It's really easy to make 100 different patterns fit if you want.

      Well, there's also the conspiracy theory that George Washington was secretly replaced by Adam Weishaupt of the Bavarian Illuminati, in which case George = Adam = farmer = earth; G.W. = A.W., drop the W's (burn the bushes) to factor out A.G. (Atah Gibor = "you are mighty"; half of the God-name AGLA = "you are mighty forever, o Lord").

    They do, they really do. 

    I suspect that esoteric mysticism is a kind of high-functioning schizophrenia that manifests in its sufferers as religious (and ideological) literalism and obsessive pattern-matching, and it shows up all over the place. Present mystics read the works of past mystics, and write new works for future mystics to obsessively glean for meaning. You can do it yourself, if you take a low-to-medium dose of a psychedelic.

    Read Umberto Eco's books *Foucalt's Pendulum* and *The Name of the Rose*, for some examples of the European Catholicism version of the phenomenon. I suspect that the Freeman On The Land movement is a libertarian version of it.

    Your objection is that sand is not in the desert?

    Heck, sometimes it even wanders. See for example this page on [wandering dunes](http://www.babakoto.eu/Articles/Poland/Slowinski-NP/Slowinski_NP-English.htm).

      My first thought of sand is beaches not deserts, I guess I missed the reality for the metaphor on that one though.

  Re footnote 1

  >  mass is carried by baryons

  Not quite correct in that other things than baryons also carry mass (eg the electron), but correct in the sense that of the visible matter in the universe (excluding dark matter and dark energy) something like 99.999% of the mass comes from baryons (in particular protons and neutrons).
  ```

    This is not really the major problem with the physics bit. The major problem with the physics bit (aside from the overarching problem of having to be in English) is that electrons and quarks *always* had mass, so far as we know - the Higgs field gives mass to things like W and Z bosons, but not to electrons.

    Why would the name have to be in its original form, given that the central thesis is "nothing is a coincidence"? Its (mis)transliteration was obviously meant to happen.

    As everyone knows, English is the correct language for biblical scholarship.

    So is "Moses"! Nothing is a coincidence!

    (well, the original had one 'sh', does that count?)

    In case anybody's curious, it's pronounced "mung-zu".
