  I didn't expect much of this movie as I thought that it's another superficial demon-story; to my surprise, it turned out that this movie is about rationality, irrationality and the ways how your own mind can betray you.

  I usually stay away from horror movies, but might try this on your recommendation! Any chance you could give us a quick content advisory?

    This would be a massive spoiler. Genre wise this movie is akin to "The Shining", I think. It does have some gore and nudity if you're concerned about this.

  Ok, but is it any good? Imdb rating of 5.5 is a bit sub-par.
