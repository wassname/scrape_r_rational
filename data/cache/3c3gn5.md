No, that’s on purpose. Like I said in the introduction, this is meant to be a solvable story. I’m very careful about what I post.

Ok now what? Anybody got any hacker ideas or maybe a way to find a secret text or something like that? Either that or I am missing something obvious.

EDIT: forgot to add the link, sorry

  There doesn't seem to be any hidden text.
  I'm guessing that the story follows Charlie in a way that keeps the narrative from continuing if Charlie would also be unable to continue narrating. Alyx cutting Charlie off mid-sentence may actually involve Charlie being incapacitated.
  >Now, can you stop wasting time, please?
  Alyx may have taken the liberty to stop Charlie from wasting any more time.

  Although, I gather that they are still on a beach around other people and I have a mediocre track record figuring out what's *really* happening in stories like this.
