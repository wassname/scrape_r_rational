## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  My girlfriend and I were talking last night about a few fiction tropes and their real-life implications. Immortality, especially in the context of Vampires, is interesting. Would somebody born hundreds of years ago take the risk posed by unfriendly AI seriously, or would they be too jaded by all the previous existential false alarms? I tend to think modern computer technology would be a more convincing threat to them, not least because greater interconnectedness and machine learning would be a major threat to their ability to stay hidden amongst the population at large.

  Ultimately, I don't think the story of a modern Vampire would be about creeping on highschoolers or their war with the werewolves or whatever. I think it would be about the net tightening around them as technology makes the humans more and more of a threat.

    Most people born in the last thirty years don't take it seriously. I'd say modern computer technology would be a convincing threat, but a threat on a personal level, not an existential one. As you said, remaining hidden despite better and better computing and forensics is the real threat to a vampire.
    ```

    - u/Tinfoil_Haberdashery:
      ```
      Yeah, but practically the only lethal threats to a reasonably competent immortal would be those which are existential to humanity, which might actually make them loom larger in their assessment of threats. It also seems like an  immortal timescale would make the rapid growth of machine intelligence seem a lot more dramatic and make its logical conclusion a more pressing question.

      But then, I can see it either way. The War to End All Wars didn't, the Nuclear threat went off with a fizzle rather than a bang...might get a little desensitizing after a while.
      ```

      - u/Salivanth:
        ```
        It really does depend on how "reasonably competent" is defined. If we're talking HPMOR-style competent you could be right. On the other hand, if we take a vampire with an IQ of say, 130 or so (+2 Standard deviations, or top 2.5%), who doesn't often make dumb mistakes...I don't think existential threats are the only thing that can threaten him.

        In addition, the rapid growth of machine intelligence only seems dramatic if you have a decent amount of knowledge about it. People who don't know much about computers (which includes a lot of older people, and our immortal is very old indeed) tend to underestimate just how much progress has been made, or don't see how better video game graphics and beating professionals at Go is such a big deal in the first place.

        Thus, the vampire is faced with two technological threats. One of these, the difficulty of hiding from technology, is immediate, threatens the vampire personally, and the vampire can take actions to work against.

        The other, an AI-explosion that threatens the whole world, is abstract, decades in the future, requires a lot of knowledge to appreciate, and there's little to nothing the vampire can do about it. The "decades in the future" thing is probably not a big deal on an immortal timeframe, but that's the only major advantage the vampire has when it comes to treating the threat seriously.

        Just about anyone would pay far more attention to the first one. People pay more attention to what's close to them and what matters to them personally.
        ```

        - u/Tinfoil_Haberdashery:
          ```
          Which leads to some other interesting questions about immortality--most pertinently, would immortals be luddites? The stereotype is that older people are less good with technology, but if true, why so?

          I think it comes down to how much being set in your ways is a neurochemical thing vs. an emergent property of experience. If a young, hip beatnik from the early '50s had their biological and neurochemical aging switched off, would they now be a young, hip millennial or would they be a cantankerous, ultraconservative octogenarian in the body of a 20 year old? How much is adaptability and neuroplasticity a property of the brain and how much is just a result of lacking experience?

          If experience per se is the enemy of mental flexibility, then our vampire would likely be a Luddite--but if it's due more to the biological aging of the brain, then I'd expect them to be more tech-savvy than the general population, not less.

          If you've been 26 since 1840, you've had 201 years to master and get bored with anything new that you found remotely appealing. If you've had 201 years to apply a 130 IQ and aren't independently wealthy, you've screwed up somewhere, so the allure of novelty and the leisure time to pursue it should both be abundant. I could envision a Luddite vampire even in these conditions, but I don't think it would be particularly more likely than the inverse.

          Also, if we're talking a fairly standard-issue vampire, who tend to be stronger, faster and more durable than a baseline human, with 200 years of experience and a top 2.5% IQ with which to apply it, I don't think they'd be all that susceptible to non-existential threats. Hell, natural selection alone means they're either sufficiently competent to have survived that long in the face of their Achilles' heels or uncommonly lucky.

          So, you've survived a few dozen close shaves with sunrise and at least 3 wannabe Van Helsings, not to mention having to flee the entire Western hemisphere for a few decades until people naturally started assuming that whatever serial killer had targeted all those accordionists *must've* died of old age--what're you really afraid of? They've got SPF 50 sunblock now, so even UV isn't the threat it once was, and since the decline of polka's popularity people's primary reaction to the mysterious disappearance of an avid accordionist is *relief*. Really, there aren't many threats left. Social upheaval just makes it easier to fade into the background. Any pandemic that doesn't kill off 100% of humanity falls under the category of social upheaval, since vampires are generally disease proof. Even nuclear warfare isn't that scary--sure, you couldn't survive a ground-zero impact, and acute radiation poisoning might be an issue, but if you were at all susceptible to cancer you wouldn't have made it 200 years, so light fallout probably isn't that big a deal. So...the biggest threat is probably all the bloodbags getting turned into paperclips.

    I'm mortal and I already fall into the latter category.

    I'm in a Vampire: the Requiem tabletop game group currently set in the mid 80s, and my character is primarily concerned with preparing such that the inevitable kine-break-the-masquerade gehenna is not an extinction level event for either group.

  So I've been thinking about what inspires people to write fanfiction about a work. Aside from the obvious (be popular, appeal strongly to a demographic, have interesting characters, etc.) I think I've figured out two more important elements.

  Namely,

  * The work should have some sort of primary setting, where the characters return to continuously, as opposed to being an epic where characters journey across a number of different places.

  For example, HP has hogwarts, Naruto has konoha, Twilight has Forks, ~~I'm pretty sure Supernatural is set in a single area~~, etc.

  * There should be a variety of semi-independent sub-conflicts such that the outcome of the story doesn't wholly hinge on the outcome of the conflict.

  This is extremely common so I won't bother listing examples. It's really more useful as an exclusionary factor-- works that bank highly on moment-to-moment suspense and reveals are much more difficult to write fanfiction about.
  ```

  - u/Chronophilia:
    ```
    Most of Supernatural has the characters travelling from town to town, looking for problems to solve.
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      whoops, I'll take that out, then.
      ```

  - u/scruiser:
    ```
    Another element, although this might just be spacebattles that really pushed it heavily, is when the plotline has some extremely easy point of divergence that allows fanfic writers to easily come up with and run with a premise (often going through stations of canon in the process).

    The two purest examples of this are: Familiar of Zero, where Louise summons alternate familiars, either self-inserts/OCs, or more commonly crossover characters, for a low-effort crossover fanfic.  Worm, where Taylor has alternate power sets, the power sets being something along the lines of "this idea sounds cool for a power", or a pseudo-crossover where the power is lifted out of another setting.  The simplicity yet potential for variability spawned a huge number of fanfics, although again, it might just be spacebattles and the format/audience it provides.

    For a more moderate example, Harry raised by alternative guardians is a common formula.  There is Harry raised by the Lovegoods, Harry raised by Sirius Black, Harry raised by goblins, etc.  HPMOR falls into this formula at first glance with Harry raised by a scientist.  This formula also allows crossovers, with Harry raised by the Adams Family, Harry raised by Tony Stark, Harry raised by Deadpool, Harry raised by a blackened denarius fallen angel, etc.

    So yeah, easy premise that allows the fanfic author to run through stations of canon while putting their own crossover or OC twist on things is a popular formula that leads to heavy propagation of fanfic, however often at the expense of quality.
    ```

    - u/InfernoVulpix:
      ```
      I'd argue that, while it's clear that these 'obvious divergence' fics tend to be of low quality, the number of high-quality stories does not decrease noticeably.  The *average* story quality will fall due to the bloating of the lower tiers with low-effort 'obvious divergence' fics, but the gems will still have been written.

      Another example demographic that I've seen for this is the Pokemon fandom, with an obvious divergence of Ash having a different starter.  Now, even though 'Ash gets a different starter than Pikachu' has been done to death and out the other side into a shambling perpetual zombie-state, the top fics like [The Game of Champions](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7354757/1/The-Game-of-Champions) or [The Sun Soul](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5367085/1/The-Sun-Soul) weren't prevented from happening, and it is my expectation that there are few other potential high-quality fics that didn't happen solely because of the 'different starter' zombie premise.

      Pokemon's case also leads me to another idea about fanfiction writing: catharsis-fics.  For when the consumer of the canon work sees something *obviously* wrong, and it bugs them, so they want to see a version of the world where that wrong thing doesn't happen, and they go write it themselves.  In Pokemon, for example, Ash is an idiot in canon.  Any kid who's played the games can tell you most things Ash does in battle make no sense whatsoever, and while that's likely the point, to make the average ten year old feel like they know what Ash should be doing instead, it leads to pent-up frustration over the years.

      So, alongside the zombie premise of Ash's different starter, and with *heavy* overlap with that premise, you have fics explicitly about making Ash smarter than his canon version, for the sake of him being smarter and not doing those dumb things.  Popular examples include [The Chosen One's Journey](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9095222/1/The-Chosen-One-s-Journey) and [Chronicles of the Chosen One: Pokemon Master](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8033836/1/COTCHO-PM-Permanent-Hiatus).  An uncharitable critique of these fics would say that they're just inanely repeating Ash's journey with him as a Gary Stu with no coherent story structure or plan except for making Ash look as cool and heroic as he did when you were six.  More fairly, the stories *are* unfocused and mostly repeating canon with their premise's filter applied, but they can still be an enjoyable read if you're willing to not think too much, and especially if you're fed up with canon Ash being an idiot and just want to see him succeed where it matters for once.  The peculiar kind of support for these catharsis-fics is somewhat evident in how, despite their debatable quality as stories, the two linked stories hold more favourites on fanfiction.net than the two 'gems' I linked earlier, though all four are clearly at the top of the favourites heap no matter how you look at it.

      In short (and I apologize for this being so long), whether or not a franchise inspires more low-quality fics than others, I expect the number of gems will remain effectively constant, and that another motive for low-quality fics is the catharsis of correcting something frustrating from canon, a concept which can easily gain enough support by similarly-frustrated people to rival the top-quality fics in popularity.
      ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      I actually deliberately didn't include this, because it's not a good predictor of whether there are many fics in the fandom. If enough people write in a fandom, eventually they'll figure out a good point of divergence, which due to overuse will then appear obvious. And on the flipside, regardless of how good a POD exists in a work, it won't directly inspire new fiction unless people are already writing in a fandom.

      The reason easily-available POD's *look* like they inspire fanfiction is really because of a larger phenomena-- works that keep up suspense, and have momentous events that have significant effects tend to be more popular.
      ```

  - u/SeekingImmortality:
    ```
    I rather liked an article I came across once, which claimed that there are ten types of fanfiction...and, in the context of your query, I would assume there could be individual reasons prompting each type for any given fandom.

    * Recontextualization - storylines that were not included in the original text

    * Timeline Expansion - prequels or sequels

    * Refocalization - stories about characters that weren't discussed in length in the original text

    * Moral Realignment - a change in the view of who is the hero and villain

    * Genre Shift - changing the genres of the original text

    * Crossover - placing the character of one story into the world of another

    * Character Dislocation - a radical change in personality and/or history of a character

    * Personalization - placing of the author / original characters inside the story

    * Emotional Intensification - focusing on extremely emotional moments

    * Eroticization - inserting romantic and sexual elements in the original text

  I recently volunteered at a CFAR workshop! It was a great experience, and I'd be happy to answer any questions people have (feel free to PM me or email me at my reddit username @ gmail.com)

  Also, I'm working a [blog series](https://mindlevelup.wordpress.com/2017/02/18/ontologies-and-operating-systems-post-cfar-1/) on how I changed my mind after the workshop, if anyone's interested.

  Weekly Monday Update

  ---

  Sorry about missing last week's. I just know you all were so sad I didn't post. Anyway, for a board game recommendation you should play Shadow Hunters. It's a really fun game where you and your friends play as a Shadow Creature, a Hunter, or a Neutral player. Each player is given a private goal where they are supposed to either kill all shadows, all hunters, or a random other objective as a Neutral. It's like Mafia, except better. 

  ---

  This week, my story has been torn apart, and I've rewritten the first chapter. It's approximately 50% rewritten, and I've begun writing other chapters which interest me. By going ahead and writing the chapter out of order, I can more clearly define characters before we meet them, among other things like ensure that Chekov's arsenal is prepped and functional.

  Rational Writing

  ---

  If you choose to write a rationalist story, try not to be _too_ hamfisted or upfront with the ai discussion or the concepts. Sprinkle them throughout your story, don't let any one chapter become overburdened by it. General rule: ensure the plot progresses for 2/3 the wordcount of any given chapter, and the rationalist discussion is 1/3 the wordcount. In fact, it's best to have a quick lesson, then have the character explore the idea a bit in their actions, and whether or not that character decides if the concept makes sense. Some of the weakest Rationalist chapters end up spending too much time discussing the rationalist section and not enough on the actual progression. If you want to raise the waterline, ensure the story itself doesn't get bogged down teaching. 

  The reason for this is suspension of disbelief. To keep your reader interested in your story, tricking them into learning, is to make sure the rationalist discussion does not overburden the reader.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Agreed with your point about the balance between plot progression and preaching.

    If anything, finding organic ways for characters to use cool skills (i.e. seamless integration) seems optimal. You don't want to have a John Galt-esque digression. *Ever*.

  [This GQ article](http://www.gq.com/story/start-working-out-again-in-5-steps) about fitness mirrors a lot of my thoughts on goal-oriented action and dealing with [akrasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrasia) in general. The focus on achievable steps, on methods over results, and creating circumstances that make working out an easier decision, etc, are good. This isn't a super good guide to getting in shape, but it's a good guide to use along with your plan to get in shape. Often, our enemy isn't determining the right thing to do, it's actually doing it--and practices like these help a lot.
