## The importance of casual structure when world building, and understanding the quality of a story in terms of information entropy

### Post:

I love thinking about what makes a story compelling.  One thing that is obvious to everyone here is there needs to be some consistency when building a world with characters.  But I think there’s a way of thinking of consistency in terms of information entropy.  I’m a theoretical physicist, and I’ve been working as a quantum information scientist for the past four years.  Because of this, I think of everything in terms of information and information processing.  In information theory, one of the main objects of study is information entropy.  It essentially measures how well a model of something can reduce the uncertainty of a measurement outcome and predict the future.  I think as minds, we are always trying to predict the future state of the universe given its present and past state.  As such, predicting the future is an essential aspect of reality.  I think that’s why it’s so important that the rules of a fictional world and it’s characters have consistency.  If a story is to function like a virtual experience that takes its audience on an emotional journey, it must be able to stimulate our want to predict the future.  If the rules of the world don’t follow consistent constraints, then the capacity to predict anything degrades and the world feels less real.  I started a podcast with my brother called The Bottom Turtle Podcast, and in our episode [When X then Y because of Z](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-bottom-turtle-podcast/id1538293885?i=1000503701082) we discuss what it means for a story to feel real, and what makes a good story in the context of information.  We think that when one thinks in terms of information entropy, one can start to identify objective traits that make a story bad.  For instance, if a 2 hour movie consists of a sequence of 10 second intervals of scenes chosen from random movies, that is just noise, and that is an objectively bad story.  The more a story is similar to pure noise, the more we can say something about its objective quality. We discuss in more detail in our episode [Conspiracies and False Trophies ](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-bottom-turtle-podcast/id1538293885?i=1000505016164) how constraints play a similar role when interpreting reality and give more examples of what it means to create a compelling story given constraints.  This discussion in our podcast about the importance of causal structure when world building is one aspect in a larger context of reimagining all of reality only using the concept of information.

  Some interesting ideas. I disagree that viewers/readers are constantly predicting the future and updating their predictions, that this is a part of the story telling experience. If anything, the current trend of fast paced, dialogue-light blockbusters that can be consumed agnostically by anyone in the world is proof against it. They are pure Id/system 1 experience, no thinking or forethought required. 

  But I do like world building for its own sake, i.e. not just in service to a narrative, so I'll check out your podcast.
