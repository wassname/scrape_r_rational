## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  Suppose that starting right now, without any warning or explanation, time is reset back to 10 years ago, i.e., every piece of matter/energy is moved back to its location 10 years ago. But everyone who is alive both now and 10 years ago retains their memories.

  If you are one of the people who retains their memories, is there any way for you to exploit this to become rich/powerful/whatever other goal you have?

    Well, I would have (most of) a college education and no debt, so I got that going for me, which is nice.  Shame about the credentials though.

    Other than that, I think that some of the other millions of people would suck up the easy opportunities.  Popular media could be rebuilt fairly easily (TV shows, books, etc.), and prospecting could as well.  Science and technology would be harder (and I don't have any particular specialties there), but very highly prioritized for obvious reasons.

      Well, since most people would keep their memories, couldn't your college give credentials to the people that they remember graduating? Hope someone remembers you did!

      > Other than that, I think that some of the other millions of people would suck up the easy opportunities.

      Well, what are the easy opportunities here anyway? If you tried making a book/movie that you didn't originally make, the original makers and the people who remember could still try to sue you.

        The college would want to show fairness and a lack of favouritism in a way that leaves a paper trail.

        Most likely, they'll (once-off) allow a set of exams for just about every degree that just about anyone can take with some fairly minimal cost, so if you can show in the exam that you still know your stuff, you can re-obtain your degree in double-quick time.
        ```

          The college would want to get paid.  In a utopia where we're trying to maximize public value it would be best for society to just give back all of the degrees that can be verified, but as individuals the college wants your money.  And arguably has a right to it.  They spent years teaching you stuff in exchange for your tuition money.  When time gets rewound all of the money you gave them is magically transported back into your bank account, but all of the teaching they gave you is still in your brain.

          This actually brings up an interesting moral conundrum.  Should you have to give them the money again?  For most careers that produce physical goods or services, the things they accomplished during those years have vanished, so whoever purchased it no longer has it, they certainly shouldn't have to pay for a good that they no longer have.  However the workers have regained the time they spent, so if they want to get paid again they need to do the work again.

          However in intellectual work such as teaching, the product has not been lost.  The teacher or professor spent ten years teaching people, or doing research, and even though the fruits of their labor still exist, the money they were paid for that labor is now magically back in the bank accounts of the people who learned from them.  Or actually, the money doesn't exist because the people, or their parents, likely earned the tuition money during that time and will have to re-earn the money by doing jobs.  However, the teachers can't "redo" the work in the same way other people could, because there is no a shortage of knowledgeable students.  Suddenly, people aged 8-18 don't need to be taught in public schools, people aged 12-24 have likely already graduated college and will no longer need to attend.  For the next ten years, the vast majority of people who would be attending college already have.  So if they don't have to repay their tuition, or really even if they do, a lot of teachers and professors will have to be laid off because they already did their jobs in the alternate timeline.

          Your solution is great for students, not so great for the teachers (and I'm not sure what is, they're kind of screwed no matter what we do)

            Well, the one-off exams that the universities allow will of course not be *free* exams, so the university will get a certain amount of money right upfront. And they will be strictly marked, with the red pen on standby (because, as you point out, the university *does* want students).

            And there will be some people who will reclaim their degrees - and immediately get started on a second degree, because they can afford it and/or they really loved the campus life.

            And then there's the ones who died in the interval in the original timeline...

            So, yeah. Universities will get a chunk of money up front from the re-sat exams, but then have a bunch of very lean years. I expect they'll be doing a lot of encouraging people to go for second degrees (and pointing out that the job market just gained a massive amount of competition - the guy who you would have replaced in five years from now hasn't retired yet...)

    This event's definition of alive is going to be relevant to abortion, cryonics, cardiac arrest, amnesiacs, and how much information a newborn's brain can contain. The stock market is as inexploitable as ever, though one might be able to find short-term arbitrage in people that don't watch it.

      That is a good point. Politics world wide will be in some upheaval or another, since all the scandals making certain politicians ineligible in hindsight will now have become unvotable in ‘presight’. International sanctions will be made harsher if they weren’t effective.

      The same goes for a lot of economics. The 2008 sub-prime crisis that lead to the recession that followed will start a year early, to name just one thing. 

      In academia and universities you might see an uptick in demands of merit-testing for all those who want to get their degrees reinstated, despite not having yet gone through the courses this time around. 

      Furthermore, you will have a sudden influx of more competent, or at least more well-educated people insofar as people will have crammed the last 10 years of education crammed into their heads. This will wreak havoc with schools, to name just one thing.

      On a more granular level of society, there will be a sudden surge of ‘genius’ kids, again because of the education injection. The affected kids will learn the repeat material easier (since it’s repeated), but at the same time will likely be less motivated (because they already did this). This will affect testing parameters something fierce, I think, with more the bell curve flattening in that regard.

      On a more personal level, people will be going to take measure to deflect whatever tragedies befell them in the last 10 years. This may be in preventative measures, but also in shortcuts. If you know you’ll be in dire straits for the next ten years, a mentally unbalanced person may decide to take the permanent way out to relieve their suffering, which is why I expect there to be a lot of suicides.

      And you have to wonder what about the people who died in-between? Are they reset as well, with the knowledge up till their time of death? Or will they not be affected at all and feel shifted by fate, doubly so for being dead in ten years and for not having a leg up in knowledge and experience like all the others got?

      Personally, I have little ambition to go for world domination and such. I would simply avoid a lot of shit and stupid procrastination best I can and call it a win. And I’d try to keep a couple friends from stupid life choices, I suppose.

      If you want to read one exploration of an adjacent idea, you may want to read “Fast Forward” by …Wilson, I think. Somewhat similar premise, with all of humanity being in the respective heads of their X years in the future versions for a couple minutes. The early part of the novel deals more with the immediate chaos that ensued when all of humanity suddenly fell unconscious for the time they went to the future.

      ----

      Overall a very interesting and intriguing idea for a novel, actually, with potential for heaps of drama on all kinds of levels, be they character or societal.

        ...there are going to be some *extremely* embarrassing situations in those first ten minutes after the reset. Some guy who had a very acrimonious divorce in 2012 suddenly eating supper at the same table as his wife, for example, is going to need to be *very* diplomatic *very* quickly (as will the wife) or they're going to end up with broken crockery.

        People who suddenly 'wake up' driving are going to be in serious trouble for about ten to fifteen minutes, though they'll likely be fine if they have quick reactions.

        There will probably be a spate of sudden arrests, and the legal question of 'can you put someone in jail for something they haven't done yet?' will actually need to be seriously considered in court.

        There's going to be an immediate conflict between the world leaders who were in power 10 years ago and the ones that are in power now. 

        E.g.  Donald Trump and his supporters will argue that magical forces re-winding time don't change the fact that Trump was elected President and everyone in the country knows it. Meanwhile his opponents (likely bolstered by those who think this is a sign from God or whatever) will argue that it's *verifiably* 2007, and every record on Earth shows George Bush is the POTUS with almost a year still to go in his presidency.

        There will be a lot of arguing over the legal definition of "year".

        Suddenly this time reset feels very tantalizing. XD

        And now it's not :(. Damn economics.

        Couldn't students just skip 10 grades ahead? I mean, it would probably be pretty tedious sorting out who gets to advance how many grades, since some people may have been held back or dropped out or died and so shouldn't be advanced 10 grades, but overall it should be doable...

        > And you have to wonder what about the people who died in-between? Are they reset as well, with the knowledge up till their time of death?

        In this scenario no. Anyone who isn't alive now doesn't get a memory transfer. Same for anyone who was conceived within the last 10 years. You have to be alive both now and 10 years ago.

        Though on the plus side, if you died within the last 10 years, and time reset back to the point when you're alive, isn't that incredibly lucky for you? Most people just got some extra knowledge, you get to literally cheat death. Ask people what killed you and avoid it this time. 

        Unless it's unavoidable, like a terminal illness you already have, in which case RIP. :(

        > you may want to read “Fast Forward” by …Wilson, 

        Oh yeah someone recommended this to me a while back, I kinda forgot about it until now. It seems fairly interesting.

        > Overall a very interesting and intriguing idea for a novel, actually, with potential for heaps of drama on all kinds of levels, be they character or societal.

        I so wish I had the writing ability to do this. Like /u/CCC_037 suggested, just the divorces alone would be dramatic chaos. Especially if the divorce was because of something like a child dying/miscarriage, yet the child is alive and healthy now...

          What about someone conceived but not yet born? There's a nine-month gap in there, no doubt *someone* will be exactly the right age...

          And what about children who were nine years old pre-reset? Can they even be born again, or would one merely get a sibling for them?

          > Though on the plus side, if you died within the last 10 years, and time reset back to the point when you're alive, isn't that incredibly lucky for you? Most people just got some extra knowledge, you get to literally cheat death. Ask people what killed you and avoid it this time.

          If it's more than six months away, it almost certainly won't happen the same way again - too much will change.

          "You cheated on me with that hussy!"

          "No I didn't! Yet! I mean, you can't divorce me based on something I haven't done!"

          "Is THAT your excuse?"

    Honestly, I think this would, by and large, be a huge gift. It'll be (a bit less than) ten extra years of life for everyone affected. Excepting the people who died in the interim (who will be extraordinarily confused) to everyone else it's still basically 2017. Our technology's taken a bit of a hit, and records from the intervening time will obviously have disappeared, but across scientists and academics, we'll retain much of the information we've learnt in the interim, as well as much of our worldview. There would be significant upheaval with our legal system, but such change would be temporary. Meanwhile, by the time we got around to 2017 again, the world's technology base would look more like 2023/2024 or so.

    From a more personal perspective, it would suck incredibly hard for all the young adults now in child or teenager bodies, and especially for those who have since broken ties with their families for one reason or another. It would be quite the tragedy for all the children younger than ten to be effectively "killed". I predict a rash of suicides and sexual abuse cases in the immediate aftermath. That being said, the issues caused by legislation (not being considered a legal adult) can be solved with legislation, and while certainly a lot of people will be in a lot of pain, I'm perhaps naive in thinking that for most people, there would only be a few years of true suck, and after that they'd regain most of their autonomy.

    In terms of exploiting the situation, outside of edge cases involving taking advantage of the relative chaos in the early months, I think it's largely dependent on your own initial conditions. I think most people would basically end up just making a few better health decisions.

    Oh, and also climate change would be delayed by 10 years, and with the massive boost to solar panel/wind turbine technology, even without the documentation, the time skip would end up being pretty great for the environment.

    edit: now that I think about this, it would make a fantastic writing prompt. Post it there and see how it works out! Send me a link and I'll try and write something.
