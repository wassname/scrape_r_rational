## [Challenge Companion] Punishment

### Post:

**tl;dr: this is the companion thread for [the weekly challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a3kagk/biweekly_challenge_punishment/?), post ideas, recommendations, chit-chat, etc., here.**

When I think of "punishment", my mind typically goes to Hell. Two recommendations in that vein are [Unsong](http://unsongbook.com/) by Scott Alexander and [Surface Detail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Detail) by Iain M. Banks.

The alternate take (for me) would be a societal justice system, where "rehabilitation", "punishment", and "deterrence" are all typically considerations that work at odds with each other (and get explored in *Black Mirror* in at least some detail through a number of different episodes).

### Comments:

- u/Trips-Over-Tail:
  ```
  I wish I could remember the name of the book, but there is a science fiction story in which many crimes are punishable with decapitation. Which you survive after having your personality and memories and essential regulatory functions downloaded into a digital device that is implanted into your pelvic ganglion. You are expected to spend your own money on sensory replacements.

  It's like an extremely drastic version of punitive branding.
