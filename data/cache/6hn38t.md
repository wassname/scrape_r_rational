## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  So I've been writing a MTG/Worm Fanfiction cross called [Tearing the Aeons](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/tearing-the-aeons-alt-power-au-elements.529801/).

  I had the terrible impulse last Wednesday to [troll my readers](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/tearing-the-aeons-alt-power-au-elements.529801/page-7#post-36059662) by introducing a complete jarring chapter, with Zero (heh) indication that it was non-canon, and in fact, added it as a *Threadmark canon* chapter.

  After I got done with my giggling fits, I announced the chapter to be non-canon. 

  At one point, someone stated the following: 

  >Well....somehow I feel like I should have seen that coming.

  >Tearing the Aeons, planeswalking effects. Seems a bit obvious in retrospect.

  Even in standard fan fiction and non-rational fiction, there should never be something which completely and totally blindsides the reader in theme _or_ in plot progress. While not everything in a story needs to be puzzleable or predictable, the themes and progress should be relevant and consistent, and develop step by step.

  I redid the same thing following [literally the same formula](https://forums.spacebattles.com/posts/36071041/) for an Omake I wrote for [Ring-Maker](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ring-maker-worm-lord-of-the-rings-alt-power.517894/) (I beta read for the author of the Worm/LotR cross Ring-Maker). 

  That fic received a few similar comments, but there's enough overlap between our readerships which made the Ring-Maker omake even funnier.

  There's a study of human psychology and rationalization ex-post-facto somewhere in here, but I'll leave that to psychology people like /u/ScottAlexander.

  I've been playing Ori and the Blind Forest, which is the sort of critically acclaimed game that is probably not for me. Anytime I start a game with 5 minutes of cutscenes, or I have to repeatedly sit through unskippable cutscenes, I think that this was probably a team that gave priority to story over gameplay. Normally I don't have much of a problem with that (I like the Uncharted series, for example) but it feels really out of place in what's essentially just a pretty metroidvania. The game also resets you to your last save point after you die (in a game that has lots of instadeath), which I see as being fundamentally unfriendly, since it erases progress *and* often makes you sit through unskippable cutscenes again. But I get why it's critically acclaimed; it's pretty and somber with a good aesthetic. I just wish that they had focused on gameplay considerations a little more. (I was probably spoiled a little bit by Hollow Knight, a metroidvania that has little touches everywhere that showed more consideration for the player.)

  I kind of want to write a story or dialogue heavy game at some point, in part because I think branching dialogue and player-driven choices are neat. I have this idea for a game called "Kill Hitler" where you go back in time and kill Hitler at various points in his life. The speedrun of the game would be under a minute - you just repeatedly select the option to kill Hitler. If you want though, you can talk to Hitler when he's sitting in the trenches of WWI, when he's an art student, when he's sitting in jail, etc. to get a more complex biographical portrait. But I'd have to do a bunch of research to get it right, and that seems like a ton of work, so that's another idea that probably doesn't go anywhere. (I really like the title "Kill Hitler" for a game that's philosophically about the appropriateness of violence as a solution to various problems.)
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Huh. It's interesting that you list the death-resets-to-save-point feature as a bug, since I thought it was probably the most brilliant part of the game. Specifically I mean how it treats save points as a resource that you can use whenever you feel it's most necessary, but if you overuse obviously you may find yourself having to adventure farther and farther from one before finding a recharge, which ups the tension very organically. Ori's definitely not a perfect game (I found the aesthetics and world great but the story itself lacking) but the gameplay was practically flawless, to me (a minor gripe I have with it is that the combat upgrades are pretty pointless after the fourth or fifth one, which isn't that big a deal since there isn't enough XP in a normal completion of the game to get them all anyway, but would suck for anyone that didn't realize that ahead of time and missed out on the other, more important upgrades).

    Kill Hitler sounds like it would be a great game that might work as a CYOA interactive comic over a fully graphiced out Tell Tale Games kind of thing. I agree that the title and concept are neat though :)

    Funnily enough, my experience with these two games was pretty much the exact opposite of yours. 

    I greatly enjoyed *Ori* — the controls, the flexible powers, the soundtrack, and even the difficulty and the deaths which force you to enter a certain (meditative?) frame of mind or quit playing because otherwise you’ll just be getting frustrated. 

    And I found the *Hollow Knight* to be bland, containing too many grinding elements (you even need to farm monsters to buy and upgrade your map) and having too many pointless game mechanics (e.g. Hunter's Journal, which is given to you with vague remarks about what exactly it will be unlocking when completed — the answer to which ends up being [“nothing”\).](https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/61su3h/whats_the_reward_for_completing_the_hunters/) At some point the monotony of the convoluted passages just killed my interest enough for me to uninstall the game, even though cosmetically these passages *are* drawn rather prettily.

    >where you go back in time and kill Hitler at various points in his life

    If you do end up making a game like that, can you please also include options of 1) [adopting him](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4yz4ip/fics_where_harry_goes_back_in_time_and_adopts_tom/) and 2) [ignoring him and fixing societal problems instead](https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/5q72fe/lf_books_where_someone_goes_back_in_time_but/)?
    ```

  - u/ketura:
    ```
    Yeah, Ori didn't resonate with me, either (although the reason I dropped it was due to a broken controller, but it certainly didn't inspire me to go back and try it again). I think a lot of gamers who want to be game devs actually want to be movie directors, and have somehow conflated all of the classic director tropes with game development. Either that or they don't realize that story-heavy JRPG is its own genre, and they don't need to inject story unnecessarily where it's unneeded. 

    Your proposal is actually perfect for a story heavy game, and is actually a pretty neat idea. So long as you don't try and make it an FPS with dialog tacked on, you're golden. Could even make it text based for a prototype, since visuals aren't really crucial until the other kinks have been worked out.

    ```
    Speaking of making games, I really really want to make a Minecraft / Don't Starve inspired adaptation of Glimwarden at some point.

    The whole "You need to kill mobs on a regular basis to fuel the devices keeping them from spawning on top of civilians, and build a whole architecture around killing those mobs" is a great theme for a Minecraf-like game; it provides a sense of necessity behind every single thing you build, whereas in Minecraft you're pretty quickly building complex systems for the sake of playing with redstone.
    ```

    - u/NotACauldronAgent:
      ```
      Huh. I am an avid player of Minecraft mod packs, and that got me wondering how that could be done. As far as I can tell, it would be definably possible. 

      1) Take a mob-focused pack. For this example, Blood&Bones. 

      2) Add to every mob a very high chance of the Heart drop, in quantities varying in quantity. 

      3) Use hearts in every recipe, make the heart container have a mob repulsing feature, consuming gives you a buff.
      ```

      - u/CouteauBleu:
        ```
        That would be a start; but ideally, I'd want to create an entire gameplay structure around it. (the same way Minecraft has a hunger mechanism, but none of the dynamics of Don't Starve)

        Orbs wouldn't just make you more powerful, they would be necessary for survival. If you don't get enough orbs regularly, then the monsters attack and your town dies.

        As your town develops and grows, the need for orbs augment, and with it the need for infrastructure. A town with twice the diameter needs eight time more orbs; which means you need to recruit other Glimwardens (or "hunters" in the context of a new IP, you know what I mean), build infrastructure to store orbs, more efficient orbs, means of transportation, housings and service buildings; you need weapons to better hunt darklings, which have their own supply chain; and so on.
        ```

        - u/NotACauldronAgent:
          ```
          At this point, you might as well go full Civ. Don't get me wrong, I would play it, but Minecraft's AI couldn't handle actual strategizing like that. Imagine Civ (I know V best but VI also probably works) with what amounts to retextured barbarians, instead of or including the gold drops, they give a heart, which is retextured Faith. None of the other stuff like founding religions can be done with faith and none of the buildings that usually make it exist anymore, but now the building requirements include Faith as well for Glimwarden soldiers which are super effective against the barbarians and can be upgraded with hearts, and every turn based on city size or something you lose faith. Negative faith nets a whole lot of bad effects, and darklings spawn everywhere.
          ```

          - u/CouteauBleu:
            ```
            I'm not thinking about making a mod. I'm thinking about making a full-scale game that would run on the engine we're currently making for our end-of-school project.

            So the Glimwarden parallels wouldn't be cosmetic, they would be embedded in the mechanics of the game.

  Well, I have certainly been lax in working on this project over the last couple months.  Between struggling with the drive to do things right or not at all and other side projects absorbing my attention, I’ve gotten jack shit done on this project for far too long.


  My wake-up call came when I stumbled across [this article](https://watirmelon.blog/2015/02/02/iterative-vs-incremental-software-development/) which discusses the difference between Iterative and Incremental software development.  Incremental basically means “start out with the whole thing designed, and then make it piece by piece”, while iterative means “sketch the whole thing out, and then flesh everything out as it’s needed”.

  The way that this was presented grabbed my attention.  At work, I’m fond of saying that “I’m an iterator, not an innovator”, which is to say, I can’t actually do very well when told to make something out of the blue; I actually work a lot better if there’s something that’s at least kind of what we want (even if it’s shitty) and I identify all the flaws and fix them.  Reading this article may well have me change this motto to “I’m an iterator, not an incrementer”, especially now that I’ve realized that I’ve been avoiding working on this project due to the development paradigm being at odds with my natural strengths.


  So, it’s been high time that I set aside all the books and design documents and attempts to be seen as a “real” game designer and just Get Shit Done™.  To that end, I started development on XGEF in earnest this week, and I’ll just do what I do best: wing it, and if that don’t work, wing harder.

  ----

  I started using unit tests for the first time on what I’ve done so far, and I have to say I quite like the paradigm.  It forces me to try and foresee as many problems as possible with the current block of code, and just seems to help focus my work in a way I quite like.


  For those of you who aren’t familiar, unit tests are where you write a small function that tests to see if the given specific thing you are testing works:

  http://i.imgur.com/eBKtMcl.png


  For instance, I have a small system that crawls through a given directory and pulls all the filenames of all the files in that directory and subdirectories.  It has three modes: Blacklist extension, Whitelist extension, and no filter.  In the screenshot above, you can (kinda) make out that there are three unit tests that are associated with these modes.  For the blacklist check, it blacklists the *.cs extention, makes the system crawl a known directory, and then checks to see if it has any *.cs files in its list.  If it doesn’t, then it’s working fine; if it does, then something has gone horribly wrong.

  So the benefit is twofold: since these tests stick around for all eternity, in the event that I change my code later, these tests will inform me if I have broken something that used to work (and that I cared about enough to make a unit test for), and second, it turns out that this gamifies the *shit* out of the process.  I’m not sure I’ve ever been so satisfied in a programming session as when I had a big ol’ list of red failed tests turn to a row of green ones over the course of the night.


  ----


  While I did spend a good portion of the last several weeks playing games, some of it was actually indirectly beneficial to this project.  I recently picked up Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance (Forever) and I have been quite enamored with its design.  My RTS experience has always been Starcraft, Warcraft, and Star Wars Battlegrounds (an Age of Empires reskin), but this just blows those games out of the water.  It doesn’t force you to deal with a bunch of meaningless attention-sucking actions, and streamlines *everything* to allow you to focus entirely on the strategy.  A breath of fresh air, as a long-time Starcraft player.

  But the real benefit has been in seeing how the mod scene works.  Fortunately, the community is still alive (and have even made a custom client/launcher that adds matchmaking, map repositories, IRC chat, and more), and it’s largely due to the incredible flexibility of the game’s modding capabilities.


  I actually spent a good while working on a control mod to include the handful of things that I missed from starcraft (such as A + click to attack-move, among other things), and it has completely validated some of the iffier parts of the mod design that have been floating around in my head for this project.  The game itself is made up of hundreds of Lua scripts, and when modding, you simply include a Lua script of the same name as the one who’s functionality you want to change, and overwrite the bits you want to change.  

  It’s elegant, it’s flexible, and it allowed someone like me, who had never played the game and who had never actually looked at Lua, to add significant functionality within only hours of first exposure.  It has certainly been encouraging, and now I have a major example to work off of (read: iterate!).

  Does anyone know why M and N occur together in so many words (at least in English)? Robot, money, mnemonic, demon, many, maniac, diamond, name, etc. By the availability heuristic it seems that it's more often m followed by n but that might not be the case.

    My linguistics is a bit rusty, but I think it's probably related to the sounds and how mouths make shapes. [m] and [n] are both nasalized consonants, pronounced with a closed velum so air flows through the nose. In all the examples you give, there's a vowel between [m] and [n], which would be nasalized too. So perhaps it's that the human mouth has an easier time of maintaining nasalization through a longer stretch of word, which directs pressure on the language in that direction.

    Using this online [Regex dictionary](http://www.visca.com/regexdict/) I looked up the number of words which match the patterns `/^[^mn]*m[^mn]*n[^mn]*$/` and `/^[^mn]*n[^mn]*m[^mn]*$/` (i.e. m before n vs n before m, where the word has exactly one of each).

    There were 2,934 matches for m before n and only 1,327 for n before m. Things seemed to match roughly that proportion for the different parts of speech.

    Removing the "exactly one m and one n" restriction, the results are similar (4,461 m before n, 2,298 n before m).

    Probably the most telling example, and the one I think you were hinting at, is that if the m and n are separated by 0 or 1 letters, "m before n" had 1,465 matches and "n before m" had only 384, a ratio of about 3.8:1.

    This implies that English does prefer "m before n" to "n before m" when constructing words. This may be due to some property of the words, or some other 

    The next step would be to compare their frequency in a representative corpus of text (of which there are many freely available, but I can't be bothered to test it right now). That could tell us if English usage reflects the raw proportion of words, or whether there's an additional bias (e.g. if people dislike "n...m", it might be even rarer than its dictionary frequency).

      That's pretty handy - I was going to try using NLTK, but this is much easier. 

      I notice that the same phenomenon seems to occur with p and t, the unvoiced stops with the same places of articulation, with 3468 results for 

          /^[^pt]*p[^pt]*t[^pt]*$/

      versus 1081 for

      Interesting, thanks!

      It would also be interesting to test "n before m vs m before n in the same syllable" but that can't be regexed and requires a dictionary with extra grammar information about words, which is probably more effort than it's worth.

        Well, you can exclude words with 

            /n[aeiouy]*m/

        or

            /m[aeiouy]*n/ 

        That is, where the n and m don't have a consonant between them. (If I got the regex right, anyway). I get 1381 results for M before N, 910 results for n first. So there's still a pretty clear trend.

        On another part of the question, 23.7% of words in the dictionary contain an M, and 43.7 percent contain an N. If the were uncorrelated, we'd expect 10.3 percent to have both. 

        Looking at the dictionary, I found that 9% have both M and N, so they actually *don't* occur together more often then chance, though when they do, M does tend to be first.

    Punishment is different than Absence-of-Benefits.  Punishment is an active choice and typically removes value for the purposes of deterring specific actions.  It only serves a purpose if people are able to avoid it by behaving in a certain, publicly known, socially-optimal way.

    Meanwhile, allowing poor children to remain poor is more acceptable because A) it is a passive action.  Nobody caused them to become poor, nobody came and stole their money, they were just born that way.  It is less wrong to do nothing and allow nature to be cruel than it is to actively be cruel yourself.  And B) helping poor children comes at a cost.  Every penny they are given has to be taken from someone else, possibly unwillingly in the case of taxes.  Not-punishing children is free, in fact it's cheaper than it would be to punish them for the crimes of their parents.  Giving charity is not free.

  /u/DaystarEld, how would you go about helping someone with haphephobia in the absence of professional help? (Though I suppose YOU don't have that problem :P)

  I don't presently have the ability to get more information from them, but they've always had a "clear sense of personal boundaries" and do not understand how other people can lower them to tolerate or even enjoy touch, and I'm not sure how to explain that or help them.

    Hard to say without more information about background and day-to-day experience. If it's severe enough that things like even a brief hug with a loved one or a hand on the arm or shoulder causes significant distress, my general suspicion would be some form of trauma, which is a very delicate thing to address outside of a professional relationship.

    If we discount trauma and just focus on the symptoms to address it through a behaviorist lens, I'd probably try to isolate exceptions (if any) and see what makes those situations different so they can try to inhabit that perspective in slowly-safer situations. Gradual exposure to build up a better comfort level in general would probably be my main suggestion, but again it depends on the severity and context. Does seeing other people touch bother them too? Does being close-but-not-touching distract them? It's the work of a session or two just to get a calibration for where a good starting point would be, so finding the least probematic form and working the way up from there is the first step. Desensitization is sometimes hard to do outside of a therapeutic context too, but it depends on the person.

    Hope that's helpful :)
