## [META] Rational porn fanfic - does it count?

### Post:

A couple of days ago, I've thought of a pretty good idea for a porn fanfic that parodies a superhero movie. It's got actual plot (obviously), and the characters are supposed to behave in realistic ways according to the rules of the (superhero) universe. 

Only with a slightly (much?) higher than average sex drive to justify the sex scenes that make it a porn. Sex is pretty important for the plot (the climax of the story actually happens as a result of a sex scene, pun intended).

It's not written yet, only a draft I don't want to spoil.

I feel this has to be a porn because if I'm to include the couple of interesting sex scenes that make it work, you better make it really explicit so that they don't stand out and the reader understands that this is porn.

The idea would be to play with the tropes of superhero stories AND porn movies, so I basically consider it normal for impromptu sex to occur (the same way spiderman movies consider the appearance of supervillains as a result of industrial accidents an everyday occurrence).

My (meta) question is: as long as there is an actual plot, which gets pretty intellectual in some
parts, and the characters have relatable motivations, can this be rational fic?

  Replace "sex scene" with "fight scene" and all of a sudden it doesn't seem like it's a question that you need to bother asking, if you get me: I assume everyone would be fine with a rational superhero fanfic where spiderman gets into very well described karate battles that get into explicit detail. Maybe people might not enjoy reading well-described fight scenes like that - I know that's not really my jam - but nobody would think that your story was *not rational* just because you thought that including detailed fight scenes was helpful to your story.

  The fact you replace "scenes where they're trying to poke each other with swords" with "scenes where they're trying to *poke* each other with *swords*" and all of a sudden there's a question says a lot about what people think about the "prestige" of different stories in general.

  If you want to write a "low-prestige" story, more power to you, I say. We always need more diversity, and the rational space is no exception. I'm working on an original supernatural romance (non-explicit) partly for this reason (mostly because I wanted to write one). 

  More power to you, I say. It's not really something I'd like to read personally (I'm not a fan of superhero stories, and I like my titillating stories to be very light on plot), but if I see you post it here I'll try to give it a shot.

    I agree with you, but in the interest of steelmanning the opposition: sex is an extremely... well, *arousing* thing, and it's reasonable to assume that an author of erotica is driven, at least to some extent, by his/her own fantasies. There's nothing wrong with that, of course, but it does mean that there are additional factors at play during the course of writing a story wherein sex features heavily, and that these factors tend to be at best *arational*. (Something similar could be said of high-adrenaline fight scenes, of course, but to a lesser extent.)
    ```

    - u/RMcD94:
      ```
      I would say that's true of all writing, and not to such a lesser extent that it suddenly becomes only important for sex.

      The vast majority of fictional authors write because of intrinsic motivation, it's another thing when you're talking about mandatory essays or reports but as long as humans are a bunch of chemicals and physical processes rather than a set of rules there will always be irrational/arational motivations.
      ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      To sort of tack onto the concept that "if you titillate your readers you are doing the wrong thing", I think if a good writer makes someone feel scared during a scary part of a story, then why shouldn't a good writer also make someone feel, well, *sexy* during a sexy part of the story?

      That said, if a story is all jump scares and no plot then it's not a very good story; equally if a story is all quivering members and no plot then it's not a very good story. (In both cases, unless you want nothing but jump scares/quivering members, in which case they're *perfect*.)

      FWIW I read the Crystal Society story that people referred to in other posts, and I found the sex scene both titillating and vitally important to the plot/character development.

    Or replace "sex scene" with "a whole bunch of really bad puns". Though I admit you can go too far with that: there's things like Unsong or the Xanth series, which are like 99% bad-reference-porn.

    Hail Eris.
    ```

    - u/aspiring_author999:
      ```
      Ahahah, I don't think Unsong is rational fiction and it doesn't try to be.

      EDIT: removed spoilers until I can get the spoiler tag to work.

        I don't think Xanth is rational either. :)

        Also, I wish you hadn't spoiled Unsong. I gave up on it, but I might pick it up again.
        ```

        - u/aspiring_author999:
          ```
          Sorry, the point of marking it as a spiler was to avoid spoiling it... I'm sorry it didn't work

    ```
    I think the main break from "rationality" is having characters in a mood for sex in situations in which they wouldn't be in real life. But I think I can tweak the story in order to keep the sex constant and the situations more credible
    ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      Yeah, having them be in the mood for sex when it wouldn't make sense for them to be could be a problem.

      That said, if their society is more like bonobos than like chimpanzees, you could probably put that into the worldbuilding...
      ```

      - u/aspiring_author999:
        ```
        Yes, I haven't decided yet if I want to describe a bonobo like society, or something like reality unless noted.
        ```

        - u/MagicWeasel:
          ```
          If people are having sex at the drop of a hat, you need to have some sort of "sex = handshake" society, or, like, "a sex potion is made and there is lust in the air can our heroes stop it before succumbing to its effects?" plot device.

          Honestly I"m really intrigued by this whole concept. Can't wait to read it!
          ```

          - u/aspiring_author999:
            ```
            I like the idea of the sex potion. I might use it :p
            ```

            - u/MagicWeasel:
              ```
              Sex potion would be hard... (heh, *hard*)

              You gotta really make sure you nail this point from the sidebar:

              * Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.

              And what problem would the Bad Guy need to solve that is best accomplished with a Sex Potion?
              ```

              - u/aspiring_author999:
                ```
                Uh, many possibilities for that... controlling his/her enemies through lust and blackmail, totally legit libido enhancing drug with bad side effects he/she's hiding. Or maybe it's must a normal drug that becomes so prevalent that it shapes society (think alcohol or tobacco).
                ```

                - u/MagicWeasel:
                  ```
                  I like the idea of it becoming a normalised drug. That would make some interesting worldbuilding!
                  ```

  - u/philip1201:
    ```
    In fight scenes, the practical goals are often paramount. You don't care about how you feel while you take someone out, you just want to find a way to win. You could write a brawl where emotion is most important, but it isn't meaningless if the characters focus on the technicalities instead.

    Sex, on the other hand, is primarily emotional, which makes it much harder to be intellectual about in the moment without defeating the purpose. The same goes for comedy - while there are no sex scenes in HPMoR, there aren't any rationalist procedural scenes about characters trying to be funny either; there are just people making jokes.

    You could undoubtedly write a good sex scene in a rationalist work, and have people act rationally outside the scene and rational-but-preoccupied in the scene. You can probably write an interesting or even engaging sex scene where a character rationally tries to approach sex, or a rational description of having sex. But a pornographic rational sex scene doesn't seem possible, any more than a funny rational comedy writing scene, or an emotionally charged rational fight scene for that matter.
    ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      So, what, you're basically saying that "sex itself isn't necessarily rational, so in a rational work, it would not be explicitly rational"? Because I endorse that, more-or-less. (You could have the sex scene further Rational Goals, like wanting to distract someone, wanting to make the Evil Ejaculate of Doom go into your Resistant Vagina Of Awesomeness instead of the metropolis water supply)

      I'll hold the *Crystal Society* sex scene up as a good example - you get a *lot* of character development and stuff happening in what is otherwise a very graphic sapphic sex scene.

      I think we're conflating Rational and Rational*ist* fiction? Rationalist has a huge helping of, well, prosthelytizing, whereas Rational just basically means "makes sense".
      ```

- u/groon_the_walker:
  ```
  Besides the aforementioned *Care and Feeding of Magical Creatures* and *Crystal Society* as clear examples of stories in which characters are being curious and intelligent about and during sex, I would offer up my own opus [The Erogamer](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/) as an example of pornography meant to arouse both the mind and the flesh.  For example the scene in 1.6 where the protagonist is wondering what her powers' rules are and why while trying to wake somebody up with oral sex.  You'll need a Questionable Questing login to read.
  ```

  - u/Endovior:
    ```
    Oh, wow; this.

    The quest format doesn't normally lend itself to the Rational genre of fiction, since it is frequently the case that the rules are getting made up as the story advances... behind the scenes, by the QM, in response to the choices of the players. This is *especially* true for Gamer-type quests, which are defined by mysterious and incredible powers appearing in response to the PC doing random things.

    Turning that around, with a character intelligently *responding* to the sudden appearance of an individual with strange and potentially world-shaking powers, and having deep philosophical discussions with them in an attempt to avert the potential horrible consequences of such a being invoking those powers at whim...

    That's significantly deeper and more compelling than I was expecting from pornographic fiction. The hosting site does provide a bit of an entry barrier, but it's well worth the attempt. Enthusiastically recommended!
    ```

  - u/-main:
    ```
    Well, that was far better than the premise would suggest. Recommended. I'm now a bit annoyed it's not finished and wondering where the author will go with the big mysteries. I'm not sure how much familiarity you need with the genre it's drawing from -- having played a few games of that nature did help me understand, but I think it's likely not essential to enjoying the story.  

    [The superpower ](#s "Conceptual Hair ") was awesome and terrifying and interesting to read about.
    ```

- u/ArisKatsaris:
  ```
  On that note, [Forever After Earth](http://archiveofourown.org/works/1246519/chapters/2562553) is the most rationalist porn fic I know -- it even pays homage to EY by having the ship named "Eliezera". I heartily recommend it.

  It begins as a crossover between Buffy, Stargate SG-1 and the author's original universe, and it eventually turns into a mega-crossover that also fuses variants of Harry Potter, Madoka Magica, Nanoha, Fate Zero... That made it slightly confusing for me towards the end, and I think the early chapters are better, but still heartily recommending it.
  ```

  - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
    ```
    The ship name initially went right over my head, until the other details started to pile up, and then I was like "Wait, is this ship named after me?" and a chapter later "Yeah, this ship is named after me."

    I'm still not used to having an influence on other fictons.  It feels a lot like walking down the street and seeing a new shop has been built exactly like one you dreamed about last night: "These are my thoughts, what are they doing outside my own head?"

  I know there's someone here who regularly posts installments of their BDSM-themed story that is unambiguously straight up fluids-dripping erotica, in a "let's figure out the rules of this universe and its magic system, rational-style" framework. And as I recall it got a reasonably good reaction from the sub. So I'd say that's proof of concept that rational or rational-ish porn is a thing that can be written and that has an audience here.

  Edit: Turns out that story was banned, so I guess it's not proof of concept for this after all. 

  Edit 2: Actually it was just one chapter that was removed, the story was not banned.

    Care and Feeding of Magical Creatures! It's quite good, and quite sexy if you're straight and even remotely into BDSM. If a mod really banned it as mentioned below, that's fuckin' dumb.

      ```
      It's not banned!  I removed *one chapter* because it was confusing and difficult to comprehend what's going on.  Seriously, *erotic* is fine, but make it *recognizably* erotic.  If all I can tell is that something messily biological is going on, please just make the text clearer.

      Here's an easy compromise: can we get warnings or ratings for how readable a text is?

      Yeah--I'm asexual and completely indifferent to the BDSM stuff, but the cool worldbuilding aspects held my interest for a long time. I stopped keeping up on it once it entered a phase where the sex-to-plot ratio got too high to keep my interest, but I could tell that it was very well written for people who are into BDSM. I thought the seraphim were really interesting.

The post they made right before they looked at the story didn't give me the impression that they were going into it with an open mind, either.

              Sure, but if you don't cull posts then you experience drift, and over time the subreddit ceases to retain its focus. I don't expect the community at large to keep that in mind, but it's one of the duties of a mod to keep the subreddit's purpose in mind and remove posts accordingly.

    I too was very sad to see this story (rather unfairly I thought) banned, but I might try posting links to it myself when a more plotty/technical chapter turns up. I’m not the author, just a big fan.

    Discussion continues elsewhere, on questionablequesting, you'll need to (free) sign up to see and post on the NSFW forums.

    I've posted a number of commentaries on the forums there, including how the strange magic gravity might work, why the plot was damped while they were finding their way to their new digs, how the magic system might work, thoughts on the use of succubus nectar in transhumanism, speculation on the appearance of Limbo, why demons might be scared of copper, and getting way too into it asking questions to the characters. I've honestly found this to be one of the most thought stimulating stories I've read, up there along with the puzzley parts of HPatMoR.

    Also, if you message me personally (here or there, either is fine), I'll tell you what's been going on with pets voice since near the beginning. It’s such an agonisingly clever bit of writing that I decided against posting it to the forum proper.

  I don't see a reason why a rational fic cannot be porn, and vice versa.

  In fact, [Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644) - essentially universally agreed to be a rational fic - is banned from TVTropes due to being too porn-like (which I can't help but find both hilarious and frustrating), and meanwhile [Friendship is Mind Control](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/238368/friendship-is-mind-control) is definitely porn (with all that that includes), while at the same time having a rational plot (not as rational as HPMOR, maybe, but definitely on or beyond the level of HPN20), and even some rationalist themes.

  So yeah, just as you can have feminist porn, you can have rational porn. It's just going to be a bit different from normal porn in some regards.
  ```

- u/DaystarEld:
  ```
  Can rational fiction have sex scenes? Absolutely.

  Is the sex depicted rational? That's a whole different question.

  If you're committing to a rational setting, your sex has to take on the characteristics just like your other action scenes. No massive breasts without attending back problems, no random unprotected sex without STD risk being addressed, and if the female reliably climaxes multiple times a scene, then by God you'd better describe what their partner is doing in detail so the readers can test for accuracy ;)

  Unless of course the superpowers are related to or impact sexual things, which could be fun too, but then I'd want to see the consequences of that explored too.

- u/GaBeRockKing:
  ```
  Proof by induction:

  Base case: rational fics are rational (duh)
  Inductive case: adding a sex scene to a rational fic doesn't make the fic non-rational, providing the sex scene keeps to the rules of rational fic.

  So from an intellection perspective a fic with arbitrary amounts of sex can still be rational.

  However, from a past-experience perspective, any time many authors even come *close* to writing about sex they tend devolve into wish fulfilment fantasies that are decidedly non-rational, so it's going to be something of a challenge to make sure you stay on the straight-and-narrow (so to speak).

  But hey-- don't let random nerds on the internet tell you what to write. If it's something you want to do, do it. Whether it's "rational" or not doesn't matter.

  There have been discussions here about rational romance, and how to have conflict without one character just being dumb or communicating poorly. Personally I find that romance + sex fanfic > just sex fanfic so it's related but I don't have a link to the thread I'm thinking of.

      More precisely, magic should only have read-only access to emotions.

  [Crystal Society](http://crystal.raelifin.com/) is a rational story with part of the story hinged on the sexual relationship between AI and a human.

  ```
  This is going to depend on your definition of rational fiction, which is not something that the community currently comes to a clear consensus on.

  *Personally* I think that appeals to an interest in sex are likely to dilute the rational aspects, and in some cases that will be enough that I'd instead say "rational-adjacent" or "thing you might like if you like rational fiction". If the *primary purpose* of the work is appealing to sexual urges, then I probably wouldn't give it the label "rational", though I reserve the right to be surprised by execution.
  ```

  - u/MasterfulSandking:
    ```
    *Personally*, Rational stories and fiction which *involve* Sex become more real to me - more rational. In the real world, sex is a fundamental feature of The Human Experience. We wouldn't exist without sex. In almost every story, there exist characters. Those characters came into existence, not due to the author, but due to imaginary sex (for the most part). That's in-line with how this sub-reddit views rationality in Stories. 

    My point being, Sex should be in most stories because it aids Plot, World Building, and Character Creation *wink* *wink*. Not to mention that it makes the overall world of that story more Rational and believable. I also read too much erotica, and I wrote this with a grin on my face, so potential authors would add erotica in their stores.
