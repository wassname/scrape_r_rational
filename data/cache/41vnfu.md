## [D] Some ways I try to keep exposition dumps off the table in my writing.

### Post:

So some background:
I am a pretty broadly educated individual. I scrounge wikipedia at very little incentive. I listen to documentaries on just about any credible source I can confirm when I go to bed. I adore skimming Eureka Alerts every day and most of my youtube subscriptions are too "how to" and "how's this work" guides on topics ranging across fractals, linear algebra, biology, ecology, sociology, electrical engineering, chemistry, physics, writing, philosophy, trade, history and more.

I tend to think about all of this stuff and how it fits together in everything I write. But showing even a tenth of what I think about for my writing in the actual work generally makes the whole thing unreadable garbage (I also study storytelling, acting, myths etc).

So here is my list of stuff I do to shove exposition off the table for the reader.

* Put your exposition in the visuals.
This is maybe not as feasible for those of us stuck doing the written word only but I tend to shove at least half of my exposition thoughts into informing stuff like lighting, material, texture and color/line quality. Maybe try and be selective with your descriptions instead?

* Put your exposition into character background and then use that to inform on their actions.
However unless prompted never actually have them dump their backstory on some one unless that is ALSO a trait they have. (probably should acknowledge this if your going to do it with how other characters respond to them).

* Just don't tell the reader why people do things or stuff is happening.
I maybe need to tone this one down a bit, but really I've seen that for a lot of my audience just leave it a mystery, let them figure it out, don't tell them, watch their ideas percolate out.

* Have uneven knowledge on topics about the world in the cast.
This one is sort of my, well we can't avoid explaining SOMETHING so might as well do it with flair and character interaction. This is also an area I think I don't pull it off as well as I could. In particular regards to rational/rationalist fiction I really feel I should stress that you should BREAK UP the monolith of knowledge that seems to get dumped on ONE protagonist and put it in multiple characters. That way instead of LECTURE LECTURE LECTURE you can make their shared ignorance to each other a source of conflict, drama and a less clumsy way to deliver your details.

  It's not a matter of *avoiding* exposition, it's making exposition *interesting*. You can give dozens of pages of exposition, so long as it's engaging. There are a number of people that do this in the real world, but I think it's a very difficult skill to learn and master. If four million people are willing to sit down and watch this video on [how to become pope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kF8I_r9XT7A) or something -- if people will seek these things out and watch them for entertainment -- then the real issue with putting exposition in isn't that people dislike exposition, it's that most exposition is boring. But I don't think it has to be.

  One of the ways to do this is your fourth point; you can add exposition in the form of character conflict, which is inherently more interesting than just a boring monologue. I think a study of real-world exposition-as-entertainment is probably the way to go, if you want to make exposition into something that people *want* to read.

  The big literary innovation of cyberpunk as a sub-genre was the way that the characters, and the narrator, take all the new technology for granted. It happens *after* the big changes, so it doesn't waste time having anybody explain them to a newbie. Instead we figure out what has changed by watching how the plot has that tech being used, or worn, or manipulated, or broken, or repaired.

  The same way we might write about the use of a cell phone, a video streaming service, or a hybrid car.

  Magic can also be treated this way, or the details of a character's backstory, or the politics of an imaginary country. Basically it's exposition as dramatic irony in reverse: Everybody understands except the reader.

    Interesting point. I'd never really noticed that before.

  This is one of those posts which approaches an optimal solution for the current topic, to the point of discussion floundering because there is so little to add.

    Well I guess upvote it? Alternatively some pointers on ways to do the two things I don't consider myself very good at might be nice?

    Or perhaps share your own self critiques on where you feel you succeed or falter on the points?

      One idea would be to disguise exposition as progress. Say for example I haven't really gone into the geographic or political makeup of the world. To remedy that I could have a character describe a list of items they need for a trip, and have those indirectly describe how the world works (... We need bug repellent for Barten, bear repellent for Zajer, lichen repellent for Neb).

      You get the idea, have exposition in such a way it doesn't slow the story.

        Ooh that is a good one I did not point out but I have used without noticing. 

        Thanks!

  No specific points to add, but overall I really enjoyed the expository style used here: http://archiveofourown.org/works/777002/chapters/1461984

  Essentially each chapter begins with excerpts from news articles, encyclopedia, books, etc. There are quite a lot of flashbacks to important events, and quite early in the story there are even two fairly lengthy chapters dedicated to one character watching a movie about notable events earlier in her life which has just been released to cinemas. The plot events and experience of watching (in pseudo-virtual reality) are described in detail. The movie is my least favourite of these expositions as I felt it dragged a bit, but it's fairly ingenious in the abstract. I loved the encyclopedia entries, especially those where sections are marked e.g. *only available to those with level three clearance*. This creates an interesting dynamic where the reader discovers what information (at a minimum) various characters are privy to by knowing their security clearance level. 
  Hope some of this is useful.

    I'm currently trying some meta-exposition via the use of a wiki appendix.

    And I do love the use of news stories in world as a way to get the background feel.

    Although I feel like I might have accidentally overdone some of the realism of "you are not important, the world is as huge and vast as our own and every little part is full of people dealing with what you are dealing with"

    However I have some plans to actually 'datestamp' parts of that wiki so that there are actually entries/versions of it that sync up to particular stages in the plot.

    In that particular case though all of those exposition bits are from my perspective considered 'optional for the reader' and I don't want to depend on it to allow the story to be enjoyable.

    Essentially it's slightly polished versions of already existing world building notes.
