  I definitely enjoyed the first 80% of this one, but I think the ending just didn't come together as well as it should've.

  Anything requiring that much teleportation, body snatching, alteration of reality, etc, should be plotted better.

  I will read the new book though, the characters and setting were really strong for awhile.
