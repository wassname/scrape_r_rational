## [RT][FF][HF] Marked for Death, Ch. 80 "Fools and Their Pride"

### Post:

I totally failed to put a post up for Ch 79! Mea culpa. You can find that chapter [here.](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/7172445/)

The latest chapter by the incomparable u/eaglejarl is **[here.](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/7172445/)**

Today, our intrepid missing-nin team puts their plan for capturing their target into motion at last! Will they make it out the other side? (Seriously. Will they?)

Marked for Death is an RPG-style story set in a rational reimagining of Naruto, where thread participants vote to control the actions of a single player character - part of a ragtag group of missing-nin, exiles who have come together to help each other survive against everything the world can throw at them.

The story updates every Thursday (u/Velorien of [Lighting Up the Dark](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9311012/1/Lighting-Up-the-Dark)) and Sunday (u/eaglejarl (of [Team Anko](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11087425/1/Team-Anko), [2 Year Emperor](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3xe9fn/ffrt_the_two_year_emperor_is_back_and_free/) and [Induction](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3294457/give_aways/Induction/chapter_001.html)). Drop by and join us in a world where death lurks around every corner, and where anything is possible for those with the cunning and determination of a true ninja.

  ```
  PSA: u/eaglejarl has decided to mess with me by changing the chapter title to "Horrible Heights and Amazing Ambush", because he's a gigantic troll and knows I can't change the title of Reddit posts.
