### Post:

The latest chapter by my fellow forum pleb u/XxChronOblivionxX is **[here](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/page-1212#post-7240761)**.

Today, a look at our Best Apprentice's life before joining Team ~~Collateral Damage~~ Uplift.

** **

Marked for Death is an RPG-style story set in a rational reimagining of Naruto, where thread participants vote to control the actions of a single player character - part of a ragtag group of missing-nin, exiles who have come together to help each other survive against everything the world can throw at them.


The first chapter is [here,](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/) and the story-only thread (if you’d like to get caught up quickly) is [here.](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/4993131/) There’s also a [guide to voting](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/6283682/) put together by Twofold, one of the thread participants. Drop by and join us in a world where death lurks around every corner, and where anything is possible for those with the cunning and determination of a true ninja. 

The story updates every Thursday (u/Velorien of [Lighting Up the Dark](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9311012/1/Lighting-Up-the-Dark)) and Sunday (u/eaglejarl of [Team Anko](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11087425/1/Team-Anko), [2 Year Emperor](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3xe9fn/ffrt_the_two_year_emperor_is_back_and_free/) and [Induction](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3294457/give_aways/Induction/chapter_001.html)).

  I'm so happy I actually managed to write this as quickly as I did. Especially considering the dubious nature of Akane's future presence in this quest.
