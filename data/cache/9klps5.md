## The implausibility of the world building in Avatar: the Last Airbender: A rationalist critique

### Post:

**1. Bender Homogeneity of Nations**

This critique actually arose after I tried to world build a world of various magical powers along sect lines, and ran into a problem which in retrospect seems as glaring as day, but which is otherwise not easy to notice.

To draw an analogy, imagine you had four nations: Tailor Nation, Smith Nation, Carpenter Nation and Mason Nation, with each nation populated solely by craftsmen of the namesake of the nation (ie all the tailors in the world are in Tailor Nation, etc). In this kind of world, Tailor Nation would have a desperate need for smiths, carpenters, and masons; and similarly for the other nations. e.g. For Tailor Nation to get a Smith would be of enormous economic benefit to the nation - they'll finally be able to smith tools! Each nation would hence try to attract people from the other nations, and because of the demand for these other professions, smiths, carpenters and masons would want to go to Tailor Nation since they’d earn more there than in their home nation. They’ll then start moving to these other nations until ultimately the distribution of these professions would be the same across all the nations. And if people are not allowed to go to another country, each country would want to train professionals of each type. This is just a result of economic incentive. And as the professions become spread equally to all four nations, the four nations would stop thinking of their nation as being of a particular profession.

The world of Avatar has a similar situation. At the start of the war, each of the four Bender types is represented only in one country, and they can’t replace each other in their abilities, and there’s uses for each of the Bender types. Earth benders in the water nation could produce lasting homes. Water benders in fire nation could carry away superheated waste water from their industry. Fire benders in water nation could keep the water nation from freezing to death as well as jump start the industrial revolution elsewhere, and air benders in fire nation would enhance the quality of their metallurgy from blowing hotter fires. Because of the potential benefits of doing this, benders should go to where they would be in higher demand and the four nations would go out of their way to recruit benders from other nations, until ultimately all four nations have the same proportion of each Bender type. And then you’d no longer have a Fire Nation, a Water Nation etc. the Fire Nation wouldn’t be the only industrializing nation, it wouldn’t have such a strategic advantage over the other nations, and it wouldn’t be strictly fighting non fire benders, it would instead be soldiers of all four Bender types fighting against soldiers of all four Bender types.

In such a setting, then, when the avatar fights against the fire nation he would be fighting against not only fire benders, but air, water, and earth benders, who would be able to team up to perform surprising or synergistic tactics, and thereby be a much more significant threat to the Avatar. Given that the Avatar’s primary advantage is the versatility of his abilities, any nation that fielded multiple types of benders on the battlefield would easily be able to vanquish any nation that didn’t, which would be a military driver for all four nations to diversify their Bender types (if the economic incentive for some reason didn’t suffice), or would lead to the replacement of any nations insisting on a single bender type, with nations that had a mix of all bender types. 

Even if the nations were single element at the start of the story, the fire nation should want to impress benders of the other types into its own armed forces because of the tactical advantages doing so would offer. Even if the benders are unwilling, if the fire nation captured their family and threatened to torture or enslave them should the benders refuse to cooperate, I would expect at least a portion of them would agree to do so.

That’s what you’d expect from even the most basic understanding of economics, but the world of Avatar doesn’t look like this, for no good reason. The very fact that the world of Avatar has nations along bender lines is the most damning indictment of the setting as implausible.

**2. Walls**

The point of walls made of stone is to provide secure, sturdy shelter, including protecting one’s belongings from getting stolen, or from being attacked. But in Earth Nation, literally every bender is an earth bender, meaning any one of these people can treat your house like it’s rice paper. Any of them can go into your home and loot your belongings, or kill you in the middle of the night with little or no advance warning. In Earth Nation, therefore, all the people who aren’t destitute would make their homes out of something else - like wood. But that's not what you see in the depiction of Ba Sing Se. And in Water Nation, literally every bender can bend away the ice walls of your home, making them all the perfect thieves and assassins... so any Water Nation dweller would build their home out of something else for better security.

  [Bending is at least partially spiritual rather than genetic.](http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Bending_arts#Inheritance) If some isolated firebenders move to the Earth Kingdom, they'll be influenced by Earth spirits, and some or all of their bending children will be not firebenders but earthbenders.

  You can make a case that there should be a constant, gigantic stream of back-and-forth migration between all the nations to make up for the deaths of immigrant benders, or that each nation should have within itself persistent pockets of immigrant benders large enough to sustain their own spirits and cultures and therefore their own bending&mdash;but mass migration across huge distances doesn't seem very realistic for low-tech, agrarian societies, and it may be that even city-sized pockets of immigrants are insufficient to supplant the native spirits without violence done against the native environment by the invaders. It seems much easier to say: "Barring the wholesale destruction of Earth people, culture, and environment in the area (as executed in the Fire Nation colonies, and as attempted across the entire Earth Kingdom by Phoenix King Ozai), the spirits in the Earth Kingdom are powerful enough to convert most Earth Kingdom inhabitants to Earth affiliation, and all or nearly all benders born in the Earth Kingdom are earthbenders."

  > Even if the nations were single element at the start of the story, the fire nation should want to impress benders of the other types into its own armed forces because of the tactical advantages doing so would offer.

  [The propaganda behind the Hundred Years' War was centered around the Fire Nation's desire to impose "civilization" on the other, "inferior" nations.](http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Hundred_Year_War) Admitting other nations' soldiers into its ranks (even as slave soldiers) would subvert the Fire Nation's own casus belli and reduce morale.

But in Earth[/Water] Nation, literally every bender is an earth[/water] bender, meaning any one of these people can treat your house like it’s rice paper.

  In Ba Sing Se, any thieves will be caught and *severely* punished by the Dai Li. I think it's safe to assume that similar (though less-draconian) measures are in place in other Earth Kingdom and Water Tribe cities and villages: Bending police are best-equipped to deal with bending criminals. (See also [the ninja police in *Naruto*](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Konoha_Military_Police_Force).)

  This is true **right now**. The vast majority of doors are incredibly easy to lock-pick (without using superpowers). People could turn their home into Fort Knox and *really* protect themselves, but they don't because the cost of building a safer home is greater than the risk of some nutjob breaking in. I imagine it'd be the same  in the Avatar world. Building an earth/ice home is much cheaper (and easier to repair) than building it out of some other material. The risk that some bender will go crazy or go on a stealing spree is always there, but for the majority of people it isn't a big enough concern to justify the cost of building a house some other way.

    Or heck, you don't even need the skill to pick locks.

  I think you're drastically underestimating the impact of tribalism and nationalism in primitive cultures. The vast majority of people in each nation would have a mindset of "other nations are inferior". An earthbender would think that anything a firebender could do, they could do better. You don't need to be a firebender to start a fire, or an earthbender to build a wall. Also, and in relation to your second point, benders were quite rare. There weren't enough of them to change entire industries. The defining attributes of the four nations were cultural, not what they could bend.

  I don't agree with your analogy of tradesmen. Every nation needs something akin to tailors, smiths, carpenters and masons, but the usefulness of the different benders is much less well defined.
  ```

  - u/Xtraordinaire:
    ```
    There aren't any primitive cultures among major nations of Avatar. There are highly sophisticated societies with millennia of written culture and developed economies. They are also fairly urbanized, and that comes with a certain degree of tolerance by the very nature of big cities.

    You inadvertently pinpointed the core issue with the worldbuilding here: civilian applications of magic were not thought out at all. The 4 bending schools were meant to represent earth martial arts. Yeah, there aren't many useful applications for them on Earth, because they aren't magic, they're just fancy ways of waving fists and pointy sticks. But transforming them into magic gives a *ton* of useful applications, and some of them were well defined, i.e. healing. Every kingdom's ruler and major noble would desperately want a water bender healer, and bigotry be damned. I'd say every nation would want an earth bender for an architect of their royal palace, but ironically earth's nation's architecture was the blandest of them all.

    edit: martial, not martian, duh
    ```

    - u/CoronaPollentia:
      ```
      Honestly that's not super surprising. When your military force is correlated with ability to move absolute tons of stone, of course you're going to just make everything of huge hunks of earth and rock. It's a status display.
      ```

    - u/boomfarmer:
      ```
      Yes, every nation would want waterbender healers for their government officials. But demand does not mean that there is a supply. At the time of the show, the Northern Water Tribe was rather xenophobic, and the Southern Water Tribe had no healers to spare. The Northern Tribe only allowed women to be healers, and kept close control of their women. Is it at all likely that a Water Tribe healer would be allowed to leave? And if they left without permission, doesn't it seem likely that they would be dragged back? An escapee would need to cunningly fake their death, and then make it to an employer, who would need to treat the healer with enough respect that they could trust the healer not to kill the patient out of spite. And with the amount of racism and xenophobic paranoia we see in the show, that seems unlikely.
      ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      By that logic, couldn't you say "Every king and noble in medieval Europe would want an Arab doctor"? And yet I'm pretty sure Islamic countries' medicine has been immensely superior to European medicine for centuries.

      I think it's not implausible that cultural segregation in Avatar's world would be *that* strong.

    ```
    Are we including Korra in this as canon (I do!!), because i think it supports OP in many ways. Given how all the characters go through DBZ style powerups (lighting and metal bending is now common) and we see the rebirth of all the legendary bending so much so that it's common place, I like to attribute this to the benders coming together and learning from each other. No longer an intellectually stale artform, I'd argue that lightning bending is a thing from merging air and fire (lack of control over power is a thing of air and Iroh), lava bending is from fire and earth as an example (control and unleashing of power)

    > Also, and in relation to your second point, benders were quite rare. There weren't enough of them to change entire industries.

    In Korra when you're producing electricity from fire benders I feel like that's definitely not the case any longer and Republic City is an example of what OP is arguing for. Even before the spirit season, we saw this as a thing, reminding me of https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2011-07-13

    > defining attributes of the four nations were cultural

    Mako and Bolin are brothers yet one's a firebender and the other is an earth bender. I can't believe that two brothers who are so close would have such a different culture. Not to mention that Katara and Aang's kids developed Water and Air (and nothing) despite having a very mixed cultural upbringing. I'd argue culture is a thing of societies and two children from the same family wouldn't develop so differently if it was cultural. This implies genetic to me (though not quite your point), and raises a question of causation vs correlation. Are their personalities influenced by the type of bending they can do or the other way around (Meelo being an air bender raises a few questions)

    Finally, Korra the avatar was bending multiple types of elements as a child (besides air)

    >  Also, and in relation to your second point, benders were quite rare

    The main characters only had one non-bender which gives us a very skewed idea of what the proportions are. Combine this with all the powerful recurring characters being benders, you get a very skewed sense of the world, either it's awfully unfair to non-benders (a la Amon) or most people are benders and the characters are representative of the underlying population. Besides Asami, the non-benders are mostly comic relief (think Sokka, Bhumi (aang's kid), the crazy merchant in Korra), so you can see how this is a very reasonable reading that bending is actually quite common. We have no explicit statistics nor do we see an inherent class system (outside of Amon's season) to read otherwise.
    ```

    - u/boomfarmer:
      ```
      > Mako and Bolin are brothers yet one's a firebender and the other is an earth bender.

      They're born in Republic City, where cultures and therefore spirits are intermingled, to parents of different Nations. Every single factor that might determine bending is set awry here, so I'm not sure that they're a good example of bending heritance outside of their example.

      Katara/Aang is more of the same.

      I think you've got his point backwards. His point was not that certain cultures produce certain benders. His point was that the nations/benders don't intermingle due to the differences in culture.

      I don't know how much of Korra you've watched, so spoilers for that ahead. The nations started out as cities/alliances of cities, with each being on the back of a lion-turtle that provided a certain kind of bending. At this point in the history, there was no intermingling due to the general danger of travelling as well as (iirc) prominent xenophobia. By the time that intermingling became viable, each nation/culture had been shaped by the bending that they had available/their location in the world. So we got the nomadic Air people, tribal water people, etc. 

      It's not difficult to imagine that, until somebody went out of their way to found a city that was basically an embassy for every nation, they stayed largely separate because of their cultural/philosophical/etc. boundaries.
      ```

- u/TDaltonC:
  ```
  Just to do the apologetics: 

  For point 1, that does eventually happen in Republic City. There are a few things that make that mixing slow. (1) transportation is expensive, (2) people are really racists, (3) the dominate political paradigm is not production focused, is a blood and soil nationalism, (4) bender abilities are not just a matter of birth; you also need training and aculturation. 

  For point 2, that just means that construction costs are a bigger concern than assassination.

    I've never really liked this criticism/observation (which applies to a lot of settings), since the answer isn't actually *that* important within the content of the setting. You *seem to* get more power than you put in, but that doesn't really change the setting much, especially if the (seeming) gains are minor and/or rare. There are hundreds of ways to patch thermodynamics in such a way that the patches would be "invisible" to people of the tech level in Avatar and/or non-exploitable, and it wouldn't have to have an impact on the setting or plot.
    ```

    - u/InfernoVulpix:
      ```
      Even beyond patching it out, it's not even hard to justify actual free energy.  If the objection is that free energy makes the rules of our universe freak out, it's simple to picture our universe's rules and models, and add a framework on top of it that adds or subtracts energy as it pleases.

      Free energy and defeating entropy are only relevant problems trillions of years from now, as much as they *are* big problems.  For all relevant purposes, stuff like "Why does the universe care about human brains thinking certain thoughts" is much more compelling than "How can magic possibly create free energy?"

  I'm trying to think of equivalent situations in real life. The first thing that springs to mind is the Chinese embargo on silkworms. They managed to keep an incredibly valuable resource from falling into the hands of other cultures for a surprisingly long time.

  Of course, that only lasted so long, and, subtle as silk moth eggs are, they're easier to spot than bending ability.

  What about actual prodigious abilities? There are definite hotspots. The fastest runners in the world disproportionately have their origins in a single tribe in Kenya, the Kalenjin. A startling number of the scientists who worked on the development of the Atomic bomb attended the same high school in Budapest. An astonishing proportion of the greatest motorsport drivers in the world are Finnish.

  While there's undoubtedly an innate hereditary component in the speed and endurance of the Kalenjin runners, they're not particularly genetically distinct from their less exceptional countrymen. It's therefore hypothesized that what's actually exceptional is their culturally instilled pain tolerance, engendered or at least exemplified by their absolutely brutal coming-of-age rituals.

  If the Ashkenazim are innately more intelligent than anybody else (and all those Hungarian-highschoolers-turned-nuclear-physicists were Ashkenazim), it's hard to ignore that this seems to come at a price; they're undeniably more prone to genetic disorders--and indeed, the carriers for the recessive genes that cause some of these disorders may correlate with higher I.Q.

  Another, more solid example of genetic mixed-blessings is sickle-cell anemia. Those who carry recessive genes for sickle-cell but don't have the double-dose necessary to express the disease are more resistant to malaria than people who have no genetic markers at all.

  Finally, Finnish drivers may be so over-represented in international motorsports because Finland is a very dangerous place to drive. It's characterized by icy, hilly, wooded rural roads that are quite treacherous, and Finland has very high standards for licensing drivers.

  So, what might be some reasons for regional differences in ability that wouldn't promote diffusion into a broader population?

  With the Kalenjin, it appears to be culturally-specific rituals that carry a high enough cost not to be picked up by outsiders--the monastic asceticism and childhood tattooing of air-benders might be somewhat equivalent.

  Congenital abilities coupled with costly drawbacks might only persist in areas where the environment mandates those abilities-- malaria resistance in one portion of the population at the cost of sickle-cell anemia in another portion is unlikely to be a trait that would persist for long outside of malaria-plagued regions.

  The famed Ashkenazi intelligence may be related to either of these factors, or both; a costly in-group cultural focus on literacy or a genetic propensity for intelligence that comes at the price of higher rates of genetic disorders--either way, the anomaly is unlikely to persist outside of the insular community that puts an unusually high value on intelligence. Also worth considering--this intelligence was eschewed by industrial nations that *really* needed it--the Germans and the Soviets--for purely cultural reasons.

  Finally, the Finnish ability to drive seems to be engendered solely by the necessity of their environment, though I'm not familiar with much anthropological study of the subject.

  Of course, all of these abilities are far less dramatic than "Can you casually hurl boulders around or conjur flames from thin air with a flick of the wrist, Y/N?"

  But I think it's reasonable to imagine that such factors could play into an Avatar-like culturescape.

  To my knowledge, we've never seen a avaricious airbender; the cultural asceticism necessary to develop airbending might not be compatible with a personality that finds contentment stoking blast furnaces in a Fire Nation factory.

  Waterbending seems only to manifest in regions where it's necessary for survival--polar ice caps and swamps. Maybe a single recessive gene for waterbending yields Katara, but if you get a double-dose you end up with someone with horrible mental deficiencies like Sokka?

  The most obvious explanation for the heterogeneity of firebending is old-fashioned xenophobia. This could explain why other bending styles aren't pursued within that culture and why other nations seem to lack the genetic basis for cultivating that skill. Sure, the other bending techniques might've been useful, but costly cultural signaling is an astonishingly powerful force. As far as we can tell, the Norse settlers of Greenland *didn't eat fish*, presumably because of cultural taboos because no other reason seems sufficiently insane.

  As to your point on walls...didn't a lot of Asian cultures use rice paper as a major construction material, just because it was cheap? I'm pretty sure most medieval peasants in Europe didn't have locking doors.

  Come to think of it, my back door is made primarily of glass, and I (a rank amateur) can pick most residential locks in under 30 seconds.

  Criminals aren't deterred by the actual robustness of building materials. They're deterred by the social consequences of crime. Likewise, building materials aren't selected for their ability to keep other people out; they're chosen for their price, resistance to the elements and other functional considerations.

  >1. Bender Homogeneity of Nations

  People do not work like that.

  How many communities of Europeans took their knowledge of steel and make a killing in sub-saharan Africa?  Or how many groups of Asians made a living off their wood block printing in Europe?  How many Polynesians went and showed up the Vikings on how to fish?

  Nations were homogeneous before the modern world.

  All that being said... are you even correct that people are building houses out of earth or rock? I just skimmed through the *City of Walls and Secrets* episode, and a lot of the walls in Ba Sing Se look wooden to me. Also, the water nation does has some igloos, but they seem to mostly use tents.

  Only got time for a new nitpicks.
  Given that both Water Tribes in the show live at the poles, they have no need for earth benders. In their world, ice already is a lasting, durable material that they have perfect control over, and any earth is buried so deep under the ice, that it is never seen.

  Immigration on the levels you are speaking of here, is also probably incredibly difficult for people at the start of the series. Most people, benders or not, are simple farmers living in simple cities. Mass transport simply doesn't exist, and the only people with good ships or technology are the Fire Nation.
  In fact the Fire Nation was poised to use their tech to usher in a new age of movement and cultural blending... But they choose to use it to go to war with the world instead, so we don't get to see that happen.

  Of course oncre the war is over, the presence of all that technology makes cultural blending much easier... And that's what Legend of Korra is about.

- u/TheColourOfHeartache:

  One easy solution would be to make bending a matter of culture, or even geography. If two fire benders move to the Earth nation and their kids are raised surrounded by Earth nation culture, they'd be Earth benders not fire benders. 

  So you'd still see stuff like rulers paying a lot for a water bender healer to come around, but by the time of the show a large war would have resulted in the borders going back up and each nation reverting to a single style. 

  You could also get some cool ideas with Republic City being a culture capable of producing any type of Bender, but it's got a notably lower proportion of benders to any other nation.

  >To draw an analogy, imagine you had four nations: Tailor Nation, Smith Nation, Carpenter Nation and Mason Nation, with each nation populated solely by craftsmen of the namesake of the nation (ie all the tailors in the world are in Tailor Nation, etc).

  Bad analogy because the benders aren't the sole population of each nation, the majority aren't benders. 

  >In this kind of world, Tailor Nation would have a desperate need for smiths, carpenters, and masons; and similarly for the other nations. e.g. For Tailor Nation to get a Smith would be of enormous economic benefit to the nation - they'll finally be able to smith tools!

  The essentially functions of a national economy do not need benders to function. Farmers hoe fields scribes write taxes without them.

  You're also completely ignoring how bending is not a solely practical function. It is a spiritual art and practice native to each culture. **A firebender and non firebender of the fire nation have much more in common than a fire bender and any other bender.** Why would a fire bender ever want to leave and offer his services to the other nations?

  >But in Earth Nation, literally every bender is an earth bender, meaning any one of these people can treat your house like it’s rice paper. Any of them can go into your home and loot your belongings, or kill you in the middle of the night with little or no advance warning.

  I think your first point is the strongest. I'm not particularly sure how useful fire and air benders would be, although being able to make sailing ships go far faster would be handy, but earth and water benders would be extremely useful. Water has healing, which would be amazingly useful in such a society before the invention of antibiotics and anaesthesia. Couple that with their ability to pull fresh water out of the air in the middle of the ocean, and catch fish with almost trivial ease, and water benders would be amazingly wealthy and welcomed in every corner of society. Earthbenders could build homes, levees, roads, bridges, wells, mountain paths, just about anything structural that a society could need. Their ability to reshape terrain on a large scale if given enough time would also make them indispensible for any nation that wants secure borders.

The only two powers who could in theory be swapping benders at scale in any form otehr than forced conscription of conquered people would be the Earth Kingdom and the Northern Water Tribe, but the Northern Tribe appears to have reacted to the sacking of the South with isolationism and trying to keep out of the line of fire. And the Fire Nation seems to (weirdly) have naval superiority over the Water Tribe so travel is dangerous.

  Even then we do see some remnants of internationality bending. The Foggy Swamp water benders live in Earth kingdom territory and practice a distinct style of water bending, and the Sand Benders live in an isolated desert and appear to have learned to mimic some air-bending like methods with earth bending. The Kioshi warriors use fans in their martial arts, which in context looks a lot like they're adapting Avatar Kioshi's air bending to non-bending styles. 

  &#x200B;

  Then in Legend of Korra, we see exactly the kind of muti-disciplinary bending and industrial boom that wasn't happening during the war and we find out that bending isn't straight up genetics as people with no known air nomad heritage start spontaneously gaining air bending. 

  &#x200B;

  As to walls. 

  I expect cost is more important than resistance to direct attack by a bender, for much the same reason we still make windows out of glass, and most doors can be battered open with a hand ram. Especially since the kind of design it'd take to make a house that can withstand a giant flying rock probably doesn't come cheap or comfortable. Historically buildings are usually made out of what's readily available and designed to withstand local weather more than to be vandalism-proof.

  I believe this was settled quite nicely in Legends of Korra when she lives through the first Avatars life. 

  Each cuty state is protected by a kion turtle which gives it inhabitants a distinct bending element.

    Except that it retcons what we knew of the origin of bending in the original Avatar, which is that each bending tradition arose naturally from observing nature. Water benders with the moon and tides, fire benders with the sun and dragons, earth benders with the badgermoles, and air benders with the flying bison. Now it could be said that the traditions were forgotten over time and then relearned through the observation of these things, but I think it's more likely that Bryke were just being lazy with their worldbuilding. There's plenty of *that* in Korra.

      Sort of.

      We do see Wan being guided through the "dragon dance" by a dragon in the montage prior to his first use of actual fire-bending forms rather than just crudely throwing gobs of fire like he did before.

      It's at least plausible that the modern story of how benders learned bending is a reference to the traditions and forms they use to not suck at it more than just having the ability to command an element.

      I don't believe there's any actual confirmation that those original benders were the ones to teach humans. Every nation has their myths about how they acquired bending, but I think that's all they were. Or maybe the animals + moon showed them how to better use their existing abilities, even if they didn't grant them those abilities in the first place. Say, dragons shared their philosophy of fire and techniques of bending fire, which boosted a firebender's power far above someone who was untrained by the dragons. And I guess the actual moon spirit may have done the same for the water tribe.

        I just think it took a generally interesting mythical origin story that fit with the theme of the first avatar and turned it into something pretty lame. Just like how the in-story title of "Avatar" went from "Avatar of the spirit world, master of all elements" to "Avatar of this one overpowered spirit that's one half of a world-destroying whole based on a whole yin-yang thing that we *already did* for the moon and water spirits in the last show." And now the bridge to the spirit world thing is *literal*. What used to be a story vaguely based on real Asian mysticism completely detached itself from that inspiration.

        And it also means the power of bending isn't really *the bender's,* it's just on loan, which I think is bad for other reasons.

  Maybe genetics are to blame?  
  For example, if every person carried a gene of a determined element and for a person to be a bender, neither of his parent's gene can be of another element. It would then be unpratical to keep an foreign element of bending for multiple generations.  
  That problably wouldn't hold until modern era, but it could certainly last until around the industrial revolution, when avatar takes place.  
   Non-standart benders would then be too rare to affect the economy too much, instead being treated as valuable resources.


  As for the walls, I can't remember if any benders were shown actually going through them, but I'm pretty sure they could. Maybe most were reinforced with other materials, but that seems pretty ineficient.

    Simple Mendelian genetics won't explain bending. I checked.

    Except there's that whole thing where random people were suddenly airbenders. That is an argument against genetics as a primary factor.

  I think OP needs to bring Korra into his argument. A lot of what he's brought up seem to be supported (in a roundabout fashion, maybe even needing a fan theory or two) by Korra's season.

  Things like the insane development of tech in Korra (which I attribute to the mixing of ideas), the resurgence of legendary bending, to becoming common place (metal and lightning are good examples, but we also see Bolin lava bend, Zaheer fly, Tenzin's daughter Spirit bend? and of course Mako gender bend).

  I'm not sure about the spiritual aspect of bending. Aang and Katara's kids were Air, Water and nothing (until he became air powered too). Bolin and Mako were earth and fire despite being brothers and super close. Given the mixed culture of republic city and mixed marriages why did Bhumi (who seems very similar to OG Bhumi and Bolin) not become an earth bender. Why is Meelo who doesn't seem like a typical air nomad not become a earth bender. Why do children of non-benders not seem to develop bending powers more often (I think Toph is a good counter example, but then we have Asami). How does Katara develop ability in so many different elements barring air till she get's some training?

  I agree that racism and lack of transport technology explains a lot, and the Fire Nation can in many ways be read loosely as an allegory of British occupation of Asia (Earth Nation), which is why there wasn't a lot of movement, but OP does bring a lot of points. In india, spices, wealth and sand were siphoned to britain, china got the opium treatment and had it's tea and gunpowder formulas stolen, most of SEA was occupied by the Brits. In this world, when you could have people that could divert water and build walls, I'd have expected far more slavery. Or if that was abhorrent, the situation of the gulf where poor workers are paid a pittance to risk their lives. Technology asymmetry should result in some serious exploitation. 

  Finally, the avatar is a problem here. Given his/her huge cultural significance, it's a bit trickier to be racist when you have a mythical figure who's had equal representation over history. They're much more connected than the current world and it should've prevented racism at the top at the very least, if not among common people. If there was limited transportation, there'd have been no contact and thus limited contempt, if there was transportation, there should have been more contact and if racism was a thing, attempts to conquer. Maybe the avatar prevented this, but it was very short sighted to not keep the various countries on an equal footing so as to not require his presence (and we can see how Aang ensured reduced tensions between the various tribes).

  You ought to write some rationalist Airbender fanfic to go along with HPMoR and MLP:FIO.

    I was gonna say something like this too, but I also decided against it because it's r/rational after all. But what the hell, I'll say it anyway.

    I don't think posting a critique of the worldbuilding on a children's show is super interesting. Frankly, it's just not surprising or interesting if a children's show has holes. (Actually, the other reason I almost didn't say anything is that Avatar *does* have much better worldbuilding than most, so in this particular case, it is much more worth discussing these things than, say, *Steven Universe*, which is a great show but you can drive trucks through the holes in its worldbuilding, which makes it hardly worth discussing unless you're actually proposing major fixes.) At any rate, I think it could be worthwhile to make an Avatar rational fic exploring the economics of house building or cultural diffusion in Avatar-land -- but just posting a list of things wrong in the avatar world and then denouncing the worldbuilding as "implausible" just has me rolling my eyes, especially because those things are more complicated than the OP makes them out to be, as demonstrated by the ample discussion on the thread. ((1) is mostly explained by nationalism and the fact that it's war-time while (2) is mostly explained by the fact that actually, plenty of houses in the world *are* just made of wood anyway.)

  You're right of course, but we have to try for apologia now.

  Well, you can keep out non-benders, and more importantly animals and the weather (which is the original point of a wall - for most of human pre-history irl, a human made wall was an ephemeral structure and did not really keep a human out).

  I think the reason this works in canon is that people don't use bending for technological progress until we get to republic city. Before that, bending is pretty much just a fighting style, and it doesn't even seem to matter *that* much which particular fighting style you have. We don't even have confirmation that bending is used for housing construction, for all we know they're building igloos and mud huts in the non-magical way using the available material.

  Also, I think it might be worth considering that terrified humans were living on the backs of lion turtles for protection until *just recently*. So arguably, the civilization of the Gaang is actually brand new. 

   So maybe they were all basically isolated tribes until fairly recently?

  It's hard to square that with the level of technological progress in the Fire and Earth nations, though.

  Another potential point is that bending might be *very rare* for non air nomads (how much of that is because non, and only appear infrequently and randomly in people who live in a climate that predisposes for it...and we just think their are a lot of benders because the dramatic story arcs follow benders. Wasn't Katara the *only* water bender in her tribe? And Sokka seemed to think bending was pretty mysterious, not an integral part of society.

  (Yes yes they killed off all the old water benders, but consider that Katara is one of many children in that tribe)

  BTW, random thought relevant to #1 that I haven't seen anybody bring up: there IS an example of a set of benders working for another nation: Azula has major successes by working with the Dai Li. It's a pretty bold move, all things considered, but a very shrewd one. She's basically the rational character picking up the $20 bill.

  (and yes, I do still think there are perfectly good reasons why that $20 bill was still on the ground until azula picked it up)
