  I like it. Told in the mythological style, similar to the tale of the Dragon Tyrant.

    Thanks. The Tale of the Dragon Tyrant was a direct inspiration.

  I have spent the past several hours reading the top posts on that subreddit.

  Thank you for posting. If any of you have any other good subreddits you visit I'd love to hear about them.

  Loved it. Reminds me of another great one called ["500 Million, But Not a Single One More"](https://blog.jaibot.com/500-million-but-not-a-single-one-more/)
