  I knew I should have linked to this earlier, but I was too lazy. :(

  A tip: try to look past the art and Scandinavianisms. I know, it's hard, but it's like Order of the Stick; you do get used to it eventually.

  That said, *The Accidental Space Spy* (also on the site) is IMO funnier and perhaps slightly more relevant on a rationality end of things. The closest analogy is perhaps *Gulliver's Travels* as written by Douglas Adams.

  *Hitmen for Destiny* (ibid) is also fun in a sort of baroque maximalist way of continuous layering of jokes that reminds me of *Problem Sleuth* or *Arrested Development*. It's a bit cruder due to inexperience with the medium, but it is worth the commitment.

  One thing you will notice is that Thorsby is *the* modern master of the comedy of errors.

  This is awesome. I don't care about the art, the writing fits with the idea he seems to be trying to convey that people are generally stupid. The guy has a story to tell to us (and I wanna hear it), and when you're bad at writing and drawing and stuff, having your readers read a bad comic costs them less than having them fight through bad prose.

  The whales thing also kinda makes sense...

  (The part about him being able to merge minds with himself does feel like an unnecessary tack-on.)

  I don't like the art (obviously), and the writing could use some work, there are still some interesting ideas there.

  While the whole thing seems really flimsy, it has a sort of cool concept going for it. That said... the author's artistic skills are really not all that great, and the art is just sort of brutally bad. I gave up even looking at it and just speed-read text boxes instead after a few pages. I didn't finish it yet. I would have preferred just reading the story in a text format instead of this - even though the prose doesn't seem that great (possibly the author learned English as a second language?) the art is far worse.

    The writing gets better over the course of the comic.
