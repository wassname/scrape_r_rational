## [RT?] The 2020 Commission Report on the North Korean Nuclear Attacks Against the United States

### Post:

Did anyone else read this? Not a deliberately rational/rationalist work by any means, but I found it interesting how they presented the North Korean leadership as rational actors acting on miscalibrated beliefs and confidence levels, contrasted with the less-than-rational decision process of their adversary. I also enjoyed the (non-fictional) explanation of the conflicting incentive structures between the deterrence value and actual utility of missile defence weapons.

  It's very good, and it seems like an important contribution to reducing the risk of an accidental nuclear war (or it would be if people in the Trump administration and the US nuclear missile forces would read it).

  My one criticism is that the technique of using slightly re-edited first person accounts from other events breaks down in one section, because the tone and style just isn't right (I'm not going to say the section in case I only noticed this because I saw the sourcing in the footnotes. I'd recommend not looking at the footnotes until after you've read the whole book).

  I get that the author used that technique to underline how the events he depicts are largely based on events that have already happened, but the sections where he invents details and dialogue more freely are just as plausible. He's a good enough writer that I think he should have edited the testimonies he uses a bit more for style.

  It's definitely a rational work, in the sense that it depicts clearly how the chain of events arises from people acting within flawed systems and trying to do the best with the information and incentives they have (even if some are less than rational actors and make their decisions based on bad sources of information like Fox News). 

  I guess you would call the genre "systems fiction".

  This book makes me wish that more rational fiction writers were trying to set stories in the real world, rather than writing fanfic or fantasy.

  It seems like the success of HPMOR means a lot of r/rational writers see "fanfic of an existing media property" as almost the default choice for rational writing. Now, for Yudkowsky's goal of popularising general rationalist concepts to younger readers, it made sense to rewrite a hugely popular media YA series. But we're now at the point where I'm not sure we need yet another rationalist reimagining of Strawberry Panic or whatever (or maybe I just don't like the type of properties that most of the rational fanfic is based on).

  Of course, I understand that it's way easier to deal with the rules of magic or quasi-magical SF technology than to do the huge amount of research you'd need for a book like this, so what I'm suggesting is probably unrealistic for unpaid writers.

  My local library doesn't have it but it looks interesting.
