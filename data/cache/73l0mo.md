  Lets see:

  * Has an extremely rare variant of an already rare pokemon
  * Acheived notable success despite lacking support or resources (first badge)
  * Is destined for greatness according to ancient myth (Ho-oh)
  * Is skilled and capable despite lack of proper training

  Yep, I think Aiko is secretly The Protagonist.  I wonder how the others will react when they realize they aren't the main characters?  Leaf and Red will probably be fine, but Blue will be *devastated.*

    I'd be kind of disappointed if this story only has one main protagonist. I read HPMOR, and liked it, but I felt like the element of the prophecy really restricted the roles Hermione and Draco could play in a story that wanted to fit all of Harry Potter canon into first year. 

    I'm excited for The Origin of Species because I expect all of the three view point protagonists to achieve something 'Main Character Worthy'.

    That being said, I really do want Aiko to become a view point character next chapter. If Red is in training to become 'The Professor', and Blue wants to be 'The Champion', and Leaf will eventually become something like a wandering reporter, Aiko seems to be the closet Origin of Species has to a traditional Pokemon protagonist, like Ash Ketchum, adventuring not because she wants to learn more about Pokemon, or wants to be the best Pokemon trainer, but simply because she loves Pokemon. And I do wonder how that kind of worldview is going to meshed into this rational reinterpretation of canon.

    I'm anticipating Red's work discovering the Fairy type when *Eevee evolves into the first ever Sylveon.

    Which will be of minor consternation when he realises that he has no idea what a regular Sylveon is supposed to look like.

    I feel like having a shiny pokemon isn't usually the *sort* of special that makes you a protagonist, especially in rational fic. (definitely the others, though).

    For myself, I suspect that the intersection of a legendary pokemon hunter, the strongest and best battler in Kanto, a psychic researcher who probably understands orthogonality, and a journalist who also happens to be one of the few people with an ethical system that a Pokemon might agree with is going to culminate in a big Mewtwo arc, and all of them are going to be essential.
    ```

    - u/CarVac:
      ```
      I'm imagining/hoping that things end with Blue having Articuno/Zapdos/Moltres, Red with Mewtwo, Leaf with Mew, and Aiko with Ho-oh...

      But I think Mewtwo alone will be tough enough for the four of them to handle as is.

  Another pretty awesome chapter!

  I wonder, is Red right now essentially the psychic equivalent of a savant? Weak to nonexistent telekinesis, slightly crippled telepathy, but a unique, highly developed (compared to other psychics, who apparently can't do it all) ability to passively, and stealthily detect attempted intrusions into his mind. Because Red training so hard that he could become useful to the Mewtwo project would require you making an unforeshadowed sudden genius. But the Mewtwo project being interesting in a savant with a relevant skill that could be made useful without having to be told to much....

  Also, considering that Red can do something that apparently no other psychic (human or pokemon) can, he might be the one person with something to offer Mew-two. Perhaps in order to learn Recover, Mew-two doesn't have to just mimic what Alakazam does, but actually force his mind into the exact same mental-state or something? Perhaps Recover isn't like mental math or calculation, which can be learnt by mimicking the rules others follow, but is actually like the No-Thought state I hear about in meditation, and must actually be discovered and experienced for oneself. Or in this case, psychically enforced on oneself.

  Because I've been thinking, and my personal theory is that the reason Mew-two can't use Recover is because his mind is too human. Normally his increased intelligence combines with his Pokemon granted abilities to make him truly powerful. But when it comes to Recover, maybe there is something about full human consciousness that prevents the ability from working? Maybe full human consciousness and intelligence is actually a self-affecting psychic move humans are running all the time, and isn't mutually inclusive with Recover? Who knows?

  Anyway, to get back on point, I just think that Red's journey, and unique psychic abilities, leading him to discover a way for humans to use Recover would be an awesome; and the thing about human intelligence, in the PokeVerse, just being a psychic move has always been my personal fan theory. I never got how in Pokemon some people can be psychic if everybody else wasn't at least a little bit psychic (for example in real life some savants are really good at math, and some people with synaesthesia can see numbers as colors or taste sights, or etc... but everybody else can also do math, or taste and see), and I always believed that psychics were just humans powerful enough, or lucky enough, to learn other 'Moves'.

  Anyways, I know you can't deny or confirm a lot my story predictions and theories, but I hope you found these ramblings at least a little bit amusing :)

      Reread his first chapter. They try to teach him, even let him inhabit the mind of an Alakazam using it, but he can't get the hang of it himself for some reason. Odd, since he learns it in every generation of games.

  Hey everyone, welcome back! Not a whole lot to announce this month, was hoping to get the second chapter of Guardian up but lost a week to the hurricane early on. Ideally it'll be done sometime next month, along with another episode of Rationally Writing. Thanks for reading, and all feedback welcome, as usual! Enjoy!

    I try to make it a point to comment on every one, and IM not stopping yet :P

    I like what you did with surge. Good character concept, modified well to be within your world, but still makes perfect sense in canon.

    I don't like that red isn't going for badges at all. He could clearly get one (you even mentioned it yourself) and I see 0 downsides to getting one. Especially the thunder badge, as it is clear he wants to train people for emergency responses, and red should love having some psuedo ranger training.

    I find the name changes to be interesting. it shows that he doesnt ever really want to use the abra in combat, OR that the brainwashing is more powerful than I thought

    The myths are interesting. If you want the whole world to be perfectly rational, I'm curious how you are going to handle the reality warping.

    For some reason it still feels weird to me to see things like "a kalos district" I think that is just me being used to the game worlds almost never referencing the other regions.

    Excellent chapter, while some I complain about, these are the ones I am here for :P
    ```

      Thanks! I enjoy consistent reviews particularly, for what that's worth, since it lets me get a feel for how individual clusters of values/perspectives are enjoying the story's progression :)

      >For some reason it still feels weird to me to see things like "a kalos district" I think that is just me being used to the game worlds almost never referencing the other regions.

      Yeah, this is something that has been slowly changing in the games, as far as I've seen anyway, with NPCs often showing up from other regions, sometimes even important story ones, and references to the other regions appearing now and then. It makes the world feel much more lived-in, which is obviously something I enjoy :)

        Me too! My gut says that I hate it, but a lot of the best world building is in the way people consisntantly reinforce a low level Idea.

      Is there any actual upside to getting badges in this setting though? In the games they let you use HMs and train pokemon to a higher level, but in this setting all I can think of is that they're required to challenge the Elite Four, which Red has no interest in.

      It occurs to me, however, that with the advent of easy teleportation if they ever change their minds they can go back and challenge the gyms very easily - even more easily than by using Fly, given that unlike in the games flight does have a travel time.
      ```

      - u/empocariam:
        ```
        Early on they talked about how badges still are required to use HMs in Kanto. So if you want a licence to use Pokemon as a flying mount then you have to have a Thunder badge.
        ```

        - u/Flashbunny:
          ```
          Ah, I must have forgotten that detail. Yeah, he should probably be grabbing them as he goes, unless he thinks it's easier to wait until he might want an HM and then go and do that specific gym at the "zero-badges" difficulty level.

      The chapter seemed to be hinting at it bein against his self conception/identity. He was resistent to the idea of doing anything that would make him fit the dreaded battle trainer mould. Possibly will result in a keeping your identity small type lesson

  Okay, *now* I like Aiko as a character. I was a bit worried about a seeming rando joining the party, but now that she fits the pattern of representing a cool aspect of the pokemon games, I am completely on board with her having a presence for the rest of the story. 

  Hunting legendaries was always my favorite part of the games.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Glad to hear it :) And yeah legendary hunting is fun, I really enjoyed the way they did it in ORAS where a ton were out in the world to be found, instead of all being promo coded in.
    ```

    - u/The_Magus_199:
      ```
      Yeah, I really feel like gens 3 and 4 really did Legendaries well, with Hoenn winning out a little on the hunt side of things but Sinnoh working its legendaries really well into the lore and atmosphere of the region. And ugh, yeah, I hate that legendaries are always just gifts nowadays! I mean, I never want to go back to the days of never being able to get any unless you get really lucky with an event location, but I wish they'd at least be handled like gen 3 did, with the events unlocking a new area where the legendary lives or something...
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Yep, for mythics not having to even battle them makes it feel utterly empty. It doesn't help that there's no reason to use a legendary in the games, so effectively they're just trophies for most.

    Red had the dual advantage of a novel strategy that lets him use coordinated attacks with excellent timing and experience in at least 2 leader level catastrophes. Even given identical other resources he would probably have the edge. I would compare his current battle ability to chapter 1 Blue, with the lack of combat instinct and training made up for in real world experience and tactics.

    Leaf is an entirely different situation. I feel like even though she's been in the same situations, her goals and thoughts about them are different enough that they wouldn't help her nearly as much in a battle. She also cares too much about Pokemon to put her all into a battle that isn't protective.

    I think that Red would be able to earn three Thunder badge if he worked his way up through the gym, but Leaf wouldn't be able to handle the militaristic nature of Lt. Surge.
    ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    >despite the fact that it's his first trainer battle

    First trainer battle with strangers* :) He's been training with Blue here and there since Pewter, mostly to help Blue, but their first "real" match was in Cerulean.

    >Could Red get the Thunderbadge if he wanted? Could Leaf?

    Both could almost certainly get their first badges at this point, if they put their minds to it: they've been journeying for months now, and even though they have less trainer experience than Blue, they've fought in wild situations and have spent time training their pokemon.
    ```

  I have to say, I'm *extremely* disappointed with the direction you took the Vermilion gym. Lt. Surge's role in encouraging young trainers to rummage through random trash cans until something happens is foundational to my experience of the Pokemon universe. ^^/s

  That being said, this truly was a great chapter. I actually am finding myself quite drawn to Leaf's story arch. I think there is a lot of cool work to do in Utopian literature now that Social Media has been invented.

  Also, I have been doing a bit of reading during the down time at my new job, and I found it pleasing that the past-chapter I had just read was the very one were the Ho-oh myth was first mentioned.

  I thought I had while rereading that I may as well comment here:
  Are Ground-type Pokemon actually Rubber-polymer type Pokemon? Similar to steel type, what makes a pokemon "Ground-type" is some kind of material infusion that makes them particularly flexible and therefore good at maneuvering beneath the earth. As a side effect, they are not very conductive, giving them their signature Electricity-immunity in game. Nothing particluarly "groundy" about a Gligar or a Mudbray, but they are all still adapted to be immune to electrical attacks.

  The main exceptions are pokemon that are dual-rock type, and Claydol and Golurk lines. All seem to actually be made of earth in some way, and can do more than just push earth around. The dual rock types are easily explainable by the rock types, and perhaps the claydol and golurk were made of a similarly non-conductive material, so people just assumed they were also Ground types because of it.

  Can't wait for the next chapter!

    I actually tried coming up with some HPMOR-type "this thing that's stupidly simple was stupidly simple on purpose for X secretly brilliant reason" that has to do with searching through garbage cans for hidden switches, or taught some moral about rationality, and failed to come up with anything compelling enough. I guess there's still time to :P

    >Are Ground-type Pokemon actually Rubber-polymer type Pokemon?... Nothing particluarly "groundy" about a Gligar or a Mudbray, but they are all still adapted to be immune to electrical attacks.

    My basic idea for this is that for most pokemon "Ground Type" is an emergent property of pokemon that can travel beneath the ground or rely heavily on it for their maneuverability and attacks, which leads to them having a strong resistance/immunity to electric attacks in most situations. Pokemon that seem like clear exceptions to this like gligar and mudbray are the "physiologically unique" ones that actually carry their immunity around with them, but also have some "earthy" properties that link them to the Ground typing, unlike many other pokemon that are immune to electricity without being Ground types (Lightning Rod ability).

    Thanks for reading!

      I was wondering what your take on the fossil Pokemon is, regarding their consistently present rock-type. My hypotheses are as follows:

      1: The rock type is introduced as a (currently) unavoidable consequence of fossil revivification, making them more "genetically engineered theme park monsters" than true prehistoric species.

      2: Only rock-type Pokemon had the sort of biology that is sufficiently conserved during fossilisation that they can be revived (either as a fundamental property or, again, as a limitation of current technology).

      3: Consistent with Brock's beliefs, life really did come from rocks, thus species from earlier epochs were more likely to retain that trait than modern species. Fossil Pokemon are thus type-transitional forms.

      4: A misleading coincidence.

              You know he's based on the Eurypterid sea scorpions, right? I first figured that out by trying to design an anthropomorphic sea scorpion, and ended up two swords short of Kabutops. There's also some *Cheirurus* trilobite in there too. I recently became a little bit obsessed with prehistoric marine arthropods, which made Kabutops rapidly ascend my favourites list.

              Though it seems to me that the Kabuto line has the same claim to the bug type as does Krabby and Corphish, who don't get it.

        Yeah I've been thinking of things like that, but nothing that makes the "hunt and seek" aspect meaningful. Making a prisoner's dilemma type situation isn't hard, but I don't want to include it for the sake of having the garbage can switches if their inclusion would just be aesthetic.

          By making it an unpleasant task, it strains the trust that's been built up here? It's all very well to work together respectfully when discussing hypothetical Dragonite rampages, but what about when tempers are fraying and you'd really like to cut some corners to get this over with? The "hunt and seek" aspect is just another way to make an unpleasant scenario even more inconvenient.

      Yeah, teaching the hacker technique of trashing really seems more like a Koga thing (digging up a note with the passcode for the gym's arena). Or maybe Blaine (combine the contents of his garbage with obscure trivia to figure out some of his tricks).

        No problem. Since I'm still reading through it, these two also popped out.

        > can bring life back from even ashes.

        from even -> even from 

        Probably not a real error, but it would keep me from mentally adding "as opposed to odd ashes."

        ----

        > But I don't think I would have made up that feeling, the Pressure.

        Again, maybe intentional, but capitalizing "Pressure" here seems a bit forth-wall breaking.

        ----

        Edits for additional issues, as I go:

        > That first day, as Blue walked across the campus to start his challenge matches, watched a formation of gym members jogging side by side with their pokemon, passed a line of trainers practicing their pokemon's aim and timing against targets, and heard the cries of battle commands mixed with shouted orders, he knew he'd been wrong.

        On my first read, I read this as "That first day, as Blue walked across the campus to start his challenge matches, **[he]** watched a formation of gym members jogging side by side with their pokemon." Eventually I figured it out. 

        While I think the whole bit could probably be revised, just getting rid of the first comma would help with the readability:

        That first day, as Blue -> On the first day when Blue

        Because "He's got" is short for "He has got", the rest of the list reads like "He has old" and "He has good" (rather than "he is old" and "he is good"). Quick suggestions:

  Wait, Red has a Whismer and Leaf a Buneary? When did this happen?
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Chapter 43:

    >The second abra hunt went off without a hitch, much to Red's relief. Blue was frustrated with the smaller haul, but Leaf pointed out that even after moving to a new location, the population of abra in the area was largely depleted. On the plus side, they managed to catch more pokemon while clearing the field ahead of time: an oddish and whismur for Red, a buneary for Blue, and another venonat for Leaf, which she traded to Blue for his buneary.

    Don't worry, I forget sometimes too: the Team Roster on my site is as much for myself as it is for readers :P

      On that note, the Team Roster does not yet list Blue's Rhyhorn he traded for. 

      And boy was catching a rhyhorn annoying and rare when I played, I bet it's quite the expensive Pokemon...

  > Blue goes over to the wall and leans against it, arms folded. "This I gotta see. You two have no idea how long I've been trying to get Red into trainer battles."

  ...

  > "And I'm not a battle trainer," he yells to Blue as he heads out the door. "I'm a Researcher!"

  Feels like some growth for Red, coming to accept as a researcher he can (and should) also actively work on getting stronger in battle.


  Also feels slightly inconsistent with *some* parts of his character that this apparent hesitation to battling exists. For example, his promise with red to fight legendary birds. Or was he planning on helping outside of battle?
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Quick note that a "battle trainer" in the story is referring to someone who battles other trainers, rather than uses their pokemon to fight wild pokemon, which all trainers do :)

  There is not *nearly* enough shipping convo's going on in these threads, where are my fellow degenerates?

  When Aiko first joined the group, the Red/Aiko chemistry was pretty clear, with Aiko giving off some mad hero-worship eyes. Here though we got some good Leaf/Aiko bonding over shared values, with some added teasing thrown in. No real romantic sparks though, but its a foundation.

  Also Blue totally noticing Aiko's hairstyle, a classic sign of interest! But I still think Red/Aiko has the most cards in play.

  Love to hear other's obviously-reading-too-much-into-it reactions...
  ```

  - u/The_Magus_199:
    ```
    Bah! Red/Leaf is clearly the *true* OTP! Them mirroring each other against the ratatta, all of their chemistry in the first few chapters, the "indistinct and uncomfortable feeling rising in [Red's] chest" when Leaf hugs him after he cedes Crimson to her... 

    Pokemon: Leaf Red version. Accept no substitutes. :P
    ```

    - u/Memes_Of_Production:
      ```
      Oh I totally agree with that - Red/Leaf is gonna have comptetition from Aiko, but just to make red realize his *true* feelings. Then blue/aiko can hook up to pair off the spares and make everything complete of course!

      Or they can discover the wonders of poly...

    - u/Memes_Of_Production:

      Ooh, I will have to read the reviews then! But yeah, you should at least increase the amount of subtle teasing by like 5% to give us more to work with ;)

  A short critique of P:TOoS.

  Strong points:
  * Easy to connect with, even if you are out of the rat community!
  * The characters showcase rationality skills in a way easy to replicate.
  * Introduces weird ideas in a way that makes sense in universe, like pokeballs / cryogenics and AI safety / mewtwo

  Weaknesses:
  * I think the start of the series is rather bland. Until the chu's attack in the forest I did not feel committed to the story.
  * The stakes during the interludes are mismatched with the stakes in the main story, which makes the main story seem dull by contrast, which I do not think it is!
  * The way AI Safety is talked about in Bill's house feels rather condescending and violates the 'show don't tell' principle. This is in stark contrast with how cryogenics / pokeballs or AI Safety / Mewtwo is handled. 

  Looking forward to next episode!
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:

    Thanks for the feedback! I think the weaknesses are all fair, particularly the one about Bill's chapter, which I'm still not fully happy about. Hopefully I can find time to give it another editing pass soon!

  Hey, did you change your RSS post title format? I didn't get the newest one. I have a filter in place so only OoS posts are supposed to make it through. If you changed it, can you let me know the new format so I can adjust my filter? Thanks!
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:

    Sorry, I haven't touched RSS since putting it into the site! Is there anything else that might have caused it?

    - u/Cuz_Im_TFK:

      Probably just a glitch on my end. Was just checking to make sure you didn't start naming the chapters or posts differently or something. thanks for the response!

        No problem!

        Hey, sorry I misunderstood this, I definitely just noticed that I didn't name the last chapter the same way as the previous ones :) I thought it was something in RSS itself. 

        I've fixed it now, and will try to keep an eye on that in the future!

  Woah man, did I arrive to this month's party late, on the plus side, 99 comments to read!

  First off, its crazy that Vermilion City would let some crazy kids up on to the roof of an 80 story building overlooking the coast; those girls must have some crazy courage to just nonchalantly talk about their aspirations under strong winds while looking over a drop to their doom. Good thing that didn't happen, hey? ;]

  That bit about how container tech would change the nature of the ports and the city's layout was really interesting. I can only imagine how the introduction of affordable teleportation would further impact the nature of Vermilion's port city status. Maybe it'll end up competing with Cerulean as a seaside resort kind of place, but with the added benefits of peninsulas such as calmer beaches and more prime real estate. Only time will tell I guess.

  That veteran trainer Lin got me curious, do trainers often go challenge other leagues aside from their first? It seems as though challenging the e4 and champion is rarely done in this world, but it seems that there are basically zero gym challengers attempting the Kanto league coming in from other regions.

  Anyways, happy Halloween to everybody who celebrates it!
