  >"Why?  Because organic intelligence has been so awesome?  Worst case scenario, an AI makes a doomsday device.  We already did that.  Starts a World War?  We did that *twice*.  Tries to kill us all?  We have scientists working on weaponised superviruses *right now*.  Go talk to *them* about scientific ethics.  I'm going to keep trying to make a person, thank you very much.

  ffs.  The root of the problem isn't that AIs might try to turn their light cone into paperclips.  It's that if they did, they might succeed.

  Lots of crazy people try lots of things.  And—crucially—they fail.

    Point, but I think her argument is that, with all the other ways humanity might fuck itself over, at least trying for friendly AI can actually "save the world," as opposed to, say, weaponizing superviruses, which is pretty much a negative if it's ever used, either as intended or not.

    Edit: Also, I just read that last panel:

    >There's lots and lots of things to worry about with AI.  Which is why, when we inevitably create it, I want it to be in **my** lab and not someone else's.
    ```

      It's fiction, so I suppose there's no truth to the matter, but "humans do bad things, so AI isn't liable to do worse, which is why I'm going to bull ahead with making one as fast as I can" being someone's response to the question "how are you going to not kill us all with your AI?" does not inspire my confidence in their sanity.
