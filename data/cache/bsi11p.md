## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  [The Real Reason Fans Hate the Last Season of Game of Thrones](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-real-reason-fans-hate-the-last-season-of-game-of-thrones/) is that we don’t really know how to tell **sociological stories**. I recommend reading the whole article but it's quite long, so I paste some quotes below. "Sociological writing" has a lot in common with rational writing.

  > George R. R. Martin (...) specialize in having characters evolve in response to the broader institutional settings, incentives and norms that surround them.

  > Benioff and Weiss steer the narrative lane away from the sociological and shifted to the psychological. That’s the main, and often only, way Hollywood and most television writers tell stories.

  > In sociological storytelling, the characters have personal stories and agency, of course, but those are also greatly shaped by institutions and events around them. The incentives for characters’ behavior come noticeably from these external forces, too, and even strongly influence their inner life.

  > People then fit their internal narrative to align with their incentives, justifying and rationalizing their behavior along the way.

  > The overly personal mode of storytelling or analysis leaves us bereft of deeper comprehension of events and history.

  > We also have a bias for the individual as the locus of agency in interpreting our own everyday life and the behavior of others. We tend to seek internal, psychological explanations for the behavior of those around us while making situational excuses for our own (...) - the fundamental attribution error.

  > That tension between internal stories and desires, psychology and external pressures, institutions, norms and events was exactly what Game of Thrones showed us for many of its characters, creating rich tapestries of psychology but also behavior that was neither saintly nor fully evil at any one point. It was something more than that: **you could understand why even the characters undertaking evil acts were doing what they did, how their good intentions got subverted, and how incentives structured behavior**.

  > The hallmark of sociological storytelling is if it can encourage us to put ourselves in the place of any character, not just the main hero/heroine, and imagine ourselves making similar choices.

  > Well-run societies don’t need heroes, and the way to keep terrible impulses in check isn’t to dethrone antiheros and replace them with good people. Unfortunately, most of our storytelling—in fiction and also in mass media nonfiction—remains stuck in the hero/antihero narrative.

    This is partly the reason why, but there's a host of other reasons too. The rushed pacing of the last two seasons, the inconsistency of character actions and motivations, the sacrifice of sense for spectacle. 

    Not to mention the fact that various interviews have shown that D&D just wanted to end the show despite being given a blank check and an offer of however many seasons they needed to finish the show. It's just incredibly insulting to the fans how this was all done. MauLer has some great video essays explaining all the shortcomings of the current season.

    Yeah, it is a good read and if they wanted to keep the season 1-4 quality they would have had to do that. I would also say that it is really difficult to do while simultaneously moving the story where you want it to be. It poses additional constraints on the characters (same as our rationality requirement here) and that makes all other aspects of storytelling harder.

    We'll see if GRRM will be able to solve that optimization problem to a satisfying degree in the remaining time he has available.

    I would have been happy with them playing it safe (playing tropes straight) if they really wanted to finish it within the few episodes. I.e. the night king remains the big bad till the end of the season, e.g. Jon kills him with a flaming sword in a final big battle. Dany gets the throne (and then burns it symbolically) or dies heroically against the white walkers. Bran uses his time warping powers to buy off the golden company or something from Cercei and perhaps tries to control the night kings dragon. Arya or Jaime kill Cersei (Arya also gets a last minute save by Nymeria and her pack). A bit underwhelming and not clever, but servicable and entertaining (like Marvel movies).

    But somehow they tried to emulate the storytelling of earlier seasons, just infinitely more rushed and ... failed. Maybe they tried to follow what GRRM told them would happen? Idk.

    That would explain why the series verged into the mediocre two seasons ago. Not why it became actually bad during the last season. There are plenty of decent if somewhat formulaic shows to watch.

    Yeah, wow. I hope it's as good as it looks to play. It seems to be a mix of Terraria and Minecraft, but with the ability to adjust the game toward whichever end of the scale you prefer.

      >  It seems to be a mix of Terraria and Minecraft, but with the ability to adjust the game toward whichever end of the scale you prefer.

      Imagine:  You start in a seemingly-infinite 3D world similar to Minecraft.  You can travel Up, Down, North, or South with only the normal gameplay happening.  If you travel East, however, you start to notice something: the boundaries between North and South are closing in, and you eventually reach a point where you are in a seemingly-infinite *2D* world.  

      Again, you can explore Up and Down with only the (new) normal gameplay, but traveling East begins to restrict your options as the floor and ceiling converge.  Once they reach each other, you are in a 1D world.

      Finally, you can travel East far enough and reach a singular room at the end of the universe.  It contains everything in one point, and is a truly 0D experience.

      ---

      If you travel West from 3Dland, you don't reach 4Dland, instead you find an infinite expanse of non-euclidean space like [Hyperrogue](https://zenorogue.itch.io/hyperrogue).  "East" and "West" are now inadequate descriptors, but you can escape from reality by going West far enough (don't get turned around!) and return to 3Dland by going East (*exactly* East.  Don't miss.).

    Just watched the trailer. It really does look like a slam dunk. Such an obvious and natural progression from minecraft, too. 

    Really makes you wonder why microsoft didn't do that the minecraft IP. Wonder if they'll pay 1 billion for this or if they'll rush out a copy.

      I don't think it's quite obvious, as shown by the army of Minecraft clones reproducing exactly the same mistakes over and over again.

      The Hypixel team has the benefit of years of experience running a high-profile server, making their own games (including quite advanced minigames and adventure maps) and running into the limitations of Minecraft's engine.

    The only time I ever experienced pain in a dream was a similar situations, demons and all that. In my case it was related to sleep paralysis.

    Normally I can maintain a pretty good separation between my real body and my imagined body, that time I found I couldn't move either. After warning me about the dangers of "exploring the dreaming realm" the creature decided to "teach me a lesson". Eventually I managed to get around those restrictions by influencing the environment, having an employee of the building we were in sneak up behind it and hit it.

    At that point I was able to move again and quickly woke myself up.

    If you find yourself lucid enough you might try just occupying another body, after all you're already disembodies, right? You could also try moving an imaginary body while you're awake, to help you find that line between your real body and what you're imagining in a dream. Ideally you'd be able to feel both.

    I hear video games can help people with nightmares, I suspect that's because it's getting you used to controlling a body that isn't tied to your real body, although in your case I worry that kind of thing might affect the physicality of your dreams.

    I've been informed that the knowledge that you can >!feel pain in dreams!< is a minor infohazard, so you may want to add something to the effect of that at the top of your comment. Knowing this community, it won't do anything, but I think it may be best to have a warning up anyway.

    If you want to stop the nightmares, I believe the techniques for lucid dreaming will help. They helped me, at any rate. Keep a dream journal, make it a habit to write in it immediately upon waking up, note down comment elements of a dream, make it a habit to pause and do a reality check every so often or upon seeing one of these elements—all that good stuff. By making reality checks a habit, you increase the chances that you'll do one in a dream as well. And then you'll be in control. When facing nightmares with full awareness, I tend to subvert them instead of just blasting them away or something. For example, I might make the ogre with knives for hands have a slightly dumb but caring personality, and give him a backstory, and alter his appearance a bit to match. Do these changes often enough and they'll stick eventually even when you're not aware you're dreaming.

    Hope that helps.

      Are you telling me that the "Pinch me. I think I'm dreaming. And obviously you don't feel pain in your dreams" thing that is repeatedly used in media is actually a benevolent infohazard protection meme to maximize the amount of people who believe that you can't feel pain in dreams?

        Hey, I am Lightwavers source, thanks to Noumero for paging me. 

        I did get the first and only pain dreams in my life after being told that dream pain knowledge can be contagious by a friend, duration about a week, mild pain. Since then I've sent out word to 80 people here on /r/rational and asked them to please report back to me either positive and negative status. One third of people reported back, mostly negative. 

         3 were already naturally experiencing the phenomenon, so we have ridiculously high baserate here on the sub or rolled REALLY well with the small survey size. Two reported having started pain dreams. 

        One of these described their experience as "extreme pain, one week of pure torture". 

        Ergo: low infection rate (lower than naturally occuring), shortness of experienced period seems pretty safe, but the one outlier of "extreme pain" makes me wary to go parade this around.

            Just because an infohazard is poorly contained does not mean it isn't an infohazard. Your sources back up the statement that >!pain in dream!<  is something people experience. All we need now is a study testing whether the frequency increases when people are told about the phenomenon. Since you won't accept anecdotes (which is fair) we could set up a poll over the internet or raise awareness until it catches an actual scientist's attention.

  Does anyone know of good resources for ornate fonts? I don't mean fancy fonts or calligraphy, but rather the very elaborate letters you sometimes see at the beginning of a chapter which are as big as the following paragraph. Those are called drop caps and I was hoping to find examples of them for research.
  ```

  - u/Bowbreaker:

    The greatest example I know of are in the original language Never Ending Story. Every chapter starts with the next letter of the alphabet, takes a whole page, and is incorporated in beautiful chapter-relevant artwork.

  Has anyone seen the new Aladdin movie? I watched it yesterday and kept thinking how ripe for munchkinry that simple premise can be. The movie itself exploits that potential a bit more as >!for example, Jafar being turned into a genie is the result of Genie interpreting the wish in a clever way, rather than his exact wording!<. Well, the movie isn't great or anything, but it made me wish there was a rational Aladdin or generally One Thousand and One Nights kind of setting story.
