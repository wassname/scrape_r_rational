## [HF] [DC] Street Cultivation - a modernized take on xianxia

### Post:

Hello, everyone! I'm here to introduce one of my series, Street Cultivation, because readers recommended that I post here.

I don't like to misrepresent my work, so I want to be clear that this isn't pure rationalist fiction. I think readers recommended for me to post here because of the worldbuilding and the reconstruction of the traditional "zero to hero" arc along more realistic lines. Though I wasn't certain that Street Cultivation was a good fit, after reviewing other fiction posted here, I think that I can say it might potentially be of interest to this audience.

**Book Description**

In the modern world, qi is money.

The days of traveling martial  artists and mountaintop masters are over. Power is controlled by  corporations, modernized martial arts sects, and governments. Those at  the bottom of society struggle as second class citizens in a world in  which power is a commodity.

Rick is a young fighter in this  world. He doesn't dream of immortality or becoming the strongest, just  of building a better life for himself and his sister, who suffers from a  spiritual illness. Unfortunately, life isn't that easy...

  My review:  
  I've definitely been enjoying this. It's... real in a way many stories aren't. The main character has a multi-faceted life that you get to see, from jobs to family to social, and not everything has something to do with each other. This is more of a slice-of-life than a literary work. The MC plays to his strengths and is aware of his weaknesses, but any cheat-codes to life have already been taken by the world at large.  


  It's solidly young adult, in theme, content and writing style.

  Read this. It was a fun read;
    - broadly rational
    - world building that passes the smell test. 
      - there's not enough revealed detail yet to be confident that it's well thought through. It's a first book, so there's only so much that can be done in that space if you want to write an actual plot, and there's a *lot* of plot.
    - The magic system doesn't seem hard enough for my taste, but that could just be lack of exploration of the system as a whole. It's not so broken that adding the right details couldn't make it harder.
       - As it stands, it feels like it's faking hardness by quantifying the magic, but there's no visible reason for the numbers to be what they are in general.
  ```

  - u/InfernoVulpix:
    ```
    I wouldn't say that it's *faking* hardness with the numbers, as it's pretty upfront that numbers aren't everything, and even the general ballpark of your numbers don't necessarily translate to actual effectiveness.  The fact that the numbers are so precise is, to me, more emblematic of their society's approach to magic: that once it's part of the world, it stops being magical.  It's the fuel for superpowered combat moves and all those fun things, but science and the measuring of the world has had its way with lucrim just as much as anything else, and that is demonstrated in the magic being precisely measured in standardized units to four or five significant figures when even two is plenty for most practical purposes.
    ```

    - u/Jello_Raptor:
      ```
      My priors on this being done badly are high. Your interpretation is plausible, but I don't have enough info to decide yet. 

      Hence why I am looking forward to the second book, it's sort of make or break for the series. At least in terms of whether I'd be willing to call it rational fiction. 

      That said, I fully expect to enjoy the next book its just a question if which bucket it fits in.

  Sarah has a strong EQ, and it's reflected in her writing.

  If you're a fan of character driven stories with characters that feel like real people navigating a could-be-real world like RE: Trailer Trash and Worth the Candle, you'll enjoy her works.

  I've cried and laughed multiple times from Street Cultivation, which is my barometer for an unforgettable story.

    What is Re: Trailer Trash?
    ```

    - u/InfernoVulpix:
      ```
      A story on royal road, where an elderly woman has a freak accident with a medical device and gets peggie sue'd back into their schoolgirl self back when they were, well, trailer trash.  The story from there is the girl working to turn her life around, get things right that she failed the first time, and things like that.

      I read through it at one point but haven't kept up with it, so I don't know what it's been doing in the last few months.
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        Huh.  Sounds cool; I've always enjoyed Peggy Sue stories.  Thanks for the rec.

    I also had that impression, which was why I didn't post here until others recommended it. I'm glad that most seem to think it's rational-adjacent enough to fit here.

    Authors get paid for Kindle Unlimited reads, unless Amazon bungles something, as occasionally happens. Glad you enjoyed my book!

  /u/NightShadowJ, /u/IICVX, /u/josephwdye: Since someone (namely, you) actually requested it, I've taken the steps to publish a paperback version. It might not display normally from some pages, but you should be able to access it via this link:

  www.amazon.com/dp/B083XTGK3Y

  Sorry about the price, but the book is longer than average for Amazon POD services and the base cost is relatively high.
  ```

  - u/TennisMaster2:
    ```
    Add the paperback link to the parent post for posterity's sake!
    ```

- u/josephwdye:
  ```
  I just read this last week and it was amazing! Iâ€™m talking to my librarian friend about picking this for our sff bookClub. 

  Is there any plans for a paperback version? 

  Thank you for sharing your book with us! It made me feel feels and over all gave me a very enjoyable day.
  ```

  - u/SarahLinNGM:
    ```
    I'm glad to hear you enjoyed my book so much. \^-^ Please leave a review if you haven't already!

    I don't usually do paperbacks, but after having several people recently ask for one, I might set it up.
    ```

    - u/josephwdye:
      ```
      If you do I will buy one@!

    Not at the moment, sorry. There's usually little enough demand for a printed version that I don't have Amazon make one.

- u/godwithacapitalG:
  ```
  Decent enough book, but I hate how it seems like capitalism is both the be all to end all and simultaneously the worst thing ever invented. Which while I guess is the whole point of the book, when in the second book we got to the >!demon realm and it turns out that demons are also suffering under capitalism!< my suspension of disbelief was broken. Just too much.
  ```

  - u/InfernoVulpix:
    ```
    To me it's less the capitalism and more the systems of power (which in the modern day setting happens to be capitalism).  In older feudal times it would be lords and serfdom or combat sects or any number of methods by which people with power exerted power to maintain and extend their power.

    >!In the demon realm case it's also worth noting that the city we visited is a city that explicitly grew out of capitalism (namely having a convenient base to conduct very capitalistic business in human cities) and we don't know if the rest of the demon world is like this.  In a way you could compare the demon city we visited to one of those towns built on a gold mine that only existed to mine gold and fell apart as soon as the gold dried up.!<

    It's worth noting that capitalism is both extremely useful and much easier to criticize than many other systems.  Capitalism is a giant engine for productivity, and in magicland as in irl-land it's handily outcompeted most other economic systems by and large, but it's also the current paradigm of systems of power and when you say 'meritocracy is an illusion', you're just a cycnic instead of a heretic.  And it's really easy to want to criticize capitalism when you're Rick and have been on the wrong end of the power structures all your life.
    ```

  - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
    ```
    I'm coming to this a bit late. But my view is that in the real world there are places where capitalism is better and worse. For example Russia and Sweden are both capitalist, but Russian capitalism is much harsher to live under. 

    So why shouldn't a capitalist fantasy world be the bad kind of capitalism? Since the genre is defined by massive and often abusive power disparities - you better bow and scrape before the old masters, they're entitled to kill you if they feel like it - capitalism being worse here seems entirely fitting.
    ```

- u/1000dollarsamonth:
  ```
  I just could not get around how the world is still so very similar like you can almost remove the cultivation aspect and its just a novel about some guy pit fighting to pay his little sister's medical bills. It was probably done in purpose but I was looking forward to read a cultivation novel similar to the cradle series but with modern themes.
  ```

- u/reddithanG:
  ```
  I thoroughly enjoyed the first book. Although I am very disappointed that the 2nd book will be the last one.
  ```

  - u/SarahLinNGM:
    ```
    I've promised at least a third book.
    ```

    - u/reddithanG:
      ```
      Oh I stand corrected, I dont know where I got that information from, sorry
      ```

- u/OnlyEvonix:
  ```
  Cultivator chat group and especially 40 millennium of cultivation seem related
  ```

  - u/Keshire:
    ```
    > 40 millennium of cultivation

    I categorize that as more Sci-Fi than modern. It's the Battlestar Galactica of Xianxia.

    > Cultivator chat group

    100 percent agree. It has a very unique Old meets New feeling. It gives those thousand year old cultivators the feeling of Grandma/Grandpa sending the grandkids emoji's on a cell phone.
