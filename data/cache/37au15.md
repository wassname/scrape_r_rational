## Munchkining Buffy?

### Post:

In S2E10 they found out that being technically dead for a minute awakened another slayer. Shouldn't doing that on purpose with doctors for every awakened slayer asap be the winning move?

  Nope. She ... um, spoilers I guess if you're just now watching the series ... dies *again* later, and no new Slayer is called. WoG is only the most-recent Slayer "counts", Buffy is now just a person who happens to have Slayer powers.

  With that said, I've always felt that the existence of a "curse" that basically *cures vampirism* was criminally underused by the cast. And I mean criminal as in "you just **killed** *more people than I can count* who could easily have been saved and added to your baddass good!vampire army".

    Yeah, the scooby gang is criminally incompetent, but then again, so is everybody else in the Buffyverse. It's a world of irresponsible idiots.

    SPOILER S6:  
    Xander summons a demon that burns people alive.  
    "Gee guys sorry, I thought it would be a *good* demon.  
    - Well that was dumb even by our standards. Oh well, let's move on and never mention it again!"
    ```

    That's why I said for every awakened slayer. When the new slayer died, another came from that, so you have to medically kill the newest one, and undo that. Slayer powers is all you need for people, Buffy doesn't miss anything else than having already used her death makes new slayer thingy, but all the new ones can do that once.

    Bending some steel beams: Yes, only the newest one counts. But you can just _temporarily_ kill the newest one to create a new slayer. Do that until you get thousand slayers.
    ```

    - u/MugaSofer:
      ```
      Oh, yeah. That, you can do. It'd be risky, of course, and you have to track down each new Slayer, but the Watchers' Council apparently does that already.
      ```

    Headcanon: most of the time when you try that, the good!vampire kills himself/herself.  It's not really useful as a way of doing anything other than getting rid of vampires, which you could already do with sunlight, fire, stakes, ~~and Ripple energy~~.

  Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

  In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

  Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

  “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

  The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

  Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

  Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

  L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

    Actually, more than two; they're just lumped into two rough categories. "Hell dimensions" and ... not-Hell dimensions. (And we only know of one person who came back and *hadn't* gone to Hell, right? Buffy had no memories of a *place*, so even that is pretty speculative.)
    ```

    - u/Terkala:
      ```
      And not all the hell dimensions are actually that bad. At least one of them is a sort of rural 1200s era Europe setting. So it's not guaranteed that every "hell dimension" is actually a bad place to live. They just need a better name for them, in a sort of "greenland/iceland" kind of way.
      ```

      - u/derefr:
        ```
        I think they're going for a sort of *Divine Comedy* setting: Earth *is* a hell dimension. "Hell dimension" means "anywhere that isn't that one nice one."
        ```

  - u/philip1201:
    ```
    How do we know heaven is a truly good place to live, and not some form of wireheading? I haven't watched the series, but it could be that they're better off trying to create soulless human-simulations with all the morally appropriate qualia, rather than trusting this 'god' fellow.
    ```

    - u/lehyde:
      ```
      [Here](https://youtu.be/1ozahkY9zLc?t=90)'s the scene where Buffy talks about this Heaven. It definitely sounds like wireheading to me. No new experiences, just an eternal feeling of bliss. And really boring.

    I think we have only one likely confirmed afterlife, at most.  
    We only ever see people bodily taken into Hell/hell equivalents.  
    Buffy died in a rift in the fabric of the multiverse, so we have no idea what happened to her soul other then it spending time in a state of (deceptive, soporific) serenity.  
    Re-souled vampires show no signs of remembering an afterlife.  
    The only possible occasion where someone died and returned with purpose (implying active thought and interaction with surroundings as a soul) is Joyce in Conversations with Dead People, which may or may not have just been a convoluted First Evil scheme, or else something weirder.

  By the end of the show don't they find another way to activate every slayer?
  ```

- u/Izeinwinter:

  Willow ends up doing rather better than that. Uhm, in fact, Willow generally does fairly well on the "Exploit the heck out of the metaphysics of the crapsack universe you are trapped in" front. 

  so, it'd be more interesting to explore other themes that are not covered by canon but implied by it - like anthropics. The number of "End of the world" scenarios which was averted on the show was just ridiculus to the point where the only reasonable theory is that one of the powers that warp reality hits the reset button every time earth gets destroyed.
  ```

  - u/kaukamieli:
    ```
    Yeaah, but Willow flowers way later.
    ```

- u/Transfuturist:
  ```
  There are some fics where Xander dresses up as a Jedi or something similarly cerebral for the Halloween where everyone turned into their costumes. He then proceeds to munchkin or something. I haven't read them.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    It beggars the imagination that no one turned into Superman / Batman / Spiderman that night.

    In any case, this curse sounds like the greatest thing since fire as far as transhumanism and muchkinry goes -- "okay, folks, everyone decided what you're going to be and got your costume on?  Okay, good, casting Janus curse in 3...2...1...."

    On the subject of Buffy!Halloween, if you read [Schlock Mercenary](http://schlockmercenary.com) and like Buffy, then this story is a lot of fun:  [Xander Mercenary](http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-6928/kevinm+Xander+Mercenary.htm)  It's very much a cotton-candy / guilty pleasure fic -- the spag is a bit flaky and the main characters aren't ever particularly challenged, but it's a blast while you're reading it.  It starts as a SM/Buffy cross, then pulls in SG-1 to good effect.  Later on (in the sequel?  I forget) the author starts pulling in absolutely everything, including PowerRangers and Ghostbusters.  Stop reading when you get there.

    I've never read buffyfics, I'm just watching the series again and thought about this. This thing allows for multiple full slayers at the same time. If one is enough usually to keep darkness at bay...
    ```

- u/thakil:
  ```
  Yes, that should work, although SPOILERS FOR SEASON 7





  In Season 7 they delve into the mechanics a bit (or rather, make them up). Supposedly there is a proportion of the female population (size unstated, but fairly small) who have the potential to become a slayer. If all of them die, the Slayer line ends and no more Slayers will be created.

  Also, at the end of Season 2 we discover that to curse a vampire with their soul all you need is an orb of thessela and Willow. Said orbs are common enough that Giles has one as a paperweight. So why not do that to every vampire, or at least as many as you have orbs?
  ```

  - u/Honest_Fool:
    ```
    In the buffyverse, souls and the afterlife are confirmed facts. Using the vampire soul curse rips a soul from their life in the afterlife and forces them to experience all the memories of their body while it was possessed by a demon. Might be a wee bit unethical?
    ```

    - u/thakil:
      ```
      That's true, although to be fair it's never entirely clear what happens to a soul while someone is vampired... Maybe the soul is forced to be an observer? I don't think Angel ever commented on what the him that was his soul was getting up to while he was vampiring around?
      ```

      - u/IllusoryIntelligence:
        ```
        Angel did spend pretty much the entire run being captain dark and gloomy though. Part of that can be attributed to the specific wording of his curse* but it could also be that getting dragged out of heaven results in long term psychological harm.

        *that he would return to soulless monster mode should he experience a moment of true happiness. Presumably had he been in hell that would have been fairly immediate on returning.
        ```

      - u/MugaSofer:
        ```
        It seems like the "soul" is more of a conscience than a seat-of-consciousness thing, at least the way Angel tells it. Vampires retain the original brain and personality, just not the morals.
        ```

        - u/Zeikos:
          ```
          Hmm personality and morals are pretty much intertwine. If you take out the morals of someone you take out his personality too.

          Wouldn't it make more sense if it was morality and consciousness? So Vampires would be just amoral p-zombies.
          ```

  - u/kaukamieli:
    ```
    Well, every potential should become a slayer to at least get the powers so they'd stay alive longer, can't see why not. Except if those with powers are somehow easy to track.
    ```

- u/Nepene:
  ```
  A strong enough witch could do that, but it's not necessarily going to be easy.
  ```

- u/MaxDougwell:
  ```
  In theory, yes.  
  In practice, the plan hits a snag when you reach a Slayer unwilling to trust you enough to die on request. Like, say, Faith.  
  Then you either give up or start killing Slayers against their will, which is it's own can of worms if the entire series is anything to go by.


  Spoiler Season 7+: Also the 100% awakening of all potential Slayers seems to have a bunch of weird metaphysical repercussions.
