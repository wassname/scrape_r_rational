## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  My curated list of the best forum quests between SufficientVelocity, SpaceBattles, and QuestionableQuesting after multiple years of active site use. Biggest hazard to finding these naturally is that most quests die pretty early. Some of these are definitely or ambiguously dead, but at least have enough meat on their bones that I still consider it more than worth your time. Haven't actually caught up with all of these either, but that's just because I'm me and not because it failed to meet a quality threshold. Sorted vaguely into tiers that are more relative to each other than absolute.

    I think I bounced off Forge of Destiny. I suppose I'll give it another shot.

    I'd like to recommend [Zerrer](https://forums.spacebattles.com/members/zerrer.307452/), specifically their Worm quests [I'm sorry, can you repeat that? [Worm Quest, OC]](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/im-sorry-can-you-repeat-that-worm-quest-oc.554997/) which is dead/hiatus and [ Child of Monsters (Worm)](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/child-of-monsters-worm.892684/) which is complete. Some of their more recent quests have had disappointing endings, but I think the two I mentioned are very well written.

    Since you mentioned QQ, I'm surprised you didn't mention The Erogamer.
    ```

    - u/XxChronOblivionxX:
      ```
      Oh right, I think I cut Erogamer because I'd stopped reading it long before it finished, it's been years and I don't remember it that well, not sure how much I actually want to finish given the reasons that this quest is unappealing to me, etc. So I thought my rec wasn't worth much, and suspected it was partly there because of the acclaim Past Chron and other people had given it.
      ```

  - u/netstack_:
    ```
    Let’s see…I’ve only read a few of these. *Ignition* was fun if not terribly memorable. I’m almost caught up with *A Song of Peace*, which has been spectacular.

    *Fate/hollow fake*, now, rates as one of my all-time top *Fate* fics, quest or otherwise. And due to actually playing the identity game seriously, it might actually be better for those who are less familiar with canon. For anyone on the fence, I recommend it.

    Between those and your involvement with *MfD*, I feel like you’ve got a lot of credibility. I’ll have to try some more of these. Especially *Divided Loyalties*, which I’ve seen on the Recommended Threads sidebar.

    For a few not listed: *A Sword Without a Hilt* (ASoIaF/D&D 3.5) was a cool concept and a ludicrously ambitious scale. I think it’s complete, too, but I can’t be sure, because I dropped it at some point. The writing just can’t keep up with the premise. [Panopticon](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/panopticon-a-game-of-posthumans-perniciousness-paranoia-politics-and-plasmaguns.47/) is another neat idea which really delves into the world building for Mage: the Ascension. Again, falls a bit short on execution.

    I think I vaguely remember that exalted cross? I have to say I preferred [Conquest Quest](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/conquest-quest-exalted-worm-story-only-thread.279681/), but it’s been so long since I read it…

    I also enjoyed the delightfully unhinged [Cauldron Quest](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/cauldron-quest™.521047/). Wait, no. I was thinking of [KOOL](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/kool-a-rooster-cocoa-brawn-quest-illustrated-worm-quest-humor.568714/#post-39333838), a somewhat different entry in the genre. Not to be confused with the multiple Damsel of Distress quests…But the crowning achievement of *Worm* questing, in my opinion, is the tragically unfinished [Armsmaster’s Social Advice Quest](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/armsmasters-social-advice-quest.23651/#post-4707498). The audience was given a chance to augment Armsmaster with grace and tact via a very narrow text channel. Incredible character beats ensue.

    Anyway, thanks for the recs!
    ```

    - u/XxChronOblivionxX:
      ```
      Aw man, I forgot about Panopticon. I had really really enjoyed that one, though yeah I think I remember the biggest flaw being that it felt a bit bloated and distracted from the main running thread of >!their computer boss turning omnicidal and the Space Division desperately keeping that a secret while fighting it off!<. Jamelia was great, and one of her lines is that rare quote that engraves itself into my brain and changes how I think a little bit. Something along the lines of "there is no heaven, and no hell. Only humans, and the consequences of our actions." Might possibly add that, but I was trying so hard to cut down this list to a more manageable size.

      Some of these other ones are new to me, so they shall go on The List.

    Mentioning Forge of Destiny in the same breath as Divided Loyalties makes me want to finally start reading it.

    What's your opinion, if any, on [Puella Magi Adfligo Systema](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/puella-magi-adfligo-systema.2538/)?

    Also, slight warning to everyone regarding the ongoingness of Divided Loyalties. It's only currently ongoing insofar that most of us trust the author enough to be very sure that it *will* go on some time soon. But technically it is not currently going. The last chapter came out January 18. The author is still regularly posting comments several times a week, but there's no specific date he can tell when he'll be able to pick it back up. Exact quote:

    >Every day or two I give the cord a pull, and sooner or later the engine will turn over and we'll be back on track.
    ```

    - u/XxChronOblivionxX:
      ```
      I have read most of PMAS, and was up-to-date for quite a while, but I eventually unwatched. The biggest reason was that the pacing was unbearably slow and it felt particularly excruciating when I'm reading one tiny update at a time. Will probably go back to it at some point, the things that turn me away are not major.

    I'm surprised to see both [Polyhistor Academy](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/polyhistor-academy-original-setting-survival-quest.614/) and [The Path Unending](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-path-unending-a-cultivation-quest.62599/#post-14380696) to be missing from what is otherwise a pretty comprehensive list, I think both are great and I actually prefer the Path to Forge (they both have similar premises)
    ```

    - u/XxChronOblivionxX:
      ```
      I dropped Polyhistor and don't recommend it to people. I did read a fair bit of it while enjoying the ride, but at a certain point I realized I really wasn't attached to the main characters at all. And I stopped being able to ignore my major issues with the worldbuilding. Mostly about >!the inherent stupidity of this kind of Death School that kills almost all of its students.!<

      I had been enjoying Paths and then the voters did something indescribably stupid and torched a lot of what I liked about it, so I instantly dropped it.
      ```

      - u/CatInAPot:
        ```
        I think a lot of people talk about the voters being at fault for Path (and they kind of are), but the main fault lies in the author putting it as a voting option in the first place.

        The way the duel went down is actually pretty impressive, in that it manages to ruin *three* characters all at once. The MC for being such a huge asshole, the girl who values loyalty for forgiving him, and the guy who valued justice over pride for forgiving him. 

        The fact that the author added that as a voting option in the first place, and the way he managed to commit character assassination on multiple characters at once to continue the story after that godawful choice immediately made me lose all interest in the story.
        ```

      - u/Ricardias:
        ```
        > indescribably stupid

        Which choice are you talking about? 

        As for Polyhistor, I think it has excellent world building and some of most fun magic around. I will say, while well written, the characters aren't most compelling part. As for you spoiler, it lines up with the goals of the academy and makes sense within the wider setting.
        ```

        - u/XxChronOblivionxX:
          ```
          Re: Paths, it was >!him volunteering to fight against his own allies for shiny loot and then he *won*, it was the type of vote that was both very stupid and also shitty to his friends. As a matter of personal taste I dislike reading most forms of major failures, and that one was intolerable to me.!<

          Re: Polyhistor, I did very much enjoy the process of reading it, but characters are a big part of me enjoying something long-term, and I both wasn't very attached to the existing ones and didn't like the kind of people they were becoming. So when I caught up and started reading updates I realized I didn't feel much pull to actually click the update links and spend time reading it. >!MC getting raped was also just unpleasant. I'm somewhat open to the idea that there is a set of circumstances where this kind of Death School makes sense, but none of those would make the concept more appealing for me to read.!< 

          I have been more mercenary about avoiding stories that bring my mood down too much in the last several years, either getting me depressed or annoyed or indignant or whatever. So that results in collateral damage of stories whose quality otherwise meets my standards.
          ```

          - u/gfe98:
            ```
            The duel from Paths was pretty much a one time thing and the MC managed to repair his relationships, it's not something like Marked for Death where frustrating votes and consequences were constant. I recommend you give it another chance.
            ```

    Below are quests *I* enjoyed a great deal. Aside from possible the cultist sim one I don't think any of them would qualify as rational, but they are still good reads for rationally minded people.


    [Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest (No SV, you are the Waifu)](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/battle-action-harem-highschool-side-character-quest-no-sv-you-are-the-waifu.15335/) is an excellent read as well.
    Deader then a doornail sadly, but still pretty great.

    [Esquestria: The House of the Sun - A pony cultist experience](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/esquestria-the-house-of-the-sun-a-pony-cultist-experience.71721/) is a cross between MLP (ehh) and cultist simulator.

    - u/XxChronOblivionxX:
      ```
      Big fan of BAHHSCQ, that one I was already considering adding to the list. Really really strong character writing in a fantastic iteration of this setting type, but the disqualifying detail is how early into the narrative it feels in the grand scheme of things. *Man's Dream* was also an edge case.

      I know I've tried Pony Cultist before but dropped it early. Can't fully remember why, though the premise itself isn't something that appeals to me. 

      I have soured on Rihaku's style over time, and consider the constant loot/build votes to be among the worst features of their quests. Their structure often feels very carefully built to maximize reader engagement instead of narrative or gameplay, making participation exhausting. And I just don't have faith they will actually finish. I liked *Garden of Enoch*, I loved Imperia just like I love Kiryuin Satsuki and Cai Renxiang, it's one of my favorite archetypes. 

      I have tried Scabbard before and also dropped quickly, and my vague memories of why are telling me that it was narrative and worldbuilding bloat. 

      Never heard of Conquest, it shall go on The List.

      Oh I was one of the main participants of that from the very start until I dropped it around the time >!they went to Konoha for the first time!<. It's the reason I went to SV in the first place.

      I read up to ~chapter 480, I believe. I found the constant "wow your plan is so dumb how could you ever think that" updates to be a bit grating. Tangentially, the retcons related to henge and some other jutsu really peeved me. Also, >!I'm personally 100% ok with LGBT stuff, but I found the focus on legalizing gay marriage to be weird when they're still in a feudal-ish military dictatorship where serfs are massacred as a matter of course. It sorta broke my suspension of disbelief when the QMs go on and on about how rationalist their world is, but they focus on "uplifting/modernizing" something that "rationally" is a highly niche issue in their current culture!<.
      ```

      - u/Bowbreaker:
        ```
        It's a niche issue, but it's an issue that was already not so serious and on the cusp of being dealt with in that world. And it was an issue that happened to be personal to a VIP, who isn't above hypocrisy anymore than most people ultimately are.

        Also, I assume it was even less of an issue in Yagura's Mist, if for no other reason than that the micromanager in chief couldn't give a rat's ass.

        - u/Neither_Guitar7687:

          As someone who participated in that quest for a while before dropping it. There was one instance where players added a direct quote and the authors took said quote and used it. It didn't go well. It was poorly phrased for a deathworld where threats are taken seriously. Also they allowed write ins and some trolling/brigading resulted in a story ruining vote that was retconned.
          ```

          - u/CaramilkThief:
            ```
            To be fair the QM/reader dynamic has changed quite a bit since that chapter, it has been like 5 years since then lol. The story was supposed to have the readers play a character until they die, and then move onto a new character, ad infinitum. What ended up happening was that the readers kept the protagonist alive, and he is still alive now. I do think the QMs are harder than they should be, especially in a quest. But for what it's worth nowadays the longtime readers are able to cater plans towards each QMs preferences pretty well, and the QMs themselves are helpful in telling us what they are looking for. I also think the "hardmode" part makes for some really nice stakes sometimes, especially since the world is supposed to be competent.

    I have a [rated list of Worm quests](https://www.reddit.com/user/ahasuerus_isfdb/comments/uo5wzx/worm_fan_fic_ratings_quests/). A number of entries may require caveats, e.g.:

    * The crack quest *Inebriated Quest* has been deleted, but epub versions may be available online.
    * *The Neuroqueen of Brockton Bay* is NSFW, but the number of sexually explicit scenes is limited. As the author explained in a FAQ, "I’m mostly asexual outside of my hypnofetish. To me, the mind-control *is* the sexy part." I gave it 7/10 because I found the mind control aspect horrifying.
    * *Worm Fanfic Crossover Quest* may require familiarity with the *Worm* fanfic scene in order to fully appreciate it.
    * *Headway/Nexus Quest* has had a few quest masters over the years and it shows.

    ```

    - u/Dragongeek:
      ```
      Personally, I'd advise to steer clear. 

      I find quests to be a rather unsatisfying format for a variety of reasons:

      - Difficult to read. It's the *worst* when authors incorporate choices in the middle of their "chapters" that don't get resolved until later. This means you don't find out what happened in the current chapter until you read the next chapter, which I find extremely annoying. 

      - Similar to the previous point, often everything is split into small chunks and you spend a lot of time reading choice options that end up never being chosen

      - Most quest authors are not good enough authors to incorporate a complete and satisfying plot or character development into their stories beyond "numbers go up!" or similar because of how the audience steers

      My biggest gripe with them is that the author is giving up agency over their story and handing it out to people who are, on average and in aggregate, moronic idiots. The absolute worst part of internet fiction is commenters telling the author what their character should do next, or trying to "predict" where the story should go, and quests are just like "fuck it, concentrate all the bad stuff and see what happens"
      ```

    - u/XxChronOblivionxX:
      ```
      Uh, don't think there are any warning signs specific to quests that I'd give to people. Drop things that just don't interest you even if they seem well-written. Participating in votes and giving your reasoning and debating people about it can be a very good way of getting more engaged with something. You should be aware that all quests can abruptly die at any given moment, that's arguably even more true for quests than it is for fanfiction, so make your peace with that and make sure you are enjoying things in the moment. If you want to find stuff yourself, start by sorting the quest form by "Most Replies" to get the really long ones that got a lot of attention. Sort by "Latest Replies" for the threads that are currently active and probably won't die soon. Sort by "Date of First Reply" to get the newest threads at the ground floor, but there is less quality filtering there.

    I like [Warble](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/warble-case-53-worm.939704/), a Worm case 53 quest with a tiny Lovecraftian dragon as the main character. Only a couple of us vote and I think so far we made smart decisions stealthily building up skills, unusual allies, and a hidden boat base. It would be great to get more people involved in planning. Currently we are planning how to hijack a pair of Tinkertanks and defuse a hostage situation.

  Mentioned on the last thread, but I got into "The Flower That Bloomed Nowhere" off a recommendation from several weeks ago. Foolish me, I assumed it was finished because it had been a few months since the last update. Nope. The author is just going slow. Which really sucks, because I wanna know what happened! Much of the plot is like crack to r/rational readers - futuristic sci-fi setting that involves magic as well, time-looping murder mystery, deliberately teases clues for attentive readers. But it's slow as hell and honestly the "time-loop murder mystery tag" is more background setting so far than an active part of the story. Great philosophical discussions about what it means to be human, though, and nice tension and psychological body horror at times.

  I also started "The Adventures of Rania Mortal the Perfectly Normal Elf," which is hilarious and tropey. It reminds me of APGTE, without any of the tension, mostly played for laughs. It's a great deconstruction of fantasy tropes, but it leans into the "tell, don't show" method and info-dumps quite a bit to explain the trope subversions. It's funny and fun but pretty brainless so far. You'll enjoy the references without having to trawl for clues. No clue where it'll go from here, as the history of the world/gods/spirits was just revealed a chapter or two ago, so unless there's another meta-narrative layer, everything is out in the open now. Still worth as a palate cleanser, IMO.

  Both fics are on RR if you want to read them.

    Augh, we can't pressure the writer to remove that incredibly misleading tag if people keep spreading it...

  Any WAFFy stories about living with or being card for by post-scarcity aliens/robots? I want something similar to the Vanda Nosseo glowfics, or fanfics like the Stellaris Rogue Servitor fanfics:

  [Are You Not Sufficiently Comfy?](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12676114/1/)

    Not exactly sure what WAFFy means, but there’s the Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect, which seems similar to what you’re looking for based on a quick glance at your links.

    I've not read those so don't know how similar they are but the webcomic Forward by Tailsteak is an interesting small scale/slice of life look at living in a post scarcity world, the main character is a social recluse with AIs helping them get out of their shell and develop as a person https://forwardcomic.com/firstpage.html

  Will Wight is giving away his ebooks for free today, they’re really good, especially Cradle. They’re Cultivation novels but in a more western style, like how The Last Airbender is like a Japanese anime in a western style, if that makes sense. Worth a pick up anytime, but especially since they’re free

    Been ages since I've read it, but [What's Her Name In Hufflepuff](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/whats-her-name-in-hufflepuff-harry-potter-self-insert.662488/) might work for you. Self-insert OC gets isekai'd to right before Harry Potter canon starts up, de-aged to join into first year classes, and resolves to make things work out better than canon did.

    ...while safe and unscrutinised in the background, largely unnoticed and easily dismissed.

      I remember reading that one a couple years ago and she really wasn't changing anything canonical, just chilling. Did that change or are you overstating that aspect?
      ```

      - u/hwc:
        ```
        Yes and no.  The protagonist didn't change much about the philosopher's stone plot, but did interfere heavily with the plots of books 2, 3, and 4.  By the middle of second year, Sirius Black is exonerated, the diary is hidden within several nested iron boxes, and the bones of all of Tom Riddle's known relatives have been destroyed and scattered (to prevent the exact resurrection ritual used in book 4).
        ```

        - u/hwc:

          And with such giant behind-the-scenes changes to canon, I wonder what the plan for the rest of the fic is.

  It's nonfiction, but I recently read Ashlee Vance's new book [*When the Heavens Went on Sale*](https://www.audible.com/pd/When-the-Heavens-Went-on-Sale-Audiobook/B0BCCLS25B). It is about the rise of "new space" and the quiet revolution that's been occurring in orbit and it absolutely blew me away. 

  Like, I can't remember the last time I encountered journalism this extreme since maybe the original Vice North Korea documentary (which is also absolutely wild). 

  The guy, Vance, has an insane level of access to industry and billionaires and this story includes everything from casually meeting New Zealand's ex-prime minister over coffee to being the person Elon Musk rings up because he's bored to trouping around Ukrainian military ICBM factories with two escorts and a bodyguard. Shit's insane. 

  This book reads like a Stephenson novel, specifically the present-day sections of Cryptonomicon, and it's even more crazy to think about how all this stuff is basically present day. 

  I highly recommend this for anyone who's even tangentially interested in space, and the audiobook narration is also particularly good (Robert Petkoff is great)

  Any shopkeep stories with a strong focus on the mercantile side and strictly minimal to no combat? Pref litrpg but could be any genre

    Not exactly shopkeep but Spice and Wolf has a strong focus on the mercantile side. Being a shopkeeper is Lawrence's long-term goal. Nice fluffy romance with some economy 101 mixed in.

  I've read and enjoyed on the "Defining Works" section of this subreddit's wiki, except for Luminosity/Radiance, Animorphs: the Reckoning, and Pokemon: the Origin of Species. These are all based on source material that I don't know much about.

  How necessary is familiarity with the source material for enjoying these?
  ```

  - u/Noumero:
    ```
    ~None for *Luminosity* and *Origin of Species*. Didn't read *Animorphs: the Reckoning*, but I expect the same.

    I successfully read r!Animorphs after one skim of TVTropes for the source material. It never felt that I missed something during reading. If I hadn't read the TVTropes page, I would've also been fine but missed a few nods to canon. In short, no familiarity with the source material required.

    It's also one of my favorite books of all time.

  A few weeks back I posted about some [crossovers](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/13i96zf/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/jk9mehx/) I like. Since then I came across [*Taylor on the Edge of Forever*](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/taylor-on-the-edge-of-forever-worm-au-star-trek-au-x-over-alt-power-taylor.800090/) [Worm AU/Star Trek AU X-Over] [Alt-Power!Taylor] and quite like it.

  You don't need to be really knowledgeable about *Worm*, though it helps if you have some background knowledge.

  The story is pretty interesting. Basically Taylor triggers as a Tinker but also teleports into the Star Trek universe while she's in her coma. She joins up as an engineer in Starfleet before she's sent back, and decides to use her knowledge to improve EarthBet. While a lot of the story elements are the the same, the story itself diverges from cannon pretty early.

  Grammar/spelling is fine. I won't say there are none, but I can't remember any major typos or anything.
  ```

  - u/buckykat:
    ```
    This is interesting, but I'm feeling mildly bait-and-switched. I'm 29 chapters in and Taylor hasn't actually done anything with Trek technology yet. The divergences have been driven by putting Contessa on a bus and upgrading the general institutional competence and feasance of Earth Bet authorities.

    My issue with TotEoF is how slow the updates have been. When I was still following the thread, there would be such a gap between chapters that I more or less forgot about what was happening.

    For a similar story with an even more sporadic update schedule, you can check out [Scientia Weaponizes The Future](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/scientia-weaponizes-the-future.82203/). It feels like both authors had a similar premise, but one has an OC-scifi crossover and the other is a Trekkie.

    edit: I just reread Scientia, and man does it end on a cliffhanger. Scientia's got a bit of holier-than-thou in her, but still an enjoyable read. Story feels very near its conclusion. I hope the author finishes it.
