  >“I knew Winter well, before you fed on it,” Masego said, eyes burning with Summer flame, “shall I rip it out through the stitches of your belly? Ruin will run down the course of you into the heart of your entire people, little spiders. Did you believe you could make yourself the life of your kind without also being its death?”

  Well, that's really not good.
  ```

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    Yeah, with the weakness to sunlight, lack of awareness of patterns due to never having been Named and Night being powered by sacrifice, there’s way too many narrative traps awaiting Sve Noc on the surface.
    ```

      Well, that’s what they’ve got Cat for. They should really probably listen to her more.
      ```

    - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
      ```
      That's why it's a good thing they got Cat!
      ```

      ```
      Do we have many instances of them directly acting against her advice, they tend to listen when she gives the specific and pointed advice, such as not devouring the crown of twilight, they take her and her role seriously.
      ```

- u/JanusTheDoorman:
  ```
  Y'know the "pulling the strings of Creation" trope is pretty well worn, and usually when a character ascends to that tier it's mostly a question of them maintaining a grip on their motivation and sense of meaning. For Masego, though, it really is just about the knowing, and being able to help his friends and family is just a side benefit, so being *able* to make and unmake gods isn't really of any more consequence to him than creating the Observatory for Cat, or just... making his friends feel better by learning to be a better conversationalist.

  Kinda undersells the fact that he can fucking make and unmake gods. Jesus. People have gone off the megalomaniacal deep end with faaaaar less power.
  ```

  - u/signspace13:
    ```
    Yep, its what makes him such an interesting character, he ticks a bunch of the evil sorcerer boxes, but his name isn't inherently evil by definition. A *Heirophant* is usually a religious figure whose main purpose is to understand the Divine, its just that attempting to understand the Gods in the Guideverse is a particularly heretical thing, as they seem to want to keep to themselves.

    He isn't *Warlock* because he doesn't derive his power from external sources, the Hells in his father's case, though I'm pretty sure you could earn that name by sufficiently fucking with Arcadia.
    ```

- u/anenymouse:
  ```
  Masego still being the Heirophant makes sense when you keep in mind that his major goal was to gain the knowledge equivalent to a God and by doing so gain the ability to manipulate Creation. 

  I loved how he told the Crows off in such a blunt manner. It does kind of bring up the question of what a Bad aligned priest would be in the Practical-verse. Cause we've seen healing, forcefield planes, the ability to block scyring, and the summoning of an aspect a (G?)od by the wearing of a mask. And the abilitis of the Lanterns of Dominions i think. in less direct fashion we've seen that the prayers etched into plate defends against sorcery and the summoned ethereal war beasts. 

  And in contrast we've seen the Gods Below acting in response to sacrifice either the Warlock spending his own life to reflect the aforementioned aspect of a God, and the mother of White Knight spilling her own lifesblood to enact a curse. We've also seen Cat using power from the Crows but nothing like the institutions of the House of Light seem to exist for the Gods Below.
  ```

  - u/Daimon5hade:
    ```
    I mean, Cat *is* a bad aligned priest. Granted on average her Miracles are more applications of Night usually.
    ```

    - u/anenymouse:
      ```
      I meant more like a group of Bad priests within either Praes or any other Evil aligned nation. Yeah Cat is a priest, but she's more like The Evil Priestess rather than one of the many we've seen.
      ```

- u/narfanator:
  ```
  Hold up just a gosh darn minute, Masego said "_even_ the Dead King".

  That's not what you say when they're what you're thinking of. That's not even what you say when they're the _first_ thing you're thinking of.

  DK is the *warmup*.
  ```

  - u/sparr:
    ```
    pretty sure he has his sights set on the actual Gods, on both sides, at the very least
    ```

- u/boomfarmer:
  ```
  > “I believe,” Masego solemnly told me, “I might have become nettled by this affair.”
  >
  > “Well,” I smiled, thin and bladelike, “we’ve certainly started picked fights with lesser gods over less.”

  The dramatic understatement here is strong with these two. But why isnit hilarious?
