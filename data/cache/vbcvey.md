## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  First time on this subreddit. Can someone give me a Chinese style cultivation novel that follows this rationality?
  ```

  - u/Cosmogyre:
    ```
    **Ave Xia Rem Y** \- Stars a male protagonist living with his father who is a doctor, and slowly coming into the world cultivation as he learns more about his circumstances. 

    The protagonist doesn't make dumb mistakes, everything they do usually makes sense. You won't find an investigation of the nature of Qi, or events that you could've predicted yourself because you had all the information, but it's a largely coherent piece of work.

    **Arrogant Young Master Template A Variation 4** \- A guy gets transmigrated(his soul replaces that of another, gaining that person's body) to another world. He is very genre-savvy and realizes he's stuck in an Arrogant Young Master. Also he has a System, so this is a LitRPG too.

    The author states beforehand that he likes misunderstandings, so you'll find a lot of them in here. If you can view them as comedic(which they pretty much are, and they're not *too* overused), you'll be fine, otherwise you might be in for a tough ride. Outside of that, you'll find the MC to be pretty lucid in his thought processes, he makes mistakes but they are pretty realistic, and he correctly establishes a new management structure to his lackeys. Events become a bit crazy, he is mostly reactive and doesn't get to put himself into anything, but it plays well into the nature of the story.

    **Forty Millenniums of Cultivation** \- (Not actually caught up with this one, on Chapter 332) A young kid who lives in a scrapyard has the dream of becoming the greatest refiner in the world. Set in a modern(with ALL the necessary implications) cultivation society. 

    This is a classic cultivation story, it's not particularly rational, but it gains a lot of points for having a modern setup and deep worldbuilding that really fleshes out how cultivation affects the world. The MC is sometimes rational, but most of the time he is a normal Xianxia MC. Expect lots of training arcs. Also very long, I think the total chapter count is in the thousands.

    **The Cradle Series** \- A guy living in his small cultivation village gets introduced to the rest of the world. Notably, it's not exactly Xianxia, and it gives a distinct authored work vibe, as it's a published book series, planned as a book series.

    The MC is kinda rational, but overall still kind of loves training and sometimes seeks life-threatening encounters for no adequate reason. The world-building is pretty well done, fleshed out and the tiers on which people fight go up a lot higher than your typical cultivation story. The characters are pretty developed, not two-dimensional stereotypes. As a planned published work, I suspect that a lot of things naturally got improved, which is why it's quality is higher than equivalent fics online.

    40 Milleniums of cultivation is the usually given one, and it lives up to the hype. That said the first 100 chapters are basically a different, much worse fic that I advise skipping.

    Oh my god, earthlings are insane by the same author is a little worse but doesn't start out terrible.

    I enjoyed ze tian ji and Cultivation Chat Group but I don't think either is especially rational or rational-adjacent.

    Of cosmogyre's recs, Ave Xia Rem Y is good, YMTAV4 was fine but I don't think it's updating and was very different, and cradle wasn't terrible but I ended up bouncing off it.

  I recently read [Royal Flush](https://archiveofourown.org/works/39240864/chapters/98186766), a Game of Thrones fic. The part I enjoyed the most was the switches between the PoV of the Starks and Lannisters. Each time you get a feel for how the viewpoint character's position is untenable, up until some clever intrigue allows them to turn the tables, and then the narrative switches perspective back to their opponent who's now the one in a bad position. As those tricks compound, they end up with an outcome that neither side had planned on.

  Any recommendations for stories with a similar back-and-forth of twists and ideas? I also enjoyed Death Note, for instance.

    It sounds like a story that relies heavily on suspense and plans within plans, so I think you might like these: 

    *Player of Games* by Ian M Banks 

    *The Traitor Baru Cormorant* by Seth Dickinson.

    *The Lies of Locke Lamora* by Scott Lynch (It's been a while since I read this but I think it matches up with your description).

    The founder of AO3 wrote a multichapter GoT fic? I can tell it's gonna be good before I even start.

    Edit: It's very good. Suggestion for the OP if they haven't already seen it: The first three series of the TV show Arrested Development.

    The [gambit pileup](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup) page on TV tropes is similar to this.
    ```

  - u/Rhamni:
    ```
    Possibly you might enjoy the manga *Liar Game*, somewhat similar to the currently airing Tomodachi Game, but complete and with more back and forth. Most of the time it's the main character pair and their team who are in trouble until they find a clever trick to turn the tables and proceed to the next round, but every now and then they get their clever plan thwarted by an enemy genius, and things get messy.
    ```

  - u/ProfessorPhi:
    ```
    The back and forth reminds me of the Prestige, a Chris Nolan movie that alternates between two rival magicians.
    ```

  - u/acinonys:
    ```
    The author is astolat. She is a co-founder of ao3 and an accomplished author, who won a lot of awards including the Nebula, Locus and British Fantasy awards and received several Hugo nominations.
    ```

    - u/WhispersOfSeaSpiders:
      ```
      What's the author name under which she won those awards? I looked at her AO3 page and found this [profile](https://fanlore.org/wiki/Astolat) but no mention of the above awards.

      Unless you meant for the AO3 site itself.
      ```

      - u/Restinan:
        ```
        astolat has in the past asked for the connection to her public identity not to be posted on public forums. I don't know if she's changed her mind since, but absent learning so I'd be inclined to respect her privacy.
        ```

      - u/acinonys:
        ```
        She does not want her real name to be posted in public forums together with her fanfic pseudonym to keep her professional identity somewhat separated from her fanfic identity and I want to respect her wish.

        It’s a bit like the situation with Scott Alexander before he got outed by the nytimes.

        With a bit of effort, it can be found out though. I sent you a pm with her name.
        ```

  Any good Self-Inserts fanfic recommendations? I've read a few, some good, some bad, some terrible (these last ones then to make the SI basically invincible or give them a nearly 100% success rate). Some I've enjoyed:

  [A Sith? During The Fall](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/51925/a-sith-during-the-fall) by Dondokin (Star Wars)

  - u/lo4952:
    ```
    [Non-Playable](https://archiveofourown.org/works/20351053/chapters/48256216) is a Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines SI. Main character pops in as a background NPC, quickly realizes they are in far, far over their head.

    [Walk Two Lifetimes](https://archiveofourown.org/works/5345492/chapters/12358616) is a pre-canon Bleach SI set in the downtrodden outskirts of Soul Society. Starts off falling into a bit of the SI trap, but rapidly improves into one of my favorite Bleach fanfics out there (not a high bar, I know, but still).

    [Psychopomp](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/psychopomp-bleach-si.747151/) is another pre-canon Bleach SI, this time as a Hollow in Hueco Mundo. By the time the story starts the MC has been around for so long that most of their self has been washed away by the endless sand, leaving a character that truly feels like a part of the world, not just an interloper gawking around.

    [The Calculator](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11221623/chapters/25072989) is a DC insert into, well, the Calculator. Aside from being a solid fic, I have to give this one props for having the absolute best transition between one universe and the next. There's no masturbatory "WoW ROB hOw cOuLd YoU dO tHIs?!?", and yet it's not just brushed over either. The MC's reactions feel incredibly realistic.

    [Wolfswood](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/wolfswood-dark-souls-si-sif.827893/) is one that I haven't actually read, merely had recommended by people I trust. Dark Souls SI into Sif. Could be rather neat?

    [Dragonspawn](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dragonspawn-my-hero-academia-si.696280/) is a My Hero Academia SI/OC (more OC, really) that deals heavily with quirks that cause physical changes, and dives heavily into parts of the setting that barely anyone else touches (aka anything but that goddamn school)

    [Sea Shells](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/sea-shells-kancolle-from-the-depths-si.952156/) is a KanColle fanfic of all things, something I never thought I'd like. Pretty heavy on dicking around and shipbuilding, as well as good ol blowing stuff up, if you're into that kinda stuff.

    [Witch](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/witch-mtg-multicross.24503/) is a Witcher 3 / MTG / Dark Souls multicross. I went into this only knowing Witcher lore, and was very entertained, but definitely a little... confused. Still, very fun.



    For whatever reason Naruto has an astonishingly high proportion of decent-to-good SI fanfics. No idea why, but here are a few I've read:

    [Sanitize](https://archiveofourown.org/works/20721824/chapters/49228244) is head and shoulders above the rest. Set pre-canon during the Warring States period, the MC is a not a ninja but instead an apothecary / medic, using modern knowledge to try and keep people alive with an extraordinarily limited tech base.

    [Dreaming of Sunshine](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7347955/1/Dreaming-of-Sunshine) is kind of like, *the* Naruto SI. I wouldn't call it literally the best thing ever, but I mean, it's popular for a reason. If nothing else, worth giving a shot.

    [Catch Your Breath](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9509154/1/Catch-Your-Breath) is another Naruto SI, inspired by Dreaming of Sunshine (this becomes a theme if you keep looking for Naruto SIs.) Don't have that much to say about it, but again, if you like SI and you like Naruto, probably worth trying.

    [Orochimama](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13631456/1/Orochimama) is a meme. It should not be as good as it is. Sultry lady replaces Orochimaru. 

    Anyways I've got way too many of these, all good enough to warrant at least attempting, so if any in particular strike your fancy lemme know and I'll try to dredge up something similar.
    ```

    - u/Nnaelo:
      ```
      I keep seeing Dreaming of Sunshine get recommended, but I cannot for the life of me get past the 10 first chapters. It's an anxiety inducing slog. 

      Adding to the Naruto SI list, [*Plasticity*](https://archiveofourown.org/works/16017161/chapters/37377839) is a fun one.
      ```

      - u/Dufaer:
        ```
        I de-rec *Plasticity*.

        The protagonist is a doormat with no agency and no will to gain any. She starts as a prisoner of an insane villain and then changes hands to become a prisoner of another insane villain and then it happens again and she plots exactly *nothing* to get out of this weird cycle. (And that was the state of the story, when I read it a few years ago.)

        I second the de-rec of *Dreaming of Sunshine*.

        While I think that it is absolutely OK to read on a moment-to-moment basis, the author absolutely blew her leg off by not only insisting on religiously adhering to the stations of canon (supremely boring) but also deciding to adhere to the stations of filler (actually insane). Then she proceeded to drop the whole thing in the middle of the filler rehash (frankly totally understandable).
        ```

        - u/lo4952:
          ```
          If you want to read something that starts off with the MC as a prisoner of an insane villain, and is actually good and avoids all the stations of canon, check out [Dirt and Ashes, or: The One-and-a-Half Body Problem](https://archiveofourown.org/works/4012402/chapters/9015190). Sakura joins up with Hidan after they are both captured by Orochimaru. Content Warning for some pretty dark violence / torture early on.
          ```

        - u/chiruochiba:
          ```
          >She starts as a prisoner of an insane villain and then changes hands to become a prisoner of another insane villain and then it happens again and she plots exactly nothing to get out of this weird cycle.

          Actually she plots to escape and nearly succeeds 3 times purely based on her quick thinking and talent for improv. The problem is that she's a normie trapped in a world of nearly unstoppable demigods (S-rank ninja). She's thoroughly outclassed in raw power, speed, tracking ability, and casual mind control, so there's not much a bog standard human in her shoes can realistically do other than malicious compliance. After a certain point, learned helplessness is a realistic outcome for a person trapped in that situation.

          I enjoy that realism in the fic. I like that it's *not* a power trip the way most other SI fics are. But to each their own.
          ```

          - u/Dufaer:
            ```
            IIRC (it has been a while):

            She tries to escape when the opportunity presents itself, but never takes any steps to create such an opportunity, or prepare for it. Even when she becomes valuable (when she has gained Orochimaru's knowledge that Akatsuki values) she never uses this to negotiate anything, not even protection from Akatsuki's volatile members who periodically threaten to murder her. And her compliance never becomes malicious.

            I agree that this might be realistic. But it is not really something I care to read about.
            ```

            - u/chiruochiba:
              ```
              She actually does take steps to prepare in advance: She learns as much as she can about sealing, explores the areas as much as she can without being punished, finds out where supplies are kept, reveals just enough of her knowledge to ingratiate herself with people in power, frequently tests the limits of what she can get away with, etc.

              As for the malicious compliance: she almost constantly tests her captors by doing things that are annoying/cumbersome but not quite bad enough to provoke punishment. Sometimes this backfires and she bears the consequences.

          That's exactly right. I've read a couple more chapters because I really want to find some decent naruto fic, but this felt more like a transcript of canon with slightly altered outcomes.
          ```

          - u/chiruochiba:
            ```
            Dreaming of Sunshine doesn't start really diverging from canon until after the Chunin Exams arc, which is around chapter 30 or so. In my experience the story starts to get really fascinating after the Land of Tea Arc, circa chapter 58. I don't blame anyone for finding the early part of the fic boring; 58 chapters is a lot to slog through. To me the last half was worth it, but mileage may vary.
            ```

      - u/Nivirce:
        ```
        It's Hit or Miss. I think that, perhaps, because it was so big in the Naruto fandom, and because the Naruto fandom itself is so big (and was even bigger when compared to other fandoms when the manga was still running) that it ended up influencing a lot of the stories that came afterwards, so now looking back it looks bland because everyone else uses the same tropes.

        I thought it was pretty good when I read it, but it was also the first SI fic I've read **ever**, and I have absolutely no intentions of going back and read it again. I imagine, someone who's already read a few SI fics and gottem used to its tropes might find it to be way more boring.
        ```

        - u/chiruochiba:
          ```
          Opinions vary. I had read a ton of SI fics before Dreaming of Sunshine, so I'd seen all of the most common tropes. I found the first 20 or so chapters skippable, but I loved the later parts of the fic so much that I frequently go back and reread it.
          ```

          - u/Nick_named_Nick:
            ```
            Can you talk about what specifically was interesting (assuming the rest of the fic follows canon and filler arcs closely) or worth it about the end? What is missed by skipping the first 58 chapters to get to the hood shit? Spoilers don’t bother me but you can tag it if you want for others
            ```

            - u/chiruochiba:
              ```
              To me the most interesting part was to see how the characters develop into slightly different people and grow with the SI's mark on their lives. ~50 chapters is the point where the fic reaches a turning point and the  life paths of the main characters become irrevocably different from canon.

              The divergence from canon starts out tiny but grows to be huge to the extent that Konoha is embroiled in a quasi-war with a rival village long before the "Fourth Shinobi War" was supposed to happen in canon. The later part of the fic also seems to have a more mature focus on things like: politics, intelligence gathering, manipulation, economic sabotage, alliance building, the burden of leadership,  etc. The stakes in the missions are high and the fights are imaginative and exciting. 

              Also, the SI has a pessimistic view of herself that is sometimes quite different from the way others view her. I'm always entertained by the unreliable narrator perspective in which Shikako doesn't think of herself as special or grasp the impact she has on the people around her.

              Edit:

              As for what you miss by skipping the early part of the fic... A few people live that died in canon, which turns out to be hugely important later. You also miss seeing the evolving relationships between friends, teammates, family, allies, etc. You miss seeing the highs and lows of the SI's personal growth, both in strength and self confidence.

There's very little faffing about with the ROB thing, and the SI's characterization felt quite a lot better than a lot of SI stories I have read. Also he never really gets a super busted powerup, so all the plans depend on mostly luck and planning. The characterization of other characters also felt good, and it's completed.

  I've been working on a fanfiction story called [STEM](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/14075658/1/STEM). It's a crossover between RWBY and upgrade(2018), a somewhat unknown but fascinating cyberpunk horror film. I've read and enjoyed many of the stories discussed here, so I believe STEM will fit right in as a rational-adjacent progression fantasy, focused on worldbuilding and transhumanism technology. It starts off a little generic (as Jaune-centric stories usually do) but gets crazy pretty quickly.

  Although the story is still in its early stages, I think there is enough content to warrant a recommendation. If you're interested, take a look and feel free to share your thoughts.

    Good style and grammar and very interesting concept. I read 3 out of 6 chapters and nothing has happened yet so I'll check it again when there's more. Pacing seemed a bit slow.

      Chapter 4 is where things start to pick up. I'd say that thematically, what's posted so far serve as a mini-arc that introduces the characters and conflict, so it's probably better to read the first six chapters before bookmarking the story and forgetting about it for a month or two. (Which is why I figured now would be a good time to recommend the story.)  I completely understand preferring to wait for a substantial amount of content before diving into a story though.

  [Hawkin the Woodsman Brewer](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37209/hawkin-the-woodsman-brewer) seems like it would be a lot of people's jam - a litRPG adventurer decides to stop adventuring, turn off his system notifications and go live in the woods by himself. That life is interrupted by some _really good_ beer, and he decides to start brewing - as long as the system quests don't require leaving the woods.

    I always seem to be in the minority on this sub about liking sequels and endings more than the average/etc, so take that as a disclaimer for the below. 

    The second book is solid and the third book takes a kind of poetic/philosophical turn but is nonetheless very interesting/cool and I found some sequences really, really moving/beautiful. 

    My memory is a bit rough but there was also a concept introduced that was, not "magic" but kind of magic in that one of the characters was like 'ah yeah physics as we know it isn't correct', and was plot relevant. It came and out of left field for a lot of people and towards the very end of the trilogy and I think it's what made people the angriest. I saw the justification but I didn't particularly like it.

    They lose the POV of Face, and I think that's what killed it for most people on this sub, because what they enjoyed was seeing Face manipulate the world into her ideal. Harms rightly said that you can't have a viewpoint book of a bootstrapped AI because that is an impossible perspective to write from. 

    So basically, if you care about the *story*, I think you'll be fine to continue reading. If you care about *Face optimising the world* then you might be disappointed.

  This isn't a fiction recommendation (it's nonfiction journalism), but I think it's an extremely fascinating listen and gave me lots of food for thought. In particular, the journalist exemplifies many of what I'd call rational characterists. 

  It's the limited series 4-part podcast:

  *My Year in MENSA* by Jamie Loftus

  Basically, it's about a journalist who wants to take an inside look at the high-IQ society MENSA, so she tests in and immediately gets swamped in drama (and death threats). It's a bit zany (the sound effects threw me at first) but it's one of the most human things I've listened to in a while and how genuine and the open-mindedness and honesty of Jamie are a breath of fresh air.

  - Are fiction
  - Have reasonably smart protagonists
  - If they are a LitRPG, they must have minimal "system" as this is physically painful to listen to when read by a narrator
  - Have a protagonist that's not be a cis-white-male nerd or everyman (aka no typical Isekai protagonists please)

    I'm not a big audiobook fan myself, but I know people that are, and from them I've heard *Muderbot Diaries* is quite good. A sci-fi story about a sapient AI security bot that would rather spend its time watching soap operas.

    *Legends and Lattes* is apparently also supposed to be excellent. Written by Travis Baldree, who's done a ton of narration work, so it's almost guaranteed to avoid the crunchyness. A more traditional high-fantasy story about a retired Orc adventurer setting up a coffee shop.

    If you’re okay with story podcasts, here are a few I’ve listened to:

    The Magnus Archives- reasonably smart protagonist, who is asexual, but that doesn’t come up in the story often. The show is about people who work at a research institute that collects “ghost stories”, and the episodes are fairly short, between 10-40 min, but usually closer to 25 minutes on average. 

    The Storage Papers- I wouldn’t call this protagonist smart, but he is organized. Unfortunately he is a cis-white-male, so that may be a turn off for you. Similar to The Magnus Archives, but focused on one character looking at papers that describe supernatural incidents. 

    The Hyacinth Disaster- Hard Sci-fi, about a group of miners surveying an asteroid to try and get money to save their friends. The ensemble cast has some pretty smart people, but again the protagonist is cis-white-male. 


    I’m in the same boat as you, looking for something to listen to while I drive. I wouldn’t call any of these options rational, but they might be something you might like, plus none of them are that standard LitRPG fantasy isekai that plagues webfiction.

    I’m a huge fan of Re: Trailer Trash. It’s from the perspective of a poor girl imbued with her future self’s memories trying to figure out who she is. The time travel bit factors in surprisingly little  - it’s really about her friendships, overcoming adversity, and self discovery. It’s extremely rational in the sense that all the characters feel real (I would say rational, but teenagers and people in tough situations don’t always make rational choices). Despite the time travel premise, it’s not rationalist. My only complaint is that it only updates once a month.

    Discworld just got new [audiobook releases](https://www.terrypratchettbooks.com/discworld-audio-announcement/)!!! if you're already familiar with them they can be a great popcorn comfort listen. Protagonists vary wildly by which subseries ( The new recordings are pretty good!... but they have really annoying footnote chimes and Nighy reallllly phones it in)

    If you've not already read [Cradle](https://www.audible.com/pd/Unsouled-Audiobook/B07XTNWRFF?qid=1655176394&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=6BQC481ECMQP336SPJ3Z), Travis Baldtree is a great narrator for them and it fits your requirements except the last, although the female leads do get just as much character development. Will's [Traveler's Gate](https://www.audible.com/pd/House-of-Blades-Audiobook/B0B29L7HZ8?qid=1655176377&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=218Y7778H25E8DP2HCP8) series is also free on Audible right now. 

    As mentioned by another commenter, Travis Baldtree has his own book, [Legends and Lattes](https://www.audible.com/pd/Legends-and-Lattes-Audiobook/B09TBKH85L?qid=1655176345&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=APSTB44SNNKX2V43R09P), thats become the Cozy Fantasy poster child. Its good, its sweet, its queer as heck. Its anti-action though, so maybe not best for a run, depending on if you want to be pumped up. 

    Man, are some of the characters in this are dumb, and one is an annoying Gary Stue, but the *[Superpowereds](https://www.audible.com/pd/Super-Powereds-Year-1-Audiobook/B01FEAXNKO?ref=a_series_Su_c5_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=284b47b1-a5db-4711-9667-612f2ac7458e&pf_rd_r=FE8J736RKV55WMZZB973)* series are fantastic audiobooks especially for low stakes popcorn listening. One line pitch: school for superheros a la Skyhigh/MHA. They're fun, silly, relatively low stakes with entertaining enough tournament arcs. The author has another (unrelated) series about supervillans but I personally found the narrator for those harder to listen to for long periods of time. 

    Aside from the mainseries, there's a spinoff novel [Corpies](https://www.audible.com/pd/Corpies-Audiobook/B01G11ZFYC) that follows the Dad of one of the students in the main series after his hero career ended in a media scandal about his sexuality. Its really wonderful and so much better than the main series. Kyle McCarley (the narrator) knocks all of these out of the park with 20+ distinct character voices without any of them being too grating.. he just speaks slow so crank it up to 1.2x.  

    Andrew Rowe's *[How to Defeat a Demon King in Ten Easy Steps](https://www.audible.com/pd/How-to-Defeat-a-Demon-King-in-Ten-Easy-Steps-Audiobook/B086R2N27Y)* was trashy and had forced videogame references, but it was still a fun short listen. It's got the same narrator as Skyward. 

    These might require more attention than you can give on an intense jog but they're got simple plots, smart protags, short, easy to pick up, and never fail make me feel things, the *[Wayward Children](https://www.audible.com/pd/Every-Heart-a-Doorway-Audiobook/B0161TMJ5C)* series. Basically, have you read [Epilogue](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21374/epilogue)? Its that but with younger children. If you haven't, please stop and go do that. 

    I've only read and not listened to them but I'd imagine the *[Cinnamon Bun by RavensDagger](https://www.audible.com/pd/Cinnamon-Bun-Audiobook/1774247828?qid=1655176444&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=P496HWEM0T3A2S8Y1P9Y)* audiobooks are alright? He tends to lean off the system but I don't know how grating it is to listen to in the beginning.


    For story-based podcasts, the three listens that stood out for me are:

    -	[Alice isn’t Dead](https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/alice-isnt-dead-2740) - A Truck Driver searching for her missing wife encounters supernatural things on the road across America

    -	[The Bright Sessions](https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/the-bright-sessions-17881) - Recordings from a therapist that helps people with uncontrolled superpowers. If you’ve read Worm, it kind of scratches the itch of wanting a Jessica Yamada fic that’s not as depressing as Ward, although Joan is less-competent. 

    -	[The Magnus Archives](https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/the-magnus-archives-107565) - Archivist for a Warehouse 13-esque institute is organizing and retaping files about paranormal happenings. Sometimes things happen to him too. Since its a frame story the protagonists of each sub-story being told vary.

      Its got slow development. However slow you're thinking, imagine a quarter of the pace. I mean its no Brockton's Celestial Forge, but wow can it be close sometimes. This means the audiobook feels even slower, which is great for not missing things on a run or doing busy work. 
      The characters are emotional & make poor decisions, the intelligent villains pull their punches, theres no minmaxing to be seen, protagonists will avoid using their best skills, and plot points take millions of words to cycle back around. The first book has weak writing (its actually being rewritten as of yesterday!) 
      But if you ever find yourself looking for slice-of-life fantasy (...or long audiobooks) there's really nothing quite like it. Its in a class of its own. It has some triumphant highs.

      - Discworld. Chefs kiss. Pratchett is love, Pratchett is life. 

      - Cradle. Listened to the first 3 ish books before the china-density got too high for me. Not badly written, but it's what solidified my stance on Xanxia/cultivator stories and why I don't like them. 

      - How to defeat demon lord. An amusing short listen. The other stuff Rowe has written is good too (Sufficiently Advanced magic) 

      - Epilogue: Gooood stuff. Also liked the cyberpunk sniper story by the same author. Double satisfying that it's a complete and whole story on RR which is a rarity. 

      - Ravensdagger. I have a mixed relationship with their work. Generally, I feel they have solid starts and a prolific pace but too many of their works devolve into "cuteness" (fawning over how cute the female protagonist is) and shipping which is a major turn off for me. Also, there's a weird trend of nonconsensual body modification that crops up across their different books with an uncomfortable frequency.

And it ... mostly (kind of?) kept me entertained while I was walking the dog. It's 8 episodes I think.  


    And I know Batman is traditionally cis-white-male, but in this he's voice acted by a Black guy, which was probably the main reason I stuck around. Didn't love it, but it'll kill a couple hours across all the episodes.

      Unlike most of the replies here, IMO yes, it absolutely is equivalent... and neither request is an immoral one to make. Discrimination, no matter the context, is bad, but having tastes for characters in fiction isn't Discrimination.

      But ignoring the moral question, as the other replies mentioned, the majority of Fiction do not star minorities (for obvious amoral reasons) so you wouldn't find much need to actually ask for recs without the minority you don't want to read about for whatever reason, so someone who does will come off as purposefully wanting to make a scene (and is probably more likely to have such intentions).

      TLDR: They are morally equivalent and amoral but due to cultural context the motivation behind one is likely quite different to the motivation behind the other.

      One of the reasons I read fiction is to gather viewpoints and experiences that I would never be able to experience in real life. I believe this broadens my ability to think rationally and allows me to understand and solve problems. 

      As a cis-white-male, I will realistically never experience what it's like to eg. grow up as a woman. 

      There's a big difference between this and asking for stories with eg. no POC or no gay people.

        While I agree with your point for the most part. Most fiction is written by cis white males, so even if the character is not from said demographic the author likely has no more experience at it than you would, which kind of defeats the point.

        &#x200B;

        It feels a bit like a meme to me sometimes, people rec books with female mcs written by males, and claim it somehow shows a different perspective. Often times the female mc is also a lesbian or asexual which means the author is taking away the most different and interesting part of that pov away, because it's easier to write it.

          [Citation Needed] on that. Maybe if you limit it to specific genres eg "Military Scifi" or "RR SI Harem Power Fantasy" I'd agree, but if looking at "fiction" as a whole, the [gender split is rather close to 50/50](https://pudding.cool/2017/06/best-sellers/).

            Sure, most fiction recced here, and that people here enjoy is written by cis white males. From what I hear most fiction sales are actually romance and most authors and readers there tend to be female.

            &#x200B;

            You get my point with that comment though.. 

            &#x200B;

            I was actually writing a comment talking about how romance has much better racial representation on MCs, and better written female mcs, written by female authors. You should give it a shot if you want to experience different perspectives.

            &#x200B;

            It's quite decent, at least the ones I've read for research. It's basically power fantasy for a female audience. Same as our generic fantasy stories tend to be.

      No, these are not equivalent. I can see how it might seem that way at first glance, but if you consider the landscape of fiction (and especially web fiction on RR), there's very much a 'default' and empowered position, so asking for exceptions to that like this reasonable (and reasonably likely to be hard to find and require specific recommendations), while the alternative is simply excluding less privileged viewpoints. Other people could probably explain it better, but hopefully that helps a bit.

        I think your argument is a logical pretzel that goes nowhere but itself, but I won't argue it further.

        ```

    - u/Flashbunny:
      ```
      Because fiction in general is oversaturated with cis white male protagonists (and LitRPGS even moreso), so looking for something else comes across as looking for some variety instead of an active dislike for the group.

      They're also just not in any way shape or form a marginalised group in the West, so the likelihood that someone is asking because they hate them seems ridiculous. Whilst saying "I hate cis white men" would still be a shitty thing to say and fair game for mockery/revilement, there's a higher standard of evidence for whether something possibly exclusionary is said with bad intentions, because of how unlikely it is.

      If either of these things weren't true it would probably be a pretty sketchy request, but they are.

      Let's re-frame the question then:

      The requester would like to read a body of good-quality fiction which contains a representative distribution of different ethnicities, cultural contexts, and sexual orientations.

      You do understand that white protagonists are disproportionately represented in fiction due to the advantages of their white authors, right? That means that the filters that are applied to fiction before we even get to make a choice already penalize anybody that's not a white author by default, resulting in way to many of those cis-white-male-nerd protagonists. I mean, I am a CIS-white-male-nerd, and it's pretty fucking obvious to me.

        Two questions for you. First, by what mechanism do these filters identify white authors? I don't know the ethnicity of any web novel authors that I read, and I'm unsure of how RoyalRoad's sorting algorithm would reliably identify the melanin levels of nobody103 based solely on their postings, let alone the same filtering applying to every website across the entire world. Secondarily, how do you even define "white"? The popular conception of the term doesn't include Iranians despite them generally being paler than Sicilians, who *are* considered white. If it's referring to Europeans, then that excludes places like New Zealand which likely isn't intended, and if you expand the definition to include European colonies or European-influenced nations then that would include places like India, and I've never seen someone label India as a "white" nation. It's a vague term which refers to a different group of people every time it's used, most outrageously showcased in the case of a Washington school which reclassified Asians as "white" a couple of years back. 

        If there's a system which can consistently identify and suppress non-white authors before *any* readers even see the story, then this system must also be able to define whiteness with much greater accuracy than I can, which admittedly isn't saying that much as I'm phenomenally bad at identifying people in general.

          Well duh royalroad’s not directly discriminating against author skin color. The point is that there’s lots of fiction of type X out there and sometimes you want to try something different. It’s just a plain fact that the vast majority of protagonists in rationalist stories, fanfic, or on Royalroad are white and a majority of those are cis-male. Unless you restrict to sub genres like Wuxia/Xianxia where everyone is Chinese or Isekai where there’s lots of Japense characters. 

          The more complicated question of why this is the case seems a bit more speculative. The first obvious answer is population - among (mostly American) English speaking internet users, most are white. The second answer is network effects and feedback loops - more people are white males and people like reading characters they identify with, so stories with white males become more popular. White males are more likely to use the site or appreciate the genre as readers and writers which then exacerbates the problem. 

          There’s also the perception that this is the case which makes writers want to appeal to their audience which means they’re more likely to write white mc’s to appeal to the audience and not detract from the rest of the story (which I don’t personally agree with, but I’ve heard it used as justification).

          Simply that authors write characters they identify with, and then people with good internet access, literacy, and spare time enjoy reading about characters THEY identify with. Do you need a Venn diagram drawn for you?

          > Secondarily, how do you even define "white"? 

          I didn't, actually. That's something that the authors and readers do when they're reading, and more importantly, VOTING for fiction on RR, or any other platform.

          I mean... are you being disingenuous? Maybe the requester just wants to read something that's not yet another Harry Potter/Isekai Weeb/whatever white dude story to balance things out a bit? This is hardly new ground academically. It's so well understood that there's a TV tropes page on it: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMaleLead
