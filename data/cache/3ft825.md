## Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria, an interesting take on wish granting that explores the horrifying consequences of poorly thought out wishes.

  I've read the first volume so far; in the middle of the second one, and I have to say this is an exceedingly interesting story. The consequences of wishes are kind of a theme, but the stories aren't about that at all. Rather, it's supernatural mystery, with a majority of the content actually being about OPSEC and information warfare. There is a point in the first book where the situation is described as an information imbalance, and the protagonist's path is set to rectify the imbalance.

  It's a fan translation. The one I've been reading is only okay, but I'm more resilient than most to bad translations, reading manga online and all. I would very much love an official English translation, as the first volume's story was quite disjointed and disorienting, and I wasn't sure how much of it was the translation.

  The first volume is about a Groundhog Day whose participant isn't actually the instigator of the loop. Instead, she wants to end the loop, and she targets the protagonist as the instigator because the protagonist is the only one who remembers her real name, Maria, spoken to him in a loop before. Despite this, he is not the loop's instigator, and together they have to find out who, because really, it's an intolerable day on repeat. I found it quite reminiscent of Endless Eight, which was a great arc, by the way.

  The second volume is about the protagonist blacking out and being possessed by someone who wants to steal his identity slash ruin his life. I'm not sure why you would do both at once, but the minor antagonists don't seem particularly bright so far. This process begins with three hours or so in the middle of the night and will expand in duration and frequency until a week later, when they take over completely. So far the deuteragonist is playing spy with the protagonist, against the protagonist. Very interesting premise.

  Inevitable comparison to *Madoka Magica* pls?

  After reading time braid I am more forgiving of time loops, but in this instance i can't help feeling it is just not as good an execution...

  i will probably read till the end of the first volume anyway.
