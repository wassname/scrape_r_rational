  Hey all- brief update on the publishing schedule. Next week you will be getting *four* chapters, as we wrap up Arc 3. After that the story's going to go on a short break. I've got to finish moving, then take a few weeks to plot what will hopefully be the final arc and regain some momentum. I'm planning on a one month hiatus, in total.

  That's all for now. See you at the big finish!

  Are infomorphs what you get if you have too many memes going at once and evolving?
