  A copy of the agreement for reference (emphasis mine):

  >I will do everything in my power to rescue whatever civilians the Sound-nin named Hideo guides us to and ensure that they emerge safely from the firestorm as quickly as possible. I won't spend more than twenty-four hours on this taskâ€”I refuse to be trapped into being a permanent rescue team. During the period of this rescue effort **I will not deliberately harm any human who does not pose a clear and present danger to me or to you, with the understanding that 'danger' shall include imprisonment**, application of additional seals, and other non-physical harms, the precise list of which are at my discretion. I will also cause the minimum possible amount of property damage compliant with effecting the rescue. Once the rescue has been effected I will relinquish control of your body and return to your mindscape. In exchange for that rather paranoid list of strictures, you will grant me the following: control of your body for purpose of the rescue; **permission to permanently upgrade your body so as to improve your senses and boost your survivability**; permission to install my own bijuu senses; permanent access to your full sensorium. You understand that you won't have direct access to my bijuu senses since you lack the requisite brain structures.

  Some things to note, as the fox's jailer, Naruto is in no way protected by the first emphasized clause. The second emphasized clause allows the fox to install any "upgrade" as long as it also happens to improve Naruto's survivability, giving the fox permanent at will control of Naruto's body would certainly do that, also note that the contract only states that the fox will return the body at the end of the mission, it doesn't state he isn't allowed to take it back.

    Man, you guys are *so* suspicious!  Just because Kurama is a Primordial demon older than time with a penchant for killing people and breaking cities with several billion years of learning how to outsmart others, you feel the need to question his integrity and the sincerity of his friendship.  

    *rueful headshake*

    Boy, he would be so offended.

      Oh, I'm not questioning Kurama's integrity or the sincerity of his friendship (why do biju have gender btw?). I'm just pointing out that Kurama has many interesting ways to help his friends.

        Because 'it' is a pejorative among humans; it implies 'lesser'.  Choosing a gender is an important part of interacting with humans.

          well "they" is perfectly acceptable as a gender neutral alternative to "it" that isnt as offensive

          he probably chose to be male because males are generally viewed as more powerful socially as well as an animalistic alpha male type thing

          ```
          The perspective is an ensemble of Anko's team, from what I can recall, and applying a model like the Hero's Journey isn't enough to say for certain because all of them fit.

          Skimming the first chapter, after the introductory scene with the Hokage you have third-person omniscient. Second chapter, similar. Perspectives are definitely an ensemble, blended even within scenes (I've heard that third-person omniscient i.e. multiple characters is hard to do well, so good job).

          I can't say for certain that there even is a main protagonist. At the very least, even if Naruto is the main character (which I don't feel is supported by the text, though you may intend it to be), there are three perfectly functional understudies once the Fox melts his brain.

            No, you got it -- it's an ensemble cast with three main characters (the genin) and a supporting cast (Anko, Orochimaru, Kurama).

            > there are three perfectly functional understudies once the Fox melts his brain.

            *laugh* You guys are so convinced that the Fox is going to mess him up.  What can't he just be a *friendly* giant superpowered Primordial imprisoned demon monster who intends only to help?

    Keep in mind that it says it is going to not deliberately harm blah blah blah only /during the rescue attempt/ and that it will give back control /once the rescue has been effected/ but if it so happens that the rescue is impossible within 24 hours (for example due to the fact that even one of the civilians is killed by the firestorm before they get there) then the rescue will never be effected and therefore the fox never has to return control, plus after 24 hours it can do anything it wants.

    Also the fox does not have to protect Hideo in order for it to be possible for him to lead it to civilians to rescue.
    ```

    - u/WarningInsanityBelow:
      ```
      >but if it so happens that the rescue is impossible within 24 hours (for example due to the fact that even one of the civilians is killed by the firestorm before they get there)

      The people to be rescued are only the people that Hideo guides Kurama to, and being hyper competent and bound to do everything within in his power I doubt that Kurama will actually fail to save anyone he is asked to save, so I doubt that this failure state can be entered.

      However this made me realize that there is a possibility where Hideo asks Kurama to save someone who would beyond help from anyone else and then Kurama is forced to do something truly spectacular to honor his agreement. Another amusing (and probably stupid) exploit, if Orochimaru guesses enough of the contract he can go into the fire and try to hold one of his civilians hostage, Kurama now has to grant him a wish in order to save the civilian  

      >Also the fox does not have to protect Hideo in order for it to be possible for him to lead it to civilians to rescue.

      True, but Kurama isn't allowed to deliberately harm him, and otherwise Hideo can probably look after himself.
      ```

      - u/Murska1FIN:
        ```
        If Hideo could survive in the firestorm, he wouldn't need Naruto to go rescue people.

        Anyway, there's no end state specified for the rescue attempt nor is it specified what it means for Hideo to guide Kurama to civilians, so the fox can just follow Hideo around for 24 hours and then head off to do whatever.

        Well, the point is that making a binding contract with someone who's smarter than you and is trying to subvert it will never work, so the only thing one should be focusing on is how to ensure that whomever you're making a deal with is trustworthy and well-inclined in the first place.
        ```

        - u/eaglejarl:
          ```
          The other thing that helps with contracts: negotiate by inclusion, not by exclusion. "You will do X and nothing else", not "you can't do Y or Z". Doing it that way makes it much easier.

  Big sigh of relief at the beginning of the chapter, but very uneasy feeling at the end, for two separate reasons:

  -The fox is clearly playing the role of the Devil. All smiles and correctly-worded contracts, but he'll have a lot of fun screwing you over. And how do we know that Bijuu keep their promises? We only have the Fox's word on it. 

  -I understand that you are spending less time on the chapters due to other constraints, but I worry that you are falling into a few 'bad fic' tropes, such as 'Kurama upgrading Naruto' and 'Kurama the Sensei'. These lead to the slippery path to a superpowered Naruto beating up everyone while being smarter and faster at the same time.

    Well of course bijuu always keep their promises -- Kurama said so and bijuu always keep their promises so it must be true.  Silly reader, pay attention!

        I'm flattered. I've always been fond of 'deals with the devil, contracts and loopholes' stories, and this was my chance to write one for Naruto.

        Of course, there's no need for Naruto to worry about this bargain.  After all, Kurama has already told us that he's honest.
        ```

        - u/krakonfour:
          ```
          Of course he has. 

          Meanwhile, I wonder, once they all get back to Konoha (or not) and go through debriefing... would the village chiefs not buy into Naruto's story that he and the fox get along with each other, and force/demand him to roll back all the changes. They might fear the fox influencing their jinchuuriki more thna they gain from a stronger Naruto. 

          Also, does no-one other than Jiraiya know anything about Naruto's seal? it looked that way in canon, but I'm hoping in your universe, it is slightly more common knowledge.
          ```

          - u/eaglejarl:
            ```
            In my world Jiraiya is the best seal-smith alive, just as Tsunade is the best medic and Orochimaru is the best psychotic Kage.  Other people know seals, though, and can make sense of Naruto's seal.  Maybe they won't understand it as well as Jiraiya, much like an undergrad math major won't understand Andrew Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem in the same degree as someone like Taylor.  Both of them can work with it, though.

              So in terms of raw combat potential, do you rate Orochimaru as one of the highest in your setting? Obviously he's one of the most survivable, as he implied he had phylacteries or horcruxes during the threat off with Shino's Skitter impression. (Shino/Skitter OTP? Make it happen internet.)

              The power creep got... pretty blatant by the end there in Canon, and Snake Boy basically became Raditz in the Cell Games when compared to [Super Sayan 3 Madara Uchiha.](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/madara-uchiha-copypasta)

                > So in terms of raw combat potential, do you rate Orochimaru as one of the highest in your setting? 

                I'd say so, yes. The other Kage, the other Sannin if they could choose the battlefield, an unsealed Bijuu...anything / anyone else I can think of offhand, he'd eat them for lunch.  (Legendary figures like the Sage and Kaguya aren't part of this setting.)

                Most of the reason he's so dangerous is because he's both skilled and versatile, so he can fight outside an opponent's envelope. When fighting Gai or Tsunade, he'd take it to range. When fighting a range specialist, he'd go melee. If he faced someone who was strong at both ranges he'd go underground and turn it into a stalking/ambush fight. 

                > The power creep got... pretty blatant by the end there in Canon,

                I actually know very little about canon (EDIT: canon's power levels). I gather by the end they were blowing up the moon and such?

Madara Uchiha was behind everything, except there were like three more sets of bosses behind him that he didn't even know about, both Naruto and Sasuke unlock the true eye dojutsu the Rinnegan somehow, and they punch out the anthropomorphic personification of the moon.

                  Or something.

                  On the plus side, Naruto finally gets together with Hinata. That's canon now.

  ```
  You know, _assuming_ that Kurama's being honest about his reasons for refusing to be bound by a "spirit of the oath" clause... There would appear to be a simple solution:

  Naruto could have Kurama agree to be bound by Kurama's best understanding of Naruto's present understanding of the spirit of the oath.

  This way one avoids the whole "accidentally broke spirit of the oath due to ambiguity/differences in understanding between the two" while still having some of the general protection of agreeing to be bound by the spirit of the oath. Further, specifying "present understanding" avoids potential loopholes like editing Naruto's mind or whatever.

    The thing is, if he's being honest then you don't really need the extra clause and, if he's not, then it's probably not going to work anyway.

  Is the thing about bijuu senses being incompatible with Naruto's mind true? I may just be paranoid, but:

  > You understand that you won't have direct access to my bijuu senses since you lack the requisite brain structures.

  *Understanding* that to be the case is not the same as it being the case. I'm not entirely sure why Kurama would want to be deceptive about that, so it's probably nothing.

  > 'danger' shall include imprisonment, application of additional seals, and other non-physical harms, the precise list of which are at my discretion.

  The list being unspecified is a potential loophole, and I wonder if "imprisonment" would include Orochimaru's imprisonment of Team Anko and thus give Kurama license to kick ass.

  There's also nothing that says Naruto's form after the remodelling would have to be similar to his old one, which would give Kurama a potential bargaining chip if Naruto ever wants to go back to looking like himself.

  > Alternatively, he could allow the fire to burn Naruto, again damaging and obscuring the seal. Would that actually work? A seal was a metaphysical thing as much as it was physical, an arrangement of chakra tethered to the real world by a design.

  Ha! How coincidental--[the most recent chapter of *Dreaming of Sunshine*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7347955/109) explicitly discussed this very topic:

  > Ah yes, seal metaphysics. The question that most people who asked wished they'd never thought to ask.

  > "A seal isn't *ink.* Once it's been activated, I mean. It's a pathway full of chakra that makes things happen. And chakra is... you can't just wash it away, right?"

  It's certainly an interesting avenue of investigation. [*Chunin Exam Day* has three-dimensional seals created by adding microscopic impurities to gemstones](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411/45):

  > Naruto had decided that he would draw his seals in three dimensions (which required inventing a whole new branch of the sealing art to accomplish, and thus by itself virtually ensured proper security) on the INSIDE of gemstones, using tiny fracture lines and flaws as his pen and ink.

  And *Time Braid*'s Sakura [even draws seals on the air itself](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/18) (though within her mindscape):

  > Seal masters normally work by drawing on paper with ink that contains their own blood and chakra, but it doesn't have to be done that way. The patterns and chakra are the important parts, and the rest is just a handy set of tools. My variation of Tsunade's secret seal was done entirely in chakra, drawn in the air with sheer chakra control. It wasn't easy, but I didn't see a good alternative.

  And, of course, there are the several seals that Sakura literally sings into being, just by speaking the divine language.

  So many beautiful ways to extend the same aspect of canon!

        ```
        The thing is, it's in his best interest to appear as a nice guy completely and truly until the one situation in which he can gain the maximum possible benefit arrives, at which point he mashes the 'defect' button.

        As this is clearly a temporary measure, it is entirely correct for Kurama to act 100% on point, prove his trustworthiness, and bide his time. Next time he gets a little more freedom, then a little more, then a little more.

        Kurama knows that more power means Naruto will start seeking (or being sought by) stronger foes. 

        This means an escalation. 

        He's old, he's seen it before. He can read the rhythm of the world. 

        So they escalate, and Naruto slips the leash just a bit more in exchange for what is conveniently jusssssst enough power to match it. 

        This happens over and over. 100% compliance, Kurama does exactly what he promises, he follows the spirit and the letter of every deal. Each time he gets more and more free and comfortable. 

        Maybe at one point he gets a shadow clone to drive around consciously. Maybe he sets some things in motion. Maybe the biggest threat shows up later, and the only way for Naruto to stop it, after he's expended all of his power, is for him to remove the seal entirely.

        After all, his good friend Kurama, who has helped him and kept his word for years and years, and always done the right thing, there's surely no problem with letting him out, right?

        A few decades are nothing to a billion year old mind. Plans which take into account *continental drift* can slide through that intellect. 

        There is no reason to jump the gun. Patience is the ultimate virtue.

        Kurama's chance will come.

          So based on your comment, im going to guess that you don't feel as if this is Kurama's moment right here? You feel like he's going to buff Naruto to build up his credit, in preparation for a plan further down the line?

          Also, bit of a followup question. How can you possibly get one over on a mind this old? And i dont mean cheating with the Sharingan. I mean, from an intellectual standpoint, do you think its possible for you, a 70 something year old rationalist (at max) to outfox the Fox?

            For the record, in the Team Anko-verse, the Sharingan can*not* control a bijuu.  That was one of the biggest things that made me throw the coffee cup about canon, and I refuse to include it.

            [I think Danny Kaye settled this one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=796bHaAtlkE)

              I clicked it, expecting some sort of ted talk perhaps, but what i got was far less useful, but much more amusing. I wonder how right Danny Kaye is

  So, the bijuu has senses that Naruto does not, and he's been given the ability to remake his biological make-up *permanently*. At the very least he could, after the rescue, turn Naruto into a featureless fleshy sphere with all of his "upgraded" senses pointed internally, while maintaining his own sanity and safety through taking in the world around him with bijuu senses that he alone has access to. Then use that bargaining position to secure another deal with more favourable terms. A time-share agreement, for example.

  I have the distinct feeling Naruto got tricked, even though I'm not quite sure how. Oh wait, the seal counts as part of his body, and the Fox can modify his body to its whims at present.

  Oops!

    Thank you; fixed.

    > Oh wait, the seal counts as part of his body, and the Fox can modify his body to its whims at present.

    But only in ways that enhance Naruto's survivability, of course.

    EDIT:  Actually, the seal isn't part of his body, it's something drawn *on* his body.
