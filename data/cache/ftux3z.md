  This used to be updated here, but whomever did it stopped sometime around when I took a break.  I don’t think it’s gotten *less* rational in the intervening time, so I figured I’d share it myself as a reminder that I’m not dead.

    I really enjoyed this when I read it a while back, but caught up to your pre break stuff. Glad you're still working on it! As a binge reader I'll hold off longer but I do look forward to it. Thanks!

    Thanks for posting! I hadn't realized you'd started writing on this again.

      Yeah, I started Book Two a couple (Few?  Some?  Time is weird) months ago, and I've mostly been keeping up the "one a week" chapter schedule.

- u/Slinkinator:
  ```
  Yes!

  I thought you were still on break, thanks for the heads up

  Oh goddamnit. I think royalroad just informs me about the last chapter and not that there are multiple. I think I missed 94 completely.
