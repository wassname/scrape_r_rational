## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  R&D have announced their newest discovery: Antinertium. An object coated with a thin film of antinertium dodges the laws of conservation, as small fluctuations of forces applied to its outside through the coated areas are not transferred to the coated object. The material slowly normalises to its current external pressure (about 0.01 Pa/s, or 100 days to adjust from vacuum to 1 atm), and negates about 100 Pa of dynamic force. Going above its dynamic limit breaks the affected material permanently and immediately.

  The material is going to be expensive to produce, about $1M/mÂ², but you project this to slowly drop a factor of 10 or so over the next couple of decades before levelling out. The material is nontoxic, thin, otherwise durable and applicable to most materials.

  You have yet to announce this product to the world. What do you do with it? Who do you sell it to?

    Tensile and compressive strength are measured in *mega*pascals and the flimsiest thing I can find stats for is Styrofoam at ~1MPa compressive strength. So it's about ten thousand times as hardy as this coating. Please do not poke the Antinertium.
    ```

    - u/Veedrac:

      Yes, it's very fragile. Note though that [Styrofoam compresses far earlier than it breaks](https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/Compressive_strength_of_expanded_polystyrene_for_civil_engineering).

    Best of my ideas so far:

    * Extremely high quality IEMs, headphones and earmuffs.

    * Noise removal from scientific tools.

    * Ion-thruster alternative; you need to be able to modulate pressure to avoid it just adjusting to the current environment, but it should be self-sustaining since the energy required to compress/decompress a small amount of air isn't very high.

    So if you put a square centimetre platform of it on digital scales and then place up to 1 gram of weight on it, the scale won't notice the weight change, and 1.5 grams breaks that property?

  Alright, so I have an illusionary magical system in which the magic can be attached and delivered through a sensory medium (light/sound waves, gases, maybe heat). In order to break out of an illusion that is delivered by a constantly emitting sensory medium you have to first prevent it from reaching whatever sensory organ it is targeting, then do the necessary procedure for escaping the illusion. So for example, if it is a flute, you have to plug your ears first and keep them plugged. The problem here is if someone, or a group of someones, cast illusions delivered through light and sound waves, then the only way to escape the illusion is to render yourself deaf and blind which is ridiculous.


  So this is basically a reverse munchkinry question, there is an obviously overpowered exploitation and I need to find a way to limit it without gimping the entire branch of magic. If you see any other OP exploitations feel free to mention them too. I feel like this may be untenable.

    This sounds a lot like Genjutsu from Naruto. Which is fine, but the thing is, when you have magic that can interact with the brain indirectly, through a sense, well, I've always thought it could ONLY be extremely overpowered.

    Just make the person experience unbelievable pain. Enough pain can make someone unable to act. If you are unable to act, then you can just be killed or subdued by a second person.

    The only thing I can think of is for people to have automatic self defense systems, with some sort of trigger (falling down, rapid blinking, etc) that automatically casts a spell that turns off all of your senses and then turns them back on.

    But then you could counter that with a spell that is automatically set to just constantly emit a spell. 

    Maybe being a mage is so so so difficult because you have to internalize this self defense spell before you can ever deal with another mage.

    I dont know. Illusionary magic is really tough, in my opinion.

    Sound waves are overpowered because they can't be blocked without completely leaving the area. Loud enough sound can be felt through your body.

    But the gas transmission medium is interesting. If all illusion magic is gaseous, I can imagine people holding their breathe for a long time, and almost passing out, just to get a glimpse of reality before they take a deep breathe and fall back into the illusion. And if you know you are going to fight an illusionist, then you would want to wear bulky breathing equipment. If your setting is less technologically advanced, there could be superstitions about hanging pungeant stuff like onions around your neck to ward of the 'evil miasmas' of sorcerors.
    ```

    The risk is always that the illusionist's victim will realize they're being fooled and ignore the illusion one way or another.

    Based on the other post, I think you can make it work by adding a time component. Say it takes five seconds of sense delivery for the illusion to become absolutely believable, and it does so by degrees. It would also take five seconds of sense avoidance to undo it, again by degree. Plugging your ears for five seconds will render the flute bard's illusions completely obvious, and as soon as you unplug them you've got five seconds before they re-resolve. At that point you'll know what's fake and what's real. Similarly if you stop looking at a hypnotic light or stop inhaling a hallucinatory gas for even a few seconds their respective illusions dissipate from your mental frame.

    Shorter times make the illusion easier to break, but also easier to establish, favoring quick-thinking illusionists against ignorant opponents. Longer times make both harder, favoring prepared illusionists against unprepared opponents.
    ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    Option: Limit the spells to being delivered through a single sense at a time. Thus, you might have to deafen yourself *or* blind yourself to escape a given illusion, but not both at once.

    A canny opponent might be able to use one sound-based illusion and *at the same time* one sight-based illusion of the exact same thing - this can be broken out of by first closing your eyes (and escaping the sight-based illusion) and *then* opening your eyes but blocking your ears (and thus escaping the sound-based illusion) - then you never need to render yourself entirely insensate.

  So I found this

  https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/92aqj7/_/

  Essentially, you have the ability to pause time for 10 seconds, and thank and pause time 10 seconds after time is done being paused. How would you use this?
  ```

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    Please rephrase, I can't parse that.
    ```

    - u/1337_w0n:
      ```
      You can stop time for 10 subjective seconds when you wish.

      If you do so, you must wait 10 seconds before doing so again.
      ```

      - u/Gurkenglas:
        ```
        Can I move during this time? If so, what matter is left out? That which I have in my body? Carry? Touch and choose? I could try carrying a supercomputer and giving it double time.

        If I can only think during this time, asking an MRI to look at my brain would be interesting. I could benefit from this in sports, wherever split-second decisions are important. Rubick from Dota 2 comes to mind.
        ```
