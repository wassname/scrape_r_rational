    I actually know of a memetic hazard that is sometimes capable of producing small amounts of pain that would not have been felt otherwise. No joke! 

    If you want to know it I can PM it to people.
    ```

    - u/MugaSofer:
      ```
      Intriguing, I'll bite. Please PM me.

      ... we're *bad* at memetic hazards, aren't we?

      EDIT: turns out I already knew that, and have proved immune. Yay me!
      ```

        Very bad-- it looks like the only thing you'd need to do to kill the Bayesian Conspiracy is set up a roadside sign saying "Five basilisks, free to a good home" and wait for the calls to come in.
        ```

        - u/Chronophilia:

          I don't think we qualify as a conspiracy.

          Is there something that's the exact opposite of a conspiracy? Where you eagerly tell everyone you can about it?
          ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      Will you accept requests to PM it to people other than myself?
      ```

    - u/TimTravel:
      ```
      The hazard is piquing people's curiosity about a memetic hazard then vanishing...
      ```

      - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
        ```
        Thats not it. So far I have sent it to 9 people, and actually met an original infectious carrier already!

  I didn't know Basilisks were small, pale and big-eyed. I always imagined that they were -- oh NO!

    This is like one of those SCPs where simply knowing it exists means you're screwed.

    [My favorite example of such](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2521). Relatively mild as these things go, I guess, but I love the presentation.
    ```

      ```
      Thanks for mentioning SCP
      ```

- u/blazinghand:
  ```
  Sounds pretty similar to the ontological argument for the existence of God. Funny.

    > Picture a grassy field. In the middle sits a small, pale, big-eyed God...
    ```

- u/ArgentStonecutter:
  ```
  Picture a grassy field. 

  In the center sits a small, pale, big-eyed creature with the power to escape from any visualized scene and move freely through the brain that imagined it. 

  It glances around nervously and- 

  -whoops, where'd it go? 

  Sorry about that! Keep an eye out for it in your daydreams.
  ```

  - u/Anderkent:
    ```
    I knew my inability to visualise things would come in useful someday!
    ```

    - u/FaceDeer:
      ```
      But imagine if you *could* visualize things...
      ```

      - u/tilkau:
        ```
        I think his inability to visualize things might possibly get in the way of that ;)
        ```

  - u/FaceDeer:
    ```
    And of course the alt text:

    > Wait, I can fix this. Picture another field. In the middle sits the only creature the first creature is afraid of. Now just-- wait, where did THAT one go?
    ```

  - u/FeepingCreature:
    ```
    It sounds adorable. I want one. And- oh look! How convenient.

    Tbf, I was probably primed to like small, pale, big-eyed creatures by playing a bunch of Ori recently.
    ```

    - u/Chronophilia:
      ```
      I think everyone likes small big-eyed creatures. Paleness is an optional extra.
      ```

- u/DCarrier:
  ```
  I thought it was going to be something that could escape into reality, so I skipped to the end. Then I saw that it was reasonably safe, and read the rest.
  ```

  - u/ArgentStonecutter:
    ```
    [You're thinking of this one?](http://www.xkcd.com/248/)
    ```

    - u/DCarrier:
      ```
      The alt text of it anyway.
      ```

- u/Geminii27:
  ```
  Ah, but the ability of the basilisk to brain-travel is dependent on its form being maintained by the brain it is in. If the brain is not actively thinking about it (i.e. it's thinking about literally anything else), then the basilisk cannot travel as it lacks incarnation. It may also wind up lacking agency permanently if it is forgotten about.
  ```

- u/resurrexia:
  ```
  So... How many Basilisks do we have now?
  ```

  - u/traverseda:
    ```
    None
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Whatever it was, it was pinned down and eaten pretty quickly by the other things that live in my head.
  ```
