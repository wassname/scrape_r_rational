## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  I know I've said this before, but one of the most frustrating, exhausting, awful things in group projects is being the asshole who tells his enthusiastic teammates that no, what they're doing isn't good enough, and no, passing the tests imposed by the university doesn't matter, and stop making excuses for each other and saying you "don't want to show me your work because it's not finished yet" and stop being vague and telling me you "did an analysis" when what you did was write three paragraphs in two weeks.

  Seriously. If there's one thing my coding school taught me to hate, it's people congratulating themselves (or me) for shitty, rushed, unprofessional work.

    My partner for a group project this past semester failed to show up to meetings, failed to provide me necessary information in a timely manner (to the point of giving me crucial information *two days before it was due*), and wrote so poorly that I essentially had to write every stage of the project myself. 

    A couple of days after everything was finished and turned in, she emailed me in order to demand an explanation as to why I didn't give her an "A" in our peer review report. 

    Me: :/

      My teammate right now: "The documents the professors are asking us to submit are way too long, and they are unadapted to our project! We should tell them!"

      Me: HOW CONVENIENT THAT YOU REALIZE THAT THE DAY THOSE DOCUMENTS ARE DUE.

  My depression came back full force this week for no reason.

  It's...pretty bad. I kind of don't feel real right now. But it's all going to be ok. This time, I know exactly what is happening to me and why, I know how to deal with it, and I have already taken the steps to start that process.

  HPMOR gave me the tools to do that. I recognize now, that anything I say to myself is being directly affected by an artificial mental bias I can't trust, and therefore I can safely disregard the darkness and not spiral into hopeless paralysis. I might not feel real, but I know that feeling is an illusion caused by my brain being stupid.

  I've got an appointment to get drugs on Monday morning. Everything is going to be fine.

    Shitposting. For example:

    "Red penguin: you've created a friendly AU that wants to fulfill human values through friendship!

    "Blue penguin: ...and ponies!?"

        I don't want to denigrate this or anything, but do people really identify these things as rational? I mean, for me, 'rational' is a label that I apply on things like epistemology and decision-making and optimizing things. I really don't imagine it as a theme.
        ```

        - u/Frommerman:
          ```
          There are some ideas that only show up in rationalist communities. Like paperclippers, and the like. Humor about those things is incredibly niche and never expected, and therefore hilarious.

  A Links Roundup!

  E-cigs are far safer than cigarettes, [researchers find](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-ecigarettes-toxins-idUSKBN15L2J7). Like most e-cig research, it took place overseas.

  Brian Palmer says twin studies are [useless](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/twins/2011/08/double_inanity.html). Alex Tabarrok [fires back](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/08/twin-studies.html). 

  This happens fairly often and it usually doesn't pan out, but [scientists have found a drug](http://www.bbc.com/news/health-39354628) that seems like it may have an anti-aging effect on mice. Don't get too excited yet, though. 

  As President Trump is forced more and more to rely on experts, it seems [he may keep Yellen](http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=32416) instead of replacing her with a hawk.

  Recently I’ve read Ender’s Game for the first time and I really liked the mechanics of combat in space and other themes like orientation in zero-gravity, 3D space and all.

  I was wondering if there were out there some realistic simulators for this kind of stuff, but upon searching I’ve only found regular flight sims, which, well, still operate within gravity so it’s not exactly the kind of thing I’m looking for.  So, can anyone recommend a realistic spacebattles simulator like that? Or at least a game with elements of one.

  Barring that, some related book recommendations also are appreciated.

    I haven't played them, but:  
    \- *[Children of a Dead Earth](http://store.steampowered.com/app/476530)*  
    \- *[Celestial Command](http://store.steampowered.com/app/330460)*
    ```

  - u/PeridexisErrant:
    ```
    *Elite: Dangerous* fits the bill, and it's also a pretty fun sandbox game.  Dogfights are 3D, orientation is mostly a matter of out-turning or confusing your opponent, and while the flight model defaults to atmospheric-style you *can* fight with full 6-degree-of-freedom controls... but it's hard, obviously.

  I recently read [an article by 538 dissecting the_donald](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dissecting-trumps-most-rabid-online-following/), and in it the author uses a tool called "subreddit algebra", which allows you to "quantify how similar in essence one subreddit is to another", as well as remove overlapping subreddits to find what is most similar to that subsection. 

  Here's the top 5 of r/rational on it's own.

  Similarity Rank	|Subreddit Name	|Similarity Score	|Link

  1	|HPMOR	|0.851678159480642	|http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR

  5	|haskell	|0.622410843878538	|http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell


  Here's r/rational - r/fanfiction

  5	|Python	|0.322841702611167|	http://www.reddit.com/r/Python

  So without fanfiction, what's left is super STEM leaning. (And HPMOR)

  And r/rational - r/slatestarcodex

  And the opposite, without politics/philosophy we’re pretty much all fiction.
  It’s impressive how well this tool matches my intuition of the various subsections of the sub. 
  A final note, it’s also interesting what you get when you do r/rational - r/hpmor, since that was pretty much the birthplace of the sub. If you take that out, you get pretty nonsense results of super tiny subs.

  You can find the tool [here](https://trevor.shinyapps.io/subalgebra/).

  From the infamous [SiivaGunner](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9ecwl3FTG66jIKA9JRDtmg/videos) (usually stylized as SiIvaGunner, for intentional confusion): An amusing (though somewhat loud) [rendition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSLtdYOb5Vw) of a [sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8cLqd47jig) in *[Super Mario RPG](https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Super_Mario_RPG)*.

  As can be gleaned from their comments, SiivaGunner's videos derive a not-insignificant proportion of their allure from obscure in-jokes (e.g., "Surprise! This is 'Mislabeled Remix of the *The Flintstones* Theme Song #211'! This time, it's remixed with a tune from *Megaman 9*!")--though the music usually *also* is impressively remixed in its own right--but this video stands on its own particularly well, as long as you get the reference to *Super Mario RPG*.

  Recent disappointments include *[Seveneves](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22816087)* (three stars--and I didn't even bother to read the last third of the book, so that's probably being generous) and *[The Color of Magic](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34497)* (two stars).

  *Seveneves* in particular served to remind me of something that I've mentioned previously (but I don't feel like digging up a link, so I'll just repeat myself): *No author* can be trusted to churn out consistently-interesting works.  
  \- Stephenson: *Anathem* (five stars), *Reamde* (four stars, IIRC), *Seveneves* (three stars), *Cryptonomicon* (two stars, IIRC)  
  \- Rand: *Atlas Shrugged* (five stars), *The Fountainhead* (four stars), *Anthem* (two stars)  
  \- Card: *Ender's Shadow* (five stars), *Ender's Game* (four stars), *Xenocide* (three stars)

  A book's summary is *far* more important than the name of its author.

  *[Burnout](https://www.gamefaqs.com/gamecube/548415-burnout)*, *[Burnout 2: Point of Impact](https://www.gamefaqs.com/gamecube/561501-burnout-2-point-of-impact)*, and *[Burnout: Paradise](https://www.gamefaqs.com/ps3/935291-burnout-paradise)* are games for which I have quite a lot of nostalgia. I have to wonder, though: Which civil-engineering design manuals and textbooks did the developers of [Criterion Games](https://www.gamefaqs.com/company/10706-criterion-games) consult in designing their games' roadways? And how did they bend the rules presented in those manuals? (Is every lane in Paradise City sixteen feet wide, rather than the usual twelve? Are the tapers on the exit lanes three times as long as they normally would be, so that players can see where they're going at 200 miles per hour? What are the radii of the curves on Downhill Drive?)

  Cursory glances at the [*Burnout*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f26fCA_te8Y) and [*Burnout: Paradise*](http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/burnout-paradise-the-ultimate-box/credits) credits reveal no shout-outs to any Department of Transportation or Federal Highway Administration.

  On the topic of video-game development: I wonder how much effort I would have to expend if I wanted to make a walker-free version of *[Pharaoh](https://www.gog.com/game/pharaoh_cleopatra)* in Java or Unity (with graphics approximately on the level of *[SimCity](http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/393/simcity+classic.html)*)...

  I finally got around to discovering [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/releases). What a load off my mind it is, to know that I can archive [my favorite videos](http://i.imgur.com/Rcz8Yc5.png) just as easily as I can archive [my favorite stories](http://i.imgur.com/4ct5GXd.png)! *ToaKraka*, not [ShadowMarioXLI](https://www.youtube.com/user/ShadowMarioXLI/playlists?shelf_id=0&view=1&sort=dd), now is the [owner](https://www.wired.com/2015/04/dmca-ownership-john-deere/) of these videos, and can edit or delete them as *he* pleases. (laughs evilly)

  On the topic of not really owning anything that you can't edit: Unfortunately, I still haven't gotten around to making an edited version of *[Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644)*.\* The HTML files have been [sitting](http://i.imgur.com/jHvEEag.png)\*\* on my computer for *literally* years...

  IIRC, I've taken the time to impose major personal-preference edits on long stories only in two very simple instances: Replacing `dice` (confusingly used as a singular noun) with `die` in *[The Waves Arisen](https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/about/)*, and replacing 'single quotation marks' (confusingly used to denote internal monologues) with *italicization* in (Part 1 of) *[Mother of Learning](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893)*. I unfortunately don't care *quite* enough to spend hours scrolling through a story to fix *every single instance* of singular `they`.

  \*IIRC, I once got halfway through Chapter 5, but I then became indecisive over which *exact* changes I wanted to make--and then Notepad++ crashed, losing all my work on that chapter, so I decided to start over entirely, but I didn't really feel up to actually *doing* it.  
  \*\*Whoops! Do I really have *over a hundred and fifty megabytes* of stories waiting to be converted to EPUB format?? I guess all those itty-bitty text files add up when you've got *thousands* of them...

    > On the topic of old video games: Did you know that programs could be decompiled from their executable files back into human-readable code?

    I've had to do that on two separate occasions for work, mostly because I was coming in behind someone who was incompetent. "Human-readable" was not quite my experience, unless we're being really generous with the term. If you're coming into a project where nothing is named or described (and sometimes without other stuff, depending on language), the amount of work needed to get it *actually* human-readable is so immense that unless you're only making very minor changes to a morass of code, it's usually not worth it. (Though I'm coming at this as someone who worked on kind of the ass end of software programming - might be different if you're programming microcontrollers or something.)
