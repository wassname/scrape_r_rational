## Rational Fiction and the Butterfly Effect

### Post:

Something I noticed reading rationalist fiction and fanfiction is that authors often fail to account for the Butterfy Effect when applying changes to a timeline (in time travel) or to backstory (in fanfiction).  


Some things that almost nobody takes into account when changing the past in the plot:  


\- **Conception:** influencing people who were about to have impregnating sex, however slightly, is extremely likely to change the outcome of conception. Either they fail to conceive, or conceive a child of opposite sex (50% chance of that), or simply a person with a different set of genes, and thus looks and personality. Every change in the timeline that predates most of the characters should logically undo said characters.  


\- **firefights**: regardless if the fight is with firearms, arrows or spells: projectile fights are very chaotic by nature, and most hits depend on precise timing that would fail otherwise. Delaying a fight by mere second should logically change the outcome, unless it was completely one-sided.  


\- **accidents:** be it a magical accident, car crash, plane crash, or something more mundane, accidents by their very nature depend on specific set of events and timing. Change that set of events by a fraction, or by a second, and the whole thing might not happen, or happen to someone else, or worse.  


\- **disease, especially cancer.** Cancerous mutations depend on very random genetic mistakes to start and to survive. Virus infections depend on "luck" because the immune system beats them in 99.9% of cases. Which means that the Butterfly Effect should cause or prevent a lot of deadly diseases.  


\- **Love, sexual lust.** Attraction and infatuation are rarely rationally planned in advance, and depend on many random factors like timing, exact influence of other people, mood, often psychoactive substances in exact amounts, hormonal balance, randomly chosen conversation topics and flirtation attempts. In other words, a lot of relationships, sexual or platonic, would be greatly changed by even a small shift in the timeline.  


TLDR: good rational fiction that tries to deal with timeline/backstory manipulation must account for all the major shifts that even a small change can cause.

  I agree with you that that's how things would work in real life.

  However, fiction is generally less about hyperrealism and more about telling a particular story that the author wants to tell.  And that's true even when applied to rational fiction.

  Unless you want to make your story *about* the changes that would happen as a result of the butterfly effect (which a fair number of science fiction stories have done), then you'd have to spend a chapter explaining all of the differences between this timeline and the previous one, every time you jumped back to the present, and that just sounds tedious both to write and to read.

  This is one of those instances, like FTL, where I really don't mind things being scientifically inaccurate, as long as it's in service towards telling a more compelling story.

  After all, a lot of rational fiction is fanfiction with a point of departure well into the past, and if you take your premise to its logical conclusion, then most rational fanfiction would be a bunch of OCs doing stuff that doesn't really resemble the original plot all that much, in which case, what's the point of writing it as fanfiction in the first place, rather than as something original?

    I think there's a difference between an AU that's "Worm except Scion arrived in WWII" and time travel fiction involving the protagonist going back to WWII and coming back to the present day and seeing what they changed.
    ```

  - u/Freevoulous:
    ```
    that realization is why I no longer bother reading or writing fanfic. Rationalising most popular fiction to pass muster is such a tremendous job that one might as well start from scratch and write OC.

  When it comes to time travel, yes, fiction that doesn't take into account butterfly effects is vastly unrealistic.  When it comes to changing the backstory of fiction, as an author operation rather than as a postulated Peggy Sue or other in-story time-travel or change relative to a previous in-story timeline, this is not necessarily an operation on a timeline that obeys strict physics.  It happens on a literary level; it's not something that's supposed to be inside any kind of physics, realistically chaotic or otherwise.  You might as well castigate the author for failing to correctly simulate their entire universe on a quantum level.  In a Watsonian sense the original Harry Potter universe doesn't exist inside the HPMOR-metaverse, so there's no in-story unrealism about James and Lily "still falling in love" because in-story there's no other universe for them to be "still falling in love" relative to.  Asking for an in-story time-travel effect to obey Butterfly is scientific; asking for an out-of-story changed postulate to obey Butterfly is scientism - asking for something to imitate a sciency phenomenon that there is no reason for it to actually imitate.

    Eliezer what is your definition of  HPMOR-metaverse as opposed to HPMOR-universe?
    ```

    - u/DuplexFields:
      ```
      Not Eliezer, but I read HPMOR-universe as the story as published, and HPMOR-metaverse as the story as a concept: the story as it's currently published, the earlier revisions as it was being published and revised, every comment that's Word Of God from EY expanding or contracting the canonicity of certain points, and all the omakes, sequels, sidequels and prequels by other writers.
      ```

        Quoting from EY's post:

        > In a Watsonian sense the original Harry Potter universe doesn't exist inside the HPMOR-metaverse, 

        You are assuming a doylist perspective but EY is clearly talking about a watsonian one.

  Conception is a huge one. Changing the time of conception by seconds (or even milliseconds) will completely change the sperm that arrive at the egg, and the child will get completely different paternal genes.

  Doc Brown: "Sorry, Marty, Even if you get your parents back together, they're going to have completely different kids. On the plus side, that "erased from time" schtick doesn't make any sense either, now I think of it. I guess your photo just got wet or something... you'll still exist when you get back to the future, you'll just be a homeless orphan."

  Limiting time travel to the recent past, or splitting the timestream when you go back, are pretty much the only ways to stay "hard" without confronting the time traveler with being a mass murderer of everyone they knew before the trip.

  Or you can invoke the Novikov self-consistency principle and every time you go back to the past you're unable to change the resulting timeline. If you do interfere with the past your interference turns out to have already happened in the "original" timeline. That stranger who pulled your mother out of the car accident where your elder brother died as an infant? that was you arriving too late to stop the car accident.
  ```

    "That stranger your mom swerved to avoid, causing a fatal car accident that took your brother's life? That was you." FTFY
    ```

    - u/ArgentStonecutter:
      ```
      Also works.

      Or "The stranger your mother hit, causing the car accident that took your brother's life? That, uh, that will be you. Sorry."

  While I agree with you that a bottom up worldbuilding approach would lead to significally difference characters I think that for many people such a time travel story would be less appealing because it makes non-time traveling characters insignificant to the reader since they'd be erased once the character jumped back again.

  I recall a time traveling story with romantic elements and I kept wondering if they were going to follow the relationship elevator and get a child just for the child to disappear once they jumped back.

  On a related note I think it's very reasonable to consider time travel to be genocide(and gods below I wish more stories explored those implications).  The newest chapters of WtC have had me thinking about what they call 'Supremacy of Existance' as a term for the position that existing and then not existing reigns supreme over not existing in the first place. I know that isn't what the term refers to in the WtC universe but it seems apt and I am wondering why I haven't encountered that position in fictional works.

  For single worldline time travel, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy already has it covered: You can't change anything with time travel, because you've already done everything you're going to do with it and the effects have already been made manifest. For softer fiction that doesn't abide by this obvious ironclad rule, well, you can't go back in time if you unmake yourself so the universe has to contort itself into a timeline where you exist.

  For fiction with multiple worldlines, well, they're more akin to sliders with a significant divergence limiter imposed on their travel. Just tourists, effectively.

  So for something like Back to the Future, its rules are just a little immersion breaking if you think about them seriously. For something like Bill and Ted, well, we wouldn't even think to hold them to this standard.

  Edit: Some of this is applicable to the dimension you exist in right now. Hydrogen is obviously Harry Potter magic nonsense. That it would form stars that build heavier elements is almost as nonsensical. That they would die and the heavier elements would form planets, totally coo-coo. That abiogenesis would form life, which after billions of years result in multicellular organisms, completely wacky. That the specific lineage of jellyfish had sex with the right kinds of jellyfish over hundreds of millions of years to produce you... to say this is statistically improbable is more than a stretch.

  Multiverse theory sounds feasible.

  Some of your cases (conception) seem reasonable, others not so much (firefight), and overall I take issue with your reasoning that "logically, X should happen", as we're dealing with probabilities not arithmetic.  
  Consider the firefight. Model it as, say, 10 rolls of a d10, looking for a 10. Timeline modifications, IMO, might change the outcome of any given die roll, but that might just mean the third shot hits instead of the sixth, or vice versa. Ditto for cancer and relationships; any situation where something repeated is occurring and it only has to "succeed" once.

  Notably, and AFAIK, this includes all chemical reactions - two molecules have to encounter each other with the right orientation, etc, and then the magic happens.

  There are trillions of possible timelines from one change. The author can choose the 1/10^34083049 timeline that somehow has every (relevant) sperm winning identically.

  Of course they should at some point acknowledge this unlikeliness.

  In the AU case it's more like: there are an infinite number of Harry Potter Universes where Voldemort is a rationalist. Let me tell you about this one where everyone else has nearly identical genes to the canon HP verse. Because that's the one you'll care most about.

  While this is true on a personal, live to live level, actual butterfly effect would do pretty much nothing on a society's scale.

  For example, let's take the usual trop "let's go back in time and kill Hitler". There would be some slight changes in how Nazi Germany evolved, but the situation would still be globally the same because it's not any individual or group that changes things, but context create logical developments in history.

  At the end of the day, society pushes forward and there's not much anyone can do to prevent it
  ```

  - u/Slyvena:
    ```
    This is partially true, but it does ignore the fact that sometimes massive societal changes pivot on the action or inaction of singular powerful individuals.For example, if the Nazi party had a significantly less charismatic leader, there is an argument to be made that they may not have been able to win the initial popular election.

    Both are true, societies have momentum that can bulldoze over millions of individuals, but individuals can sometimes be elevated to extreme heights of influence and completely alter the course of a nation and the world.

    I'm reminded of an excellent book "Time and Time Again" by Ben Elton which shows the truth of both of these >!Killing Hitler stops world war 2 as it happened, but often leads to far worse outcomes. Most of the time Hitler isn't even responsible for WW2, its other people.!<
    ```

    - u/Freevoulous:
      ```
      for one, Hitler pushed the antiSemitic angle far harder than any other politician. Without him there would likely be no Holocaust, just at worst expulsion of European Jews. That in itself would mean a completely different world today.
      ```

    - u/KDBA:
      ```
      I'm fond of the idea that, given that if time travel ever becomes possible it will always have been possible, there must be an infinite number of people messing with the timeline constantly in an attempt to improve it. Therefore the "final" timeline as experienced by us non-time-travellers is the *best possible timeline*.
      ```

  - u/Freevoulous:
    ```
    yes and no. There are plenty of crucial decisions that are made by an individual, not by society.  


    Take your Hitler example. If you killed Hitler long before he came to power, then most like NSDAP would not rise to power without their charismatic spokesman. The main parties back then in Germany were Nationalists, Imperialists, and Communists, NOT National Socialists. WIthout Hitler, the most likely scenario is either that Imperialists merge with Nationalists, and bring the Kaiser to power, OR Communists gain the upper hand and Germany joins the Soviet Block.  


    Imperialist option means far less violent WW2 and no Holocaust, Communist option means no WW2 at all, but rather a slow Soviet conquest.
    ```

    - u/pyrovoice:
      ```
      That's where I disagree actually.

      To keep the Hitler example, his party did not rise solely thanks to him. For every speech, every action, he had his party behind him, and he was as influenced by it as he influenced it (he probably became the leader because he held the same view as his party too). Remove Hitler and the party pushes the next most charismatic person it has, but the context is still the same and prone to having a Nazi party and WW2 coming, and most big decisions would still be the sames because the same people would push for them.

      Of course, some things would change. The party would probably have been a bit less efficient, and this could have been enough to tip the scale in another direction. Though I believe you would need to remove way more than one person to have significant changes.

      For each historical character that rose to power, there is another person that could have fit the same position but was not pushed by his peers because the other option seemed better
      ```

      - u/Freevoulous:
        ```
        I picked Hitler example here precisely because NSDAP was doing rather poorly without him, and were very unlikely to win without his influence. They did not gain suppoert by a landslide, it was a slow creep of popularity based for the most part on his charisma, and it was his ideas that formed the crux of Nazi ideology. Without him, National-Socialist would be exactly what it says on the tin, with him, they became anti-socialist race supremacists.

  \- Supergravity tunneling between reality branes causing reality events to be attracted to main timeline events. Not much less absurd  that time travel itself. From falsehood, anything.
