  I find it really interesting that Sy is actually looking forward to seeing the other lambs, even if they're enemies. 

  Either it shows that he loves them so much that he doesn't care how he sees them again, or that Sy on some level wants to try his skills against them. Sort of like how Helen has fantasies of breaking Sy, Mary, and other people she likes.

  While it's nice to see Sy truly happy for a change, those red spores are going to extremely problematic.

    Nah. Didn't you hear what the guard say? Just a mild rash. The academy is just overreacting again.

  It's fun seeing Sy continue to be oblivious to Jamie's crush even the second time around.
