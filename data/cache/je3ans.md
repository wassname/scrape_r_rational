  I've picked up/caught up on reading three stories that have a mid-story scope shift that has been done well, and wanted to talk about them:  Delve, Magic Smithing, and Artificial Jelly.  Before getting into spoilers I'd like to note that each of the three stories are available on Royal Road and I like each of them enough to recommend.  

  -----

  Delve is about a man dropped into a hard magic LitRPG world, and it focuses on the minutia of discovering how the system would work.  The story follows the main character, Rain, as he levels up and tries to figure out the math underneath the system.  Lots of numbers.  In recent chapters, >!the story changes focus to the Rain's effects on others.  It starts with him just trying to live and make enough friends to survive, but then it moves to a larger scope.  First he forms a group around himself, then he explicitly creates a guild and goes wandering into the unknown.!<

  And >!it's great because we've shifted from a very narrow focus of a single person's POV to a much broader scope of others.  It lets us see other aspects of the system, and we start to learn about how all the individual pieces we've learned about fit together to create the society we've been with for 120+ chapters.  The story has left the starter town and the scope has moved to optimizing entire guilds instead of just trying to max out the Refrigerate skill.!<  That said: Delve's story really shines on the math and meta-analysis, but it has always been weaker with characters and plot.  The shift in the story was been fairly well executed if a little rushed, and I'm excited for what comes next.

  -----

  Magic Smithing is about a person reincarnated into a soft magic LitRPG world.  The story grows up with Aaliyah as she becomes a magic smith (surprise!), and it focuses on slice of life and building power as she lives her life in a fantasy village.  In recent chapters, >!the outside world has started to gradually encroach into the story.  First it was monsters, then due to the monsters trading with the outside world became more important, then due to trading the far away war became more important, and as speculation it's looking she'll leave permanently.  The story has gradually been increasing in scope and it's fantastic.!<  I like the story but I've not been overawed with the author.  However in retrospect this has been *very* well handled.  Everything has happened so gradually that this just feels like the inevitable result of the world.  

  -----

  Artifical Jelly is a non-Rational story about Gell, a jelly monster in an MMO.  She lives in a dungeon and tries to figure out what the meaning of being an MMO moster is until one day she meets players.  It's cute and mostly focuses on humor, mystery, and slice-of-life.  It has a dramatic shift in recent chapters >!where the entire premise of the story is rewritten.  The monster turns human and escapes the dungeons then starts adventuring with humans.  It's a very abrupt change and I was bothered by the sudden shift.  That said, it's a pretty brave thing for the author to realize when their premise is starting to get stale and then change everything before it happens.  I'm glad it happened instead of just wandering around!<  I came into this story a little biased against the author, but I think this story is great.  The story is not very rational, but I'd give it a rec anyways.

  ----

  TLDR three of the LitRPG stories I'd been reading had shifts and I was very pleased on how they all turned out.  I'm used to stories not taking risks and burning out.  I'm also used to stories making a shift and then going off the rails.  I'm very happy that each of these stories seems to have ended up stronger for it.

    I'm curious, what do you mean about disliking the author of Magic Smithing? It's been one of my favorite stories recently in spite of the issues it has with characterization and technical writing aspects, and I'm curious what I missed. Did the author have a bad reaction to criticism or something?
    ```

    - u/xachariah:
      ```
      >in spite of the issues it has with characterization and technical writing aspects

      I just meant that.  I'm used to that sort of thing signifying a bad (or mediocre) story, but it hasn't in this case.  

      No amazing writing tricks.  Not a lot of vivid imagery.  No tracks of prose or subtle meanings that have me sitting back impressed.  But the story is well thought out and well realized on page.
      ```

    - u/ricree:
      ```
      It's a fun story, and does a decent job scratching the crafting itch I've had for a which. That said, it also relies heavily on the annoying trope where the main character seems to be the only one who seriously engages with the system.  At least of the characters we've seen so far.

        Patreon/recent chapter spoilers: >!People call out her rate of growth as anomalous, either to her face or in their own thoughts in POVs.  It's heavily implied that she has isekai bullshit powers.  In addition to modern human knowledge and training since she was a baby, she's got a massively enlarged soul.  !<

        Speculation: >!If I had to hazard a guess I'd say she's got something like the ol' isekai 10x growth cheat for learning/training/breaking through skills.  Aaliyah of course (and most readers) assumes it's just her old hard work and everybody else isn't even trying.!<

    > Magic Smithing is about a person reincarnated into a soft magic LitRPG world.

    I tried the first 5 chapters or so, but the writing just seemed... really bad. I was also getting some pretty intense neck-beard vibes from the author. Like, the only thing mentioned that the protagonist actually felt about the whole experiance of being reincarnated into a litRPG was a) boredom being a baby, and b) intense shock and horror at the idea of being reincarnated into a *girl*. Together with a near-psychopathic disinterest in his new parents, it just seemed so unlikeable and dumb. 

    So, does it get better? Or are these first chapters representative of the tone throughout?
    ```

    - u/xachariah:
      ```
      It gets better.  There's certainly some early story weirdness.  I assume it's the author's first story as the writing improves fairly quickly.

      I know that the chapters in the 40s feel pretty different from the first several chapters, but it's a gradual shift which makes it hard to pinpoint where exactly.  At a guess, I think once you hit the point she becomes an apprentice magic smith (chapter 12 or so?) is roughly when quality steadies out.
      ```

      - u/brocht:
        ```
        Hmm, ok. I'll try another dozen or so chapters and see how I feel then. Thanks.
        ```

- u/bananbreadisonlyokay:

  Prophecy Approved Companion -https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35549/prophecy-approved-companion - is my current favorite fiction. 

  'Qube is an NPC in an AI-driven VR-RPG who avoids her scripted death and blithely continues following the Player, trying to make sense of the normalised nonsense of Fantasy RPGs and accidentally glitching out the world in stranger and stranger ways as she seeks to be the very best Childhood Companion ever.

  It’s a loving parody of old school RPGs, high fantasy, and every gamer who has ever thought “what happens if I do this...”'

  Great comedic timing and appreciation of munchkinery that gamers engage in. 18 chapters deep and updates twice a week, I'd give it a shot!

  I found another enjoyable SI (self insert) story, and this time with a male SI to boot! It's called [Somebody that I used Tahno](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/somebody-that-i-used-tahno-a-lok-si.670771/#post-49799620), a fanfic of Legend of Korra with author Self Inserting  into Tahno.

  From there he goes on to live life as normal and be a vain self-obsessed Pro Bender, but then inevitably get caught up in the main conflict. It's not a straight canon rehash, there are some significant changes which lead to some different outcomes, but there's still a remnant of canon underneath the plot.

  What I liked about this is that it manages to avoid most of the pitfalls of SIs and just becomes a good story halfway through. The story is kinda like Name of the Wind, in that the protagonist is telling the story to someone else, which leads to a lot of unreliable narrator happening. It's not too subtle, but I thought it was a nice touch and used pretty well. A bunch of plot points get reiterated with less information obfuscated, and you get to see the SI's storytelling become more gritty. 

  The depiction of Republic City was well done imo. The city feels like a city in the 1920s, with all the high society cocaine parties and low society martial arts clubs and the late night gang wars. Also the author is good at writing fights. I had a clear image of what was happening and some fights brought me to the edge of my seat. It's also pretty dark! Doesn't shy away from the expected amount of blood and death you'd find in such a crime filled city.

  What I didn't like is that the SI has the same flavour of other spacebattles SI's where they are usually self-proclaimed jaded assholes with a heart of gold who also lie to themselves and yet end up becoming friends of all the main characters. What I will say though is that the author of this fic manages to lean really hard into this, and manages to make the SI its own fleshed out character halfway into the story. There's still a bit of "jaded assholery," but not as empty and meaningless as other SIs. 

  Last thing, this is not a rational story. The author puts almost no effort towards optimizing the canon of TLoK to get to the end with all the good guys. It's more like the author doing their own thing and slowly getting embroiled in the main plot, done pretty well too. Overall I'd give this story a good recommendation. It's not amazing, but it's pretty good and sometimes really good.

  I've recently re-read my favorite Naruto fanfiction, [The Need to Become Stronger](https://needtobecomestronger.wordpress.com/about/), for the fourth time, and I loved it more than ever. It has a few minor flaws, mostly in the first three or four chapters, but overall it's the perfect mix of clever world building, rational mystery, and awesome fight scenes.

  Unfortunately it looks like it may be dead after 48 chapters. Although u/Sophronius, the author, has taken long breaks before, so there's still hope.

    You can consider [Noon Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noon_Universe) series, by Russian SF cult writers [Strugatskie brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkady_and_Boris_Strugatsky). It's the world of victorious communism and it's mostly happy, especially in the early works. You should probably skip first book in the series (Noon: 22nd Century), it's kind of sub-par. It's becoming progressively less happy toward later books though. It's not dissimilar to Banks Culture series, but where Culture series reaffirm Culture superiority despite some drawbacks, the Noon Universe society shown to be inherently controversial and it could be even considered to be ultimate failure in last books.
    ```

    - u/ChaoticManifold:
      ```
      I'm not sure that I'd necessarily call "Hard To Be God" optimistic (though I haven't read anything else from the Noon Universe, and its otherwise a great book). On the other hand their book "Monday Starts On Saturday" is very fun and (maybe) optimistic, though whether you can consider it science fiction or not is another question. I has parts which remind one of the university in Discworld, and of Hogwarts

  I’d once again like to recommend So I’m a Spider, So What? I’ve seen that isekai is relatively popular here, and this is the JP light novel I feel is the closest to perfecting the Isekai formula.

  It’s surprisingly rational, at the very least it’s rational adjacent, and the plot, characters, and worldbuilding is all really good. The MC also has an actual personality and is fun to follow. It’s a really great deconstruction of isekai.

  All I will say is to give the series some time. Things are not straightforward in Spider, and the way the author pulls off red herrings and twists is really well done, nothing ever feels like it comes out of nowhere.
  ```

  - u/Revlar:
    ```
    Sorry to drop an anti-rec on your comment, but frankly I think this story merits a warning: This isn't a story in which someone is transported into another world, this is a story in which someone is transported into a dark cave full of RPG monster fights. The bulk of the writing is the main character (who is now a spider monster) essentially talking to herself with nobody to interact with. This state of affairs remains for a long time. If you enjoy that, you need a different warning: There's a major shift to the story pretty far into it, and it kind of comes out of nowhere. After that shift occurs, the story stops being a stream of consciousness narrative from the spider MC's perspective altogether, so don't get too attached.

    This is all based on the translation I read a few years ago. If the story has received proper, page-one editing that ameliorates or removes these issues, I'd love to know so I can retract this anti-recommendation.
    ```

    - u/MoneyLicense:
      ```
      I loved Kumo Desu Ga, but you're spot on. The light novels sort of helped on this by having the interludes early on and fairly frequent, so there's an pretty interesting isekai storyline that isn't just an amusing battle log.

      However, like you mentioned, we only really get to the point where our primary protagonist has more constructive interactions with others than just combat from volume 4/5 onwards. Keep in mind there are only 9 english volumes available.

    I have to anti-rec this as well. The first 1 and a half books are great and fun to read, then >!the spider gets extremely op skills!< which combined with how uninteresting the other characters are makes the rest of the series boring and kind of pointless (at least the following few books that I read before giving up were).

      It has been often said and I have to agree that the story steadily improves once the main character starts travelling alone and really hits its stride after he reaches Shadowflame (iirc 50 and 100 chapters in respectively).

      While the convenient power ups never really stop, it does start feeling more like he earned them. And once the story reaches that level of quality, it is no longer a bug, it's a feature.

      All in all I would compare this story to Cradle, albeit a little bit lower in quality.

      Your specific complaints all improve greatly soon after you stopped, but even so I'm not sure I can give it a rec. Especially from a rational perspective.

    Can you elaborate on Paragon of Destruction ? I always thought it was a chinese translation.. What's good or interesting about it ?

      - Interesting magic system, separate but interacting with the ki-based stuff, where both have a kind of platonic basis. 
      - Slow, but often interesting growth
      - Main character has good reasons for doing what he does
      ```

      - u/CaramilkThief:
        ```
        More info about the magic system. You can go physical or magical, each with different but somewhat connected progressions. This leads to periods of time where the mc is more of a fighter and periods where he's more of a mage, which I found pretty enjoyable.

        Also, mc spends lots of time alone and travelling/exploring. This was a plus for me because I love books about exploring ruins or traveling.

    Do you mean you can't stand translated fiction of any kind, or translated webnovels? I hope it's the latter, otherwise you'd be missing out on Tolstoy, Marquez, Murakami, some Nabokov, and many many others.
    ```

    - u/cultureulterior:
      ```
      Never read any of them. But yeah, I meant translated webnovels. Translated books are good in theory- Jules Verne is good.

  So I know Worm get's peddled an awful lot, but as one of the ten-thousand last week(before?) I've been going through [Taylor Varga](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/taylor-varga-worm-luna-varga.32119/) at a ferocious clip. 

  Save the world, pretend to be an eldritch horror while doing it, play with physics, and make friends. Taylor's overpowered as hell, and yet I'm not board, and rarely does anything turn into a fight.
  ```

  - u/xachariah:
    ```
    I'll anti-rec this one.  The writing is mediocre.  Not awful but passable enough to be readable.  

    The story essentially has no stakes and shows you nothing new.  Slice of life stories normally focus on characters or showing off a part of the human condition, but Taylor Varga has all characters act identical and nobody does anything funny or clever.  The story is roughly what I'd expect if you just put random Worm fanfic into GPT-3 then started feeding it's own text back into it to make the next chapters.

    However, the real dig is that it's 2 million words (or more?) of nothing.  It has about as much content and new ideas as an average 50k story, it just takes 40x as long to get there.  You know the anti-joke about the boy who took his shaggy dog to the city fair and won then took it to the county fair and won then...  Taylor Varga is that except millions of words.

    For specific recommendation to rational, I'd also put it at nearly the exact opposite of what I think this sub values.
    ```

    - u/Kachajal:
      ```
      I agree with all of your criticisms of  Taylor Varga and I dropped it pretty quickly, but I would like to recommend the author's other stories. He has some great ideas that are fun to read about for a bit. I particularly enjoyed "Taylor as doom slayer/eldritch paragon of **RAGE**", EMIYA finding himself in Mass Effect and a young Taylor being trained as an officer by an extradimensional thinking tank (not familiar with the source story of that one). 

      Don't expect a finished/well crafted story as a whole, but I've still found them really fun to check out.
      ```

  - u/Optimizing_apps:
    ```
    Second the anti-rec. This story badly needs an editor to tell him not to repeat the same scene from different points of view five times.
    ```

    - u/kraryal:
      ```
      This sounds like hyperbole but it really isn't. This happens over and over and over. It really inflates the word count without making anything happen. Not only that, most of the POVs feel the same.
      ```

      - u/Watchful1:
        ```
        And in every single recurrence all the characters treat it like it's the most dramatic and exciting thing to happen in their lives. Complete with fainting, feeling queasy and expressing how they will never think about the subject again.
        ```

  - u/ironistkraken:
    ```
    I am also giving a de rec for a couple reasons.  Frist for a happy fan fic of worm, theres ones that are better written, 2 the concept in its self is kind of boring (take the fic about interesting super powers and give an op win power), 3 Over all there exists much better fan fic for worm out there that hits much more similar notes like mixed feelings and redoubt.
    ```

    - u/Weerdo5255:
      ```
      Could you link those if you have them? I'm apparently on a kick for happy Taylor. Finished Hive last week, got back into Worm.
      ```

      - u/ironistkraken:
        ```
        Warning both are not happy, and both follow OCS, I just think they are the fan fics that feel the most like Worm to me.  Mixed feeling is about trying to get better, and is more happy I guess, while redoubt MC feels a lot like taylor.

        Go check out r/WormFanfic also, there you can find any type of fic you want.

          I'll second Redoubt as well. It starts a little generic, but gets good quick.

          For happier fics, [Headpats](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/headpats-worm-alt-power.786559/) is really cute, [Eden's Edge](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/edens-edge-worm-sonnies-edge-love-death-and-robots.65474/) is pretty good if you don't mind lesbian relationships taking up half the fic, [Hardlight](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/hardlight-au-alt-power.858637/)'s got a blatantly OP power combined with Purity attempting to be a good not-racist mom.

          [Impurity](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/impurity-worm-au.64859/) is good but it's kinda borderline on the "happy" part.

            FYI if you liked Headpats, the author is also writing [Fluff](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35958/fluff) which has a similar concept but is set in an original universe.

              Also the same author as [Love Crafted](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29669/love-crafted), which occasionally gets suggested here.

                  You're not wrong, but there's a certain sort of knowing irrationality that tends to be popular here, and that story seems to fit. At any rate, I only ever heard of it because of people raving about it here.

    Instead of just following on the other anti-recs, let me recommend as an alternative another of this author's stories, [Insect Outside](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12621953/1/Insect-Outside).  I can't say that it lacks the author's usual flaws, but at 20k completed they're much more forgivable, and it has some fun ideas.
    ```

  - u/Hard_Avid_Sir:
    ```
    Adding another anti-rec. There are a number of neat powers and interesting concepts in T.V. but there's zero tension, the pace is glacial and there's a tendency where the author repeatedly sets up potentially interesting things only to swerve at the last minute and blueball the readers.  Like: >!Taylor gets access to a nearly indestructible material. Ends up collaborating with Armsmaster and some other tinkers on an anti-endbringer gun that uses it to channel a nuclear bomb. Timer is counting down on the next-endbringer attack. Then, last possible minute... the EBs fuck off to the opposite side of the planet because they don't wanna fight Taylor. !< And the story does shit like that *all the goddamn time*. That's is, when it's not focusing on boring, pointless garbage >!like Danny having mob connections for some reason and a bunch of 'hilarious' shenanigans coming from that !<.

      *Luna Varga* has been on YouTube for a while now. You can watch it before tackling *Taylor Varga*, but it's not really necessary to understand what's going on. Especially considering the fact that the Varga in the fic was changed to be much stronger than the Varga in the anime.

      It's a fairly standard direct-to-video-early-1990s anime: a mix of fantasy, action, comedy and a bit of nudity. The sound track is OK and there were a few amusing moments here and there, but other than that it's pretty generic.
