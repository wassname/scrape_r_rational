  I'm shipping. No one can stop me.

  - u/Belgarion262:
    ```
    I dub this ship the HMS Cathanno

    May she sail true
    ```

    - u/Brell4Evar:
      ```
      CatHan, maybe?  (Seafarers are pretty much  shippers, after all.)
      ```

      - u/Ardvarkeating101:
        ```
        Handsy-Cat, because itâ€™s true
        ```

- u/Rheklr:
  ```
  When was the last time Cat fell into a trope without even noticing yet?

  Not a full-fledged story yet, but this must be one of the oldest tropes in the book.
  ```

  - u/NZPIEFACE:
    ```
    >Grey Pilgrim  
    >Tries his hardest to get her to get into a redemption story  
    >Ends up losing a war and dying, then ends up being resurrected by her

    >White Knight  
    >Does nothing  
    >Starts romance trope

    Turns out the secret to being a savvy hero was to be young and hot.
    ```

    - u/Anderkent:
      ```
      And a bad builder :p
      ```

  - u/Schuano:
    ```
    This is goddam amateur hour for her here.   

    I have to imagine that Black gave her a "Mysterious strangers" need to be stabbed as soon as possible.
    ```

    - u/Wolpertinger:
      ```
      Stabbing a mysterious friendly stranger merely for being a mysterious friendly stranger would have huge narrative consequences especially when she's here for a peace conference. Especially when this kind of plot can easily branch into a friendship instead of enmity.

      Remember, though, that Cat talks to many people, it's just they're not important enough to mention in the plot, so she isn't always immediately suspicious though she probably started to wonder a bit as the conversation went on.

      &#x200B;

      Plus, this is sort of a unique situation in that *Catherine* is actually the mysterious stranger here even more than he is - he's just working on the farm, she's the mysterious stranger who wanders in. They just fit the mysterious stranger role for each other, simultaneously.
      ```

    - u/LordSwedish:
      ```
      She's done the "let people assume I'm someone else" twice before now and just going with the flow worked out well those times. My theory is that Hanno has also done this song and dance a few times and now they're doing it to each other.
      ```

    - u/Nevereatcars:
      ```
      She didn't even notice that she was wandering around by herself.
      ```

- u/Nimelennar:
  ```
  I'd call this a "discovered check," but for the facts that:

  * Queens can't be put in check, and
  * Because of the way knights move, you can't have a discovered check by revealing a knight.
  ```

- u/Mountebank:
  ```
  I just realized that since Cat used to be Squire, there was a possibility of her becoming the White Knight if she betrayed Black and switched sides. I wonder if that has any narrative implications. You know, the "we're not so different" trope.
  ```

- u/CarsonCity314:
  ```
  Dumb question: do we know what the White Knight actually does?  First, is it a given that Hanno's coin expresses the will of the Choir of Judgment?

  If so, what are the criteria used by the Choir?  Is it simply "destroy that which is more Evil than Good?" Because I have no clue what that means in practical terms.  If we don't know, does Hanno know?

  This bears heavily on just how insane Hanno is, and therefore whether I can support this ship.


  ...it would be amazing if the Choir of Judgment simply doesn't care about arbitrary killing, and the only special thing about Hanno's coin is that he trusts its determinations.
  ```

  - u/CaudexCapite:
    ```
    Given the way Judgment smote Black and almost killed him when he interrupted Hanno's coin-flipping Aspect (with Bard calling it a "formulaic Aspect" when gloating afterwards), and Hanno immediately realizing that Cordelia was coming into a Name when she grabbed it out of the air, and how it burned her hand when she rejected that Name, it seems pretty clear that it is actually Judgment making the calls on how the coin comes down, and they have substantial leeway in what they can do to show Hanno the result. I'm not clear what other effects it has; presumably, it has some combat application beyond baiting savvy opponents into pissing off a heavyweight Choir (I believe earlier in the story, it was suggested that Mercy and Judgment were two of the most powerful/influential Choirs, with Contrition being mid-tier and Endurance [who had the random hero Cat killed at the start of book 4] being one of the weaker ones), but we haven't seen what that application is.

    That said, one of Hanno's big things from his introduction way back when was accepting that he wasn't capable of determining what justice was, and neither was any other mortal, and so his best option was accepting the will of the Choir of Judgment, who have way more information than any mortal. He doesn't try to necessarily understand their criteria; we've seen Judgment spare people in the midst of committing crimes, and condemn people who don't appear to currently be doing anything evil, so the implication is that they take more than current conduct into account, but by and large they seem to condemn those who are evil and spare those who are good, so it probably maps roughly onto the Above/Below dichotomy. 

    However, it seems like one of the fundamental differences between Choirs and good mortals is that the Choirs exemplify their respective virtue to such extremes that its occasionally hard to recognize it as being good, partly because of the lack of other virtues to give them context and limits in how they act. Contrition didn't care at all about the good people had done, or the net results of its actions, only rejecting individual's own evil in as dramatic and final a way as possible. Mercy is utilitarian to the point of occasionally mirroring evil in is ruthlessness (see the debate around Grey's use of a magic disease to slaughter Black's force, at the cost of killing many innocent Procerans). Presumably, Judgment is similarly one-track to an occasionally abhorrent extreme. Some hints we've seen of that include the rejection of any mortal ability to be just, and hence mortal laws, and the extreme dichotomy of Hanno's response to evil; death or no punishment whatsoever seem to be the only two options. I imagine we'll get a moment where the extremes of the nature of Judgment are laid bare, at some point relatively soon, because we got one for Contrition and Mercy, the only other two Choirs to have a major story role.
