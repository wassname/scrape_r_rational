## Anyone willing to share (part of) their story maps/plans? I think it would be helpful as a community resource.

### Post:

The rational fiction community seems very good about planning their stories extensively before writing them (unlike most of the webnovel community).

I know my story plans and notes are all over the place and go through revisions all the time and then when it actually comes to writing, I'll often go with the flow and ignore the story map for a while, so what's written ends up being quite different from what was planned. 

I was curious to see what other people do—especially here where the stories are so well plotted—and also see how much the written story ends up diverging from the plan.

So, anyone who's published or posted all or part of your story on the internet: would you be willing to share the part of your story map/plan/notes that don't contain spoilers for any as-yet-unreleased parts of your story? I know it would help me and I think it would be a good community resource.

Thanks!

  Not that I've published anything under my name in a long time, but I do NaNo every year, which is writing! Anyway.

  My usual thing is that I start with a thesis. Speculative fiction at its best, whether it's original fiction or fanfiction and whether it's SF or Fantasy, is about an idea as seen through the lens of people and persons; this is just as true for the old classics (Foundation, 10,000 Leagues) as it is for the more modern stuff (Jo Walton's 'Tooth and Claw' asks what biology would support the claims of regency romance, Bakker's 'Prince of Nothing' asks what an ubermench is).

  So let's say my theses are "What does an urban fantasy that doesn't beg the question actually look like?" (in homage to Mage's Technocracy) and "What would someone from outside our context think of our attitude towards environmental/ecological issues?" (hi, Modesitt, thanks for the feels, you jerk). I answer those questions, and that brings up more questions, and I answer those questions.

  Somewhere around there I have ideas for cool scenes or people or abstract concepts, and I turn those into vignettes or structure them out; as I do this, more questions pose themselves.

  The last thing I do is I pull up some random "give your character more depth" questionnaire and answer it for literally every character I have the patience to, then figure out what progress they're making on their personal goals and how their life is changing while they're offscreen.

  After that, I'm ready to write! Bonus, I have vignettes that I can slot into what I've already written to cheat a little on the wordcount. I'd never win NaNo without that, probably; I'm bad at writing, especially compared to the titanic work ethic of the web serial authors whom I really shouldn't be comparing myself to.

    That was really unexpected, but gave me some ideas. Thanks for the response.

  I wrote some blog posts for *The Dark Wizard of Donkerk*, which you can see [here](http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2014/09/pre-writing-for-national-novel-writing.html), [here](http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2014/09/pre-writing-for-national-novel-writing_25.html), and [here](http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2014/09/pre-writing-for-national-novel-writing_28.html). The first one concerns story structure more than the others do.

  Not precisely what you're asking, but I find that one of the most important things for me is to keep a careful timeline as I write. It helps me track how long various things should have lasted, if it's feasible for the cavalry to ride to the rescue in time, etc. It also tells me where I have space to go back and insert a new scene if I want.

  For a while I was keeping a local git repo of all my notes. It seemed like a neat tool for looking at how the story ideas developed over time.

  Not exactly what you were asking for, but since my process is a bit different as I work with another person in an extremely collaborative way, I thought I'd show the "house map" I sketched out once I realised, in editing, that I'd need to make sure the house the story is set in is described in a consistent manner.

  Even though it's not to scale and not "official" in any meaningful sense - I might decide I need an extra room later on - I can be confident that when I describe the kitchen as being through the dining room from the sitting room, or that the bathroom is at the end of a long hallway, I'm not going to write myself into a corner.

  Like how the simpson's house has a door that leads to the basement or the closet, or how the bathroom on the top floor moves around between episodes. Boy, I really hope somebody got fired for that blunder!

    Interesting. Do you find that drawing rough area-level maps before you start writing scenes in those areas gives you any benefits aside from avoiding the kinds of mistakes you mentioned?
