  ```
  Excellent series overall. The creator does an excellent job of building a new narrative distinct from the original, and the characters have a lot of chemistry together. If you're a fan of riffing on games for inconsistencies and irrational actors, you'd probably enjoy watching this.
  ```

- u/Grasmel:
  ```
  Yeah, this series is great. It's fun to watch if you haven't played the game, but even better if you have. It's its ownself-contained intelligent story, but at the same time inspired by/parodying the original.
  ```

- u/traverseda:
  ```
  I appreciate the social commentary later on. The setting is a feudalistic-captitalist dystopia, and they make good use of it to perform social commentary.

  Episode 4 is when it really starts being acceptable.

  Seen this before, but I may watch it again. Really fun show.
  ```

- u/Bowbreaker:
  ```
  Is there any more stuff like this? Games where the narrative is exchanged for a funny yet consistent alternative I mean.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Abridged series. The absolute funniest of which is probably Sword Art Online Abridged, which turns the main character from a one-dimensional heroic archetype to an unloveable but hilarious total asshole who experiences such wonders as character development.
    ```
