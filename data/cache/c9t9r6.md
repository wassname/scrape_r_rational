    Hey that's my post.

    No news from my camp. I certainly hope it comes back.

    Author's reddit account /u/9adam4 hasn't posted in 3 months though.

    His Star Wars self insert story hasn't had any work since March either.

    Maybe message him from the [contact](https://delphicserial.com/contact/) section of his website. I haven't tried that yet.

      I cheated and wrote Star Trek for a bit:

      Time to suck it up and address the plot threads of Delphic volume 2. Especially since a lot of volume 3, "Rise of the Fiendish Four," is already plotted out.

      Sorry for the delay.

  I loved the series so far, sad to see it go. Didn't get much press or response here, which is a shame.

  The series was very well written, with a larger slice of life than any other superhero media I've consumed. Unfortunately, this combined with relatively short chapters and week+ release times to form a situation where not much plot would happen, for long periods of irl time.

  The action that did occur was quite compelling and fun. I would love to see more of it.
