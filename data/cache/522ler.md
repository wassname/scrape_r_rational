  Oh shit, we're on our way to New York. We are officially entering the endgame. This very, very bad, considering the present circumstances.

  The title alludes to the quote "Blood runs thicker than water", but my first thought was of *Fray*. We haven't seen her in a while, and this is the worst possible time for Sy's nemesis to appear, which makes it a virtual certainty.

  I'm at arc 9.

  And I abbandoned it cause real life kept me away from reading.

  Does the story gets better from 9 to 14?

    Yeah.  Twig just keeps getting better.  If you liked it before, the only reason not to catch up is to try to read it all at once.
