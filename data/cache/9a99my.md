  *I aten't dead. T*he next chapter should be up in a week (not in four months). This follows on from the events of [Chapter Fourteen](https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/2018/03/26/chapter-fourteen-convergence/). We get to learn some interesting things about [Acausal trade](https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1465) and the importance of keeping the faith.
