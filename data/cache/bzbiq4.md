## Mother of Learning Audiobook: Jack Voraces

### Post:

 

Hi folks, Im Jack Voraces, a narrator on Audible. I did the Limitless Lands series which currently has nearly 1000 reviews (4.7 stars over all). 

I wanted a project that I could do to give back to the community after their amazing support and love. I wanted to make a free audiobook that could be as long as possible and that people would enjoy. To this end I discussed the possibility of narrating Mother of Learning with the author, Nobody103.

We agreed and are now putting out the book as a free podcast on most major podcast apps and YouTube. 

There are currently 3 chapters out but there are many more to come. Please enjoy and feel free to comment any feedback you like. 

&#x200B;

Looking forward to recording more for you all.

    [Author had an answer in this thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/motheroflearning/comments/5yug64/how_do_you_pronounce_some_names/dltq4wv/?context=3)

    Virtually all names seem to be intended to be read as they're spelled with Croatian pronunciation in mind.
    ```

  - u/TaLampaRoger:
    ```
    IMO the Xvim pronunciation is more interesting, was some discussion here about that a while ago. Also Knyazov Dveri.

      In my head Xvim always sounds like Vim but with the V sucking air in instead of breathing out.

  Is there a straight-up RSS feed?

  crossposted this to the /r/motheroflearning subreddit, just fyi.

  Looks great, enjoying your voice so far!

- u/CaiTerry:

  This is great!

  But it's worth noting i think that there's a fully up to date fanmade audiobook on youtube at  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57snp5yKvTk&list=PLqzaEaXT1reNb\_FCxDOk7LZHj00tiouY7&index=2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57snp5yKvTk&list=PLqzaEaXT1reNb_FCxDOk7LZHj00tiouY7&index=2)
  ```

- u/kuilin:
  ```
  About how often will it update?
  ```

  - u/JackVoraces:
    ```
    Im going to try for every two weeks but may get it done faster. I cant afford to pay my editor to do this at present so I edit it in my spare time.
    ```

    - u/kuilin:
      ```
      Hm. Do you have a Patreon, or some other way we can support you for faster updates and to make your work easier?
      ```

      - u/JackVoraces:
        ```
        Here you go. Not sure if many will contribute. Feels kinda weird.  [https://www.patreon.com/jackvoraces](https://www.patreon.com/jackvoraces)
        ```

      - u/JackVoraces:
        ```
        I hadn't thought of that but maybe I should set one up. My editor can do a better job than I can anyway :p
        ```

      - u/JackVoraces:
        ```
        Ow. There is a bitcoin address in the description but that was just for fun. I'll look into patreon.
        ```

    - u/iftttAcct2:
      ```
      What does one do when editing, out of curiosity?
      ```

      - u/JackVoraces:
        ```
        Take out any errors and unwanted sounds. Check that the recording is the same as the text and master the audio to make it sound awesome and add any effects. If several takes were done, picking the one that sounds the best for that character.

        Audible advises that it takes about 6 hours per finished hour of audio to edit so its no simple task. A 10 hour audiobook could take 60 hours to edit + the time to record. (A professional editor can probably do this much much quicker.)
        ```

        - u/iftttAcct2:
          ```
          Ohh, post-editing! For some reason my mind was stuck on some kind of editing before recording, like adding in notes on how to act or something. 

          Thanks for the detailed reply.
          ```

  Dude, this is really great! I was a bit skeptical about this, since I didn't really like the narration of HPMOR by Eneasz and most other free audiobooks that I came across (I still appreciate the effort people put in), but this is actually high quality stuff! I think your voice fits my image of how Zorian could sound pretty well. Thank you so much for doing this. I'm really looking forward to new chapters.

  - u/JackVoraces:
    ```
    Thank you! This is really nice to hear. I hope I can do you proud

  wow your voice is great!  I have over 4 months on audible listened and yours is one of my favorites.   I’m Not a discerning listener and have only given up on a book due to the voice actor maybe 5 times.

  If you want one persons opinion, you don’t need to go so high in tone for females, your voice is great and deep, just go more natural.  

  Huge fan already, will check out your other work

  Edited for content and typos
  ```

  - u/JackVoraces:
    ```
    Thanks so much!! That's very helpful advice. If improved my female voices in recent books keeping them deeper.
    ```

- u/lmbfan:
  ```
  There appears to be an editing issue in chapter 1 at around 3 minutes and 38 seconds.  The phrase "you don't really intend to go out looking like that" is repeated several times in the audio but is said only once in the text. I'm guessing that the narrator made some extra takes that should be removed. HTH.

  Overall, excellent quality, I'm looking forward to more.
