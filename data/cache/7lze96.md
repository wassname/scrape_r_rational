  Always nice to see Foundling from the outside. Listening to her talk it's easy to picture her as just an antihero - right up until she goes full villain.
  ```

- u/cyberdsaiyan:
  ```
  Gods did she just allow the cowardly guards to be killed so that she could raise them into an absolute army of her own?
  ```

  - u/Mgmtheo:
    ```
    She lost legionnaires too, I don't think that was her plan, I think it was an opportunity she grabbed.
    ```

    - u/CFCrispyBacon:
      ```
      Plans within plans?  If the trap hadn't been sprung, they would have won.  Waiting for whatever they sprung on her and using Take or Rise is a perfect Foundling non-plan plan: Wait until the enemy uses dirty tricks to pull a reversal, and then kill them with it.
      ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  Catherine's plan was pretty good on general principles: since she expected the Praesi to open with a ritual, she gave them a decoy so they wouldn't account for her beating their ritual.
  ```

- u/haiku_fornification:
  ```
  Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't Cat already use up Rise? I though she only had three tries and that afterwards she lost the ability. If so, it makes me think that she can learn how an aspect works via Take and then replicate its effects using her Winter power. 

  I'm very glad we got to see this battle from an outside perspective. It doesn't strike me as particularly important so letting us see other point of views makes it more interesting than just another standard battle.

    ```
    It wasn't an aspect, as it wasn't bolded, she just said rise and use normal necromancy.
    ```

    - u/Ardvarkeating101:
      ```
      "Normal" necromancy, weeping heavens
      ```

    - u/MoralRelativity:
      ```
      Yeah, 'normal necromancy' backed by the power of a Fae Duchess.
      ```

  - u/DTravers:
    ```
    Yeah I was confused because in the church she said she could only use it thrice, then she gave it up to **Take** flight from Princess Sulia (I think).
    ```

    - u/ricree:
      ```
      She gave it up to Take that wind thing from a summer duchess, but was only able to hold it for a short moment. The wings came later. (And I think that it was thrice per day, since she used it way more than three times total).

      Regardless, this seems to be just general necromancy (boosted by the power of a fae title, seemingly), not an actual aspect.
      ```
