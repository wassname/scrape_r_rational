## GEB Discussion #7 - Chapter #6: The Location of Meaning

### Post:

**Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid**

This is a discussion of the themes and questions concerning the **Chapter 6: The Location of Meaning**, and its dialogue, **Chromatic Fantasy, And Feud**.

**Implicit Meaning**

This chapter asks the question of how we understand a message. It seems as if the obvious answer is that the meaning is in the message itself. However, Hofstadter questions how we can even know or decipher what the intended message is. The intended meaning of the message can be called the *inside* message and is also referred to as the “information-bearer”. Hofstadter points out that to comprehend the inside message, there must also be some *outside* message or the “information-revealer”. For every message, there is also some clues to point out how to tease out the intended meaning.

For example, most personal mail (spam mail is ignored) someone receives are written in that person’s language with the intent to inform the specific reader of something from the sender. The outside message in this case is the implicit understanding of the language and the information relevant to the sender and receiver. In this sense, the outside message is whatever is necessary to understand the inside message. Another example would be ads, music, books, memes, etc, etc… Can you think of some more examples of a message sent to you and what is the inside and outside message in your examples?

Does a message still have meaning even if there is no one to read it?

The previous examples all involved messages being sent to you, or someone similar to you. There are also messages not intended to be sent to a human being such as the example of DNA used in the chapter. In this case, ‘message’ takes on a slightly different meaning. It now means to compress a structure or system into a simpler form. A living organism is compressed into a convoluted sequence of Adenine, Thymine, Guanine, and Cytosine. The inside message is the living organism itself, and the outside message is the necessary process (and parent) to convert the DNA into the organism. Then how closely does DNA ‘define’ what it means to be ‘you’, or is it DNA+environment which defines ‘you’?

Are there other ‘messages’ which don’t require a ‘reader’ to understand it? Would mathematics qualify as a message since it does has a simple structure of axioms to be expanded into complex theorems? What about the laws of physics?

After talking about the outside and inside message, we need to talk about recognizing when something is a message in the first place, the *frame* message. This can take on many forms which is unique to each individual, since each person will have different, but similar, ways of recognizing when something is a message. Hofstadter discussed that alien civilizations would be able to recognize man-made artifacts by the virtue of how unlikely nature produces geometrical shapes such as a circle, square, and so on. Another example would be sharp and straight lines, since curves are more commonly found in nature. By understanding what is unlikely to be produced by chance or natural processes, we can recognize when something is unusual and is a message to be read. Hofstadter mentions the difficulty of sending physical objects and says that we can simply extend the same idea of a message to a signal having ‘unnatural’ characteristics to distinguish it as a message. In this same matter, the frame message is simply the understanding that something is unusual and is likely s way to convey an idea to someone. Does this mean that all man-made artifacts are messages with the frame message of “I have been made by an intelligent mind”? Would you think it’s a good idea to send something silly like a toilet lid as a way to express the idea of “There’s an intelligent civilization somewhere”?

After reading about outside, inside, and frame message, can you say what the three messages are in the Fibonacci Sequence? In puzzles? In board games, or computer games? The Contracrostipunctus?

Suggestion for Further Reading: I recommend looking up the [Voynich Manuscript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voynich_manuscript) and the [Voyager Golden Record](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_Golden_Record). They are an interesting read and really illustrates how flexible the idea of a 'message' is.

**Dialogue**

Do you think Tortoise is being contradictory?

If so, is the logic Tortoise using incomplete and/or inconsistent?

If not, then why is the Tortoise still so confusing to Achilles?

What is the inside, outside, and frame message Tortoise is conveying?

### Comments:

- u/markus1189:
  ```
  a) I found the discussion about `earth chauvinism` wrt the definition of `intelligence` really good.  What *if* we swim in messages and we are unable to identify them due to the unknown frame message?

  b) I had to think more about the daily implicit context that we all take for granted and the difficult trade-off on how much context has to be explicated before the `inner message` is lost again because nobody understands what you wanted to say originally.

  c) /u/rspeer has some nice points in the wiki, for example about the `Voynich manuscript` or `Voyager golden record`, thanks!

  > If so, is the logic Tortoise using incomplete and/or inconsistent?

  I'd say it's both complete and consistent:

  * complete (every theorem comes out true)
  * consistent (all statements which are true are theorems) 

  but totally **useless**, like a typechecker that accepts everything, whether it's well-typed or not.
