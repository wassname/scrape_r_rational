## [Challenge Companion] Definition

### Post:

**tl;dr: this is the companion thread for [the weekly challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8y5nex/biweekly_challenge_definition/), post ideas, recommendations, etc. here.**

I wouldn't say that I love definitions, but I would say that I love seeing the ways that they get weird. I've been watching the show Taskmaster as it comes out, and one of the fun parts of it is when contestants play the definitions game. If you're tasked to "blow out a candle", what does that actually mean in practical terms? What fits within the rules?

Of course, a lot of attempts at defining things fail hard when they come across the corner cases. In addition to that, when faced with an adversary of some kind, there are always going to be problems, some of which are going to have to be solved by altering the definition. My favorite example would probably be the definition of "doll" as used by the United States tax code, which eventually saw Marvel arguing in court that the X-men were not human (thereby making the action figures "toys" rather than "dolls" which allowed them to be taxed at a lower rate).

Definitions also happen to be pretty important for magic systems (a love of mine). If you declare that magic works on "a stick", then you need to give "a stick" a rigid definition, lest the implied possibilities spiral out of control. By that same token, poking at the edges of definitions can give you some interesting things to play with, and that spirit of munchkinry can sometimes turn up interesting things, rather than just the things that are broken.

  I tend to see definitions (in the context of rational fiction) come up mostly in the course of munchkin-ing.  The protag comes up with a non central application of a rule (magical or otherwise) that gives them what they want.

  I appreciate a good munchkin.  My only gripe comes up when it really feels like someone in the world should have thought of that before.

  There are no punishments for breaking natural laws, because there are no crimes. You can't defy inertia by arguing for a broader understanding of "at rest". Newton's first law of motion is *explained* by human language rather than *comprised* of it.

  Human laws, however, are linguistic structures. Arguments over words can and do change whether they affect our social world. For example: [a PDF of Greyhound's baggage rules.](https://www.greyhound.com/-/media/greyhound/pdf/helpandinfo/110307policyprohibiteditemsupdated43015.pdf) No tools *and* no hammers. No liquid fuels *and* no gasoline. One need not wonder if a sword is a knife as both are prohibited... unless the latter is "plastic cutlery", which is fine.

  These are extremely breakable rules, and breaking them has a variety of human consequences.

  **Fictional worlds of gods and magics have anthropomorphic natural laws**. One can bargain with reality. Definitions become powerful as laws turn linguistic, even while characters must fear arbitrary punishment for straying too far from standard whys and hows.

  Many people who'd make great munchkins in fiction make great lawyers in real life, and vice versa. [I wrote a challenge entry about that a while back.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vdS-7ib7XbBiEtCYyMFIJjStp7ehThQL8kNLF_wIOlA/edit?usp=sharing)
