  I'm up to chapter 8 and expect my opinion to change if I ever read it further. My problems with it so far:

  * Ontologically basic fire, water, earth, air and life in universe exactly like ours in every other way.
  * Physics broken with no justification provided. 
  * Gaia is speciest. A natural volcano eruption resulting  in an ice age and tremendous changes in ecosphere would not bother it one bit, but human activity somehow is special. Humans obey the same laws of physics as volcanoes. If you are not going to blame a volcano for erupting and killing things, then it's silly to blame humans for behaving as they do. This only makes sense in a world with a magical free will element.
  * Gaia conforms to human gender roles.
  * Economics broken with no justification.
  * According to this fic, humanity is polluting the environment because we're evil and not due to coordination problems. Fight for an optimal ecosphere framed as "Bad vs Good" conflict.
  * A fetishistic attitude towards nature.

  If I ended up on a the same planet with a sentient agent capable of mass destruction on the scale of gaia and found out that this agent is as dumb and petty as this fic's gaia is, my first priority would be to GTFO. And probably nuke it just to be sure it does not come looking for me later with some other imagined grievance. An alien agent blackmailing/mind-controlling people into it's service under the threat of annihilation of the whole species is not something I appreciate.

  EDIT: After reading chapter 8 I can add to my problems:

  * Absence of a working brain in Linka's head. Only the first day of superpowers and the death toll is already in double digits. And a minor ecological catastrophe to go along with it! Seriously, who would choose this person to be one of the 5 people to bring about "balance" to the ecosphere? Well, I guess one could interpret "bring balance" to mean "kill humans". Then it works out.

  EDIT2: Apparently "nobody was killed" in the indecent mentioned in the previous edit. And there will probably be no negative consequences at all. Because tornadoes are known for spontaneously neutralising toxic industrial waste when they destroy chemical plants. That's just plain author fiat at this point.

    I like most of your points, but I have an issue with a few. Firstly though SPOILERS up to chapter 8, below.

    - Speciest. Saying Gaia is speciest is like calling a country racist for fighting back against an invading country. Gaia's issue with the humans is that (based on the story, anyway) they've hit a point where they're not existing in a sustainable fashion.  The other large, acts of destruction, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, ice ages, etc. do their damage in a way that nature can recover from. Humans consume in non sustainable ways. Ways the planet doesn't naturally recover from. Mostly due to our proliferation, and also the rate of consumption of our race, especially those in first world countries. Gaia isn't mad because humans kill things. She's mad because we are removing things from her cycles. At non-renewable rates. With continued, unchecked removal, her cycles will be irreparably damaged and the environment would cease to exist (admittedly, humans MAY die off before we got to push the environment to that point, simply because we would die off much quicker than the environment would) Conclusion, Gaia is mad out of self preservation. Where natural things, such as trees, water, etc. are how she bases her vitality and sense of self.


    - Doesn't ever hint that humans are polluting things for the sake of being evil. It states that humans are polluting due to unchecked greed, specifically "The Corporation" and its unchecked greed, and a disregard for the environment due to a lack of empathy for it.

    - Fetishistic attitude about nature. <--- Nope. It heavily promotes nature, and sustaining it. You can almost call it a soapbox, but even that's stretching it. It's a story about the Earth's Spirit finding pro-Earth people to fight for it. Do you also want to say that Star Wars has a Force fetish? You can't pick up a story and accuse it of fetishism, simply for sticking to the subject matter.

    - Linka. I'm not pro or anti Linka. But I don't think you can say she has no working brain. She's impulsive, single minded, and short sighted, sure. But I think her actions were more than reasonable, and consistent with her character. The factory was threatening her tribe (for lack of a better term) for years with its pollution of their water source, and she fixed the issue safely. Then they proceeded to threaten her tribe. And kill two members of it. Her decision to attack the factory was impulsively taken, immediately after she got the news of the murders. A crime of passion, if you will. While not rational, her actions were more than understandable.
