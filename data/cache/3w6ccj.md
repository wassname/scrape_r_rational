## [Challenge Companion] Deal With the Devil

### Post:

The deal with the devil is probably exemplified by the various tellings of *Faust*, though he usually doesn't do all that much with his demonic powers or otherworldly knowledge, which is usually part of the point.

The demonic pact is almost never shown as being a net positive for the person making the deal; it's almost always either the devil in question being a dick and using legalese, or short term gains (youth, money, power, etc.) in return for long term problems (eternal torture). For whatever reason, devils don't engage in positive sum exchanges, probably because the mythos came about prior to the most seminal works of economics, or because it's not narratively convenient, or because they're devils.

This is the companion thread for the weekly challenge. Found a story that seems like it fits? Have some insight into the challenge topic? Post it here.

(Apologies for posting this late.)

  The utility function of a Faustian devil either is or is contingent upon persuading people to make taboo tradeoffs of their own free will.  All sorts of magic may be offered in exchange for a deal, but only minimal magic may be used to push the deal, and no mind magic - mind magic would defy the point of the archetype, of corrupting people through their inherent moral flaws.  In this sense, the Faustian devil is a foil to the common conception of God as a being who values humans' virtuosity, but values their free choice more highly - the Faustian devil also apparently values humans' ability to freely choose, but wants the opposite choice.

    Yes, and I'd argue that the strongest Faustian bargain stories are ones where there's no need for the devil to deliberately undermine the protagonist's choices. The individual *is* corrupt, or they wouldn't have taken the bargain, so the decisions they make are necessarily corrupt decisions. Deals with devils are tragedy and farce.

    Cruel devils are more comforting, they let us imagine that we're not responsible for the poor outcomes of our choices. We had free will, sure, but somebody else was still the architect of our misery. At worst we're only to blame for not thinking things all the way through.

    The best devils are *fair*. They give the hero what he thinks he wants, and then watches as he destroys or devalues it. The grass isn't actually as green on the other side of the fence, and unearned success is fickle and fleeting.

    The hero wasn't unhappy because of his worldly trappings, he was unhappy *because he was already corrupt*. No magic power could comfort or satisfy him.

    Perhaps not an outlook particularly suited to Rational Fiction, but an extremely common one in the whole of human storytelling.

      To be fair, you could make a devils that run on that- ones whose only price is that you already be corrupt. 

      And then see what the most good a person could do with that would be. A person who's corrupt, but whose goals aren't. a person who'd want to bring about world peace, just to prove himself better than everyone who failed before. Someone rational and evil, but with enough likable traits that that doesn't matter. He'll never be satisfied, but that just means he'll try to do even better things for the world.

      EDIT: I just realized i almost described ventanari, but without the intelegence.

      Maybe he wins, for a given value of victory. maybe he loses, but we get to watch the fall. Maybe it's neither, or both.

        If your "price" is "already be corrupt when I meet you", then it's not really a deal with the devil story, it's a "run around giving superpowers to bad people" story.  I haven't read it yet but I gather that that's a description of Worm.

  In [Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid) there's a little bit on the topic with the sharingan. One of the things that stuck with me was a quote saying it was designed to tempt mortals into utter depravity, not empower heroes.

  Of course the difference is you actually have to sacrifice something to gain that power, so the cost is supposedly up front.

    Absolutely; PMMM is a classic Deal With The Devil story.  There's even Faust quotes in the background graffiti.

    Just about a month or so ago I finally gave in to becoming an even bigger nerd and started watching animes, btw.  So far I've seen NGE and PMMM.  Love that shit.

      Ermahgerd, Evangelion.  I've had an idea for it kicking around in my head for gotta be weeks going on months now, so I need to re-watch it, but it's _finals era_ over here[](/raritydespair-in)!, so I've been kicking on way too many music videos instead of acquiring episodes.

      Sorry.  I've just got Eva stuff in my head and I really want to talk to someone about it, but I've been holding myself back because my usual crowd hasn't seen any of it and _oh my odds, is it messed up_.

        Go watch *Gurren Lagann* to fix the mecha-sized holes in your soul.

          Lagann is already on my to-watch list, actually.

          I don't consider myself to have mecha-sized holes in my soul.  It's possible I do, but if so it's not because of Eva.

      [just in case](#s "Well, I was mostly wondering because as far as I remember the downside of the deal was not something he was causing\taking as payment but more of a normal progression. he was benefiting from it, and knowing about it of course. but he wasn't actually causing it")

      About anime, great for you, if you just started it just means you have so much more great stuff to watch..

        He was causing it insofar as he was setting it up and deliberately neglecting to mention it.  Same principle as how you "caused someone's death" if you lure them out to the bottom of a cliffside, position a boulder above them, and allow the laws of physics to take their course.

  I've always been impressed with Spider Robinson's [Apogee](http://www.baen.com/chapters/w200011/0671319744___5.htm) for a reasonably well-considered deal on both parts. The demon convinces the dealmaker to entirely change their wishes.
  ```

- u/LiteralHeadCannon:
  ```
  Worth noting that my personal favorite Deal With The Devil story, or any story for that matter, is Little Shop Of Horrors; the stage version is best, followed by the director's cut of the '86 movie, followed by the '60 movie (in a distant third).
