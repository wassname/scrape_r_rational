## [WIP][FF][MK?][RT?][DC?] A link to an interesting, full-of-promise Isekai-type story, that was almost rational, that had/was poised to have lots of rational themes...

### Post:

...that ultimately let me down on being the Rational Fiction thing.  But it's still good!  And you should read it anyway, and maybe some of the discussion that's taken place in the last several pages as well -- I would like some help identifying what exactly is leaving a bit of a sour taste in my mouth, when so much of the story is so fantastic.  It seems to be a partial deconstruction of isekai type stories where the protagonist just goes on a murder spree (this does not happen in this story).  Of course, I'm not the author.  It's still a great story, and does the 'factions are driven into conflict by values' thing, and also seems to have the 'fictional world has consistent rules' theme.  Also, everyone but the protagonist seems to solve problems through intelligent application of their resources and knowledge.  It had, at the beginning, some scientific methods used to demystify things, but the author seems to have dropped those, at least as far as the protagonist is concerned.  Still, the premise of this story oozes potential, and the characterization of everyone but the main character is fantastic, and the main character does seem to have a consistent personality.  Anyway, the story is on Spacebattles, and is sort of fanfiction (sort of), and the guy wakes up as an automated GDI defensive outpost from Command and Conquer, in a world that is definitely NOT Earth.  Also, I'd like to see what you think of this, both here and maybe as a reply in the spacebattles thread!

  Becoming an advanced guard tower instead of an obelisk of light, how pitiful. Will definitely read this, thanks for the recommendation.

  ```
  Read to the second chapter. With the mc not choosing the basic diagnostic skill I gave up on it. I can't stand the rambling and complaining mc. The world seems interesting but the execution is lacking.

  Too many words for a lot of nothing.
