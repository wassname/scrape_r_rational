## Hypocrisy? Help here, I think I'm confused...

### Post:

Ok. I just got into an argument with my parents. Nothing big or damaging or anything, but it WAS confusing. And I want this sub's opinion on something.

My mom is very against listening to hypocrites. I made the counterpoint that someone being a hypocrite doesn't necessarily mean what they're saying is incorrect. Someone who doesn't believe in math telling me "2+2=4" doesn't make them any less correct. A fat person telling me I should reduce my calorie count and exercise more to lose weight doesn't make them incorrect, just because they are incapable of following their own advice. 

Now, obviously, I'm not saying you should let your accountant tell you how to distribute your military. You shouldn't believe someone just because you don't know if they're right or wrong. My point was that, you should be able to rationally determine if what the hypocrite is saying is true. Obviously, there are times when you can't, due to lack of information. But my mom discards the statement entirely, instead of evaluating it, which is my big problem. 

I just wanted some feedback on how you guys feel about this issue. Also, and this is a sidenote, not my main question, how you feel about MY take on the issue.

  Sounds like she's committing some weird moral corollary of the fallacy fallacy.

    The formal version of it is *tu quoque*.

    * X claims Y.
    * X does not act on Y.
    * Therefore, not Y.

    An example:

    * Joe says smoking is bad for you.
    * Joe is a pack-a-day smoker.
    * Therefore, smoking is not bad for you.

    Never mind that Joe could have a death wish, or be speaking from personal experience and trying to quit, or be friends with someone who believes that smoking is a moral obligation, or otherwise be unable or unwilling to not smoke.

  I am exceedingly tired of people being dismissed just because they aren't perfect. There are lots of people who are deeply flawed but still have plenty of worthwhile things to say. And just because you fail to reach a certain moral standard, doesn't mean you have a bad idea about what a moral standard should be.

    Hypocracy is a personal flaw, not a flaw of reasoning.  (You have identified and are espousing a superior course of action, but are not following it)

    Pretty much what I said to her. She tried to defend her point by saying there's a difference between hypocrisy and "making an error in judgement". For example, someone who got pregnant as a teen could still advise people about using protection. She wouldn't consider them a hypocrite. But a smoker, or an alcholic (someone who's hypocritical behavior is ongoing) wouldn't be able to advise her on the dangers of either activity. She wouldn't put value on what they say.

      Even though they would be the ones with the most firsthand experience on negative consequences of their addiction.

        I understand you not wanting people to judge you, if they themselves are doing the same thing. The pot calling the kettle black, as it were. But I'm concerned as to why she can't take factual information from it. If a smoker bitches at you because you smoke. Fine, de-value their words. But if a smoker tells you that you shouldn't smoke because you'll get yellow teeth and trouble breathing, seems like you should believe them.

  >My point was that, you should be able to rationally determine if what the hypocrite is saying is true.

  Yes.  A hypocrite is someone whose *actions* don't match their *words*.  That's a moral status, not an epistemic one.  Hypocrites often make true statements, they just fail to actually follow through on such.

  You're logically correct, while she's correct in a probabilistic sense. 

  >A fat person telling me I should reduce my calorie count and exercise more to lose weight doesn't make them incorrect, just because they are incapable of following their own advice.

  Yes. But a fat person *might* be more likely to have false beliefs about the best methods of not being fat compared to a thin fit person. Not every fat person always, but it may be something that's *generally* true. (Because if they knew how not to be fat, and if they prefer to not be fat, they wouldn't be fat.)

  Is this a vast oversimplification, and are you better off evaluating arguments based on other, better criteria? Yes. So you're *more correct* than your mom.

  Something to consider: evaluating if something is true or useful has a cost, in time/effort/frustration. Since we have access to so much information (internet, books, etc), coarse filters on what information to not bother evaluating seriously can make sense.

  As an example, consider advertisements, on the internet, billboards, tv, whatever. Tons of information being thrown at me. Sure, some of it might be true or even useful to me, but I ignore everything that looks even a little like an advertisement because it's not worth sifting through the shit.
