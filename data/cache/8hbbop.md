  I feel like there's a very good joke somewhere between male pride and a pride of male lions, but I'm not quite sure where.

    Well, there's already the title of Lion King 2: Simba's Pride...

  So far, so good. I can't wait to see how this will turn out. So far I'm hoping to see what these rocks are about \(Probably hyenas\) and to see the legacy of Scar \( And also his ghost\).
