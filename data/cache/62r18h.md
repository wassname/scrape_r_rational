  Wait, did she cut her ear off? 

  Damn. 

  It might not be major character death, but self-mutilation to achieve a goal is still alright.

    Yeah, I'm proud of her! She got ruthless as hell.

  Honestly we had all the information to think the plan was possible. Just that we were not given a clue into the kids plans.

  Didn't someone suggest them cutting their ears off to fool the transmitters early in the story before Ray showed the device to shut down the transmitters?

  Brilliant fake-out, although I sort of consider it cheating to draw Ray being on fire in the last chapter.

    I agree that it definitely felt like cheating to me as well. Every time I think a piece of media is going to man up and actually follow through with its supposed stakes, it doesn't. Ugh. 

    Not that I wanted Ray immolated. I just hate these stupid sort of fakeouts. They're so trite. 

    "Oh, the MC went over the cliff edge in his car while handcuffed inside the trunk. The car was never found but he's totally dead."

    Yea, sure he is....

  So... fakeout self-immolation.

  Mama seemed to recognize the burning human flesh smell tho. Wonder where she 1st smelled it.
  (I hear it smells like pork roast)

  Also, how did they fake the burning flesh smell?
  ```

  - u/Kishoto:
    ```
    I can believe Mama wouldn't know the difference in volumes of human flesh being burnt. That's a very specific thing to be aware of.

    Also I should've known they wouldn't kill off Ray. The last panel of last week's wasn't entirely conclusive so I should've known.
    ```

    ```
    The ear also smells, less intensely, but Mama would be stressed and not know the adequate level of strength of burning flesh smell, or not consider it now.
    ```
