## 1632 and it's spin-offs evaluated as rational fiction

### Post:

'1632' by Eric Flint, with it's "ring of fire" dropping a modern town from around 1990 or so into 1632 has been a series of books which I have enjoyed, even including most of the spin-offs.  The initial premise of a super-advanced race playing games with space and time for art is rather irrational - but that's backstory, and the characters in the book know nothing of it.  What about the rest?

I've never really considered the 1632 series from a rational point of view.  In hindsight, without reading them all again and trying to analyze them, I seem to remember them being rather rational.

On a scale of 1-10 (10 being fully rational) how rational would you rate the series?  If there are any specific bits that are irrational, that really stand out, point them out, and try to regard them as outliers.

Personally, without re-reading them, I would put the main series at around an 8 out of 10, and the offshoot short stories that I have read at a 7 out of 10.

  I mostly agree with that. I've read the first couple of them, and they have that same sort of heavy focus on logistics and extrapolating upon a set of initial circumstances that I'd expect the people of /r/rational to like. At the same time, I think that it sometimes gets bogged down in the details a bit, in the way that I'd expect from an author that enjoys finding and describing those details. And the tech level never goes beyond the 1990s.

  Actually, in a lot of ways it reminds me of some of the stuff that Harry Turtledove writes - alternate history is by its nature rules-based, unless you're going off the rails.

  What I love is how the focus gradually shifts away from the time travelers. It isn't just the travelers changing things. The whole world is innovative and learns from what it is given, and in the end it starts being the down-time individuals who are causing changes and creating new things. So many time travel books just focus on the messianic time traveler here to do everything and set everything right, but here the down timers have just as much agency and brilliance, and often more.

    That is one of the things that makes this series feel more rational to me :)

  This is a meta-referential [in-joke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_space_bats) which plays off of the contradiction between [deeply-held norms of knowable, causal behavior in SF](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=6005) and the inherent conceit of the hypothesis. (cf. the epilogue of *A Midsummer Night's Dream*)

  I read the first couple of books some years ago.

  Overall it's obvious that there was a lot of care and effort involved to get the world as historically accurate as possible and to get technology right. What would be possible to build in that time period, if the relevant knowledge was there, and what still wouldn't be possible.

  So in that sense, the world-building was done in a rational way.

  On the other hand, I don't think you could really describe any of the characters as rational. I don't remember how much it deals with good/evil (I think the first one more than the later ones?) or how often people hold the idiot ball. I do remember though that I didn't really like any of the characters by Eric Flint. That caused me to give up on the series, even though I liked the world-building. I just kept rolling my eyes at the characters.

  There is a lot of sensibility and bias for action in the Grantville community, and there are enough people that, so long as the idea isn't too extraordinary, someone will think of it eventually. On the other hand, people tend to get in over their heads very quickly -- the initial forays into international politics are a combination of impulsiveness and serendipity. People are stupid sometimes, but it's realistic stupidity.

  On the whole, I'd say it's a good job of making realistic characters, but I hesitate to call it rational. Maybe it's because people are optimizing their outcomes in relatively banal ways. Maybe it's because the insights and good decisions tend to be spread across more people than in a typical novel. Maybe it's the amount of luck. But something seems off to me.

    I agree with this. I'd say that it has an abundance of level-1 intelligent characters but few to no level-2s (Cardinal Richilieu might qualify, particularly thinking of him making the big damn trade to make America French, and Mike Stearns approaches it during his better moments)
    ```
