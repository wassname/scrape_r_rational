  To u/lurinaa: The writing has feeling, and I can tell you can do remarkable work when on form. The so-far developed characters, even presumably side-characters, have all grown on me. The worldbuilding is done with an envious confidence, the names of places and people are all stylish and tasteful (*applause*), and I really liked the way you tied it in with the Epic of Gilgamesh. I think the story first got me interested by the more humble, self-aware tone than usual for around here, and that first chapter has kept me reading.

  Some thoughts:
  Post-chapter 4 Utsu seemed too different at first. I actually wondered if I was just reading a different protagonist. She's still very likeable but I think you need to sort it out more explicitly, ie. *in what ways does she match the self-aware humility she showed in her introduction?* There's a judgemental edge (admittedly a quirky, self-aware one) to her since chapter 4 that I don't know what to make of- how far does it go? I guess its the feeling that if I take her at face value, I might misunderstand her again, so I keep reading her with a suspicion that isn't as comfortable as she *seems* likeable. I don't think I'm alone in this opinion.

  You'll probably have to elaborate a little more on masculinity and femininity in the world because the aesthetic is already evocative- women healers in veils, despite Utsu being a death mage and all of them being high achievers. Given the reappearance of the male healers, I'm sure you already have some ideas.

  Be aware that suspense-by-author-knowledge is risky.

  You're getting better at being terrifying. Keep it up!

    Thanks for commenting! I've been hoping to get more of this kind of broad feedback on how the setting and the characters come across.

    I'm glad you like the worldbuilding; most of the names of people and places are derived or closely inspired by late bronze age/early iron age cultures, which I hoped along with the descriptions of the clothing would cultivate a certain kind of aesthetic, even though in a lot of ways the setting is very modern in presentation. I'm one of those people who tends to obsess over making sure every single Name Of A Thing is somehow meaningful in some esoteric way that will go over 99% of people's heads, so to even see it praised vaguely makes me happy.

    Regarding the vibe of Utsu's character changing after the prologue chapters, it's intentional that there's a shift, which is foreshadowed in chapter 3. She's meant to come across as judgmental of others, but also self-deprecating at the same time, like in the scene where she first describes Ptolema and talks about how she thinks that she's kind of an idiot, but then turns around and immediately mocks herself for that sentiment, despite not renouncing it. Having a slight underlying sense of suspicion towards her is probably the reaction I was hoping for, though you're right that one needs to be careful in navigating between cultivating an atmosphere and reader comfort, especially when it comes to the protagonist.

    On the veils, though, I think you might have got the wrong idea, which makes me think I should revise the text slightly, or hammer the point in further? I don't normally like to self-justify in this way since it compromises the reader experience a little, but the intent was for it to be explicitly clear this point that _everyone_ wears them in public. 

    From chapter 6: 

    > Everyone, without exception, was clad in veils or the very occasional mask. Most of them were variants of the standard style, like ours. Long, black, though you also saw some blues, purples, and even the occasional cheerful colour. Men's were usually subtly less frilly and flamboyant, and were often a little shorter, even though this was technically dangerous and could get you in trouble if it wasn't tied up properly.

  Thanks for posting my work again! I really appreciate it. 

  I'm _trying_ to slowly speed up to a reliably reliable 2 updates a week now that there's more interest. Not sure if/when I'll get there, though.
