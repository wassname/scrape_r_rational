  So since literally anything goes, I'm going to theorize that this fic is just leading up to the fudge AI being unleashed, making so much fudge that it causes accelerated global warming, which forces scientists to release a [certain gas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEX52h1TvuA).

  - u/IV-TheEmperor:
    ```
    Do I have to watch Snowpiercer to enjoy that video?
    ```

    - u/Makin-:
      ```
      Snowpiercer is a fucking amazing movie, so you have to watch Snowpiercer regardless, but yes.
      ```

  ```
  One more ticket, will it go to Chillenial or the chump with his name in the title?
  ```

  - u/Nimelennar:
    ```
    If we're following the pattern of the original, the last ticket won't go to the title character, but it'll then be revealed that one of the Golden Tickets was a fraud, and the title character will end up with one last shot at it.
    ```

  - u/archpawn:
    ```
    Maybe that is Chillenial's name on the title. Chili could easily be short for Chillenial.
    ```

    - u/vimefer:
      ```
      Maybe Chili will steal the ticket from Chillenial. It would fit the character.
      ```

- u/archpawn:
  ```
  I guess this means the anti-astronomy stuff isn't about Vermicious Knids. If someone has boiling moonrocks, then they must have sent a rocket to the moon, which the Vermicious Knids didn't steal and use to kill everyone.
  ```

- u/Roneitis:
  ```
  And there we go: Chili has achieved significant enough, specific enough magnitude of desire to win. Probably by just saying he wants a golden ticket.
  ```

  - u/TempAccountIgnorePls:
    ```
    He doesn't even want to win. He just wants all the other ticket winners to lose.
    ```

  So because specific attention was drawn to it this chapter, I thought I'd take a look at David's continually expanding string of numbers. After spending some time on it, I've concluded that it's too difficult for me or is some in-joke that I don't understand. It isn't a basic cipher or ASCII and isn't evenly divisible by 3 for trigrams. It doesn't grow by any pattern I can see (+4, +12, +10, +29 so far). It does seem to be added to each time rather than changed (except for a possible typo in chapter 2, where the final digit is a 9 and in later chapters the digit in the same position in the sequence is a 5).

  It is, of course, somewhere in the digits of pi but since the same can be said for any sequence of numbers I don't think it's important.

    Maybe it's just a cry for help?

      Yeah, I can see it now.

      Edit: turns out the formatting I used is super broken on mobile. I used the numbers to spell out the word 'HELP' as a dumb joke that falls even flatter if you read this on your phone.

  ```
  At this point, I'm pretty sure the "right" answer is different for each person who tries to answer the riddle. You just enter in what you want more than anything else in the world, and if you want it badly enough, you get a ticket...
  ```

- u/IICVX:
  ```
  What's the deal with the characters in the prefaces? I was originally thinking they'd eventually be relevant to the story but this section with Cleo basically says no.
  ```

  - u/awesomeideas:
    ```
    Wow. I didn't realize you were such an awful human being.

    Can't you just appreciate the fact that there's a puzzle in the first place? Why do you even need an answer? Why are you so selfish and entitled? What's wrong with you and why do you have such unreasonable expectations?
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      To be fair she'd already asked way more than three questions by then, so the genie didn't really have any incentive to answer truthfully.

      Edit: also the genie never actually answers the question of whether or not it's an evil genie, so...

      Edit edit: also I just realized that in my head the genie sounds almost exactly like GLaDOS
      ```

      - u/appropriate-username:
        ```
        The genie says three wishes at first but then he contradicts himself by saying that the limit is whenever either of them gets bored.
        ```

      Thank you for you request.

      I have looked through IICVX's posting history and found 1 G-words, of which 1 was hard L.

        You gazztromple of a bot
        ```

  - u/IV-TheEmperor:
    ```
    Cleo's us and genie's the author saying there would be no answer to the puzzle. So Cleo's character is pretty much complete imo. I still expect other kids to appear since it doesn't look like the story will end after they finish touring the factory.
    ```
