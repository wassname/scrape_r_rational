  You know what would be faster and more productive? Actually doing the search yourself typing "archmage" or "cliff' "mountain" and checking if it's the right chapter. Like it only has 44 chapter as of now, finding what you are looking for would take you less time than creating this thread.

    Another idea: check your history and go there. Probably fastest unless you clear your history for some reason.

  ```
  [Chapter 27](http://gravitytales.com/novel/the-good-student/tgs-chapter-27). It would have been better to ask this in the latest chapter's discussion thread, though, instead of creating a new post.
