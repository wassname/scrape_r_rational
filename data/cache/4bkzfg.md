## [HSF] Cixin Liu's Remembrance of Earth's Past Trilogy (The Three-Body Problem, The Dark Forest, & Death's End)

### Post:

These books' plots can be awkward at times, and some of the science seems absurd. The English translation of The Dark Forest leaves something to be desired. The translation for the third will be released in September, but it's translated by the guy who translated the first one, Ken Liu.

However, I enjoyed reading the books, and would recommend them.

There is one idea in the book in particular which was...worrying: it's solution proposed to Fermi's Paradox.

[](#s "All contact between intelligent species can be thought of as an example of the prisoner's dilemma. This isn't a new idea, EY wrote a short story about it, but the way it is discussed in this book, even extraterrestrial civilizations capable of living in peace with other civilizations are forced to defect and destroy any others detected at once, as being defected against means receiving the same treatment. The Trisolarans know this, and a main character proves it by experimentally broadcasting the 'address' of an unrelated star.")

[](#s "The conflict in the first two books stems from an act of cooperation with a hostile extraterrestrial species which is a defection against our own, and the second book concludes with...a threat to defect against both, I guess.")

[](#s "I'm not sure how much of this can be put outside of spoilers"), but I recommend it.

  I second the recommendation, I read the first book and I quite liked it. It was a novel perspective on chinese culture, and left me really curious about the development of their sci fi, their influences and so on. As you said, there were some awkward moments, and I was unsure if it was lost in translation or what, but overall a good read.

    Considering I listened to it on audible, in English.  I think he already has.

    The second book has a different translator, but I believe Ken Liu is translating the third book.

  I really enjoyed the first two books, can't wait for the translation of the third this fall.
