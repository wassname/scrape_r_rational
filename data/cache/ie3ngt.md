## Anybody read Jade City?

### Post:

I just stumbled upon [Jade City](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43587154-jade-city) through [this interview](https://davidepstein.com/from-nike-corporate-strategist-to-award-winning-novelist/) and this part raises some rational!hope:

> I think that having a business strategy background certainly does influence my writing, because even though I write fantasy novels, I’m always thinking about the way my fictional world works, really works, not just in terms of the magic system, but the politics and economics and culture. I want the fantastical elements to feel entirely real, as real as anything in our world. A substance with powerful properties like bioenergetic jade would absolutely be subject to state regulation, international trade, and black market smuggling, so that’s what I put down on the page.

  ```
  Haven’t yet, but it just got put on the list to read. Which means if I get through 2 books a day, I might finish that book by 2030 sometime.
