  Simon's reasoning is certainly ropy, though I'll forgive that given how freaky his power is. But "if the future canâ€™t be changed: his usefulness will be in mitigating the damage by giving forewarning."? If it can't be changed how there BE any mitigation?
  ```

  - u/FeepingCreature:
    ```
    Since it cannot be changed, he was always going to mitigate the damage.

    Or, more plausibly, he means "future in the vision cannot be changed". Leaving room for changing things outside the vision.
    ```

      Basically, what HPMoR! Harry asked Dumbledore to try with the Time Turner after the Troll incident

  This is probably the best superhero story I've read since Worm. I'm looking forward to more.
