## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Happy new year everyone!

  Id like to share some of the things im reading, watching or listening to, with some comments on them. This is not meant as recommendation list, more of a brain dump. i don't yet know how long this list will be, and im certain some of the things will not be up to any quality standards. This is guilty pleasure combined with my weekly to-do combined with "whatever i picked up this week and will probably drop in about a month"

  I tried to put spoiler tags where needed, but ugh, please don't hate me if something slipped through x.x

  **A practical guide to sorcery** ([https://www.azaleaellis.com/pgts/prologue-myrddins-hermitage/](https://www.azaleaellis.com/pgts/prologue-myrddins-hermitage/))

  This one has been around here for a while, is still constantly updated. I enjoy it very much. Rational? Problems are, where possible analyzed well. Coming from the protagonists perspective, the solutions make sense, even though, for quite a few points, the view as a reader kinda screams "WAT". Still. Constant updates, a good story (despite being in a school setting!), overall very enjoyable read. It does have some issues though. Spoiler:  >!the way the characters, as students, just scheme against adults feels super off to me. Especially the recent arc around Ana's family just felt... meh. Definitely not a "im going to drop this" issue, but ugh. !<

  **I Will Touch the Skies - A Pokemon Fanfiction** ([https://archiveofourown.org/works/43485478/chapters/109321909](https://archiveofourown.org/works/43485478/chapters/109321909))

  This one is definitely guilty pleasure. Updates come in regularly, writing quality is consistent. It is not especially great however. The world building feels inconsistent -  >!in the first chapter or so, the MC jokes about legendary Pokemon; however later reactions to just somewhat mundane Pokemon are much much different!< . Another similar thing is the  >!Scyther!<  in the early chapters vs the one present now. There also is a difficulty spike for the protagonist that feels forced. That said, the antagonists do feel like good. The whole situation around >!Mars!< felt good, including >!Chase!< who got his ass whipped for being overconfident. It felt a lot more happy-world in the first chapters than it is later, so be warned, it deals with >! heavy trauma !<.

  In general, i have started looking for OC trainer fanfics again, but so far nothing has really sprung out to me. I'd be very happy for recs!

  **Mother of Learning** (Book! Audiobook!)

  Im gonna skip the introduction here (its been done enough lol) and just point at the next print version kickstarter. The books came out beautifully. [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wraithmarked/mother-of-learning-arc-2](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wraithmarked/mother-of-learning-arc-2) The audiobook by u/JackVoraces is also still going strong and. Welp, onto the 10th re-read/listen/whatever :D

  **Chosen One Support Chat (Kanto)** ([https://archiveofourown.org/works/43244523/chapters/108695088](https://archiveofourown.org/works/43244523/chapters/108695088))

  I first ran into the concept of "chatfic" over on the Avengers parts of the Fanfic world, where it was akin to made up twitter conversations being written. Some of them were decent laughs, most of them not good. This one is a Pokemon take on this one. The premise is "Arceus (god) threw everyone and ash into a group chat, lets see what happens".

  Its fun. And just that. Mostly happy world; nothing more going on than in the Anime. Not much more to say, you are probably not going to get much out of it. The way it handles some changes to the story, coming from the advice of the champions in there, is interesting at points, but it is, to be honest, just a fun read. Not much depth. But that's fine - gotta enjoy something in this dark world :D

  **Legendarily Popular** (series: [https://archiveofourown.org/series/2446036](https://archiveofourown.org/series/2446036) start here: [https://archiveofourown.org/works/32984290/chapters/81864850](https://archiveofourown.org/works/32984290/chapters/81864850))

  Speaking about silly power fantasy, oh god this one. The author - Saphroneth - has, in the past, written some of the most popular pokemon Works over on FF.net (Ashes of the Past). This is their "new" series (its already years old, isn't it), and boy does it deliver on the power fantasy bit. In my opinion, the authors characters are on point. They are often not canon, but they are consistent in story, and the interactions between them are top notch. I read this, aside from the funny moments, mostly because of the "how is this gonna be resolved", not the "if"; it always seems to be "people talk to each other" or "friendship or something". But its not an issue; the way to get there is what is the treat in this one.

  That said, story is not deep or anything, just yet another redoing of Ashes journey, and frankly, there are too many of these. But by the gods, its a fun one.

    And 2/2

    **Lions Led By Donkeys**  ([https://soundcloud.com/user-798629330](https://soundcloud.com/user-798629330) and [https://www.patreon.com/lionsledbydonkeys](https://www.patreon.com/lionsledbydonkeys))

    Podcast time. CW: **e v e r y t h i n g**. Like, ugh, this podcast is about military history and, more specifically, military fuck-ups. And boy, do people fuck up. Like, dying by pooping is one of the better ways to go they talk about. Be it generals leading their men into sure death, all the various pointless genocides in history or The Troubles. Romans? Everyone, everywhere has people who should not be leading a horse who lead armies, and this podcast talks about them.

    They go about this in a humorous, very left-leaning way, and its definitely not for everyone. Though, even if you count yourself more on  the conservative end of the political spectrum, you might wanna give this one a go; military fuck ups are very very independent of what party commits them, and holy shit some of this is as funny as it is horrible.

    The view they give on history is not completely objective most of the time; their own views are very much present in the reporting. However, they give the sources they use and put them into context. Also, for most events this looks at, they give historical context, which is very much needed - for both the humor and the horror.

    **Well There's Your Problem** (Podcast; [https://www.youtube.com/@welltheresyourproblempodca1465](https://www.youtube.com/@welltheresyourproblempodca1465) and patreon.com/wtyppod)

    Time for more horrible deaths. WITH SLIDES.  WTYPPod is about engineering disasters, with slides, on YouTube. Also a very left leaning podcast, sharing a co-host with LLBD, they go into the ins and outs of historical and current engineering woopsies.

    What i like very much about it is that they rarely just focus on the raw engineering part. No, they also go into a lot of detail of the surroundings. Why was $Thing built? How did the investigation go? How were the victims compensated? Stuff like that.

    Its a very solid listen (watch?), but we warned that the topics, while fun to listen to, often give you pause. "Chunky marinara" sounds fun, but its still people being turned into tomato soup because of criminal negligence.

    **The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark**  (Carl Sagan)

    Back to written things. This book is stronger than me. I have picked it up 6 times now, and it only depresses me. Im not even halfway though now, and it gives me insights and thoughts and modifies my thinking in ways i wish i had earlier, but damn its not a happy read.

    **Seasons of Change**  ([https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9969014/1/Seasons-of-change](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9969014/1/Seasons-of-change))

    The premise of this one is, i guess, "what if everyone was just a little more nice, more considerate" and it is, so far (im sitting at chapter 39), one of the more cosy HP fanfictions out there. My biggest issue with it is that its still very much a canon rehash. I like how decisions are made in here, but some of the things still feel forced for the aforementioned canon compliance.

    **Celeste**  (Game. Buy where ever you buy games)

    This is a hard platformer, and i have been playing it again after a year or so break. It's story is about overcoming yourself to reach your goal, and damn does it tie well into the gameplay. That game is Hard.

    And feels so SO good. Every screen you solve, every bit of progress feels earned in this one. All while the game never asks you for the impossible. Hard, but doable. It only gets cruel-hard if you do B-Sides, >! C-Sides !< or >! Farewell !<

    **Hard Enough**  ([https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/hard-enough-pokemon-si.102511/](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/hard-enough-pokemon-si.102511/))

    Last week someone de-recced it, and im not re-reccing it here. Just a few thoughts. What i can say is that i am still following it. I do agree with what u/Zeitfor/ said ([https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/107ggwy/comment/j3or0sj/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/107ggwy/comment/j3or0sj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)). It still manages to engage enough that i want to know what happens next. However, with the recent developments, my interest has been going down and i switched from actively following daily to reading up on the progress every other week or so.  Spoilers: >! my biggest issue recently was with the 66 interlude chapter. Especially Sabrinas part felt kinda off? !<

    Anyway, that's my brain and most of my content-currently-in-consumption dumped out. So much Pokemon - I should spread out more again.

    I have, web-wise,

    * Katalepsis
    * TGAB

    Actually similar to your chatfic mention, but I literally recommended [Conference Call](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/conference-call-multicross.50109/#post-11279755) to someone else like 3 hours ago for unrelated reasons, and its got a similar idea behind it.

    It features an organisation setting up a cross-dimensional psychic chatroom for 4 entirely unconnected universes, with a notable individual from each universe randomly selected. The four characters are Roxy Lalonde (Homestuck), Kid Win (Worm), Zorian Kazinski (Mother of Learning), and Ino Yamanaka (Naruto).

      I wish there were more Nodefics, or fics like them; It scratches the same itch that Glowfic does where powers from different universes solve problems in interesting ways.

    Kind of an OC trainer fic pokemon, but Thundamoo, author of Vigor Mortis and Bioshifter that have been mentioned in previous recommendation threads, is running a pokemon quest in her discord. Probably not your ideal format or location, but if you're a fan of her other work and their common themes (traumatised girl that straddles the line between human and not, morality and identity being often called into question by the protagonists actions) then this is more of the same.

    Short summary is that Mercury was recently rescued from a highly illegal experimental laboratory, in the same vein as the people responsible for Mewtwo, after being kidnapped and having her DNA spliced with various pokemon and forced to fight against others in combat testing for a long time, and she is now a hollow shell of her former self, more pokemon than person. Thunda is *really* into pokemon herself and so has a whole lot of interesting worldbuilding details thrown in, building upon what canon started with to make something more cohesive out of it.
    ```

- u/MICHA321:
  ```
  Looking for stories that are more lighthearted with the trope of having a person or organization engaging in seemingly insane behavior, but it's more so just them rationally acting with information everyone else does not have. Bonus points if the fic has different pov chapters where people try to comprehend and try to apply occam's razor to the behavior leading them in much a different direction than the truth. 

  The extreme versions of these have the mc being a Mary Sue of some sort of system or time travel knowledge, but it doesn't have to be. The information asymmetry can be much more mundane and be more organizational. The entertainment comes more so from that this knowledge is often opposed with normal sense which results in some humor.

  A couple fics I can remember being like this in no particular order.

  [A Man Rants at a Camera, for Hours On End \(NieR: Automata, Somehow.\)](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-man-rants-at-a-camera-for-hours-on-end-nier-automata-somehow.909146/#post-73060511) - A human thousands of years in a post apocalyptic world full of androids livestreams to an audience of androids pretending to be a archeologist teaching them about humans and their culture. The MC pretends to be a weird hermit android who makes statements about human history with little actual proof but offers weird theories instead. This annoys many androids, but it turns out he's correct since he's just telling everyone from his experiences being human. Entertaining, but slow to update and the parts of the story that has this type of writing does not last that long. 

  [Till I Change Your Mind \(Mass Effect Krogan SI\)](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/till-i-change-your-mind-mass-effect-krogan-si.1036170/#post-86544855) - A human gets reborn as a Krogan in the mass effect universe thousands of years before canon. Because of the long lifespan of the Krogan race, he is able to stay alive and become a living legend for the Krogan race. He uses his future knowledge to help his people and steer the galaxy in a better direction. It's humorous and entertaining, but it is quite frustrating that despite his future knowledge he is passive and chooses to make only minor adjustments to the grand scheme of things in history. He prefers to let canon do its own thing despite just how insane the path canon mass effect has to travel to be able to achieve a good ending. If he had an ounce of sense he could have found fifty different ways to solve the problems of the world hundreds of years before canon. Very frustrating because there is no logic in the story because the author wanted to write about their oc being friends with canon characters, but it is still somewhat entertaining nonetheless. 

  [Island of Fire](https://archiveofourown.org/series/205025) is a great crossover between Harry Potter and Temeraire (An alt history fantasy series where the earth has dragons). Harry Potter and a bunch of students from Hogwarts, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang were accidentally transported to the world of Temeraire because of a portkey accident gone wrong during the Triwizard tournament. Stuck on an island in the middle of nowhere, they have to establish of society while they wait for a rescue. Because of their magic, the students are able to establish a colony on the barren rock they are stuck on. A society who's existence causes all sorts of confusion to the natives of the world as none of their reasonable assumptions regarding how it was formed make any sense. A short series that I reread every couple of years. 17k words in total.

  [The Perfect Run](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36735/the-perfect-run) - Possibly does this trope the best, with an MC that can set save points and loop time an infinite number of times until they are satisfied with that period of time before continuing on. This means that they're able to discover huge amounts of information on people and upcoming events causing them to take what other characters think are crazy actions, but are rational because he has foreknowledge on some completely unexpected even other people are unfamiliar with. Other time loop stories like [HP and the Wastelands of Time](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time) and others I'm forgetting are great for this trope and also do this reasonably well.

  One note, I think all the Tanya in another world fanfictions are somewhat like this as well, but they're more so based on Tanya overthinking and misinterpreting what actually is going on which somehow results in her achieving much better than anyone would expect. This is more so the opposite of what I'm looking for, because in this situation Tanya is the one that is incorrect, but it magically works out for her. Looking for fics where the MC or an org are correct, but they're correct in a way that is so insane that it confuses onlookers. I guess a big part of this is that the mc or org does not explain their reasoning to outsiders causing even more confusion to everyone else.

    I know you said that misunderstanding comedies are kind of the opposite of what you're looking for, but I thought I would recommend a misunderstanding comedy I've been reading recently called '[Losing Money to Be a Tycoon](https://boxnovel.com/book/losing-money-to-be-a-tycoon-boxnovel/)' just in case. It's about a modern Chinese business with a system that rewards him for losing money, which is often quite concerning to his loyal employees. Similar and maybe a bit closer to your request is '[Gourmet Food Supplier](https://boxnovel.com/novel/gourmet-food-supplier/)', where the main character is a chef acting according to his chef system, which makes his actions seem bizarre and confusing to his customers.

    Check out [Isekai Speedrun](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21107/isekai-speedrun). MC is a speed runner that winds up isekai'd in-game. As you can imagine some of the things he gets up to seem absurd to his audience. Also somewhat satisfies your POV criterion.

    > Looking for stories that are more lighthearted with the trope of having a person or organization engaging in seemingly insane behavior, but it's more so just them rationally acting with information everyone else does not have.

    I suppose it's a "square peg in a round hole" problem. If we limit it to societies with established superhuman abilities and powers, it helps if the abilities follow certain general patterns. When the society in question comes across an "out of context" power, it will most likely assume that it's a new facet of the same kind of power that it is already familiar with, which will create potential for misunderstandings.

    The Worm fan fic [Brockton's Celestial Forge](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/brocktons-celestial-forge-worm-jumpchain.70036/) is one of the better known examples. The MC is given access to the Celestial Forge system, but everyone else on Earth Bet thinks that he is an unusual parahuman. (Please note that the fic is exceptionally slow and 1.7 million words long, which is why it's not on my recommended list even though it includes interesting portrayals of canon characters.)

    Another Worm fan fic, [Respun](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/respun-a-worm-peggy-sue-story.523987/), is a time travel story in which the powers that be draw entirely logical and completely incorrect conclusions about the time-traveling protagonist. Recommended and fairly lighthearted.

    On the Naruto side of things, there is [The Empty Cage](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7305950/1/), in which Kyuubi replaces Naruto at birth; complications ensue. As the fic progresses, some misunderstandings are resolved while others are created. Things were getting deliciously confusing right when the fic died. Recommended and mostly lighthearted, at least for a Naruto fic.

      The Empty Cage also has a what-if fic called [Swapping the Cage](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7832146/1/Swapping-The-Cage) by the same author that also has some really nice misunderstandings (unfortunately they only really got explored >!right before it died!<).

  Two requests this week, if anyone knows stuff that could fit the bill:
  First, are they’re any science-fantasy stories that people know of? I’m talking more like [Caves of Qud](https://www.cavesofqud.com/) or To the Far Shore (which I still need to read). Something where magic is basically advanced technology, but it’s misunderstood and treated as arcane rituals. 

  Second, is there anything set in the Eclipse Phase universe? I enjoyed some of the technology seen in [A Cyborg in the Wasteland](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-cyborg-in-the-wasteland-fallout-self-insert.106091/#post-24665396) and from what I know that technology is from Eclipse Phase. Side note- I don’t really recommend A Cyborg in the Wasteland, the main character feels like a Mary Sue, but if you’re cool with power fantasies like that, then more power to you.

  - u/kevin_p:
    ```
    For your first request, [The Diary of Angyar (aka The Necklace)](https://www.torforgeblog.com/2021/11/17/excerpt-worlds-of-exile-and-illusion-by-ursula-k-le-guin/) by Ursula K LeGuin might fit the bill. It's a short story, ~7500 words, but was also turned into the prologue of a novel called Roscannon's World if you enjoy it and want more.
    ```

  - u/chiruochiba:

    For your first request:

    You might like Mike Lawrence's two trilogies set in the same universe: *[The Broken Empire](https://www.goodreads.com/series/64473-the-broken-empire)* and *[The Red Queen's War](https://www.goodreads.com/series/109248-the-red-queen-s-war)*. The setting is quasi-medieval with magic, but as you read further into each story it becomes clear that the setting is actually a post apocalyptic earth, and characters occasionally explore the ruins left by technologically advanced human civilization. The 'magic' is all the result of >!a world-wide destabilization of quantum mechanics similar to creative extrapolations from the Von Neumann–Wigner interpretation of the observer effect (i.e. 'consciousness causes collapse').!<

    If you like RPG gaming, then the [Numenera](https://www.shutupandsitdown.com/rpg-review-numenera/) setting might be a good fit. Similar to "To the Far Shore" on Royal Road, the setting is a world which has experienced many technological singularities and collapses, to the extent that the incomprehensible relics found in ruins are considered magical:

    >For this uncanny place is our Earth, far, far, far into the future, after our civilization and seven others have climbed, peaked, fallen, and been rusted over. More than one alien invasion has occurred, and more than one alien species has mingled genes with humanity. A new civilization has arisen, but hasn’t really gotten past the middle ages. The perplexing debris of past civilizations, from humming obelisks and transdimensional portals to enchanted amulets and portable CD players, is everywhere. The people of earth call these weird objects “filled-with-power-things”: numenera.

    If you are into videogames, then you might like this isometric RPG set in the Numenera universe: *[Torment: Tides of Numenera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torment:_Tides_of_Numenera)*
    ```

    - u/Krakenarrior:
      ```
      I loved the Broken Empire! I didn’t know that there was a sequel series but I’ve been mostly reading webserials. I think I own Numenera so I’ll check it out.
      ```

      - u/N0_B1g_De4l:
        ```
        There's also the Book of the Ancestor series (it's two trilogies, one starting with *Red Sister* and the other with *The Girl and the Stars*). They are, technically, a part of the same universe as *The Broken Empire*, though far less connected to it than *The Red Queens War*. They do scratch a similar itch though, so I'd recommend them if you liked the other two series.
        ```

  - u/NephremRah:
    ```
    Of Eclipse Phase if you haven't already read it there is the free official anthology '[After the Fall](https://posthuman.shop/collections/eclipse-phase-play-aids/products/eclipse-phase-afterthefall?variant=31773373399091)' (writing from mobile, hope reddit got the link right), as any anthology the quality of the stories varies but I think it worth a read.

  I've been in an uplift mood recently, and after reading several first chapters of various works I've finally found one that I actually enjoy.

  The Destiny's Crucible series by Olan Thorenson is pretty good, my only complaint with it really is that sometimes the dialogue is too much of "Char 1 says then char 2 says then char 1 says" with it being kind of obvious the direction the dialogue is being guided by the author. 

  I'm on the second book and it's still quality fiction.

  The other stories I read in this vein which I lost interest in, so soft de-recs:

  A Hero's War - Some weird word choices and grammar issues, didn't make it past the first chapter. 

  1632 - First couple books were great, but then the next book started following characters I have no interest in without going back to the introductory characters. 

  Dread Our Wrath - I honestly don't remember why I dropped this one, but I'll say I enjoyed the beginning.

      I've been reading [Marked for Death](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/page-6901#post-16076158) over the last while, recommended [a few weeks back](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/101em0c/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/j2ofers/?context=3). It's a 'rational' Naruto quest with some OCs from the Village Hidden in the Mist who quickly >!become missing-nin and have to go on the run!<.

      The MC Kurosawa Hazou is an idealistic genin who wants his Team Uplift to better the world, ninja and civilian, with his subconscious run by the collective hivemind of a bunch of super-munchkiny quest players who love excessive planning. The QMs try to balance a simulationist/rational world while keeping with how Naruto's canon is portrayed. There have been some retcons in the course of the story that are pretty jarring (>!henge (transformation jutsu) being erased annoyed me, but given how easily breakable it is caused the QMs no end of headaches!<), and some rather convenient plot happenstances are the most annoying (a few hundred chapters in, after >!the Team Uplift joins Leaf!<, >!the main contingent of Leaf clans that are opposed to the team are killed off in a surgical strike by another village!<, which felt a bit outta nowhere, but maybe there was some thread discussion that foreshadowed it?).

      I'm at chapter 354 of 570ish (2.6 million words!), but I've liked what's there outside of the odd retcons and plot happenings.

  Currently im on a roll of reading **SNAFU: Anthology of military horror** series. Its several books worth of anthologies, each but the first one has a different theme.  


  Basic gist of each and every story there is: *bunch of badass soldiers must use their wits, rationality, and tactical skills to fend off monsters. A bit like Aliens, 13th Warrior, Predator, Dog Soldiers, or Starship Troopers, but with actually solid, rational-ish and pragmatic tactics.*  


  Soldiers in the stories range from medieval Vikings to Delta Force, and from Wehrmacht to MASH medics.  
  Monsters range from undead to werewolves to giant creepy crawlies, and several types of Lovecraftian beasties, plus a lot of creative variations.   


  **PROS:**  


  \- "tactical" stories are very close to rational stories, and in some cases the soldiers internal monologues are very close to rationalist explanations. Irrational behavior is swiftly punished with death, rational with occasional survival (or at least, more badass last stand).

  \- anthology type military stories are good detox from webnovels, because they are short, to the point, and neat with no filler. 

  \- the few times the authors used mythological beasts or folklore monsters/undead, they stick well to traditional canon instead of mass media portrayal. 

  \- when giant animals or other "biological" beasts are used, the authors at least try to explain or lampshade scientific issues that would be obvious to a science-literate reader (like conservation of mass, plausible-ish mutations and evolutionary paths).  


  **CONS:**   


  \- by design the stories tend to be repetitive: bunch of soldiers go on a supposedly standard mission, encounter monsters, quickly get over their initial disbelief, use their smarts to kill as many monsters as they can, die one by one, finally the last man standing either somehow defeats the monsters or manages to send a warning before dying heroically in blaze of badass glory. Basically, its Aliens, but everyone is as smart as Ripley. If you enjoyed Aliens or original Predator, this is a series for you, if not, will probably drop it after few stories.

  Just now I had a craving for necromancer MCs and realized I can’t think of any good necromancer novels.

  And by that I mean a serious sort of story, preferably if necromancy is actually explored and munchkinned, instead of just some lame boring [Summon Skeleton] skill or whatever.

  I was disappointed by Sylver Seeker a year ago, and was disappointed by Saintess Summons Skeletons today too. I expected the latter to be some serious heavy story of a girl who wanted to do good with a poorly viewed class, and with dead heroes and their noble intentions and characters juxtaposed against the blank and evil seeming canvas of a simple skeleton. Some sort of serious story. Instead it’s a meta litrpg where there’s only ever 1 skeleton, and he isn’t even a character. It’s still fun enough, but not what I wanted.

  Sorry for that long tangent. In short, I’m looking for good necromancer novels that really explore necromancy, or feature a MC trying to do good with the class. Or just any good Necromancer story, I can’t even think of any in the first place. Published or web fiction, either is fine.

    [The World Waits on Evil](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-world-waits-on-evil-hivers-eoa-ww-a-finished-story.274791/). Someone gets isekai’d into a lich’s body, inheriting his necromantic powers as well as his treacherous subordinates and tenuous geopolitical situation. Chaos ensues as an unprepared human tries to get a grip on his new evil kingdom. I think it’s fanfiction of an original work which plays it as more of a power fantasy.

    I recommended RavensDagger's works in general elsewhere in this thread but to you specifically I recommend [Dead Tired](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37251/dead-tired)

    A necromancer lich maxed out and scienced out his litrpg world and so went to sleep. We join him a few thousand years later as he wakes up to find that everyone is now convinced it's a cultivation setting instead. It's not a serious sort of story, and it's on indefinite hiatus, though.

  Any recommendations for warm/cozy/pleasant stories, possibly slice-of-life but not necessarily? I'm caught up with TUTBAD and I'm looking for more like that. I'm planning to check out Beware of Chicken.

  Related question: I saw Wandering Inn recommended as similar and started reading that, but so far I'm not finding it warm or cozy at all. It's filled with trauma and anxiety. Does it change later on to become more pleasant? I just got to the part where she >!buried the 3 goblins!<.
  ```

  - u/taxemeEvasion:
    ```
    To answer the related question first: The thing about *The Wandering Inn* is that it's long. Chapters that follow Erin tend to alternate between periods of downtime and periods of crisis. Because its (currently) 10M words long sometimes its *really extremely cozy* for very long periods of time, minus the occasional interlude. But the opposite is also sometimes true and trauma can hit unexpectedly. It is the most slice-of-life story I have ever read and I'd highly recommend it but its not a pure comfort story. The overall tone of the story is hopeful though.

    For pure comfort books I'd recommend the following:

    \-  Ursula Vernon (aka T. Kingfisher) has a bunch of rather silly (& imo kind of prachett-esque) novels with non-standard hero types as protagonists: *Swordheart, A Wizards Guide to Defensive Baking, etc.*

    \- There's the current wave of  "fed-up adventurers open a warm beverage shop" books: *Legends and Lattes* and *You can't Spell Treason without Tea.*

    \-  Relatedly, the "robot companion and I open a tea shop books": *A Psalm for the Wild Built* and *The Cybernetic Tea Shop*

    \- Becky Chambers (the author of *Psalm)* is also best known for her cozy sci-fi series, *Wayfarers* that starts with *The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet*. The first is about a new member joining the crew of a space ship that builds the hyperspace jump points so they have to go the long way round the first time. I enjoyed it but a common complaint is that they're ***too*** slow and slice of life\*.\*

    \-  I'm currently reading *Miss Percy's Guide (To the Care and Feeding of British Dragons)* and highly recommend it! Its a Jane Austen-like tale of a 40 year old spinster, that lives an unhappy life with her sister, that inherits a dragon egg. The prose is parentheticals upon parentheticals, and I'm finding it funny as hell atm.

    \- *The Goblin Emperor* about a half-goblin inheriting his father's kingdom. Its all quiet but generally cozy intrigue. Some might also consider *The Curse of Chalion* in this genre. I've also heard similar & good things about *The Hands of the Emperor* by Victoria Goddard, but its still sitting on my TBR so I can't recommend it personally yet.  


    \- Meadowsweet by C.J. Milbrant about a magic sculptors apprentice. It has a good audiobook narrated by Travis Baldtree.

    \- The classic recommendations are Diana Wynn Jones' books. *Howls' Moving Castle*, *The House of Many Ways*, etc.

    \- T.J. Klune keeps writing the same book with a different setting about a grumpy man becoming a better person when he's given a relaxing and welcoming environment: *House in the Cerulean Sea, Under the Whipering Door*, etc. That said I'd recommend reading at least one of them. I think *Cerulean Sea* is the best of his work.

    \- Anything by Raven's Dagger. Cinnamon Bun is probably the classic recommendation for online fic. but I've actually enjoyed Heart of Dorkness and Dead Tired better. That said their stories can drag, turn into nonsensical cuddlepiles, or have odd body modification.

    **Manga/LN/Anime:**

    \-  *Ascendance of a Bookworm.* An isekai series about someone discovering that books and reading aren't common in their new world and their journey to change that.

    TWI definitely isn't a pure slice of life feel good story, but by virtue of how long it is, there are many novels worth of comfy low-stakes chapters in it next to the occasionally rather more charged ones. It definitely manages to hit emotional highs and emotional lows

  - u/Snoo-33022:

    Albeit unrelated to the question: in my opinion TWI is long in a *bad* way, where countless words describe boring stuff (side characters / side plots / unnecessary detail).

        Im not going into the deepend for writing quality here, but for short enjoyable readable moments...

        For rather short but  mostly cozy and happy-times i can reccomend [https://archiveofourown.org/works/25373284/chapters/61525111](https://archiveofourown.org/works/25373284/chapters/61525111). Not especially deep, but if you know the Anime and some of the fandom stuff this one is a nice happy read. Works with the reval/secret identiy/hiden badass tropes a bit. 

        There also is [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7262793/1/Ashes-of-the-Past](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7262793/1/Ashes-of-the-Past), which is is getting a limited rewrite over on the author thread on SB; you might wanna hold out until then or follow those here (use threadmarks; chapter one is updated since forever over on [ff.net](https://ff.net) as well) [https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ashes-of-the-past-pokemon-peggy-sue-thread-two.420755/](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ashes-of-the-past-pokemon-peggy-sue-thread-two.420755/) 

        Ashes is ugh.. massive, and mostly fun. There are some dramatic moments, but they are very much not the dominating force. You do notice the development of the authors writing thorugh it. If you make it past the beginning (thats being touched up; but still). 

        Have you ever read the top-fic over on AO3? [https://archiveofourown.org/works/2080878](https://archiveofourown.org/works/2080878)
