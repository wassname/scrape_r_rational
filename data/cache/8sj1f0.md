## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  I have a question to see if anyone can reconcile this form of magic. In this world, astrology and constellations are important for magic. However the worlds wider universe functions pretty much exactly as ours does. Can anyone think of anyway to have both of these at the same time. I just kind of want to see if anyone has any ideas.

    Magic which is highly dependent upon time of day and time of year?

    Suppose the Earth were orbiting through a cloud of aether which grants magical powers to certain people if the right techniques to harness it are used. The cloud could stay in a fixed position relative to the sun, perhaps a kind of gravitationally-attracted dark matter with an ultra-low density, so it is actually pressure that pushes it out to the orbit of Earth, rather than it maintaining a stable orbit around the sun. This is how the Earth is able to move through the cloud during the course of the year.

    Suppose the cloud has many 'bubbles', and 'pockets' possibly of various 'colors' which are different in different places. The different colors of the dark matter tend to be cohesively drawn towards accumulations of the same color. If different colors have different effects on magic, perhaps allowing different types of magic or not allowing magic at all, then you'd have substantial changes in your magic system during the course of the year. Constellations would just be a proxy for time of year, so if magic works one way when Orion is highest in the sky at midnight, it should work the same way at the same time next year.

    Far out, I actually read a now-defunct blog that had a post on that *exact* subject: 

    https://comparativelysuperlative.wordpress.com/2013/09/04/astrology/

    It does require Sufficiently Advanced Aliens to care about the Earth in particular, though.

      That post once got linked by an actual astrology blog. I'm not sure if it's funnier if they knew I was joking, or if they didn't.

          I do have a Tumblr; that's kind of like a blog.

          xkcd mafia I haven't done in years. That was fun though.

  This might be the wrong weekly thread, but because it deals explicitly with Delphic, I thought I'd put it here.  Spoilers for the most recent chapter (2.6 Painful Questions).

  So, certain supers are using "enhanced interrogation" to extract information from criminals (ask a question, detect if the person is lying, inflict pain if so, rinse and repeat). When I introduced this, I took for granted that most people (and presumably the readers) would find this deeply disturbing and immoral.

  That's not the feedback I received. One particular beta reader indicated that this "solves the problems" of interrogation by not physically harming the person, and that if this technique were possible in the real world, we should use it regularly. 

  Other comments I've received were primarily worried about danger in reputation or legal prosecution of the supers, presuming they must have some way of covering it up. The voices I heard from either indicated no immediate qualms with the practice, or minor concerns that could be overcome if the resulting intel was good.

  So, have I just entirely misunderstood where people stand on these issues? Is inflicting temporary pain, in a situation where it isn't coupled to injury and can reliably produce information, as tilted on the balance of benefit versus harm that the controversy primarily boils down to controlling (ignorant) public backlash?

    I think the problem is the simplicity of the frame. Not your fault so much as the fault of fictional stories in general.

    What is a lie? If it's fact vs. falsehood then just ask the question to anyone (yourself, even!) and learn the truth from their guesses. No torture required. More probably the power is detecting the physiological process of deception.

    How is this willful deception being detected? There has to be enough subtlety to distinguish between a lie by omission and genuine lack of knowledge, so by the time someone has been thoroughly tortured, their goal may so strongly be to end the pain rather than to answer the question that every answer might read as deceptive.

    Even if the read is flawless, introduce (for example) an "innocent" who is protecting a criminal by pretending to be one. Everything they say will be deceptive.

    Alternately a mercenary employed by a criminal may truthfully have no knowledge of the particulars the heroes want, but may believe truly terrible things will happen if the heroes realize this. "I don't know," will remain deceptive to some degree, even as it is also the truth.

    All sorts of more subtle examples exist inside the minds of real torture victims. Knowledge is complex and deception is complex.

    Your readers are reacting to a set of simple facts: The criminal is definitely guilty. He knows what the heroes want to know. They know exactly when he has told them everything he knows. This information is safe, and it saves lives at little cost to anyone. Very few real world situations match this frame, yet most fictional torture scenarios do.

    And waterboarding, done properly, is almost exactly as "safe" and "temporary" as the paralysis/pain trick.
