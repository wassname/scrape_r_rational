## I dislike HPMOR, how representative is it of rational/rationalist fic as a whole?

### Post:

I've read a few rational/rationalist fics, with varying degrees of enjoyment. *The Waves Arisen* is a recent favourite, for example. However, I just cannot stand *HPMOR*. The characters, the author's tone - I just do not dig it.

Is *HPMOR* generally considered to be representative of this genre, or is it considered to have teething pains and not really represent where the genre went later on?

EDIT: Can you fig it, sucka?

  I'd call [Metropolian Man](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man) the best representative of rational fic, since it has all the best features of that genre, while avoiding the flaws of HPMOR. 
  Please go read that one first, especially if you liked 'The Waves Arisen'

    I just read that, and it was very good indeed. Thank you for the recommendation.

    It did a very good job of having a protagonist who is clearly the villain overall, but not making me ask "Wait why do I care about this asshole again?", which I find to be something of a problem with a lot of evil protagonists.

  If i understandit correctly, HPMOR is a representative of the genre, but in the same way that i think you can like rock even if you hate metalica, i think there are good rational-fic that do what HPMOR did better. 

  HPMOR is exceptionally preachy, for rationalfic, for instance. I'd say that rationalfic usually strives to copy HPMOR's good side while avoiding all the flaws in it. On the other hand, i'm bad at noticing preachyness unless it's something i've already heard and disagreed with.

  Someone once described the levels of rationality in fiction:

  0. Characters are not rational. They act as the story would require, rather than how people would act.
  1. Characters are thinking. They act in a coherent, thought-out manner to achieve their goals (unless they're supposed to be dumb). The story results from the interactions of these attempts, with a garnish of Plot.
  1. Characters are "rational". They are aware of the science and study of human psychology and apply that knowledge.
  1. Story attempts to teach rationality. An Aesop's Fable, but for the science and study of human psychology.

  Most pop fiction is Level 1. Harry Potter, Twilight, most superhero movies. Some popular fiction is between 1 and 2 - there's stuff that is definitely there just because story, but after and around that, the characters react with thought - Star Trek, latest Star Wars, most of the new Marvel superhero movies, Daemon.

  Some extremely popular fiction is Level 2. Game of Thrones, Name of the Wind, The Lies of Lock Lamora, Nexus, The Martian, most classic science fiction (Herbert, Asimov, Niven, Heinlein). The "humanist" classic sci fi is between 2 and 1, because there's more Plot Conceit in order to put the characters in the desired situation within which they react, but they still react like people - Phillip K Dick, Sturgeon, Vonnegut.

  Most of the web fiction (fan or otherwise) recommended by this sub is Level 2 - Worm, Pact, (Twig is edging into 3 because Sylvester, but edges back towards 1 because Frankenscience), Shadows of the Limelight.

  Very little fiction is Level 3, all of it recommended by this sub. I think I've heard of one published novel that's Level 3 - it got recommended in the last couple weeks. Metropolitan Man, Lighting up the Dark, Luminosity, etc. Some of this fiction edges towards 4; Origin of the Species, HPMOR.

  The only stuff that I'm aware of that's "truly" Level 4 - given that you now have to sacrifice the range of story that you can tell so that it's a fable - is the Bayesian Conspiracy shorts that Yudkowsky has written.

  (PS - Feel totally free to challenge me on any of the level assignments. Either I didn't think it through enough, or I welcome the discussion)

  - u/NotAHeroYet:
    ```
    I wouldn't call worm rational-fic. it's just a tiny bit south of the border for that, in my opinion. You're welcome to disagree, and it is a good book, but... rational setting, irrational characters at best, i would think.
    ```

    - u/rdestenay:
      ```
      Maybe my definition of rational-fic is too broad. I call a fiction rational when the characters act in a believable way (the opposite of Hollywood movie). In Worm, some characters act rationally and are very intelligent, some are less intelligent but still act the way you would expect them to act in real life considering their background.
      In that regards, I find HPMOR's characters less realistic even though Harry is more rational.
      ```

      - u/NotAHeroYet:
        ```
        I think rational-fic is where rational thought is explicitly rewarded, and where a non-insignificant number of cast members try accordingly. 

        I tend to forget some of worm's rationalism, that was clearly there on re-reading. Taylor is happy to try her hardest to muchkin for that, after all.

        It's also surprising how effective the POV swaps are.
        ```

        - u/memzak:
          ```
          I'm pretty sure a fiction where rational thought is explicitly rewarded is more a rationalist fiction than a rational one. At least, going by what I can gather from the sidebar.
          Rational fictions are where things in the story make rational sense, but doesn't necessarily mean the characters themselves always act perfectly rational. (and in the case of Worm, the literally can't [due](#s " to how powers influence the mind") )
          ```

    - u/Sailor_Vulcan:
      ```
      I would probably say the same thing for HPMOR. The whole premise of Scientist!Harry was basically lost after the first twenty-something chapters, and there was less and less science after that point. And by the end of the story the takeaway message was clearly that knowledge can be very destructive and dangerous and therefore we should not "open doors that should not be opened" curiosity killed the cat sort of stuff. Not a very rational message. While the author has gone on record saying that this was not what he intended to say and definitely not intended as a main takeaway message, the story reinforced it with the events of the ending as well as a lot of stuff building up to it. For instance, how Harry ended up [spoiler](#s "deciding not to overthrow the statute of secrecy, and how Harry is prophecized to end the world and yet voldemort is the one who saved the day from Harry's stupidity").

      To be honest, I don't think it takes a rational genius to understand the reasons for the statute of secrecy. Someone with sufficient training in relevant fields who had the training to learn about and understand other cultures and how and why they function the way they do could have understood why the statute of secrecy existed, and why getting rid of it without a viable alternative would be catastrophic, even if they didn't have any training in rationality. 

      And while the average person, put in Harry's shoes might not accomplish much, they also wouldn't do so badly that they nearly destroy the world either. When a "rational" protagonist is so irrational that even though they are super smart they still miss obvious things like Quirrel being evil (which Hermione got right away despite her not having rationality training like Harry had), when the "rational" supergenius protagonist's *stupidity* nearly gets the world destroyed, when the story is preachy (the preachiness in the story discourages questioning it or figuring out what's going on, and the severe lack of science doesn't help), you have to wonder whether it really qualifies as a rational fic. I would say HPMOR has hints of rationality, but does't really qualify as a rational story. It has a lot of potential to become more rational with a decent amount of editing and rewriting, but from what I recall the author published it while it was basically a first draft. A lot of the views that HPMOR presents are views that a lot of rational/rationalist people have, but merely agreeing with rational/rationalist views isn't enough for the story itself to qualify as rational fiction.

      That being said, it does technically meet all the criteria on the sidebar, somehow, despite all the issues described above.

        Are you saying that that someone would have thought of the antimatter bomb (and been able to take the idea seriously enough to override short-term humanitarian instincts), or are you saying there is another catastrophic problem with dismantling the status of secrecy?

        > when the "rational" supergenius protagonist's *stupidity* nearly gets the world destroyed

        HPMOR, despite appearances, is not a story about a rational hero. It is the *origin story* of a rational hero. It ends when that hero is *finally* starting to get his shit together.

          > HPMOR, despite appearances, is not a story about a rational hero. It is the origin story of a rational hero. It ends when that hero is finally starting to get his shit together.



          That's a fair assessment, though I think it's easy to lose that point in the way that Harry often seems to think he has everything figured out. He's so sure of himself almost all the time, and the plot usually rewards his actions and beliefs. So it's often difficult to determine what the author's intentions are in showing us these often flawed points of views.

          In many cases a later event will come and show that Harry actually wasn't right about something, and you'll realize the author intended that. But often times the immediate pay off of Harry's self-righteousness is more weighty than his reflections on being wrong. 

          And it seems even at the end that he never really evolves beyond wanting to tackle all the world's problems on his own. And he still seems to trust his own judgement beyond that of those with many years of experience over him even after seeing how flawed his own judgement has been in the past.

          I think that is really my main problem with the story and it seems to be a theme with lots of rationalist fiction. It's the story of one flawed man trying to be rational all on his own, instead of realizing that big problems are often better solved through collaboration.

          Note: there are some scenes in HPMOR that highlight that Harry's unwillingness to rely on others is a weakness, not a strength, but it seems as if he never puts the lesson into practice.
          ```

          - u/Roxolan:
            ```
            I think the payoff for most of the story's lessons comes in chapter 119 (the meeting with all the important adults) and in the first half of chapter 122 (the final chapter; Harry's quiet reflections on "the magnitude of his own folly"). Ch.119 is the one where Harry is finally learning to cooperate and delegate.

            But I do fully agree with you that this is *very late indeed*. A lot of Harry's mistakes are called cleverness, or at least not explicitly called stupidity, for most of the story.

            A feature both of the young and of early bloomer geniuses.

            I think a lot of what you're saying (and I've seen it before) is that you forget that even though he talks like a professor, and has a more... mature soul, he's still 12. 

            He doesn't have the life experience, and one of the major plot points in the story is how goddamn bad he is at being *wrong* (unable to lose).

              ```
              I understand that that's  a part of his personality and I think it's a perfectly reasonable character trait to have.

              I just don't think the author did a good enough job of showing him overcome this issue.

              Edit: Not that I didn't enjoy the story as a whole. This is just a minor issue that I think could be improved on, especially since part of the stated goal of the story is to help teach rationalist methods.

                Oh absolutely. To be honest, my favorite part of the story was the early stages and the War Arc, where Harry basically takes up the role of magical Ender Wiggin and hacks magical combat for all its worth. 

                The (actually quite funny) comedic angle combined with the intrigue and ingenuity was wonderful.

            You know, it's often pretty funny how the real world works.  You can grow up completely arrogant and convinced you know everything, and of course reality will slap you on the face for that.  But you can also grow up convinced that the real world is run by Adults, who Know What They're Doing and Have Their Shit Together, and the reality will *also* slap you on the face for *that*.

            As it turns out, the world is run by overgrown 5-year-olds who're all desperately hoping that if we stick to our specialties where everyone else gives us social proof that We Know What We're Doing, *nobody will notice* how wildly ignorant and disorganized *we actually feel inside*.

        They explained it just fine in the original HP books: without the Statute, the Muggles would basically enslave wizard-kind to provide magical solutions to their problems.  Secrecy, for wizards, is a matter of human rights.

        >When a "rational" protagonist is so irrational that even though they are super smart they still miss obvious things like Quirrel being evil (which Hermione got right away despite her not having rationality training like Harry had), when the "rational" supergenius protagonist's stupidity nearly gets the world destroyed

        Actually, I think this *was* part of the intended message: "the simple, obvious, boring hypothesis is most often the correct one; so while Dark (Slytherin) Is Not Evil *sounds* like an interesting trope subversion *in a story*, if you actually meet someone obviously Dark (Slytherin), they *are*, most probably, Evil (Dark Wizard), and you should stop rationalizing away evidence that they're not just because you fanboy over their awesomecoolness."

        I mean, the guy *is* prone to writing lengthy essays on how in the real-world, the truth is usually simple and we call things boring because they're actually highly probable.

        The problem was that in stories, ie: fanfics, awesomecoolness overrides almost everything else, so the *readers* were fanboying over Quirrell *more* than the characters were, which made the message fall flat.

        I remember /r/hpmor collectively palming its face and going, "Oh OF COURSE Quirrell was evil!  He was Lord fucking Voldemort, after all!  How did we *ever* get fooled into thinking he was *merely* a 'Light-side Slytherin'!?"  And there was much joy among the Sunshine Regiment that day, for we had been right all along.

    It is reasonably likely that the author of The Waves Arisen is Yudkowsky.

      I thought this as well for a while, but the timing doesn't work out on it being him (it would have been started before he'd finished HPMoR, during his last sprint of writing it). Also, the character of the references are not his style, and there are a couple minor things treated approvingly that he viscerally hates in a way that is reflected in his writing. (IIRC, one of those was bees; EY cannot write about bees approvingly and would not feature Killa Bee as a larger character than necessary.)

  HPMOR is a tract for "rationalism".

  Different people have different ideas about what constitutes "rational" fiction. Some consider "rationalist" and "rational" to be part of the same spectrum, synonyms, or separate genres. Some require the characters to have rationality or rationalism as core goals, others just want the world to have "hard SF" levels of internal consistency. That last is where I find myself. I consider _Worm_ rational, for example, because the irrationality of the characters is driven by a rationally derived plot point that's a core part of the universe, and characters are realistic and as rational as they can be within the bounds of that constraint. Rationality, in _Worm_, is a useful tool that is likely to lead to a successful outcome.

It's tone, style, content, and characters, are as different to HPMOR as could be imagined, but it fulfills the pitch above and a lot of people I've rec'd it to seem to like it.

  I think it depends a lot on the source material, in the case of fanfic.

  HPMOR deviates hard from the canon flavor, and yes, becomes ‘preachy.’ TBH I read it mostly for the audacity of the gambits.

  *Lighting Up the Dark* (Naruto) is a very fine example of rational fic that doesn't end up being preachy — mostly because it is about the process of *becoming* a rational thinker. In it, it is *commonplace* that the main characters get schooled by their betters. It has the amazing gambits of HPMOR, without the annoying protagonist.

  My own work *The World is Your Oyster, The Universe is Your Namesake* stays very true to the source material of *Steven Universe* — to date there isn't a character characterizable as rational*ist* in it. (Will come at a later date— whoops, spoilers!) Mostly it is some people with a lot of emotional baggage who talk it out like reasonable folks, and try to save the world as best as they can.
