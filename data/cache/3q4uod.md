## [D] Mr. Yudkowsky on the lack of munchkinism in Worm

### Post:

Original ([source](https://www.facebook.com/yudkowsky/posts/10153717992824228), [archive](https://archive.is/t9t4E)):

> I'm starting to have trouble reading Worm fanfiction about Panacea without my mental screaming drowning out the words. Her underuse of her powers is maybe the worst in that universe, short of Eidolon. It's like if Contessa was using her Path to Victory only to win at blackjack. Panacea is "total control over biology, including the ability to create new organisms with new complex abilities or immediately alter a virus to reverse its effects" being used to "heal physical injuries at a local hospital". There's a reason she's psychologically crippled in canon, the same reason Bonesaw and Siberian are in the Slaughterhouse Nine. If you have a non-crippled Panacea in your story, there is no story! By the time your story starts she's already made a virus that cured cancer, and designed trees that would grow sushi in a desert from seawater, and altered some humans to live outdoors on Mars, and maybe built an intelligence-enhancing bacterium, and converted irredeemable capes into her loyal minions by touch brain control, and bribed others to participate in Endbringer battles by converting them into immortal youthful supermen...

> Characters in Worm whose powers suffice to easily take over the world: Eidolon, Glaistig Ulaine, Panacea, Contessa, Bonesaw (instantly); and then Number Man, Dinah, Accord, Tattletale, Coil, Leet, Andrew Richter, Teacher, the Yang-ban... I've probably forgotten like half of them. I wonder if a prerequisite of a work generating an enormous quantity of fic is an enormous amount of untapped potential.

> Sigh. Maybe it's not a fair complaint. Out of the whole Forbes 400, nobody except Elon Musk makes any attempt to live up to the potential of their power, and nobody around them notices anything odd. It *should* be the bug-control girl that ends up as the hinge of destiny. You *should* have to go that far down the cape list to find one Munchkin.

> To be clear, I wasn't criticizing Wildbow. The original Worm does what it sets out to do as well as any story possibly could - it's trying (successfully) to be the Superhero Story To End All Superhero Stories, the category killer for its category, that doesn't let you ever look at superhero stories the same way again; the same thing I set out to do with HPMOR and Harry Potter fanfiction. Wildbow is rationalizing and therefore of necessity *preserving* every aspect of traditional superhero stories, including Reed Richards Is Useless, excusing them and lawfulizing them as hard as he possibly can (and no harder). Even so the power balance in Worm is ludicrous but there's no way a human-level author could possibly avert that, given that they were trying to rationalize something akin to the Marvel or DC multiverse to start with; you just can't have economic balance or the weakest inexploitability given that many different superhero-level powers. Wildbow has thrown on at least four layers of inhibitors to try to rationalize why his Earth goes on spinning despite that, and that's the most he can possibly do without changing the nature of his universe.

> What makes the voices start shrieking in my head is when I read a fanfic that's unaware of this, and depicts happy cheerful sane Amy not taking over the world (nor being attacked by the Simurgh or blocked by Contessa).

  ```
  1. If she were going to do that she'd probably get Simurgh'd before the story begins.

  2. It's possible her shard induces psychological limitations on its use, since her biological father and shard-sharer also made strict rules/restrictions for himself.
  ```

    ```
    Shards have outright fucked with people and Wildbow cites Nilbog as an example of a shard subtly shaping behavior to achieve an end (Nilbog's shard was supposed to serve a goal beyond "end the world" so he stays put)

    And she's fucked in the head. You have to take a story for what it is sometimes. Panacea is just not that character, which is fine. 

    If this was a comic book, with a bunch of writers trying to justify dumb conceits foisted on them by the Comics Code (but-but it's more rational for Batman to not kill the Joker honest!) then I'd be infuriated too. But the narrative never acts as if there's anything noble there, in fact, it's the opposite.

    It gets even worse when he says that people like Number Man aren't achieving their potential because they're not taking over the world. That's just outright dumb, given Number Man's goals.

      This right here is why I so strongly dislike Worm.  It's an entire slew of interlocking narrative cheats designed to excuse absolutely anything.  Villains wearing spandex and robbing banks instead of CuttingLexLuthorACheck?  The shards did it!  Character not living up to his potential?  The shards did it!  Every single person carrying the Conflict Ball?  The shards...you get the idea.  This is not an example of good writing.  And then, of course, the entire thing is grimdark without any relief.

      It frustrates me so much.  The only thing that frustrates me more is that so many smart people love it; it's very unlikely that I'm the only sane man, so I wish to heck I knew what it was that all of them see that I don't.

        It's one of those things that bothers me about Worm, but I just push it to the side as one of those things that I don't really *have* to like. I mean, there are lots of other works of fiction that just take the whole "capes and superpowers" thing as their conceit and run with it, without feeling the need to add in lots of justifications. Worm adds those justifications in, and for me it doesn't really work, but I don't find this to be too much worse than if that justification weren't there at all. Obviously YMMV.

        The persistent darkness is a much bigger issue, partly because there are so few breathers.
        ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Except, barring extreme cases like Nilbog characters have clear reasons for what they do. Take Taylor's intractable issue with Tagg: you can't blame it on shards EDIT: Or rather, it's totally explicable in terms of character motivations.

        In fact, I wonder how often we'd hear this complaint if Wildbow had never mentioned shards in the Nilbog WoG or had abruptly stopped the story before getting into the origin of powers.
        ```

      - u/sanctaphrax:
        ```
        The endless shard justifications mostly show up in fan discussions. If they were all over the story, I'd like it a lot less.

        Honestly, you don't need space magic to get the original Undersiders to be criminals. Robbing people is actually a sensible way to make money if you have Grue's powers and live in a disintegrating nation where the police have thoroughly lost control.

        Similarly, plenty of people fail to live up to their potential in real life. And the conflicts in the story mostly feel organic. At least in my opinion.

        But fans, for whatever reason, love to talk about the entities.

        As for the darkness...how dark it is is a matter of opinion, and how dark it should be is a matter of taste. Maybe it's just not your thing.

          > Honestly, you don't need space magic to get the original Undersiders to be criminals. 

          You kinda do, for most of them. 

          Regent, yes. He was a bad guy, I find it completely believable that he was a criminal. 

          Maybe Grue goes bad...maybe. I never really understood why he chose villain,  and I'm pretty sure there are more lucrative things to do with superpowers, although I'd have to think about it. Seems more like alien space worms than common sense to me. 

          Imp only went bad because she followed Grue. 

          Tattletale should have been insider trading or front running stocks. What she was doing -- highly visible street crime for comparative pennies -- was ridiculous for a smart character whose power was information. 

          I never got why Bitch was an active villain, other than "these people are my pack and they want to be villains."

          Taylor...well, Taylor was just a bit of an idiot. If she wanted to make a difference, she chose about the least effective way to start doing it. And then she only went villain because Armsmaster was likewise an idiot. If someone tells you they're going to infiltrate the bad guys but can't tell you too much...go with it. At the worst they are a criminal who is already on your radar. At best they can actually bring down a group. 


          > and live in a disintegrating nation where the police have thoroughly lost control.

          That's got it the wrong way around. The nation has disintegrated (if it has) because so many capes have decided that the best way to make money is to rob banks. There are so many better ways to achieve power and/or wealth, all of them either perfectly legal or illegal but white collar and not at all visible. Again, why isn't Tattletale just doing insider trading / front running stocks? 

          In the real world, sure, there will be some crazies and some psychopaths who actively want to commit violent, highly visible crime.  (It's unlikely that they will want to do it in spandex, though; that requires alien space magic.) There will not, however, be anything like the number that we see.  To the extent that society collapsed in Worm -- however much that might be -- it wouldn't do that in reality, because there would be far fewer bad guys so not as much authorization. 

          Skinhead groups and other cults led by evil capes? Sure, right there with you. Random capes who just want to be criminals for money and power? No. 

          The society in Worm seems to be the way it is because Wildbow was working backward -- he wanted a particular setting and figured out how to justify it. Unfortunately, the justification required a series of things that all involved people not acting like normal people.
          ```

          - u/sanctaphrax:
            ```
            Tattletale's situation is a bit odd. If Coil hadn't found and recruited her, she might well have gone for something like insider trading. But I found the story of how she ended up there believable before I knew anything about shards.

            Grue needs money, the support of someone powerful (like Coil), and freedom. He doesn't trust the government, and his powers are not well-suited for business, so crime is really a good option for him.

            Rachel was a homeless drifter who accidentally killed someone, and who was raised by a succession of abusers. Hard to return to ordinary society after that.

            Anyway, I'm pretty sure Wildbow was working backward. But the way he did it seemed plausible to me. Early in the story, before shard stuff was on anyone's radar, it seemed plausible to me that society had been destabilized by parahumans to the point that "whatever, I'll take what I want with my powers" was a reasonable life plan.

            I guess it's easy for me to accept society being destabilized. Our civilization isn't that competent/durable, if you ask me. And superpowers represent a pretty big shock to the system.
            ```

          - u/KateWalls:
            ```
            One thing to keep in mind is that by 2011 in worm, there had already been over a decade of PRT propaganda and media campaigns about Hero vs Villain. They *designed* the system to work against "Rouges" (parahumans who use their powers legally but don't fight crime), it's only at the start of the story that the gov't starts to pivot and we see people like Canary and Parian. Before that, everyone who was born in 1990 or later would have grown up saturated with the idea of Hero vs Villain, and not necessarily in a way that deplored criminal activity. Outside Brockton Bay, Capes teams are viewed more like sports teams, a combination of MMA and NFL, perhaps. 

            So the fact that Taylor's first thoughts were of fighting crime and not joining the agricultural industry, is not surprising.
            ```

          - u/Frommerman:
            ```
            All of Tattle's extra clock time was being used taking down Coil. You know, the guy who was literally an Elder Scrolls player character, totally unafraid of death because he had savestates? Robbing banks when it gives you the opportunity to take over a criminal organization that large makes perfect sense. Also, Coil mentions in his interlude that the stock markets are protected from thinker influence, and that he could only get around it because his power went at an angle nobody thought to protect against.
            ```

      - u/OrzBrain:
        ```
        Other superhero stuff doesn't make sense. Worm makes sense *because* of all these cheats. If it didn't have them it couldn't be a superhero story that makes any sense.
        ```

      - u/TimTravel:
        ```
        This is a perfect example the following rule:

        > Mind magic is the enemy of character development.

        That is, magic should have read-only access to mental states. It's much more compelling if someone does something because they chose to than because magic made them do it.
        ```

        >so I wish to heck I knew what it was that all of them see that I don't.

        Basically, while it's not perfect it still does a whole hell of a lot better than almost any other story in the superhero genre of making sense. Turns out what a lot of smart people want to read is clever applications of superhero powers to defeat spandex wearing arseholes.

  >You should have to go that far down the cape list to find one Munchkin

  You're also forgetting that Worm isn't the best universe for munchkinry, by design. There are a few that can do it, but mostly it's far more limited than it'd seem.

  You know a good universe for munchkinry? Irredeemable. In that universe powers are natural and you can follow them to their conclusions. If someone can warp space, with enough know-how you can use that to crush planets and solar systems. If someone is pulling a whole bunch of Superman-style shenanigans, they're probably more than just a flying brick and can learn to go beyond that.

  Worm powers are artificial, sentient and *deliberately blackboxed and limited*. That sort of 'explosion-munchkinry" is not happening. People can and do use their powers rationally (Purity picks fights where her power is strongest, Jack uses Hookwolf as a vehicle for his power) but that's mostly what you'll get. Notice that Skitter is incapable of achieving explosion-munchkinry on her own, and she would have been even more hamstrung if two unrestricted capes weren't around for her to coopt. She was stuck with vanilla competence for the longest time.

  And this exists also on a societal level. New capes are coming, they have powers that you may not have accounted for, good luck taking over the world. The list of people that can do it is probably smaller than you imagine. Leet especially is someone touted too much. He is after all a natural trigger, and the whole point is that they can be threats, even massive ones,but they are there to provide conflict. He's not allowed to do anything and everything. In fact, there's absolutely no guarantee that his powers don't bottom out relatively early. That's the benefit  of shards as an explanation for powers: arbitrariness is now fine. 

  Then you have Endbringers, who can and will kill anyone getting out of hand and are engineered to be superior to just about any cape or any group of capes.

  >Characters in Worm whose powers suffice to easily take over the world: Eidolon, Glaistig Ulaine, Panacea, Contessa, Bonesaw (instantly); and then Number Man, Dinah, Accord, Tattletale, Coil, Leet, Andrew Richter, Teacher, the Yang-ban... I've probably forgotten like half of them. I wonder if a prerequisite of a work generating an enormous quantity of fic is an enormous amount of untapped potential.

  Some of these aren't even worth talking about tbh. "Taking over the world" is not really that important a goal for people in the know in Worm, for good reason. Why does Eidolon want to rule the world for twelve seconds (to someone with his potential lifespan)? Others just can't do it, Tattletale especially is a massive overestimation. As if the PRT doesn't have its own whole division of Thinkers.

  Worm deliberately shapes the world such that all the powers that can't be contained are more concerned with other things, or outright dead. I think it's generally quite thorough to the point of being hamfisted on this.

  Contessa is, imo, the biggest break-down point, which is ironic because she holds things together a bit (why did GU go to the Birdcage? Why isn't Bonesaw creating a zombie plague? Contessa is the final line of defense). She's so strong her limits aren't as good at justifying why she doesn't do certain things, unlike other characters.

  Also, you should have trouble reading Worm fanfiction about Panacea because they generally suck. Certain characters make better canon characters than fanfiction characters. See also: Coil.

    - u/Transfuturist:
      ```
      Munchkinry is not well-suited to a world where your own effectiveness can be used to destroy everything you love. Between a rationalist non-rational (munchkin) story and a non-rationalist rational (realistic) story, I would pick the latter. EY either doesn't consider the realistic consequences of rationalist characters, or he simply doesn't acknowledge them because he prefers munchkin beatdowns. [](#s "The Endbringers play nice because it fulfills their purpose, and if Panacea for instance actually tried to kill them, they would squash her (and her goals) like an insect. And then there's Scion.")

      That said, Worm itself has some problems. [](#s "The multiverse clairvoyant is the Deus Ex that enables the entire ending, and Cauldron was using them as a glorified taxi service. If they had actually used his power in conjunction with more useful powers than the Doorman... Well, I just don't see how Contessa's path was actually a lot shorter. The Simurgh was fucking with Cauldron as well and produced Echidna and the Siberian, but that doesn't seem to explain that *particular* problem.")

            Her path was so long because her power doesn't work on precogs, strangers, endbringers, or Scion. Her power is absurd, but the fact that Mantellum or any other similar effect can turn her into a baseline human makes things tough. I would argue that the only reason she seems so powerful is because she avoided all conflicts where she wasn't directly needed, keeping her power and weaknesses out of public knowledge. Sure, she could take down any of the Triumvirate, but if she actually tried to replace them she would be killed within weeks, either in an endbringer attack or by someone with a grudge and a high stranger class.

If it was simply a matter of the right power combination Eidolon might have soloed him. But Scion's combination of powers and precog makes almost all combinations about worthless. The narrative was set up for a very unlikely and fortuitous win more than one that could be predicted far earlier with competence.

They won by "bullying" Scion into not caring enough to follow the PtV. The key players were Oliver (made Scion depressed enough to not PtV\), Flechette (Open to Scion's dimension\), and Tinkers (Gun to destroy Scion's body\).

  SPOILERS for Worm. (It's almost impossible to discuss without them.)

  I don't have facebook, so I can't reply to EY directly, but:

  Firstly, the shards are deliberately given to people who *won't destabilize the cycle*. Secondly, shards influence their humans to cause conflict. Thirdly, most of these can't easily take over the world because the others with equally broken powers would stop them. Fourth, the Endbringers target anyone who's doing too well at fixing things. Fifth, most of the Capes mentioned aren't doing as badly as all that:

  The Number Man, Accord, Contessa and Dinah are already doing what's most important - using their Thinker powers to plan how to save the world.

  Coil is taking over a city, but chooses to be cautious that is takes a long time. Tattletale did end up one of the most important people in said city.

  Teacher was clearly working on taking over the world, and was reasonably clever at the attempt, but it didn't work out. 

  Richter - well, he was effective enough to get targeted by Leviathan. Who's to say he wouldn't have tried to fix things if he'd had the chance? Tinkers need time to work.

  You overestimate Leet. When they say he can build anything, they do not mean it literally, and WoG is that by the time he figured out his limitation, he'd already burned out a lot of the best tech he could make.

  Also, [there is Panacea fanfic in which she does that sort of thing](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/amelia-worm-au.13577/). I don't actually find it particularly enjoyable to read after the first few chapters.

  Edits: Added non-recommendation to my mention of *Amelia*. Fixed where I said Simurgh had killed Richter - it was Leviathan. Added futile spoiler warning.

  Ok, so Richter, Accord, and Bonesaw explicitly have (and spend much of the story working to overcome - well, substitute Dragon for Richter) shard-induced psychological limitations.

  Panacea's *whole character* is devoted to delivering the moral that an absurdly broken power is no use if you're a twit; so yeah, obviously she could be a god *if she wasn't a twit*. (For what it's worth, I think she's unrealistically bad at using her power, but then I also subscribe to the theory that her Shard was messing with her.)

  Number Man and Countessa basically do rule the world. Tattletale, the Yangban, and Teacher explicitly *made* their own bids for power; I think it's reasonably clear that their powers aren't that great, especially when you take into consideration that there are other people with powers out there opposing attempts to take over the world.

  Leets power is ... variable in strength.

  Eidolon, Glastig and Dinah believe, correctly or incorrectly, that there are bigger fish to fry than ruling the world.

  I don't know, I was actually quite impressed by the levels of thought displayed in Worm. Not everyone is a "munchkin", exactly, but they do seem to have devoted a level of thought to their ability that you'd expect from someone whose day job is using that power.

  To be clear, I wasn't criticizing Wildbow.  The original Worm does what it sets out to do as well as any story possibly could - it's trying (successfully) to be the Superhero Story To End All Superhero Stories, the category killer for its category, that doesn't let you ever look at superhero stories the same way again; the same thing I set out to do with HPMOR and Harry Potter fanfiction.  Wildbow is rationalizing and therefore of necessity *preserving* every aspect of traditional superhero stories, including Reed Richards Is Useless, excusing them and lawfulizing them as hard as he possibly can (and no harder).  Even so the power balance in Worm is ludicrous but there's no way a human-level author could possibly avert that, given that they were trying to rationalize something akin to the Marvel or DC multiverse to start with; you just can't have economic balance or the weakest inexploitability given that many different superhero-level powers.  Wildbow has thrown on at least four layers of inhibitors to try to rationalize why his Earth goes on spinning despite that, and that's the most he can possibly do without changing the nature of his universe.

  What makes the voices start shrieking in my head is when I read a fanfic that's unaware of this, and depicts happy cheerful sane Amy not taking over the world (nor being attacked by the Simurgh or blocked by Contessa).

      I disagree. I think seeing things from Taylor's perspective leads one to buy more into her character as the reason for victory. 

      Pretty sure she wasn't the only person doing this. In fact, her decisions in many cases didn't really help because the people who knew better weren't jumping in for a reason. 

      In fact,in many ways she did just really bumble about. The whole "go to jail" thing is a prime example, a complete miscalculation based on what information she did have but she doesn't see it because she wants to be a martyr.

      Taylor won because Wildbow stacked the deck in such a way as to help her win while rendering all her rivals for the victory ineffectual. Attributing it to dispositional factors and leaving out the situational ones is no bueno. And I don't just mean that on a Doylist level; see how that fight went, inside the story.

      Contessa or Eidolon don't have less willpower than Taylor, they don't care less about the Earth than Taylor. She doesn't win because she conceived of a sacrifice they couldn't imagine. There is no level of brutality or hardheadedness that Taylor could discover and sink to where she wouldn't already see the evidence of Cauldron's passing.  

      She won precisely because 1- they failed and 2- they can't do as she does (and not because they're dumb or weak either). Eidolon going Khepri is an extinction-event of its own, and it never seemed necessary or possible...until it was too late and he had already lost, precisely *because* he is stronger etc.  (Scion never felt a similar need to just precog-kill Taylor, though he did fuck with her with it) .  Not to mention that Wildbow sets up a situation where necessary bits of information are only available to Taylor once that has already happened.


      Maybe, on a Doylist level, that was what Wildbow was going for (self-sacrifice is worth more than sacrificing others) but I'll take a harsher stance than usual and say that he just failed, completely.

            In some other stuff he wrote, he made it pretty clear that HPMOR takes place in a universe where complicated plans are much more likely to work than in the real world. He doesn't think he could take over the world if he wanted to, he just thinks that a Quirrel who made the same choices he would would be more able to take over the HPMOR world. As a matter of fact, that point is made in the paragraph directly before the one quoted. He lives in a world much harder to optimize than the one Quirrel lives in.

            Imagine that HPMOR was instead a story about a power struggle in a kingdom of two foot tall gnomes that grant power to the person with the most martial prowess. Quirrel is a giant, at four feet tall. Eliezer comments that if Quirrel were as large as him, he would have an easier time of it. However, Eliezer is very aware of the fact that the real world isn't populated entirely by two foot tall gnomes who grant political power to the person most capable of beating them up, so of course he can't seize power in the real world simply by virtue of being taller than Quirrel.

            Quirrel exists in a world with different constraints that the one Eliezer lives in. The fact that Eliezer believes he would have advantages over Quirrel in that other environment does not mean he also believes he could do what Quirrel does in that other environment in our world. Eliezer selectively crippled Quirrel's ability to think, in order to prevent him from being too gamebreaking. So, a non crippled version of Quirrel would necessarily be more intelligent than the actual  Quirrel, and Eliezer can't be less intelligent than a fictional person who exists entirely in his head, as Quirrel can't think up a clever plan or solution that Eliezer couldn't also think up.

            In summary, Eliezer is correct when he says he is smarter than Quirrel. He actually expressly states that that fact doesn't mean he could do the sorts of thing that Quirrel can. You are attributing to him a belief he doesn't hold. There is actually a reason why being as smart as Quirrel doesn't mean he could take over this universe as easily as Quirrel could take over his, intelligence goes farther in the HPMOR world. And Eliezer knows that.

            Sorry if this seems a little combative, I just really don't like it when people get ridiculed for beliefs they don't hold. It's also possible I drastically misread the tone of your comment, in which case I apologize.

            Well, he clearly does contain Quirrell. He wrote him, after all. What he doesn't contain are the things that made Quirrell successful, namely, a story where there was always information available and things made sense, where that simulated iteration of Quirrel-conciousness was plugged into a subconcious model of the world he lived in, the HPMoR world, with access to data front-end rationalized after the fact - and where that model was able to interact with things multiple times, always doing the thing that wasn't stupid and consuming massive amounts of processing power spread over multiple iterations until it arrived at the best possible plan. The world works according to rational principles, sure, but it also contains several orders of magnitude more complexity than the setting Eliezer imagined and pitted Harry against. In the real world, you can get hit by a bus, die without meaning or cleverness, and be remembered with a funeral, a grave, and a brief but impassioned obituary. In the real world, people make mistakes.

      Firstly: revealed preferences are almost always *irrational*, reflectively non-coherent "preferences".  Secondly: all real agents are boundedly rational.  Just because you, with your budget constraints and information, can think of something they can do that is much greater than what they actually do, doesn't mean *they* can think of it, or that it lies within *their* budget constraints and information.

      This is why we have education instead of "Everyone just be smart now!".

          Assassinate the baby Gates, and you butterfly the first half-decade of the personal computer all out of recognition, and who knows what then happens.  A world that's a lot more Datapoint 2200 and a lot less Homebrew Computer Club could have a lot of knock-on effects on the "home computer" category and the adoption of computers in K-12 education, and subsequently, for example, on uptake of the Internet in the home.

        Actually, what most makes that possible is common APIs on a variety of operating systems on a network that he initially opposed. Windows adoption of internet protocols was slow and reluctant - Gates was all about local private LANs running proprietary protocols (NetBIOS, LAN Manager) linked together via online services (Microsoft Network) using telecom style protocols. If he'd been successful there, there would be no Reddit for us to be having this discussion on.

            People give Microsoft credit for all kinds of things they opposed and only reluctantly embraced.

        Gate's maximalist attitude to copyright (cf [Open Letter to Hobbyists, 1976](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Letter_to_Hobbyists)) carried along with his success has done *enormous* damage to the general purpose computation movement. If [Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) had pre-dated Gates, and his attitude of open-source, peer-reviewed, user-controlled software had prevailed over the MPAA and RIAA earlier (rather than Gates and to a lesser extent Jobs making common cause with them), I suspect that we would have advanced general computation by at least 10 years.

        The Jobs/Wozniak dynamic could have played out differently too; Wozniak, like most highly creative hacker types, was not interested in preventing other people from doing what he did. Quite the opposite, the early Apple computers were extremely well documented. Wozniak understood that creativity is stimulated, not held back, by sharing. He wanted to see what other people did with his devices, in order to build better devices himself.

Stallman has always been about *free* software, which has largely the same goal but isn't willing to compromise at all, or to indulge in marketing. Open source is a marketing campaign for free software, and it wasn't until that marketing started that free software actually made a difference in the mainstream.
