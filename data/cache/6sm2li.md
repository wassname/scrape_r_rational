## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

    > How could a modern society put an upper limit on accumulated wealth, while still incentivizing innovation?

    I'm not sure that wealth actually incentivizes innovation, beyond a point it just becomes a game token. Maybe explicitly gamifying control of corporations, maybe creating some kind of stock that's the opposite of non-voting stock, stock that has a controlling interest in the company but can't be sold except through some ludicrous tax process?

    A wealth tax?  

    On the one hand, I've never heard of one so I assume that there's something horribly wrong with them.  On the other hand, a progressive tax makes a lot more sense to me than a flat cap.  If the top wealth-tax bracket was 10%/year on any assets above $100m then it would act quite similar to a cap, but avoid some of the dangers of a rigid system.

      I think you will find that the thing 'horribly wrong' with them is that the people who have the power to introduce them would be the ones most disadvantaged by them. Not a lot of incentive there.

        Money is currently power. Nobles would, instead of accumulating wealth, acquire black market money, connections, and favors, being the nearest unblocked neighbor to wealth as an approximation of power. If you start taxing contracts by how much leverage they give each party on society, more mafia-like structures will have to form instead.

        I think you're already proposing a wealth tax, but it's a single step (0%@$74.9m, 100%@$75.0m).  I think a progressive system would be better, but I'm not sure about the exact values.  Maybe 1%@$5m, 5%@$10m, 10%@$20m, 15%@$30m, 20%@$50m, etc.

    Dunno how to solve this, but

    > *Would there be a benefit in establishing a class of nobility that gains power by achieving the cap?

    Unless spilling progressively more wealth into the government grants progressively more power (which you probably don't want to happen), there is no incentive to keep producing wealth beyond the cap.

    Something my late father told me:

    The Queen of England has kind of a deal like that. As I understand it the state gets all the income from her personal estates, and she gets all her expenses handled by the state. When Victoria set it up, she got the best side of the deal by far, but since then the value and income from the royal estates has increased immensely.

    Whats stopping those people from investing all their money back into their business? Or is the government going to force them from making their business better?

    Say I make 15mil. That's the cap.
    So from no on instead of keeping the money with me, anything I earn over the 15 mil cap I just put it back into the business. Buying more factories and equipment and such even though I no longer really need it but I can still justify it as a business expenditure.

    Personally, I still earn only 15mil. Can the enforcing agency prevent me from growing my business?

    Just have a progressive wealth tax that approaches 100% a $x->infinity in such a way that you can approach the money cap and get endlessly close, but can't actually reach it. Then you'll have people able to compete over how much money they have for prestige, but still not go over the cap. Now, this would still be a pretty terrible system, but technically works.
