## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  So! I started my new job the other day. Turns out for the next few months I'll be doing *fatal crash investigations*. Whenever there's a fatal crash, the team I'm on will have to attend the site within ~2-10 days and take measurements of the road and determine whether it was likely a road problem that contributed to the fatality. We have about ~70 fatalities in the metropolitan region a year (~160 state-wide, so for some remote crashes I'll need to go out there, which'll be great as our state is huge (bigger than Texas) and I have seen hardly any of it). Depressing when you think about it: I'll be light on work unless people die, but I suppose that's the nature of it...

  It's not exactly what I was expecting but it's *fascinating* and I can't wait. They're also going to give me training in becoming an expert at assessing roads for safety in general, and then in a few months when a new system comes online I'm going to start being able to come up with ways to "fix" routes and sets of intersections that have been statistically identified as being high risk for future fatalities.

  All in all, it looks like it's going to be a great change of scenery, the people I'll be working with seem fine!

    You could get into photography. Alaska is a beautiful state, and if you have to go out away from cities, you could get some really nice astrophotography experience. It will give you something to look forward to, when a drive out is more than just going to see where people died.

    If you haven't already, I recommend podcasts instead of radio for long drives. You can learn interesting topics from them, or simply tailor the stories you want to hear to your personal tastes rather than hear whatever happens to be on at the time.

      ... i'm not in Alaska, I'm in a completely different country! My state is also bigger than Alaska :). Only one state in the world is any bigger and that's some giant part of the Russian wilderness.

      And I expect to only travel 2 or 3 times in the 6 months I'm here, so won't be a huge issue, and I'll be travelling with my colleagues so you're generally meant to chat with one another.
      ```

      - u/sicutumbo:
        ```
        Huh. I was so sure it was Alaska. Bigger than Texas, a state, roughly half of a low number of yearly fatalities in the metro area (Anchorage has about half of Alaska's population)... I also wasn't aware that places outside the US referred to their subdivisions as states. Canada uses provinces, for example. A quick search says that you're in... Western Australia?

        Well, the advice stands. Photography would be a good hobby to pick up, and podcasts are nice. Talk to your colleagues, but I doubt that you want to spend the entirety of a long ride talking.
        ```

        - u/MagicWeasel:
          ```
          I've done long rides with colleagues before (4 hours) and... yeah, it was spent talking. It's kind of dull but yeah. People in the area were talking about one of the people in our team and all his great stories that he tells and how they'll miss him now he's going onto better things (which is why I have a job there so I guess no pressure to come up with quips?)

          I tend to listen to science / reality TV / true crime podcasts so maybe not something that would necessarily be "safe" to put on for all to hear, but something like This American Life or Radiolab might be OK. I tend to listen to everything at 2-2.5x though so listening to it on 1x speed for podcast-muggles would be infuriating.

          And good job guessing right once I gave you enough information to perfectly guess the location ;). And our main metro area has 73% of the population but "only" 40% of the fatalities... very sad.

          I will definitely be taking photos if we happen to see anything pretty! But alas there'd be minimal time for sight-seeing as apparently when we go regional, we do 12 hour days :| and the places the deaths occurred are probably not the same as the most pretty photo spots. Then again, sometimes the deadly stretches of road [are beautiful](https://thewest.com.au/news/augusta-margaret-river-times/caves-road-upgrade-plan-raises-concerns-ng-b88765934z). There was a fatality at the one mentioned in that article in the last few months (I think after the article was published), and people are up in arms about removing the pretty trees that are just constantly killing people. It's very sad to remove trees and that road is GORGEOUS (I drove it once looking for rare flora markers, but that's another story), but according to statistics 'the community' is willing to pay $7 million to prevent a fatality and those trees have killed pleeenty of people in their time.

    [](/flutterkay) ...you have *way* safer roads than we do.

    Whatever you're doing, it's clearly working and clearly saving lives. Keep it up. And remember - every time you're finding a road problem that leads to a fatality, you're saving someone's life and they will never even know you did it.

      ```
      > ...you have way safer roads than we do

      State population's about 2 million compared with the US population of 330 million and the Texan population of much-more-than-2-million so that has something to do with the number being so tiny!

      We actually fare pretty poorly compared with other states in Australia!

      That said, let's work it out:

      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_traffic-related_death_rate

      Australia has 5.2 deaths per billion vehicle kms; USA has 7.1. Per 100,000 population Australia has 5.4 and the USA has 10.6. 

      .... oh, wait, I forgot you're South African (25.1 deaths per 100,000) so you actually did have reason to be impressed! 

      That said, we still far behind the UK (2.9 per 100,0000) and many other European nations though. And, well, everyone's far, far ahead of Thailand (36.2 per 100,0000).

      Now I want to go to South Africa and check out the roads. I was constantly shocked at how bad the roads were in Thailand - really poorly maintained barriers in particular.

      - u/CCC_037:
        ```
        [](/twisad) I don't think that the *roads* are our problem. I think it's more the *drivers*. There's a... *lot* of History behind that. Some of which I can only speculate on.

        But, to make a long story short; one category of vehicle found on the roads here is the minibus taxi, which is (as the name implies) a minibus that acts as a taxi, picking people up and carrying them to pre-planned destinations in exchange for fares. What the name *also* implies around here (though I'm not sure how international these particular connotations are) is a complete and utter disdain for traffic laws.

        I don't mean just "ignorance of traffic laws" either. I mean the sort of drivers who will - regularly - drive up on the shoulder of the road or drive the wrong way up a dual carriageway to avoid a traffic jam kind of thing. They're not *deliberately* suicidal, but they'll do just about anything to get to their destination faster (thus obtain more fares). They'll treat traffic lights as polite suggestions and stop just about anywhere to on- or off-load passengers. (Often they'll at least *try* to pull off to the side of the road for that, if it's possible to do so at that point, but there are no guarantees).

        Of course, this applies only when they haven't seen a policeman watching (because being held up by a traffic official will waste even more time). But you can't have policemen *everywhere*. And even ordinary drivers will often treat a speed limit as a recommendation rather than a rule... and while the minibus taxis are the *worst* offenders in general, they are far, *far* away from being the *only* ones.

        But, by and large, I don't think our [roads](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&source=hp&biw=1364&bih=669&ei=4CdcW6KcGoedgAbG6LrIAg&q=south+africa+roads&oq=south+africa+roads&gs_l=img.12...0.0.0.2544.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1ac..64.img..0.0.0....0.GRES0l1T6Io) are the real problem.

          ```
          > I don't think that the roads are our problem. I think it's more the drivers. 

          History aside, the drivers are a product of the roads, of any public safety messaging there is, etc. Driver education programmes are something we do - now I'm sure a bunch of ads telling drivers that going quickly to get more fares is dangerous won't be successful, but if I was the czar of road safety messaging in South Africa (something for which I'm completely unqualified!), I might start introducing it to the school curriculum at a young age, if it's as bad as you say. 

          There's also ways the road could be modified to prevent some of the actions taxis are making: driving up on the shoulder can be prevented by installing either a crash barrier or even just a pedestrian fence. Red light cameras, even though those are expensive and enforcement isn't the best way to go about things. 

          > And even ordinary drivers will often treat a speed limit as a recommendation rather than a rule

          This is universal: you don't lower speed limits to slow vehicles down (I recall seeing that a 10km reduction in speed limit reduces vehicle speeds by 4km), you do "traffic calming" - install roundabouts, curves in the road, rumble strips, speed bumps, reduce visibility, etc. Not being local I'm not sure what sort of changes like this would actually wind up being helpful or stuck to, or if there's something that's common over there that I've never heard of. But those are the sorts of things I might try.

          (Oh, actually, if I became the czar of South Africa I'd probably ban the minibus taxis and replace them with actual bus routes since that might attack the route of the problem if minibus taxis are as large a portion of road accidents as you're implying. I'd also require bus drivers have special bus licenses and fancy GPSes on their buses that track adherence to speed limits. Also, while I was at it, I'd give every child a unicorn.)

      Having been at the slightly further up part of the chain (coming up with ideas and the first stage of implementing them), eehhh. We don't have the budget to do a lot of things, and political pressure comes into it too (ugh). But yeah, hopefully some of the intersections I've worked on will avoid deaths because of my work. It is what makes me proud to do what I do instead of working in the more lucrative mining sector.

  I’m not enjoying Stardust Crusaders that much. 

  This is a shame, because I quite liked Phantom Blood, and *loved* Battle Tendency, and now I’ve spent probably too much time trying to figure out what’s wrong. If I had to point to one thing, it’d probably be the pacing? It’s much more episodic than parts 1 and 2, and it feels like there’s been a lot of episodes I could have just skipped entirely without really missing anything. Also, the fact that each Stand User gets exactly 1 (or 2) episodes means that each episode’s pacing needs to stretch around that, which leads to what feels like a *lot* of padding.

  Or maybe it’s the characters? Admittedly, characterisation has never been JoJo’s strong suit but I’m 22 episodes in (which is almost the length of the last two parts put together) and the only character I’ve really been given any reason to care about is Polnareff. I still haven’t even the slightest clue who Kakyoin is, Joseph feels like a different character, Jotaro is… Acceptable, I guess, and Avdol I still don’t really have much of a grasp on either [spoiler](#s ', but he’s been dead half this time, so I’ll cut him some slack. Though his sudden blatantly retconned I-was-alive-this-whole-time thing really puts Polnareff’s development in a weird place, undercuts what I’d considered to be the highlight episode(s) of the series so far, and absolutely kills my ability to ever feel like any of these characters are in danger ever again. Which is weird, because I'd considered JJBA to be a pretty high-mortality series.')

  Parts 1 and 2 could get away with having weaker characters because there was always something happening to keep me hooked, but part 3 seems to expect me to enjoy just hanging around with these people for their own sake, and I really just don't.

  I don't know, I feel like I'm rambling, are there any JoJo's fans here who can give me reasons to keep watching?
  ```

  - u/SkyTroupe:
    ```
    I love JJBA and have read all the parts but Stardust Crusaders was definitely a slog to watch it. If you're getting tired of I try reading the rest of just skipping to part 4. The pacing for part 4 is much better. I find that the characterizations get better each part. My personal favorites are parts 6,7,&8. With Steel Ball Run being considered his magnum  opus. 

    For sure give 6 & 7 a try because the stands are incredibly creative and the characters are all unique and incredibly memorable. I think I read both parts in only a few sittings.

    The ending of part 3, from when they finally arrive in Egypt and confront Dio, is fantastic. The fighting, the animation, the emotions, all 100% JJBA love. If you enjoyed the Kars fight in Battle Tendency you'll love the Dio fight.
    ```

  - u/Fresh_C:
    ```
    I took a hiatus from watching Stardust Crusaders for the exact same reasons.

    The show started to feel completely different from the first two parts. It wasn't terrible exactly, but it began to feel more like a typical monster of the week anime, rather than a continuous evolving story.

    I haven't forced myself to continue watching it yet, though I probably will at some point. But I have heard the second half of Stardust Crusaders is better than the first.
    ```

    - u/SkyTroupe:
      ```
      The second half is significantly better as it goes more towards plot progression and setting up explanations without being info dumps. The last quarter of part 3 helps set up part 4 very well and does a good job of foreshadowing parts 5 & 6, as well as bits of 7.

      As always, I will recommend reading the manga as it flows faster. But the end of part 3 and part 4 are definitely worth watching because of the superb animation and music choices.
      ```

  As I already made a post on The Nightmare Stacks I didn't want to make another thread about it.

  So I just finished it and want to read more of the series. How similar are the rest of the books to it? Does book 8 cover Alex as the main character? Is the eater of souls a main character in one of the other books? Should I just go back to book 1 and start there?

  Similarly, Id love for book recommendations on similar stories to the Nightmare Stacks, anything Lovecraftian, or anything in the Biopunk genre (like Twig, which I haven't finished yet). Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.


  ALSO, I'm suffering from clinical depression. I'd really enjoy just having some people to talk to on a regular basis about anything. Even if it's just you telling me about your day or what you're doing in life. I often let myself get too distracted inside my own head instead of reaching out to people and I'm always worried that I'm just bothering those people so penpals would be great.
  ```

  - u/N0_B1g_De4l:
    ```
    In answer to your questions: the rest of the books have a pretty similar tone, Alex is back in book 8 but as a supporting character, the eater of souls is the main character of most of the books (not book 7), and I would recommend reading all of them, but you can skip the first two or three because it doesn't really start to have serious continuity until book four or so.

    Recommendations: I think if you enjoyed *The Nightmare Stacks* you'll probably enjoy the rest of his stuff. Probably start with The Merchant Princes series, because it's the closest to The Laundry Files. They're not terribly close genre-wise though. *Bitter Seeds* and sequels might scratch a vaguely similar itch.
    ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    I would recommend starting the series from book one which will give you background on some of the other characters and their evolution. They're all good books, but each covers their own things, and they share a lot of similarities in terms of style. Alex is first introduced as a character in the Rhesus Chart, but he's not a main character there.

    - u/scruiser:
      ```
      I’ll agree it dragged a bit, but The Yi Ti arc has several important developments.  Most importantly, I think Jofferey committing to staying and fighting even when he realized the Others might be able to permadeath was critical to his character development.  The length of the Yi Ti arc was needed to reach that point.
