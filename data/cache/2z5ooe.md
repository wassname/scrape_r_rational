## [D] Goddamn do I hate prophecies.

### Post:

There is no form of artificial plot advancement, no unnecessary McGuffin so odious and unimaginative as "The Prophecy." Almost every single story that has a prophecy or any kind of "precognition" in it could remain exactly the same, or be improved, by the clean removal of them. 

Need a reason to make this uninteresting character The Hero? Try a prophecy that forces them into the center of existence!

Need motivation for someone to do something they normally wouldn't do? Have YOU tried PROPHECY today? Guaranteed to utterly circumvent any sense of organic agency your characters might have!

Hey, how about those pesky worries that your characters or plot aren't engaging enough? Not to worry friend, we've all been there, and with just a little bit of PROPHECY thrown in, your readers will be HOOKED!

And that's not all! PROPHECY comes in many DISTINCT FLAVORS! 

**The Vague Prophecy**: Excellent for keeping your audience guessing as they try to decipher your cryptic, shitty poetry! This way you can either fulfill it or not, and still make it seem mystically wise in retrospect!

Example: "The White Queen will see red, when by dark hearts she's led." Is it her dark heart? Someone else she trusts? What does see red mean? Who knows?! Does the prophecy even matter? Not really!

**The Self-Fulfilling Prophecy**: Want to write an utterly predictable story no one can relate to? Just dress it up with some "deep" existential questions about free will that ultimately have no impact or moral wisdom beyond the scope of the by-the-numbers plot!

Example: The Dark Lord will be defeated by the child! But how!? Simple! Upon hearing the prophecy, they will attempt to undermine it, and somehow be hoist by their own petard! Everyone loves a Deus ex Prophecy!

**The Incomplete Prophecy**: Want to keep some artificial tension? Make your prophecy completely understandable and straightforward so that it ensures a lot of angst over a foretold tragic event, but have it leave out vital bits of information that renders it utterly meaningless!

Example: "You will kill your father." (But they end up dying from a painful disease or wound, and ask for a mercy killing! Hooray!)

**The Spoiler Prophecy**: One of the favorites, who doesn't love a good SPOILER right in the middle of the story? Now we know what you're thinking, aren't all prophecies spoilers in some regard? Not as much as this one, which serves NO PURPOSE other than to inform the readers, while keeping the characters ignorant! The trick is to make sure the prophecies have NOTHING to do with the character who hears/sees it, and they can't ALTER the outcome in any way! So not only is it utterly meaningless except to break the fourth wall, you don't even have to change anything in your story to fit it in! It's like it means nothing at all! ^nothingatall! ^^nothingatall!

Example: A bunch of dead people at a feast, their leader with a wolf for a head! What could it mean?! Nothing to the person seeing it, but ho ho, what a shocker it'll be for the readers once they get far enough in the story and come back to it! You clever writer you, dropping such discrete hints of the future plans you alone know and control!

That's right, with the power of PROPHECY, you too can elevate your subpar, generic fantasy and science-fiction into the over-used-tropesphere!

(**Note**: Any apparent reference to specific stories is almost completely coincidental, and not a remark on the overall quality of that story, prophecy notwithstanding. On top of which, fanfiction works are somewhat exempt from this criticism, as they usually have a source material that includes prophecies to abide by.)

So. All that said, does anyone have examples of stories where prophecies did none of the above?

  Now I want to see a story with an epic prophecy as the driving MacGuffin that drives every single person that knows that there *is* a prophecy, only for it to turn out to be complete bunk.  Sort of like the twist in the Lego Movie, only with it being bunk-er (that prophecy was fulfilled in the end, after all).

  I agree - prophecy tends to suck. If a character is doing everything because of prophecy, they basically don't have any agency, and worse, the author is often not compelled to make any of their actions make sense. This is my biggest problem with Worm and the Path to Victory shard. You can't criticize the actions of [](#s "Cauldron") because everything that they did was because it was the winning move, even when their actions looked incredibly stupid, nonsensical, etc. There's no agency to it. This has been on my mind in the past few days because of [HPMOR](#s "Dumbledore"), who has the exact same problem. Why X? Because prophecy said so. It virtually assassinates the character, because all of their actions - everything that they did - was done because of reasons that even they didn't understand. All interpretation shuts down immediately in the face of something like that.

  So with that said, I occasionally like prophecy if it can act in a time travel sort of way (because ***I love time travel***). Something like "The Skynet missile defense system goes online April 19, 2011, declares war on mankind and triggers a nuclear apocalypse two days later" is a compelling prophecy to me when it's treated like any other bit of information. It's not much different from saying "an asteroid will strike the Earth on April 19, 2011" in terms of what it does to the characters - it's preventable, avertable, and treated just like that, with the implicit "unless we do something" tacked onto the end.

  There are still a whole host of ways to misuse that though, as you've expressed.

    I was just explaining in a separate subreddit why chess grandmasters prefer to play other chess grandmasters, even if chess AIs can offer them, in strictly technical terms, more of a challenge.

    Chess AIs don't make the optimum move by finding an optimum coherent "strategy" and following it. Instead, they just search the solution-space as far out as they can, keeping track of the optimum move they figured out so far... and then do that "best-so-far" move they figured out. Effectively, they divine the future in their heads (which is possible if you live in a restricted deterministic game-world), prophesize their own success, and then act to carry out that prophecy.

    If you're a skilled-enough strategist that the AI isn't poking holes in your own strategy, and its ability to effectively prophesize is *the only reason it ends up winning*, then you end up both bored, and frustrated. At this level, whether you win or lose, you *don't learn anything*, because there's no pattern to its reasoning to figure out that'll help *you* advance!

    Dumbledore may have had that problem in-universe, but literarily, the puzzle was that we were supposed to deduce *the very fact* that he knew a zillion prophecies, which wasn't revealed until the very end. It's not like we were supposed to figure out what the purpose of Harry's father's rock was in Chapter 17, and it ended up being unsatisfyingly random; the randomness itself *was* the clue.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:

      It was definitely well foreshadowed. I think EY did the best he could in a world that already had such a place as a Hall of Prophecie, and managed to pull it off quite well.

    To be fair, Cauldron was following a specific Path to Victory, not the "winning" Path because of certain things that were blocked to the shard, such as modeling Scion.

    If I recall correctly, the path they were going on was "Path to highest number of active parahumans" or some such. So there's still quite a bit of arguing you can have on if they chose the most effective path. It guaranteed they would perfectly do whatever they set out to do, but is what they set out to do the most optimal path they could have taken?

      That is something that most people seem to miss about PtV- not only does it have limits (other precognitive programs, things that it cannot gather data on, etc.), but its effectiveness is determined by a computer. The ability to get any answer is rather less useful if you don't ask the correct question.
      ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Exactly. I will note that predictions are fine as long as they're honest: gained through justifiable means and subject to realistic uncertainty. It's mainly when it's a "Word of God" sort of thing that it's a problem, as you described.

      I've always been fond of Chrono Trigger/Dragonball-style time-travel metaphysics: effectively, time travel exists between the present and all possible divergent future timelines (for any given values of "present" and "future"), though only one future timeline is actively 'attached' to the present at any given time—the "default" one that happens if nobody else ever again, from this point forward, acts on information derived through time-travel. All future information comes from that particular future, time-travel *to* the future only goes there, etc.

      So you *can* have prophecies (information, or even people(!), delivered from "the future"), but just in the act of delivering them, the the quantum probability-mass is shifted away from the future timeline that information came from. It could shift toward another one that ends up looking *very similar*, if anyone in the present happens to think in terms of redundant back-up plans, but there's nothing forcing the present to "stick to" a given future timeline.

      On the other hand, this gets into the (in my opinion much more entertaining) questions of the anthropic value of people in alternate futures that could be "evacuated to" the present.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Yeah, that's definitely one way to do it that keeps things interesting.

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    (Spoilers for worm ahead.)

    I actually have my own theory about the PtV:

    Namely, that as an Abbadon shard, it was carrying some prior programming. Instead of just giving *the* PtV, it merely shows Contessa *a* PtV, that just happens to coincide with furthering the goals Abbadon set for it, including, but not limited to: the deaths of the native entity pair, the concentration of power under an organization run by parahumans, and the fostering of conflict.

    That being said, Contessa does retain some level of agency: the PtV shard only shows a single path towards victor,y, not necessarily the best path. Contessa and cauldron took on the role of optimizers, trying to corral the shard into giving them PtV's that maximally benefited humanity, while also setting up failsafes so that even unexpectedly powerful trigger events (as trigger events force the PtV to recalculate) don't force cauldron into choosing an overall less beneficial path.

  In a sort-of-fantasy setting I've been mulling on and might eventually do something about, "Prophecy" is a system which is a legacy (one of many) of an ancient and now absent civilization that's basically a warning system about dire future events. The system isn't perfect at all, of course - this depends on how exactly you define 'dire event'. That would come into play.

  There's the twist that few if any prophecies ever come true - they would only come true if they hadn't been made. Prophecies, so to speak, tend to avert themselves simply by existing, and change the course of history with few people being any the wiser - they're not given much credit for being true, anyway, since they are by their very nature extremely avertible.

  It's not a crucial feature of the lore, in any wise, but it *is* a background fact which shapes many parts of the story I might eventually set in this setting (who knows - I've a dozen other ideas competing for attention). Once the characters catch on to this fact, they will make quite a few useful deductions and then proceed to do their own thing entirely with this information. (Edit 2: In fact, they will abuse the hell out of it.)

  Would you object to prophecy used in that sense?

  Edit: And to more directly respond to the topic question, I don't *think* this fits under any of your categories.

  - u/DaystarEld:

    Prophecy as a form of prediction based on data available to people is perfectly fine. If it's handwaved how exactly the prophecies are made, that might also be fine as long as they're not treated as infallible, as you say :)  I would at least be interested to see how you play around with the concept.

  My favorite use of this device is the future telling abilities of Agnes Nutter, Witch, writer of Nice and Accurate Prophecies. From Good Omens by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman. Also the horoscope given for the world because the Earth was a Libra, in that same book. These were used as plot devices a couple of times, and were used to occasionally foreshadow lightly, but were more for comedy than to seriously drive the plot.

    Using prophecies in comedy or for comedic purposes is a fairly different ballgame, yeah :)

  Well, I disagree. Strongly.

  Information from the future is an interesting Speculative Fiction problem to deal with. It just is. I like reading time travel stories, and prophecies allow for a particularly limited version you can interject into any fantasy universe that doesn't have to consume the entire damn plot of the story.

  Precognition often serves to make the Chosen/Unkillable Hero a lot more logical in-universe (this *is* /r/rational, right?) This might be bad if it did so by killing the narrative flow or whatever, but prophecies are actually one of humanities oldest tropes, and were well-codified before we had writing IIRC. They are clearly effective storytelling, from a practical point of view.

  And, of course, from a [RST] rather than purely [RT] perspective, dealing with prophecies and time travel when You Can't Change The Future allows for all sorts of educational Newcomb's Problem variants and expounding on varieties of Timeless Decision Theory. A perfect predictor streamlines away the "what if I can trick them/what if they're too smart to trick" issue with normal TDT situations, and makes everything much clearer and a better message.

  You could easily tell a thousand distinct, brilliant, *Rational* stories centred around prophecies and precognition.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    >Precognition often serves to make the Chosen/Unkillable Hero a lot more logical in-universe 

    True, it's possible to make otherwise illogical tropes *more* logical through prophecy, but that doesn't make it compelling, to me, because  ideally if your story really is about an average joe who ends up helping save the world, giving them personal stakes in doing so is much more interesting and engaging.  

    I don't really care that it's a time honored and widely enjoyed trope, to be honest. There are a lot of things people like that I don't, and lots of things I like that people don't, and that's all fine.  I prefer characters with as much agency as possible, as relateable as possible, and the point is, none of us are ever going to be approached by a wizard one day, handed a magic sword, and informed of our destiny. Nor have any of the great men and women in history been destined from birth to be great.

    We choose our destiny: life happens to us, and we decide how we respond to it. When I say that the best stories follow reality in this respect, it's because the best stories can inspire us to be better, and personally I can relate to their struggles far more than those of people who are compelled to save the world because God said they would.

    > Information from the future is an interesting Speculative Fiction problem to deal with. It just is.

    You can have a technology/force/law of physics that is interesting to reason about, but which nevertheless inherently decreases the fun-theoretic value of universes containing it. Unless the story specifically is *about* that thing, contrasts life before and after it, and so forth, all you'll end up with is just "stories set in a universe constrained to be less entertaining than would otherwise be possible."

    For another example: Culture Minds are neat. But a story *setting* where they exist, is one where the heroes have less agency than they would in a setting without them. The story could be interesting if the Minds were *themselves* the main characters... but they're very likely not, just as unravelling the metaphysics of prophecy itself is very likely not the plot of a story with a prophecy in it.

  Personally I enjoyed the prophecies in Wheel of time. This was mainly because the main prophecy was incomplete and a bit vague but everyone tried to spin this fact to their own advantage. There's also the fact that The prophecy could just straight up fail completely because the "wheel" (basically the thing that keeps fate and the universe going) would be broken.
  ```

- u/TofuRobber:
  ```
  The spoiler prophecy sounds like a form of foreshadowing to me and I think that's fine. The point of a story is to entertain it's readers and if the readers are given information ahead of time there is a thrill from knowing what to expect and also not knowing how the characters will react; It's the journey not the destination. There are valid points in giving the readers information that the characters don't have. For one, it builds anticipation, two, It gives the readers a chance to figure out what might happen, and three, It gives direction the the story. In practically all hero stories, we already know that the "good guys" will win. But, when we get a little bit of information about how it's going to happen, it excites us. Sure it may or may not give the characters anything, but for a novel as a whole it has good merits, at least I think so. Or, maybe I'm getting the wrong impression from your description and completely missed the point.

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    I agree for the main reason that Dinah's prophecy was worded as a "If P, then Q" type of statement. The prophecy was a clear statement on what will happen if a certain event occurs. This kept the absoluteness inevitability prophecies have while still allowing characters to have the chance to stop event P to prevent the disastrous consequence Q from happening.

    I disliked it for the second reason stated: it just artificially propelled characters to do things that they normally wouldn't have done, namely try to stop him at all costs and at a much higher priority than they normally would have. Not to mention what HE began to do once he heard of it himself.

    It would have been far better if he'd independently thought to do something that would have that effect anyway, and they found out about it and tried to stop him. Same actions, same results, but no prophecy necessary.

  I'm contemplating prophecy as relates to time shenanigans lately (periodically in the last few years).

  My approach at present is that the prophecies are artificial tools, constructed to create the actual outcome desired.

  They are literally only as trustworthy as the party who created it and bothered to send the message back.

  Nothing in prophecy is clearly certain to those that receive or send them back.

  And those that blindly obey prophecy' dictations are about as interesting/important in the world of a time traveler as a loyal slave is to a prophecy author.

  Which is to say there are actually a lot of prophecies and their used horribly to exploit enormous quantities of populations across time and space just because it's convenient to those who want work performed in the past for their own benefit.
  ```

- u/Meneth32:
  ```
  I think prophecies are equivalent to time travel, and prophecies that always come true are equivalent to Stable Time Loops. They send information far into the past (or pull information from far into the future, depending on your point of view).

  In a universe that allows time travel, causality goes out the window, so everything that happens is author fiat.

  Time travel can be a lot of fun (at least in short one-shots), but you shouldn't try to write adult stories that feature it. That, I think, was the biggest mistake of HPMoR.

  I'd agree prophecies are overused and sometimes not done well at all. But like every other trope, they are only bad if used poorly or if used in bad writing. Let me give you a fifth category, though it may not be very common: Prophecy as a vision of what some powerful NPC being *wants*, or what is "supposed" to be. In my own writing, prophecies (Which come in visions, not words) are the product of an unconscious force of destiny trying to bend human behaviour by showing 'futures' to leaders and those around them.

  >So. All that said, does anyone have examples of stories where prophecies did none of the above?

  Not yet. I'll certainly ask the subreddit for input when I have a first draft.

    Now *that's* interesting: the utility function of any sufficiently-powerful optimization process would just "ripple backward through time" and make its desire for paperclips et al known before it exists to demand them.

    This would sure be a convenient world for the optimizer—it would effectively be given the opportunity to execute Roko's Basilisk-like bargains, even with creatures that would never otherwise think to model its utility-function; they would just be "inspired" with it.

    This seems like the kind of world the term "Lovecraftian horror" actually should apply to.

      There are very few tentacles in my world, but possibly there might be an itsy bitsy bit of existential horror here and there.

      Destiny doesn't reach back from the future, but it is capable of predicting some things, especially when they are important enough to warrant its full attention. It, uh, it might also be the case that souls in my world are not so much pure mind as they are destiny latching onto human brains and trying to nudge them. ...That won't be known to the reader, but it makes talking about the world easier. Destiny is capable of predicting the future fairly well because it can see the long term plans of every faction and player. It still makes mistakes, but mostly because a few NPCs and a villain has figured out how to send Destiny false signals.
