  Yet more confirmation that Rain's build isn't an unknown. The Empire has used lower-level and more specialized versions of it to conquer quite a lot of the world. If that doesn't count as a meta build, I don't know what does.

    I think the mine dungeon name was a bit of a hint as far as the world's system is concerned. Remember how the name started as generic, then switched around a bit as people figured out what to call it?

    Now, consider the various Empire of <whatever> auras, and the fact that the world has an infamous Emperor. I think we may have an idea what the Emperor's build grew out of.

      Nice insight.

    ```
    There are a few paths/plotlines that I see opening up. For one, the way he's unlocking every skill tree available is reinforcing his "soul", and there was a scene about how the Guard's lie detection didn't work as well on him because of it. I think once he unlocks everything available, it will unlock a special class at the level 25 upgrade point. 

    Also the scene about how he's speculating about how someone could learn the weapon Katas through practice (without the skills) leads me to believe he'll train to upgrade his staff fighting the old-fashioned way.
    ```

    - u/xachariah:
      ```
      On the one hand, I don't think Rain needs to get a ultra-legendary class because monolithic clarity already has a known legendary upgrade that he's on track for.  It's a bit like him becoming a double wizard.  

      On the other hand, I really wanna see Rain get that **Ultra-Legendary** upgrade.  I want to see those stats to GO UP.

    It's not the same build, though.
    ```

    - u/DoubleBullfrog:
      ```
      Yes, Rain has been forced into picking up Offensive Auras due to the lack of a reliable and trustworthy party. That's not the true power of the build, though. It's always been the massive mana regeneration combined with Utility Auras and especially the ability to constantly keep Winter active, even as far back as chapter 15 when it's revealed that's the reason Lavarro let him tag along to the mine. Beacon slaves aren't going to have exactly the same build, because they're kept low level so they have to be very specialized with their few skill points and they aren't allowed to have offensive skills so they can't escape, but the core principles seem very similar.
      ```

      - u/xachariah:
        ```
        I think the bigger part is that he's a Dynamo with monolithic spirit.  I know the empire uses monoliths a lot more than other countries, but there's no reason to assume they use *only* monoliths.  This is speculation since we haven't seen the Empire yet, but I think the empire slaves are part of the Worker (noncombat) class instead of Dynamo.  

        They get a raw boost of 50% better auras immediately, and Dynamo doesn't actually benefit them at all.  It gives them more mana, but if they're just using winter or other auras they'll have more than enough mana for that.  Force shield slaves also exist, but those would benefit more from int for the mana pool.

        Since slaves can do their job arguably better by being a Worker and a Dynamo is a known (if rare) combat risk waiting to happen, they might even intentionally prevent them from being able to follow that build.
        ```

        - u/Veedrac:
          ```
          FWIW it's really not clear to me that Dynamo is even the right class for Rain. Animus would be a lot stronger as long as he could adjust to Winter. (Though Animus is generally busted because of Magical Synergy. idk)
          ```

          - u/burnerpower:
            ```
            My understanding is that Animus are borderline non functional most of the time because of their crippling lack of mana. I think an Animus aura build would just be terrible. He'd make his already problematic mageburn worse and would have zero mana for things like force ward or other support effects. Hell the mana cost from using Winter would probably overpower its benefit. (I believe that was true for Rain early on despite his dynamo build.)
            ```

            - u/Veedrac:
              ```
              > My understanding is that Animus are borderline non functional most of the time because of their crippling lack of mana.

              That's the story explanation, but it's not reflected in the mechanics; Synergy means that an Animus at Rain's level with his stat boosts (+29 to both Focus and Clarity) will have 41,500 mp and regen at 11,500 mp/day. For context, Dynamo Rain has 7,500 mp and regens 22,000 mp/day.

              A non-monolith with 50/50 Focus and Clarity would have 9,000 mp but regen only 6,000 mp/day! That's **less** than an Animus! There's an argument to be made as a result of this that the class boost for Animus might only be +100%, rather than +200% for Dynamo, but that still leaves an Animus with 8,000 mp/day regen, still more regen than a non-monolith.

              This is already plenty of mana for general use, though it'll take three to four days to regenerate from empty, but then we take into account that Rain still has Winter. With that active, a +200% Animus Rain would regen at 125,000 mp/day, and a +100% Animus Rain wolud regen at 86,500 mp/day. This is plenty to justify wanting the much higher mana caps.
              ```

              - u/xachariah:
                ```
                Honestly the only thing I can think of is if Intrinsic Clarity / Magical Synergy doesn't give protection from mana burn.

                In that case you could regen 86,500 mana but it'd kill you since you only have 10 'real' clarity.  

                As a side note, I want to see Rain mess up somebody using mana burn.  Essence well dumping 10k mana into somebody who doesn't use mana (like Velika) should do a number on them.
                ```

              - u/burnerpower:
                ```
                Well I haven't done the math so its possible the author has messed up. For now though I'll take the explanation at face value that animus's do actually have noticeable mana issues.
                ```

          >  but I think the empire slaves are part of the Worker (noncombat) class instead of Dynamo. 

          I was wondering if "beacon" isn't actually the name of a class. If you think about it, Rain is getting a lot of power from modifiers, their slaves probably don't have the skill points to do that. A beacon class could help make up the difference.
          ```

          - u/RetardedWabbit:
            ```
            Especially if it was something like: "Beacon - Increased aura range/power, you no longer benefit from your own auras" makes them more useful to the Empire and less dangerous if they try to escape. 

            It would also help explain why everyone thinks auras and especially aura builds are awful.
            ```

      - u/Veedrac:
        ```
        Offensive auras makes sense. His only other option that isn't obviously bad is to getting more defensive auras, but that's of only niche applicability until he gets Prismatic Intent, by which point he's spent five points in Offensive anyway.

        I think you're missing the game plan here. Rain's only a support build in the short term.
        ```

        - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
          ```
          Rain's offence will be AOE specialist. Great if you need a horde cleaned out, but weak against a powerful single monster like a blue.
          ```

          - u/Veedrac:
            ```
            Rain's build goes off the rails at level 25/26 with the ‘Legendary’ class boost. He won't be weak against anything.
            ```

            - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
              ```
              You're assuming that other well built legendary class boosts aren't equally powerful, without having their offence specialised into AOE.
              ```

        - u/burnerpower:
          ```
          I mean, he's still a support build. Just at later levels he becomes a little more self sufficient. Still weaker than an equally optimized and equal level selfish build. He even theory crafted one earlier in the story. (The all passives build I believe.)
          ```

          - u/Veedrac:
            ```
            At level 25 Rain's skills have their level caps raised to 15, which has a cascading effect and results in all his abilities getting ~20x as strong. At level 26 Prismatic Intent kicks in, which allows him to use all his abilities at once, and he becomes utterly broken.
            ```

            - u/burnerpower:
              ```
              Sure. He'll be strong if he can get there. We don't really know anything about how high level builds really function though. Its perfectly possible that Rain won't be particularly notable if all builds are getting similarly broken bonuses at that level while also not wasting a bunch of skill points on support effects.
              ```

- u/Bowbreaker:
  ```
  So I know that the physical effects of heat and cold obviously cancel each other out. But what about the raw numerics of heat *damage* and cold *damage*? If Rain were to switch between the two auras every 1-2 seconds, shouldn't the damage remain the same, but with much less collateral and self harm? At worst he'd also lose the status effect of immolating/slowing his enemies, but that doesn't really matter in situations like the one in this chapter.
  ```

- u/BoojumG:
  ```
  It's nice to see Rain get to be a bit of a badass for once. This "mageburn" from his Immolate and Refrigerate auras making the air too hot or cold to bear is seriously limiting his attack power though.
  ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    It won't be limited for too long, once he gets more levels he will be able to use 2 auras at once. Then he could just have a large range immolate aura and a short range refrigerate aura active at the same time to keep his surroundings at normal temperature while everything further away bursts into flames. (Switch them around for freezing instead.)
    ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      Has the author ever mentioned what would happen if he just rapidly switched between the two auras at equal power? I mean clearly there's still a difference between the environmental effect and the actual target damage, else IFF wouldn't work. So the damage throughput shouldn't necessarily cancel out even if he switches every second.
      ```

      - u/ricree:
        ```
        Probably wouldn't work, but Rain really ought to at least try explicitly adding "the environment" to his IFF blacklist.
        ```

        - u/Bowbreaker:
          ```
          Or maybe just "air".
          ```

        - u/Luck732:
          ```
          I believe he tried that, and was stopped stone cold. IFF specifically says you can whitelist entities, and the environment is not an entity.
          ```

          - u/ricree:
            ```
            Wouldn't surprise me, but do you recall where? I don't remember reading it, but that could be easy to miss.
            ```

      - u/BoojumG:
        ```
        I don't think so and it's a good question. It would come down to whether the target damage is a direct magical effect or a result of the target's body getting cooked or frozen. Same question for the slowing or burning debuffs that get applied when there's enough damage done by Refrigerate or Immolate respectively in a short time - are they direct magical effects or side-effects of temperature?
        ```

        - u/Bowbreaker:
          ```
          Even if it's just damage through heat and cold it would still essentially cooking and freezing monsters directly for a second or two each. Setting a flash frozen person on fire doesn't heal them.

          Though then again the question becomes where does the damage source originate topically. Inside the enemy? On the enemy's skin? If two persons are naked and hugging and one of them is excluded through IFF, how much would either of them be damaged by Immolate or Refrigerate? Would the non-excluded one be protected by being partially enveloped?
          ```

        - u/Diggsi:
          ```
          Rain could create a force push outwards by making a pressure differential with a long range immolate nova and a short range refrigerate nova. Probably not useful against silver plate+ warriors,  but it would be good against say, an army of archers.
          ```

    - u/ricree:
      ```
      Some of the higher tier auras should be safer in their environmental effects. Dark, for instance, would mess with visibility for him and allies, but shouldn't actually hurt.
      ```

  - u/Veedrac:
    ```
    It actually seems like it's not that big a deal any more because of his ring. He did ~3200 damage at a cost of 1500 mp (20%) and 56 health (6%).

    A mana-optimal approach using Focus with the same diameter would deal just over twice the damage per mana, so he's still going to run out of mana first. He'd ‘pay’ about 600 health for it, but also deal 35k damage. It's possible he'd need to alternate Refrigerate and Immolate to do this.
    ```

- u/LLJKCicero:
  ```
  I think I missed a piece of exposition on blue and level caps. So Rain is capped at 18, and he needs to kill another blue or something to starting leveling again? Has it been said the exact intervals where you need to kill blues?
  ```

  - u/Orpheon73:
    ```
    There's no interval, you just only gain levels up to the level of the blue you killed. The blue that got killed by his party was level 18, so he gets to level up to level 18, and is capped until he finds a more powerful blue and slays it.

    It's why people with powers are so rare, and non-combat classes so dangerous.
