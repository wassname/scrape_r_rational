  Welp, I'm going to count this as a 'found' entry to the competition.  

  It's awesome.

    Everything Chiang writes is awesome. "The Story Of Your Life" is as mind-opening as a psychedelic trip.

  Like *Limitless*, but cool!

    I loved its ambitious way of describing how high intelligence feels from the inside. Almost all stories just half-ass it and create the feeling of high intelligence by making the characters omniscient and directly feeding them all the correct answers.
