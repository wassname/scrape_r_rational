## [TH][D] I've just started watching Attack on Titan. Only on episode 2 but so far it seems like a metaphor for the fight against death. Thoughts?

  It's not a metaphor.  It's a long, dreadful slog through the efforts of the mangaka to avoid giving us actual information or plot progress, while simultaneously failing to examine the primary failure mode of the main-character, while also giving the main character plot-relevant superpowers for no good fucking reason.

  Sweet Cthulhu Who Only Swims Left, this could have been a *really good* anime/manga if they'd fixed the pacing and given the [AoT ep7](#s "Titan shifter powers") to Mikasa instead of Eren.

  A metaphor in what way?

  I haven't gotten all the way through Attack on Titan, mostly because I prefer dubs to subs (so I can split focus), but I found it to feel very much like a jingoistic military propaganda piece, in the best possible way. The titans are just the "Other" that can be safely killed by the valiant heroes without any moral question. Though it's possible that this changes later on.

    The titans are an "unstoppable" force that kill everyone they can get their hands on, and most people just accept their existence as a fact of life.

    At the start of the first episode everyone feels safe because it has been such a long time since anyone they knew was eaten, and after the attack most people grieve for a while then start forgetting again. Only Eren thinks to try to stop them permanently, instead of just trying to minimize casualties or not think about it like everyone else does.

      Okay, I guess I can see that. I certainly don't think it's the writer's intent though.

      The most compelling interpretation I've heard is that the titans are an occupying force and the main characters are the insurgents. It's not terribly hard to see the titans as the American military (vastly more powerful, able to be defeated only with hit and run tactics and then not even all that effectively, utterly foreign). But I guess I can see death working as a metaphor too.

        I think it's just a general commentary on human nature and how people have difficulty seeing the bigger picture and cooperating even when there is an immediate threat. The general asked Eren at one point what he thought about people in the past's belief that an external threat would force them to work together, and Eren said that was naive. As the plot goes on the protagonists worry more about their enemies within the walls than outside it.

        In terms of real life, if there is a connection then I'd say that the author of AoT is probably more likely to be commenting on Japan's relations with China, which the right wing in Japan perceives as a threat in terms of their economy and their numbers. The walls are supposed to represent [Japanese isolationism](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2013-07-23/interview-george-wada-producer-of-attack-on-titan#) and there is some weak evidence that the author is right wing [see here](http://seldomusings.wordpress.com/2013/10/19/migiteorerno/). Apparently the author has admitted that the general, Pixis, who is portrayed as a good man, is based on the Imperial war criminal Yoshifuru Akiyama.

      I would have disagreed initially, and I still don't think that is the writer's intent, but I think it does make some sense.  The worship of the Wall is a false solution, similar to the way religion offers a false solution.  The wealthy think they are safe staying behind the innermost layer of walls, similar to how the wealthy in our world benefit more from medicine, but neither are truly safe from the real threat.

      I think you might be reading into this a bit too much, [Everyone is Jesus in Purgatory](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsJesusInPurgatory) style.

  You can make parallels initially, but the more you watch the less you'll think of them as similar, I would imagine.

    Yes, by episode 10 this pretty well falls apart.
