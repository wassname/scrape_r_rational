## [BST] Stopping the Next Wizarding War

### Post:

My biggest problem with the original Harry Potter books has always been how easily all the other characters have written off all Slytherins as evil and so treats them accordingly. Mcgonagall locked all the Slytherins up during the last battle because of the comments of ONE GIRL. Furthermore after the war any of the Slytherins whose family weren't killed are now being permanently tortured in Azkaban. Additionally is the problem that their are actually two types of Slytherins ( I assume) the ones who join because of their blood and the ones who join because they have ambition whether their ambition is world domination or curing cancer they are all treated the same. If everyone else treats you as evil is it any wonder Slytherins keep rising up with whichever Dark Lord comes along? In this story I want to have a muggleborn get accepted to hogwarts, and the more they learn the more they fear that the Last wizarding war was no different than WWI, and has merely set up perfect conditions to bring about another war. Fearing what another war would be like this protagonist will join Slytherin and try to show both his fellow Slytherins and the world that ambition and evil aren't the same thing before it's to late to stop the war.

  The only issue is that this is a hell of a complex emotional position to take for an 11 year old. Even to notice the similarity. There would have to be some life experience or serious historical study or personal reasons to explain this position.

    This looks like a job for rationalist Severus Snape circa 1980! Prevent the next wizarding war during the last wizarding war.

      That doesn't really fit though, because that was before the rise of the Death Eaters, and the modern 'All Slytherins are Evil' meme. Certainly Slughorn didn't seem to have an issue.

      Grindelwald wasn't a Slytherin, he went to Durmstrang. And if anything, the social examination from a muggle standpoint at that time would seem to indicate that the treatment of muggleborns or magical creatures was about to spark a Civil Rights Movement (which would have been rather recent memory).

        Riddle founded the Knights of Walpurgis (with, at the very least, a Lestrange) when he was at Hogwarts in 1940, and the Death Eaters were already extant by the time the First Wizarding War starts in 1970. Grindlewald's machinations back during World War II are never given a proper name.

        Evidence of Snape's experiences with his friends from those pensieve visions seem to imply that muggleborn prejudice was a Slytherin thing by that time as, indeed, Voldemort's reign of terror had already been in effect for a few years. The Order of the Phoenix is founded some time in the 70's with Snape as a double agent.

        1980 is the year he overhears Trelawney's prophecy.

        What about during the interwar period, after Voldemort lost for the first time?
        ```

          That might work, but that is really just the 80s, and I suspect it took a few years for the prejudice to really get going.

    Depending on how willing you are to lean on magic, time shenanigans of one sort of or another can be useful when excusing radically mature-for-their-age wizard children.

      I don't want to make my protagonist so skilled that they can stand toe to toe with Lucius in their first year. They should slowly work to that level over their time at school Time travel is always ridiculously complex, so I think that it's probably best to stick with the 6 hour maximum. This could allow him to gain 25% more time to learn but not enough to make him instantly super smart and knowledgeable on world politics.

    I haven't decided exactly how intelligent I want my protagonist, but you're correct that it may be a little extreme to have them immediately see the problem. My idea is for them to simply have a normal ambition "eg something like immortality, or end all poverty with magic" and over time as he ages he notices the similarities and works to stop it.(At least to explain his knowledge of history and politics I plan to make one of his parents a political science professor who instills in him a high level understanding for his age). However I don't want him to be some kind of super-genius like harry in HPMOR. He can have a crash course level of knowledge in a few subjects but he shouldn't have the knowledge of a PHD in every subject under the sun or I wouldn't find him believable.

  I really liked one interpretation I read of Salazar's views. He didn't hate muggleborns, he just thought that they should be taken from their parents and raised completely in the wizarding world. The main reason being because back then humans were basically living in huts in the mud, (9th century) hence the term mudblood. I believe he thought it was cruel to make them live like that, without being able to do magic to make their lives better until they turned 17 at least. 

  Of course this doesn't really apply with modern technology giving almost any muggle much of the same conveniences wizards have enjoyed for centuries. Ironically, with modern technology I would consider it cruel to make someone live where computers and phones didn't work for most of the year.

  I can't remember exactly where I read it, but it was in a time loop story (possibly Innortal's) and I believe the context was he discovered portraits of the original founders and spoke with them.

  I think Hermionie would be a fantastic rational protagonist in this story. If you haven't already, I'd recommend you read [Applied Cultural Anthropology, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or). In the story, Hermionie doesn't have any specific goals other than surviving the dungeons, but the author does a fantastic job with the whole thing. Additionally, it's not unreasonable for Hermionie to be extremely mature for her age.
