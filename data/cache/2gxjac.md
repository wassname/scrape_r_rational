  Challenge accepted. Also, when the pharaoh is talking in the last paragraph, there are italics around the word "is" in "Life is the struggle for life" line which do not italicize the word. 

  It seems okay so far, but there is not nearly enough content to form an actual opinion and the admission of the first chapter being too hard to write is rather worrisome.

    Firsts are important and I tend to overdesign. That's really the only reason I delayed the first chapter. I was having writer's block about the beginning so I skipped the beginning to get past it.

    Thanks for the typo report.

  Knowledge of Yugioh is not required to read.

  Chapter 1 was too hard to write so I just made a placeholder for now. Chapter 2 is still too short but hopefully it'll be enough to give a taste. I'd appreciate any reviews / advice / etc. I admit I'm mostly posting this to positively reinforce progress on writing actual words instead of hyperdesigning every detail. If you want more than a taste you'll have to wait.

  Challenge 1: what strange things have not yet been explained?

  Challenge 2: name all departures from canon so far.

  Challenge 3: come up with clever applications of the Puzzle's powers.

  I'm trying to make Yugi not just "generic rational fanfic protagonist" and retain as much as possible of his original personality but it hasn't shown yet. He's in unusual circumstances.

  ...Why is the A/N longer than the story?

    It's not. Perhaps you missed chapter 2?

    Anyway, I can be quite [long-winded](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/27cs4s/d_the_nature_of_fiction/).

  >PS: We learn that the Puzzle cannot be harmed by anything. It makes its wielder impervious to any harm without permission: it is still possible for its wielder to get a haircut, but only if the barber has permission, otherwise even the hair is invincible.

  It makes you immune to being harmed without permission. My inner munchkin tells me that a rigorous definition of "harm" is called for. Are you immune to ageing? Starvation? Can you eat an unhealthy diet for years and not get fat? Are you immune to hair dye?

    I thought a lot along those same lines. I feel like the puzzle is going to work on a combination of Yugi's subconscious definition of harm and his allowances of "harm". Otherwise a villain could say "Let me kill you, or I kill Gramps, Tea and Joey" That seems a too-obvious way to cheat the invulnerability. So I feel like, for a decent sense of true, tangible invulnerability, the sensation has to pass two checks before the puzzle can let it through.

    1. Does Yugi allow this change to his physical state?

    2. Will this physically harm Yugi based on his subconscious definition of the word?

    The sensation has to get a pass through both questions to be let through. That's the best way for that mechanic to run, I feel. Otherwise, as I said, it's much too easy to be bypassed by villains through the use of proxies.
    ```

    - u/Chronophilia:

      Or it could be a narrower definition, like "nothing that makes his pain receptors fire".
      ```

      - u/Kishoto:
        ```
        That's possible. But does that mean he never gets sick then? Headaches, sneezing, coughing and whatnot usually hurt. At least a little bit.
        ```

- u/Kishoto:
  ```
  I'm thinking about how the puzzle's invincibility applies to Yugi's strength. If he's invulnerable, what's the mechanic? Does he have a second skin clinging to him, that's just a hard layer nothing can bypass without permission? And how does fighting work? Assuming the 2nd skin thing, then do his punches feel like he has a fist of diamond hardness? I know his strength is still limited, but will his limbs now be essentially the hardest bludgeons in existence? Can I put him in a cannon and use him as the hardest cannon shell ever? Also how transitive is this? Is his clothing invulnerable? If it is, can he make objects and people he hold invulnerable as well? And what decides this? Is this a puzzle mechanic that filters through yugis mind and what he identifies as his body? Or does the pharoah decide? 

  Obvious "counters" to the puzzle are targeting Yugi through the people he loves. Psychological warfare. Imprisonment (assuming his strength is still just that of the teenager he is), Starvation (assuming this isn't covered by the puzzle) Suffocation (that seems like something covered by the puzzle, almost, so can Yugi now survive underwater? Or in space?) 

  Also, on a related psychological note, can I break Yugi mentally? As in drive him insane through years of mental and sensory assault, so that I can convince him to "allow" me to harm him?
