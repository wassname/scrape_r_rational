  Kinda like [this](http://dresdencodak.com/2009/01/27/advanced-dungeons-and-discourse/). I haven't played it myself, but I very much want to.

      Love that comic. Too bad it updates slower than HPMOR.
      ```

        ```

          His profile says he hopes to update once per week. That produced a laugh.

  I am so definitely going to try this in my local gamer group.
