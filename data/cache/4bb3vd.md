  Loved this movie; I paused it several times to ponder characters' arguments, which for me marks substantive depth in a work of fiction.

  ```
  I second the recommendation, this is an excellent rational movie.

  It had the feel of being filmed in the nineties, not 2007.

    ```
    That's because it was filmed on video. Nineties movies on film don't look like they were filmed in the nineties.

    I didn't find the characters in this movie to be very sensible. Far too much sanctimony and judgement. It's a pretty okay movie, but it's basically a monologue/dialogue in one setting.

      It feels like it was written to be a play. The characters remind me of the teachers from The History Boys.
