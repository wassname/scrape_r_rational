## [RST] Naruto: The Need to Become Stronger, Chapter 1

### Post:

The first chapter of The Need to Become Stronger is now up! It can be found on my [website](https://needtobecomestronger.wordpress.com/2016/10/17/chapter-1/), or you can download it from [mediafire](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/og9fdufawqfj7/NTBS).  

Edit: The folder now includes Act 1 in full for anyone wanting to beta read the whole thing. Please note that you'll be getting a slightly less polished version if you read it this way, and of course take care not to spoil anything for others!  
&nbsp;

Again, I greatly appreciate any and all feedback you may give me! As I have already written 300 pages of this story I'm not likely to start over from scratch of course, but I take all suggestions for improvement seriously. I especially appreciated the note on Danzo's Sharingan, which he indeed should not have at this point - that part has now been removed from chapter 1. I am also curious to hear how you all feel about the writing style and mood of this chapter versus the prologue, as I think they're quite different.  
&nbsp;

(If anyone is interested in reading the whole thing in one go to provide better feedback, PM me and I will send it to you, though bear in mind that some chapters are not fully polished yet.)  
&nbsp;

Based on your advice I will also post these chapters on fanfiction.net, Sufficient Velocity and probably space battles, though with a time-lag so that I can make edits based on feedback here before showing it to a larger audience. If anyone knows any other good sites to post it on, please let me know.  
&nbsp;

Again, thanks for all the comments!

  What is the expected update schedule for this fanfic? You mentioned in the post for the prologue that you already had 300 pages and I am eager to read more.

    Glad you liked it! The planned update schedule is biweekly - probably On sundays and Wednesdays or something like that.

  I liked it and am looking forward to more. The start seems relatively slow, but that's alright.

  I'm a big fan of the whole grandiose, over the top writing style in general. That being said it's a hard style to nail and you'll probably need a couple of edits to make it flow better, not that your current chapter is bad or anything. Just some advice to keep in mind for future chapters.

  TLDR: This good!

  Okay so the writing style is a bit different, makes me think of trailers for movies where narator lines are mixed with scenes of protag. It's not bad just different to me.

  Character behavior is pretty good and unravels pretty much how character descriptions and the originals would behave in real life, specifically talking about Kiba, Iruka, Sakura and Naruto's liking of her, and people's reactions to attacking noble and important figures.

  Mizuki the QuirelMort seems a bit of copy from hpmor with his cynism, story and personality. Not a bad thing, just don't overdo it.

  Prologue was good too. I like the attitude of 
  Army > OP character/person in combat, I mean unless your special snowflake powers include out thinking a group of cunning people working in unison then you're gonna get screwed.

    Thanks for the feedback! You're right about Mizuki resembling Quirrelmort too much... I think I accidentally channeled him in the process of writing an evil cynical teacher. I think I need to rewrite the section where he actually teaches, because I suspect that's the main offender.
    ```

      ```
      I think you need to pad that scene out more, there is a lot of "Telling not Showing" there when it comes to how he teaches with 'passion' or in a way that makes you pay attention even though it's the same information Iruka would have taught.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Have you read the full first act?  [SPOILER](#s "I don't think this matters as much as you're making it out to. The direction surprised me. I'm still not sure of what direction OP is going to take this. I didn't expect the wave mission happened as quickly as it did.")
        ```

- u/Sophronius:
  ```
  Hey all,

  per request I have now added the full Act 1 to the mediafire folder, for any who wish to beta read the whole thing. Please note that you'll be getting a slightly less polished version if you read it this way, and of course take care not to spoil anything for others!
