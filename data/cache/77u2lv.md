## Rational Batman Fic?

### Post:

I’ve been wanting to right a rational Batman fan fiction that is a sequel to The Metropolitan Man By: Alexander Wales. Before I rush into writing, are there any cues that I should note or any ideas that y’all can suggest for me if anything? Thanks for hearing me 👍🏽.

  My view of Batman, and DC in general, is that there is a heavily mythological element to them; that is to say, there are lots of different Batman stories, and Batman gets written through many different and conflicting lenses by authors who are trying to make different points about either the character, or their culture, or the role of the character within their culture.

  Here are the ideas that I think are interesting about Batman:

  1. Batman is at least partly responsible for the criminality problem in Gotham, in the same way that the American justice system's focus on prison-as-punishment and the militarization of police are partly responsible for the degradation of communities and the perpetuation of crime.
  2. Batman is psychologically crippled by the deaths of his parents and channels that psychological dysfunction into his work *as* Batman. You can go several different ways with this; he does it unknowingly but it's apparent to the people who know him, he does it knowingly because he thinks that the good he does as Batman means working on his problems would be to the detriment of society (in the same way an artist might want to stay an alcoholic because they think it allows them to produce better art), etc.
  3. Batman is paranoid to a fault, unwilling to trust anyone, unwilling to put confidence in anyone that he does trust, with a penchant for surveillance and violations of privacy, and without a real respect for the rule of law. The parallels to post-9/11 America practically write themselves!
  4. Batman inherently represents a class struggle. He's a billionaire with lots of fancy equipment and all the benefits of privilege, and his rogue's gallery consists largely of those who are trodden-down and/or mentally impaired.
  5. Batman (usually) doesn't kill, but where Superman doesn't kill because he's an eternal optimist, Batman doesn't kill because ... well, you can fabricate your own answer. Maybe he thinks that death is the ultimate tragedy, and the idea of sending one more person into the abyss produces such a revulsion in him that he can't bring himself to do it. More commonly he thinks it would put him on the other side of the line of acceptable vigilantism. My personal take would be that he *really, really* wants to kill, and the reason he doesn't kill is that he thinks his first murder would send him over the edge, in the same way that some people can look at heroin and know in their heart that they would be addicted from the first moment, because they understand their own personality that well.

  There have been a *lot* of Batman stories, and a lot of these things have been explored in depth, but I think there's plenty of room for doing a rational take on them.

    This means so much to me as your Superman story was absolutely amazing. 

    The thing is I might have his parents die during the Metropolis bombings that happened in Metropolitan Man. But if I set the story up like that then the story would take place sometime after or maybe during WWII because I could always age Bruce up and have him be a 14-15 year old spoiled brat that ends up being deeply scarred by his parents deaths. 

    The thing that I might do when portraying Bruce is to have him resemble a somewhat more well-minded Rorschach. But I’d love to make it as close and well fitted to the world that you made for Metropolitan Man. 

    I’d also like to tell that I have, in my own head cannon, Metropolis in Delaware, Gotham City in New Jersey, Blüdhaven is also in New Jersey. Fawcett City is in Wisconsin, Central City is in Missouri, Keystone City and Smallville are in Kansas, Coast City is in California. This is the geography I wanted to set up and I’d like to know if it’s rational.

      Frank Miller said that Metropolis is New York City during the day, and Gotham City is New York City during the night. I think this makes a lot of symbolic sense, but doesn't make any *literal* sense whatsoever.

      Canonically, Metropolis is (usually) New York City, and Gotham City is (usually) across the river in New Jersey ... which doesn't actually make that much sense, but that's what *Batman v Superman* went with.

      For *Metropolitan Man*, I think that I had Gotham City as replacing Chicago, but if it was mentioned at all, it was only in passing, and I'm not sure enough information was given to infer that.

      I think your geographical layout works. The thing you have to keep in mind if you're monkeying around with geography is that cities exist for a reason, and that reason is usually dictated by 1) distance from other cities and 2) access to transportation or 3) access to valuable raw materials. I'm one of those geographical determinist people who think that given a height map of a continent and a rough tracing of riverways, you could predict where all the most major cities would end up with good accuracy. The big thing is not having big cities too close together, unless they're twin cities (e.g. Minneapolis and St. Paul), or there's a good reason.

      What origin you want Batman to have probably depends on what themes and ideas you want to write about for him, e.g. if you want to tackle systemic issues that give rise to crime, then you can have his parents be the victims of said systemic crime. If you want to examine organized crime, game theory, defection from society, etc., then you can tie their death into that (as the comics occasionally do). If you want a focus on moral philosophy, then having them be the victims of someone's answer to the trolley problem might work best. (Though I don't think, as a general writing thing, that it's always best to tie everything back to your central thesis.)

        I bet China Meiville could make it work.

        Edit: or Chuck Jones. Imagine Superman clocking out and Batman clocking in at the change-over, like the sheepdog and the wolf.

        "Afternoon, Bruce."

        "Evening, Clark."

        "How's it going."

        "Same old villainous subplots."

        Well with the geography I had in mind that Metropolis was built upon a gold mine many years back and as time passed the city expanded into what it is today. 

        Metropolis in my eyes is still relatively old-fashioned compared to other cities in other states, so transportation is slowly integrating into society but not as quickly as other states have done in their cities. 

        For Gotham, I’ll be honest I just figured that it being called Gotham City gave way for me to put it in some state rather than making it it’s own state.

    Uh, that's interesting. The take on Batman you're describing is the exact opposite of the take on Batman that I follow.

    I think [Shamus Young put it best](http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=27397). Batman as a premise is fundamentally bent for purely editorial reasons, and trying to fit him into of the above categories either doesn't fit the categories, or breaks the Batman premise.

    I'm not sure quite how to put it. It's like, I like rational fiction, and fiction on general, to be meaningful. I like it to have a consistent logic, and for that logic to be based on real-world logic. I feel the best works of fiction are the ones that "bend" narrative causality, ideas like "the hero should win" or "interesting dramatic things should happen" and other demands of fiction, until the story is roughly shaped like real life.

    I feel that ideas like "Batman doesn't kill because it would be addictive" or "Batman represents the rich crushing the poor under their strength" do the opposite. They take real world concepts, and bend them until more or less fit story demands. I don't like this, because I feel this is the opposite of useful.

    I really don't like this type of thinking in general; I think it uses / stimulates the same brain gears that make people go "9/11 was an inside job" or "Idiocracy is so real". Or, for a completely different fandom, "the Prequels actually have a deep philosophical message about how the Jedi order is too static and outdated to cope with the reality of their world".

    On the other hand, these themes are all good, and probably make for interesting stories. I just... feel like they're the opposite of rational, somehow? They're not what I'd want from the "official" rational Batman story.

    EDIT: Actually, Shamus Young put it way better than I do in the article I linked:

    > But what’s most interesting to me is how people continually try to impose order on the chaos. There are two ways you can look at the bent nature of Batman:
    >
    > * This is stupid. I’m done.
    >
    > * This doesn’t make total sense, but I’m on board because I really dig this detective-and-brawling stuff. 
    >
    > But some people try to forge a third way: They try to say the inherent nonsense is saying something. They look for a message in the madness. A reason for the eternal struggle.

    Person XYZ doesn't kill is often such BS in fiction. I'm watching Once upon a time, where the good guys are being so holier than thou with thou shall not kill with the big bad, but they have no problems killing the henchmen like they aren't even human.

  Speaking as possibly the only person on this sub who doesn't like Metropolitan Man, I think it's very important that you decide whether you are writing a deconstruction of Batman before you start. MM isn't a bad story, but I can't see it as a Superman story. Thematically, the superhero genre is about people with power using that power to fight injustice. It's escapism, but it's the kind of escapism people need in order to inspire them to follow the same ideals by example. That's the purpose of heroic characters in storytelling, while anti-heroes are defined by their contrast with heroes.

  u/alexanderwales brings up interesting ideas for exploring Batman's character, but most seem to lead in the direction of preying on his faults instead of simply using them to generate complications on the way to a satisfying conclusion. It's not that I think deconstructing heroic characters is a bad thing to do, I just don't find it satisfying to read. I want to see Batman succeed at being Batman because of the virtues that he represents and flaws he overcomes on the way there. That's why I love the interpretation of him as wanting to kill, but ultimately resisting it.

  I want to see him get called out for being an asshole with a martyr complex, but only when he overcomes those fault 
  A over the course of the story with support from others. I don't want to see Batman be symbolic of a class struggle because what he's supposed to represent how much we want people with power to use their power to help others however they can. The debate over his methods is meant to make the audience what lengths *we will go to*, and seeing Batman choose to never compromise his principles inspires us to do the same.
  ```

    I partly agree and partly disagree.

    Superman within *Metropolitan Man* is mostly there as a tragic figure, who contains the seeds of his own self-destruction in the form of both his overly-rigid and incompatible-with-the-real-world moral code, and in his inability to deal with his empathic side and attempts to retain some scraps of humanity (though I will say that I have four years of experience under my belt since writing it, and probably would have been able to do the whole thing better now - it's not a story without flaws). He doesn't follow the path of the traditional hero's story, which normally ends with the hero having grappled with their problems and become the stronger for it.

    I think that if you *do* want a traditional hero's story, then you *should* figure out what the compelling flaws of the character are, because *that's* the thing that's at the center of your story; it's what the character is forced to confront, and is the (occasionally metaphorical) source of their triumph at the end.

    I'm pretty sure that a skilled writer could do this for almost any of the troubling aspects of Batman. Nolan already did "Batman as paranoid surveillance state" in *The Dark Knight*. The plot of *The Lego Batman Movie* was basically that Batman was too much of a loner.

    Heck, if you wanted to do an inspirational/affirmational "Batman as class struggle" story, one where, at the end, Batman is still ideal-driven and inspirational, all you'd really need is a good villain, like Lex Luthor, who can do a "Not So Different" speech at the end which Batman then refutes. Depending on how far down the rabbit hole you want to go, you then structure the plot so that it touches on things like the relationship between capital and labor, the necessity of an organizing force within society, maybe something about the inevitability of the rich given their incentives, etc. Or, somewhat more classically, you have Batman brought down to the level of the common man *but still be Batman* and learn some lessons about crime as a systemic issue, or how to identify with people who commit crimes, before he (somehow) returns to power (again, still Batman) with a new perspective on what the city and people of Gotham actually need of him.

    (And if you wanted Batman to be a tragic figure, he would be undone by his flaws rather than learning from them and eventually overcoming them.)

      > Superman within Metropolitan Man is mostly there as a tragic figure

      Wait a sec, [doesn't Superman ](#s "actually overcome his flaws and learn from them at the end of the Metropolitain Man? And it's only because Lex is limited by his own flaws (mostly his fear of Superman) that Superman is undone?").
      ```

      I’d forgotten about the trope of the [Tragic Hero](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicHero), though it’s hard not to view such a reimagining of an established character as a commentary on the original. Maybe it doesn’t count as a deconstruction and I just hate tragedies.

      I can’t think of any tragedy that I’ve ever been glad I read. I don’t even like episodes of The Twilight Zone with sad endings, though I have loved *some* of Black Mirror’s horrific social satire. With the possible exception of Walter White, I’ve never enjoyed the story of a tragic hero.

      I love the original Frankenstein but that’s more of a horror story, respect for Of Mice and Men was drilled into me so hard I have no idea if I actually if I actually like it, and Old English writing was incomprehensible to me as a kid so I grew up hating Shakespeare.

  One of the strengths of *good* rational fics is that they enhance elements in the original even if making fun of them. Illogical wand movements in HPMOR, Superman being genuinely heroic in Metro Man, the vampires' characterizations in Luminosity - you don't write fanfic by removing core elements, although you can go into more detail about or twist them.

  So the core of Batman is that he's crazy, that he's rich, that he's fighting a one-man war on crime. Have him do things smart people would do in that situation, and then think of an in-universe reason it *doesn't work*.

  Why doesn't he just fund poverty reduction programs? Have Bruce try that, and then realize Gotham's corrupt as shit, murderous weirdos in costumes are still around, and in a world where supervillains are around superheroes are *actually* useful.

  Why doesn't he kill? Well, his Rogue's Gallery keeps coming back, right? Or maybe because he knows that if he goes unhinged, he'll stay unhinged. Explore that.

  Why doesn't he use superpowers? Well... Maybe he decides to, after all? Maybe he seeks out magic or super-tech to be prepared, but wants to avoid escalation with supervillains?

    > Why doesn't he just fund poverty reduction programs?

    Okay, I want to address that one criticism, because I see it every time someone talks about Batman, and it's empirically false.

    In basically every single long-running Batman story, he does fund poverty reduction programs. He's both a vigilante *and* a playboy philanthropist. You have stories with Bruce Wayne funding scholarships, museums, Gotham City police, shelters, Arkham Asylum, etc.

    The idea that "Batman tries to solve crime through punching people in the face because he / the writers / the readers are too dumb to realize that it would make more sense to fund charities instead" strikes me as baseless smugness. There is no need to justify Batman not funding charities, because Batman does fund charities.

      I think you're missing the point - Bruce Wayne spends huge amounts of money on his vigilante equipment, which could instead be spent on other programs. The *batman* has a huge opportunity cost.

  Based on your post, my impression is that you don't have a lot of experience writing. This is nothing to be ashamed of; experience is something you gather over time, with practice. Accordingly, my suggestion is; don't hesitate, just rush into writing. Practice is something you get by doing, after all.

  That said, Rational Fiction is a bit of a high bar, and requires a bit of preparation and forethought that you are probably not accustomed to, given that you're asking for basic advice and ideas here. That's not to say that you shouldn't try... but you might want to consider something a little less ambitious, as early practice writing.

  Note that November is coming up, and that means [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org) is just around the corner. I'd strongly suggest that you start there. Don't set yourself up against your favorite author in writing something exceptional; just write something, and write a lot of it. NaNoWriMo isn't about *good* writing; it's about getting into a habit of writing *anything*, which is a necessary precondition to writing anything good.

    Thanks for the criticism and yea you’re right rational fanfics are a high bar of writing. The thing is I’ve written the lore for stories and I’ve been doing world building a lot so I wanted to try out a rational fic for the sake of it. But thank you for your Much needed criticism. 🙏🏽
    ```

    - u/Endovior:
      ```
      Worldbuilding is all well and good, and you'll want plenty of that in place before you set out to do serious writing.

      However, you should have some practice doing non-serious writing before you sit down to attempt serious writing... in much the same sense that you should have some practice running before you attempt a marathon.

      Having ambitious goals is a *good* thing, but if you want to achieve those goals, it's probably best to start with more modest goals and work up from there. That's not to say that NaNoWriMo is easy (50,000 words is a lot, and *will* kick your ass if you take it lightly), but it's a more concrete goal than most writing goals tend to be, which makes it excellent as a practice target.

        Well if it’s anything before I even thought of considering writing a rational fan-fiction, I had actually created characters for several stories such as Naruto, One Piece, Dragon Ball Z, DC Universe, and Marvel Universe as well.

          One thing that can be simultaneously really easy and really hard is to write a stand-alone vignette that, in your mind, fits into a larger narrative.  The key is not to over-plan the big story but to make the little piece really good.  My expertise is in academic writing rather than fiction, but I find that no large outline remains unchanged after you flesh out a small piece of it.

          IIRC Batman decides that being Batman is actually a sort of encouragement for the Joker, so he decides to change how he operates, and Joker's reaction is the titular [extinction burst](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_(psychology).

  Sounds great! Though I should read Metropolitan Man. For years I've been considering doing a DC fanfiction, especially one about Superman, but I want to challenge myself (especially for the rationalist genre) by using some weird enemies like Composite Man and such. Shit, imagine that.

  The DC multiverse is so crazy and expansive. Remember that, even for a Batman story. How many elements of the DC Multiverse are you putting into the story? Remember some of the newer stuff like the Court of Owls, cuz that could be neat to see in a rationalist fic.
