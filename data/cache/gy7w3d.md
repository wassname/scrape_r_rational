  So. From the appeance and effect of that thing I'm assuming it's a >!small EMP device? Evidently it didn't kill their phones, just the guys prosthetic !<

    It's a leap and I have no idea how Turry would get them, but I was thinking >!nanites or other tech allowing  Turry to take control of cybernetics!<

      >!Nanites would be kind of an asspull, we haven't seen anything like that in the story so far. It tries to stay very grounded. If that is really Turry taking actual control of this guys cybernetics my guess is simpler that being hit by an EMP forced a reboot or something where the limb connected to the net and Turry was able to use that to introduce malware.
      Even more likely though is IMO that he wasn't even the target. Turry could not have known for sure that he would open the package. !<

        Turry might have been monitoring the situation and waited for when he would be holding it. And considering how good Turry is at predicting humans now, it doesn't seem that much of a stretch that he could predict, at least with a high probability, that he would be the one to pick it up.
