  > “If Tunnel Vision shows up,” said Oakes.  “Keep the fight short.  Our intel source told us about her Praxis Vocation.  It modifies her mind over time, perfecting her for a single goal at the expense of everything else.  The longer the battle goes, the more time she’ll have to outsmart us.”

  Yeah, this sort of proves to me that whoever Paragon's getting their intel from, they're just feeding them the intel Tunnel Vision wants them to get. I can't imagine the details of Grace's vocation are something that could just leak like that, especially in a way that's *technically* correct but paints a very misleading picture.

  Yes, technically the longer you fight Tunnel Vision the worse your odds get, but we've seen from her perspective that it's less "I need time to optimize my brain," as this implies, and more "the more information I acquire, the better I can optimize." Also, if you find yourself fighting her at all, it's likely a battle that she's already planned for and stacked in her favor and optimized her brain for. In other words, by the time any battle is taking place, you've already been outsmarted, trying to end things quickly won't save you.
  > *Fuck.*  I clenched the binoculars, squeezing my eyes shut.  This was exactly what Admiral Ebbridge wanted.  She wanted us to fight.  She and her posse of elites had decided that Queen Sulphur was useful, but dangerous.  So they’d developed this scheme to break us up, to turn me and Wes against each other with vicious competition.

  I feel like I've said this a hundred times at this point, but I'm really hoping this causes Ana to realize that Paragon doesn't have her best interests at heart. I doubt it will, because Ana's proven remarkably stubborn in this regard, but I can dream, can't I?
  > “I forgot to ask,” said Wes.  “Will the Green Hands be unconscious inside?  Do we need to secure them?”

  > “They will not be unconscious,” said the Obsidian Foil, regret slipping into his voice.

  Paragon is being incredibly brutal in how their fighting this, if they don't have a victory to show for all their ruthlessness and civilian casualties I suspect it'll bite them in the ass. Hell, even if they do pull out a win it'll still probably bite them in the ass.
  > Tunnel Vision.  Grace Acworth.  The Pyre Witch.

  Surprising absolutely no one, it was a trap. The real question is what Grace achieves with this trap. Is this an assassination attempt on some of Paragon's most powerful projectors? Is she forcing Paragon to overextend itself attacking surprisingly well-defended targets so her allies can strike elsewhere? Is she baiting Paragon into this brutal (and likely ineffective) military action on domestic soil to further incite the public against them? All of the above? None of the above? I have no doubt she's accomplishing multiple goals with this move, but it's still fun to speculate about.

  Bwahahahaha hahahaha ha ha ha!

  "Yeah, you people saved our country so I figure it's good for a single pardon between the four of you. Go fight each other for it, I guess."

  This like that scene in The Dark Knight where the Joker has three mobsters fight to the death to join his crew, except this comes from Paragon, the "good "guys". I love this.

  Man, Ana is really getting more desperate to justify herself.
  ```

  - u/Don_Alverzo:
    ```
    Her justifications haven't actually changed, really. Being a real Paragon student has always been her goal and she's always equated that with the sense of belonging and acceptance she's lacked, it's just that now she's seeing a lot of evidence that "Paragon student" and "hero of the people" are a bit contradictory. She's ignoring that evidence, naturally, but as the evidence mounts her willful blindness is becoming even more painfully obvious.
