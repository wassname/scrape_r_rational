## Charlie Stross on Twitter: I have no intention of ever writing a Merchant Princes/Laundry Files crossover. So that one’s free for fanfic projects …

  The way I see it, there are two obvious approaches:

  1. *The Merchant Princes*' Prime Earth is one where the Laundry (or a parallel version of it) is active. Following the events of the last *Merchant Princes* book (or possibly contiguous with it) the Laundry (or since it's primarily in America, Black Chamber) makes contact with the world-walkers. Possible reasons include wanting to recruit someone with that ability, trying to prevent the massive deaths associated with [Merchant Princes spoiler](#s " Dick Cheney's nuclear carpetbombing campaign") and the resultant psychic bleedback, or trying to devise an exit strategy from Earth.

  2. The world where the Laundry takes place is encountered by the world-walkers during their exploration. This leads to the sort of cock-up that one might expect.

  Of course, you'd probably want to reskin the world-walkers as being related to something Cthuloid so there's less of a border between the continuities.

    The world walker's ability seems to be purely materialistic, since the military can build matching neural nets. You could make it an extremely primitive version of the same kind of neural nets that infovores etc are made out of.

    Would #2 be Case Nightmare Red, or doesn't it count if the alien invaders are human?
