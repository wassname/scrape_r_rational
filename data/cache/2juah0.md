  Ghosts: immortal, have all the time in the universe, have unrestricted access to said universe, can interact with material objects / living beings in said universe ...

  Sounds like I'd be doing a lot of science, and then communicating it to Earth through ouija boards.

    "What's it saying?"

    "Let's see... 'Can you get me a board with Greek letters on it? I need to tell you about science.' What?"

    They may be angry at scientists for not believing in ghosts :)

    Actually a story aboug ghost of a scientist who tries to explain his continued existence and takes holidays on Mars and Europa would be nice.

  I always thought ghosts were involuntarily tied to the place they haunt. They'd *like* to travel and see the world, or better yet move on to the afterlife, but they're stuck.

  Something a little lighthearted. The artist’s the same guy who illustrated Zachary Weiner’s Augie and the Green Knight. Oh, casual female nudity towards the end.

  Thoughts on munchkining the hell out of being a ghost? :P

    It's hard to know how to munchkin the hell out of being a ghost without knowing what rules we're operating under. The rules for ghosts have a huge variance among them. Just saying "ghost" is like just saying "vampire" - it doesn't really mean much, given how large the differences. Hell, in HPMOR ghosts don't even seem sentient.
    ```

  AFAIR, ghosts are people who aren't in afterlife because they can't let go. Either because of internal (regrets) or external (not being buried, etc) reasons. That's why they look like some obsessive maniacs - because they are.

  ```
  Unless ghosts can move FTL, wouldn't even exploring Mars take WAY too damn long? :(
  ```

  I would totally do the "hideous sick ghost" thing, but only because it would be the best way to show the people I love that it's really me.  

  "How long have you been like this?"

  "Oh, about a year"

  "WTF?!?  Your first 'hello' is to re-enact the Ring?  You couldn't IM me or something?"

  "Do you know how hard it is to steal a GoPro and _find_ an abandoned roofless well in the middle of the woods?   You only get one chance to prove the existence of the afterlife, and I wanted people to know it was really me."

  "Asshole."

  "Mission Accomplished!"
