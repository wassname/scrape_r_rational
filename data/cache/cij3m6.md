## The End of Worth the Candle?

### Post:

After binging the story I'm left wondering how it's all going to end. Do you really believe Joon is going to end up a benevolent capital-G God after everything?

Seems a bit cheap or easy to me, just from the number of surprises this story has given us so far.

What are your thoughts?

  Aerb is an *incredible* shithole as far as worlds go. Tons of hells and so many existential risks that plastic mages - an X-risk in and of itself - still get used after a couple close calls in that one Library glimpse because the X-risk doesn't even register as worth avoiding. -_- 

  The Aerbian hells alone make Aerb as-is such an incredibly bad place that removal of those is the basic rat!story necessity. Normally that'd require godhood but we have Library glimpes of depopulated hells, probably via Valencia. That leaves us with ALL THE OTHER SHIT that is going down on Aerb. 

  Basically to satisfy rat!story requirements and Mary+that other guys stated ethical intentions, its either soft godhood like Uther had for thousands of years to even have a chance at the long future, or hard godhood. 

  Hard godhood is kinda boring, so I'll go with lots of exclusions and soft godhood for a long time.

    >Aerb is an incredible shithole as far as worlds go.

    I disagree, Aerb has infinite opportunities, basically every problem is solvable, given enough time/work invested. On Earth, In comparison,  many unfortunate circumstances are hopeless. As someone who's currently stuck in such a situation (severe health problems), I would transfer to Aerb without a second thought given a choice.
    ```

    - u/Veedrac:
      ```
      Not to marginalise your issues, but most sentient life on Aerb, if I understand the ratios right, is under constant torture by unnaturally competent beings. The most likely outcome for their world is that all life other than the tortured souls and those doing the torturing are wiped out. Our planet is in a precarious spot, but we're technologically primitive and have a large opportunity for solving these issues for future lives.
      ```

      - u/sicutumbo:
        ```
        The ratio was mentioned in a recent chapter. Roughly 200 people being tortured per living person on Aerb.

        Oh, and also the magic that allows their civilization to function is slowly being chipped away at, with no known way of slowing the rate at which magic is lost.
        ```

        - u/Veedrac:
          ```
          Demons and devils are sentient too; I'm not sure how many of those there are. Not that it changes the overall evaluation.
          ```

    - u/SoylentRox:

      In Aerb, every "exploit" they find gets nerfed by the gods.

      In our world, the exploits are small and weak.  Electricity and magnetism barely do anything without centuries of infrastructure and many people's lifetimes making slight improvements to it.  Computing has taken close to 200 years - and many generations of dead scientists - to finally begin to yield the **big** gains from it.  

      &#x200B;

      But no one, so far, has come along and decided to just take away something.  The internet hasn't quit suddenly because an asshole god decided to exclude it to a single city.  While we talk about doom and gloom scenarios following a nuclear war, the knowledge that let our civilization reach this point has been copied millions of times, between books and records in compact portable devices.  Unlike what the Romans had (some parlor tricks and a few useful ideas that were lost), our advancements are here to stay.  

      &#x200B;

      And we're *this* close to unlocking a means to ending all of our problems, one way or another.  (yes, super-intelligent AI is an existential risk but it also offers a possible route to banning human death and illness and unfairness)


      Did you know that the neural network algorithm Google calls "AutoML" is a neural network that can find superior neural network architectures, and it is itself subject to the same improvements...?

      I'd rather die instantly on Earth than transfer to Aerb. The chances for eternal damnation are far too high. Even assuming that eventually someone destroys the hells, that's probably centuries or millennia of torture.
      ```

    - u/Afronerd:
      ```
      A lot of the worst stuff is in exclusion zones but that doesn't mean they're out of the picture and there are a few other world-level threats revealed already.

      The void beast, the opposite world and exclusion zones (maybe unified hells too) aren't necessarily solvable with just throwing time and resources at them.
      ```

- u/Slinkinator:
  ```
  I think the focus is much more Joons pathos and stuff, godhood is mostly irrelevant I think. How many beings on aerb are actually 'real', how 'real' is aerb itself? As real as earth, but is earth 'real?'

  I'm still waiting for some horrifying reveal about how it's all a simulation; not that the reveal it's a simulation would be by definition horrifying, but that AWales will present it as such.
  ```

  - u/Argenteus_CG:
    ```
    Simulation is already strongly implied. I don't think Joon would freak out at it being a simulation; he's already pretty much concluded that, as have most of us I think. There's hells of a lot of evidence that it's either a simulation or the DM wants Joon to think it's one, and it just being one is the simpler hypothesis in many respects.
    ```

    - u/Veedrac:
      ```
      What is the evidence that it's a simulation?
      ```

      - u/azurebyrds:
        ```
        If you read the chapter in the library with the infohazard you see warnings pop up about the substrate his brain is being run on and how many picoseconds until he died from cognitive overload.
        ```

        - u/Veedrac:
          ```
          Thanks, I'd forgotten about that. One reason I hadn't taken the game layer too seriously is that it's obviously fake; there are fake bugs, and ‘issues’ well below the sophistication of the whole set-up. But I don't have a conclusion here.
          ```

      - u/Argenteus_CG:
        ```
        Many different messages from the game-layer. Specific instances include when Joon's mental stats got too high and the game-layer switched to knowledge-injection mode, the crash when Valencia got her infernal-eating powers, and the failsafe that went off when Joon got hit with the infohazard in the Library that kept it from using his full processing power (each more blatantly simulation-implying than the last).

        Like I said, Joon seems to be operating under the simulation hypothesis, and IIRC Amaryllis has seemed to be too.
        ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        The game layer implies a higher level of reality beyond Aerb; it's pretty obvious it's not 100% real. Or if it is, then Earth and the "real world" might not be all that real either.
        ```

        - u/Empiricist_or_not:
          ```
          Its apparently a simulation, but if the characters are brain emulations don't you agree they have the same moral weight as "real" people, and in fact the people are real?
          ```

          - u/None:
            ```
            I don't think I have a good enough understanding of what "reality" even is to debate with you on that aspect. However I agree that as long as the people of Aerb can think for themselves/have free will/sentience they are as good as real and deserve rights.

            Aerb is just one big steaming [mindcrime](https://arbital.com/p/mindcrime/).
            ```

        ```
        In addition to what azurebyrds mention,  in chapter 36 Juniper gradually adds points to MEN to see how his knowledge and capabilities change.  After adding a certain amount of points, the following pops up on the game layer:

        ***WARNING: COGNITIVE ENHANCEMENT HAS CAUSED PERSONALITY NETWORK TO EXCEED HOLISTIC INTEGRITY THRESHOLDS. REVERSING AND REFACTORING EMULATION TO WITHIN HOLISTIC INTEGRITY THRESHOLDS. ENABLING TRI-STRATUM PSEUDO-INTELLIGENCE INJECTION SETTING TO COMPENSATE.*** 

        This appears to describe Juniper's mind as an emulation, which Juniper seems to take as pretty definitive evidence that he and the rest of Aerb are being simulated.  He takes it in stride though.
        ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    If there are some sort of constraints to the substrates available then simulating billions of people suffering in the hells seems pointlessly wasteful (ignoring the cruelty for the moment). It may be that only the entities Juniper directly interacts with have fully simulated minds and the rest are complex bots.

    Alternatively, maybe all of them are nonsentient, and the harsh twist would be juniper finding that out
    ```

  ```
  It'll end as it proceeds - in a way that's deeply emotionally satisfying and engaged with notions of narrative and rule-bending.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Let's certainly hope so!
    ```

  I feel like the ending has been heavily foreshadowed. The DM revealed to us that Joon agreed to 'enter' Aerb and would be satisfied with the ending. The title of the story is Worth the Candle, which is a reference to an in-story book about the supply chain and production of an actual candle (pig slaughter, not beeswax). 

  So we, as readers, are being taken through a metaphorical pig's life, slaughter, and greater purpose. The pig is Aerb et al. and the greater purpose is Joon. AKA there's a lot of suffering in Aerb and we as readers are supposed to question whether Joon's closure / character development is worth that moral and/or ethical cost. 

  Whether Aerb is a simulation or not is unimportant, as Aerb has been demonstrated to be too real to dismiss as "Oh, it was all fake? I guess Fenn and Mary don't matter since they were just fake and can stop existing now."

  Joon as a capital G-God may or may not happen, but if it does then I do not believe that would be the end or purposeful to Joon or us as readers beyond wrapping up loose plot lines in Aerb.

  The story's about the candle, not the pig. Joon, not Aerb.

  That said, I don't expect Joon to remain in Aerb when the story ends, whether he dies or returns to Bumblefuck, Kansas I won't speculate on. So the G-God question becomes a bit irrelevant.

      > Fallatehr tapped his finger to his lips. “There is a book about a candle, written in 97 FE, which describes it in exacting detail. Each imperfection of the candle is noted, every possible measurement of it is taken, and the composition of the candle is detailed down to the diet of the hog whose fat was rendered to make it. It runs for four hundred pages.”

      >“Okay,” I said slowly. “So the soul is like … a list of things about a person?”

      >“Some of the information listed about the candle was procedural,” said Fallatehr. “There are details of how it was created, what processes were used to render the fat, information on the construction of the molds, and all that sort of thing. The soul has nothing like it. There is nothing written upon the soul that will tell you how a person came to be as they are, no history, only marks that you might use to work backwards and infer.”

      From chapter 63, titled The Chemical History of a Candle.

      I'd speculate that the DM summoned book 'Worth the Candle' is what we're currently reading, written by Joon, titled with a reference to the unnamed candle book written in 97 FE.

      Oh wow, I hadn't put it together with the DM's tome, but there is this:

    Umm, maybe I'm missing something, but "worth the candle" is a saying that means something is worth the cost of doing it. It originated from needing to use up a relatively expensive candle to have the light to do things in the dark. The book Falatehr is talking about, which I think is based off an IRL book, definitely has some interesting parallels in regards to the story, but it isn't where the title of the story came from. Joon used the phrase "worth the candle" in his prayer to the DM when they were in Weik Handum or however it's spelled, and mentioned this when everyone was discussing the DM's second appearance.
    ```

    - u/Gr_Cheese:
      ```
      I did not know that. Good point.

      I'd still argue that these new-to-me facts still fit with the 'Aerb to redeem Joon's soul' theory I'm pushing.
      ```

- u/TwoxMachina:
  ```
  I think Joon becomes the DM
  ```

- u/TrebarTilonai:
  ```
  Personally, I'm still leaning towards the idea of him being dead. Assuming that Uther is actually Arthur in the same way that Joon is actually Joon, I'll bet that he got a similar deal. DM talked to him, he made a choice to go to Aerb but the details are kept from him. Then he gets hit by a car on Earth to explain his absence. This would also work with the simulation idea.
