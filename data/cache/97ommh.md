## [D] How might a rational antagonist use cognitive biases against his rivals?

### Post:

Looking for examples. I have a passing familiarity with the major biases, but haven’t really internalized them such that fictional opportunities are obvious.

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the references. I'll chew on it.

  It's a dangerous ploy, because any plan that depends on you successfully predicting your opponent usually runs afoul of [Kakashi's second rule](https://needtobecomestronger.wordpress.com/2016/11/28/chapter-8/):

  >“Then nothing,” Kakashi said as he leaped to the next roof.  "It doesn’t matter what level other people play at, because cleverness is still going to get you killed. Technically, the real second rule is that you should use the simplest possible strategy that can be made to work, so the worse the situation you’re in the cleverer you’re allowed to be. But you’re not supposed to ever get in a situation like that in the first place, so it amounts to the same thing in practice.

  As such, a rational antagonist should really only be trying something like this if he's in a desperate situation, or if failing doesn't cost him anything. In the second case, he could be on the lookout for any mistakes that the protagonist is *already* making and then try to take advantage of that. If you really want to go crazy though, you can put your antagonist in an impossible situation that *requires* him to completely play his opponent, like [this scene in NTBS](https://needtobecomestronger.wordpress.com/2017/05/06/chapter-15/):

  >“It’s obvious if you take your beliefs  seriously,” Haku said with just a touch of ice in his voice. He wasn’t  sure if his master was provoking him intentionally or if his remark  really had been intended as a compliment, but he resolved not to let it  get to him either way. “You’ve said many  times that Leaf ninjas are too soft and that this makes them weak. However, if they really were weak they could never have won three  shinobi world wars. So the correct conclusion is that they are  hypocrites, motivated not to do good but by a desire to have others  think of them as being good.”  
  >  
  >“Oh?” His master was looking at him with good humour. “What difference does that make?”  
  >  
  >Haku turned  away from his crystal ice mirrors and gave Zabuza his full attention.  “If we forced Hatake Kakashi to choose between his life and any number of civilians, he would simply turn away, since if he were truly that  good a person he would be dead. But if the choice is between the certain death of a civilian he knows and a mere risk to his own life, then he  will choose the latter in order to avoid having to think of himself as a  bad person. To exploit this, all we need do is to confront him with  variations of this same choice, over and over until finally the effect  is the same as if he chose to sacrifice his life after all.”

    A minor variation would be that even if an antagonist doesn't technically *need* to do anything to win, they might also run some costless B-plots with higher potential profitability just on the chance that the A-plot doesn't work for some reason.

    However, if they then try to deliberately sabotage the (simpler) A-plot in order to attempt to force the higher profit of one of the B-plots, they've fallen prey to one of their own biases. Probably something like the sunk-cost fallacy.

  Same way anyone else would. Start thinking "second-hand car salesman" and you should get on the right track...

  If you know what bias this falls under, I'd be interested to know. This happened to me inadvertently.

  tl;dr People have a tendency to assign blame for malicious events that negatively affect them to their most available competition or enemy.

  I was acting as a merchant in an online game, as were guy A and guy B. We were all in different areas, they knew each other but had not 'met' me as I'd just come online that day. Basically guy A and guy B had been competing in the same item categories (and now had some overlap with me), but apparently still had enough moral scruples not to fuck with each other as badly as I was about to... By DDoSing guy A with fake customers using unrealistic item prices.

  Given the nature of the game, I don't really know if this works until I check up. When I do, I see guy A in a tiff with guy B (who I had not spammed). Then I check the boards, and sure enough someone (who I must assume is guy A retaliating) posting fake offers under guy B's name.

  Then guy B, who I can only assume has no fucking idea why guy A randomly started cursing him out and presumably spamming him, decides to escalate in the same fashion.

  It was a nice surprise for me.

  I learned that day, that if you start fucking with someone and they can't directly attribute it to you, they'll have a short list of people to blame.

    Sounds like the [Availability Heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic). The existence of the merchant's rival came readily to his mind, therefore it was clearly his rival causing problems for him.

      Hmmm, I dunno, iiuc “availability heuristic” is usually used specifically to describe the related flaw in how people judge relative probability, and I very much doubt Person A ever stopped to think about *how likely* the situation was to be B’s fault.

      Also, I notice that it would be just as easy in the counterfactual world to say “availability heuristic” was why Person A blamed the newcomer, on the grounds that we’d expect recent changes should be very available!

      Is there a succinct phrase for “failing to check for third options”/“failing to check your assumptions”?

    I’m in the middle of reading Leviathan Wakes, the first book in The Expanse series, and the antagonist takes advantage of precisely this, but in Interplanetary politics.

  The easiest approach is to take a false belief they already have and exaggerate it, but only if such exaggeration can be made be useful to you. See [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nv3oLT3K4OQ) for example. EY does this in HPMOR when Hermione's army pretends to be easily wiped out leaving Harry and Draco's armies to diminish each other's numbers before Hermione's army comes back and wipes them both out. Draco and Harry had the false belief that Hermione would be an inferior tactician, so she was able to plan around exaggerating that misconception and then exploiting the exaggeration.

  Exaggerating misconceptions works well due to a variety of biases. Confirmation bias is one - the model you worked out or predictions you made seem to be even more on-point than you originally thought. Bandwagon effect is another when groups are involved, people don't want to run against the group consensus that X is true, so if you exaggerate X, they don't typically suggest that it's merely a ruse and X was actually wrong all along. Actor-observer bias also plays a role here since other people will be more likely to explain exaggerated X through your personality/characteristics than through external circumstances that could artificially encourage the appearance of X. The self-serving bias also plays a role when the trait you're exaggerating is a negative trait, like cowardliness, or ineptitude - the easy 'victory' must have been because of innate superiority!

  "Rivalry" is a cognitive bias in and of itself.

  It's something like 'target fixation'.  People focus so intently on their immediate-next-step ("observe the motorcycle" / "beat this specific guy") that they lose sight of their long-term-goal ("don't crash" / "win large-scale victories").

  When you realize your opponent is doing this, you look for the places where you could be "defeated" without losing much ground on the things you care about.  Alternately, look for long-term gains that don't look like a "victory".

  Say we find ourselves in a Highschool Tennis Anime.  My true goal is "be the best tennis player when we graduate in 4 years."  I realize I have a rival.  My rival's goal is "defeat /u/best_cat at whatever formal contest is next."  The first thing I notice is that I don't have to care about my rival.  But maybe contests provide some resource, so I need to win some.

  Next step is looking for resources that don't seem like overt prizes and get those before they're contested ("Hey, senior student / inexplicably talented janitor, are you up for games on weekends?").  Then, I'd look for contests that WILL become relevant in 4 months, and see if I can start laying groundwork now.

  Then I'd invent stuff for my opponent to do.  They want to defeat me.  I want to build resources.  So create contests where they spend a bunch of energy "winning" a morale-victory, but not getting resources.  ("Hey!  A week of snack-money says I'm a better player with my off hand!")
  ```

  - u/EthanCC:
    ```
    One example could be, in that situation, practice with your opponents and either subtly throw the matches or show behaviors you wouldn't normally (IE you intentionally bias one side of the court, if that's a thing in tennis- I don't play). Meanwhile, you practice with the better players who aren't your direct competition to actually improve.




    Of course, this is one of those things that seems smart at first glance but looking deeper reveals it's not a great idea- so pretty much par for the course for plans in anime. If you get a reputation as being a poor player you may lose access to the resources you want since people won't see the point of spending them on you. Also you are betting a lot on being able to show false behaviors while covering up the actual weaknesses an opponent might be able to exploit in the real match, which wouldn't work on weaknesses you aren't aware of. This is the sort of plan you'd only want to do if you're already behind and want to cover up your progression.

  This would be a pretty bad plan. Biases exert influence when someone has enough information to come to the right conclusion but then they go to the wrong one instead. But a good villain shouldn't be giving away possible clues without significant recompense. So biases would only ever be used incidentally as part of backup backup plans.

  A detective novel of some kind might be a good place to look for this. My first thought was that Death Note might have some of what you're looking for. Alternatively, is there any genre of fiction in which people spend a lot of effort trying to manipulate public opinion? I guess Shadows of the Limelight would involve this, to an extent.

  If you're looking for deceptive characters, and not ones who leverage named biases specifically, the Vorkosigan Saga by Bujold and the Going Postal series by Pratchett are both good.

      I was going to say that there's a genre of /r/Outside which has way too much of this.

  Uh. Does "honeypot" count? Surely over-trusting attractive people counts as a cognitive bias.
