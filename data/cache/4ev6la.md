  For those that aren't familiar with Psi, it's a mod for the game Minecraft that allows you to create spells based on linking effects ('tricks') with operators and constants to create an effect. 

  To simplify it a bit, the mana ('psi') cost is related to the number and strength of tricks, and the ability to cast it is based on the caster's psi, the complexity of the spell and some limits on effect radius. 

  This post discusses the results of this person's experience with combat in the game using Psi. The interesting part is that they had to throw out the whole concept of classic fantasy mage spells when confronted with the reality of using inventable magical effects to target and kill other players.

    ```
    Reminds me of the Eragon series. In that magic system, there were a multitude of ways to kill someone instantly, but in the time taken for a mage to pronounce a spell and for it to take effect, your opponent could get one off too, leading to instant mutually assured destruction. So combat between mages became a matter of battling telepathically (which could be done wordlessly) to gain control over the opponent's body and prevent them from being able to enunciate spells.
    ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      I never understood what happens if you decide to defect from that prisoner's dilemma. Like, cast an insta-death spell as your opponent is still trying to dominate your mind. I mean if you do it out in the open you become a priority target for all enemy mages but if you do it in private no one ever needs to know about what appears to be near suicidal ruthlessness.

          >And second, it was mentioned that in a head to head battle if a mage cast an instant-death spell their opponent generally had time to also cast one.

          Yeah but if I understood right then it seems that if they expect a telepathic battle of wills they won't start casting their own insta-death spell. And if you use the shortest one they can't possibly both notice what you're doing and do it themselves too except if they are insanely more skilled than you, in which case they shouldn't have had an incentive to tele-battle you first.

          I'm not saying this should always work, just that it should in a case where your opponent thinks you're going to do the sensible thing and you decide not to. Prisoner's Dilemma pretty much.
          ```

          - u/Murska1FIN:
            ```
            Without knowing about the subject matter, I could imagine that the instant-kill spells aren't actually instant in that they, after cast, take a short time to kill the other mage (during which time said mage can cast one in return).
            ```

            - u/JackStargazer:
              ```
              In one situation, I remember the protagonist killing enemies by pinching closed certain blood vessels in their brains.

              If he did that right, that's pretty much instant death. There wouldn't be enough time for the brain to process that it was dying before it did.
              ```

      - u/GaBeRockKing:
        ```
        There's a casting delay-- spells don't come into being immediately after pronouncing the words, and of course your opponent can probably notice you concentrating on a spell, and immediately retaliate with their own.

    If we ever get a /r/rational community minecraft server, it better have this mod.

      and some other mods that are fun (intangeable, Blood Magic) or are fix mods (quark)
      ```

    - u/Execute13:
      ```
      And Ars Magica 2 and Blood Magic, and any other munchkinable magic system.

      Ars Magica 2 can create, with a bit of effort, *geometric* spell shape cascades, up to ~10^5. You can build a spell that causes one hundred thousand lightning strikes nearby.

    ```

- u/Execute13:
  ```
  The primary reason for this thing happening is that offensive power entirely outclasses defensive power within the strict radii. A single successful hit can either cripple or outright kill the opponent, and within 64 metres, targeting is extremely strong. Within 32 metres, entirely *passive* effects are deadly, no aiming required. This situation only arises when both combatants have these capabilities and are aware of each other. 

  As with nearly any setting where this kind of power is available, however, the element of surprise is virtually insurmountable.

  Thank you for sharing the link. Reading a story with laws like this would indeed be very interesting. 

  Regarding your title, however: it still isn’t strictly a real-world experiment, since the laws of the system can easily be redefined. For instance, most magical systems work around this issue by introducing resistance to magic for magical creatures. Usually it’s something about having first to overwhelm the opponent’s mind\mana to be able to directly influence the physical space\body they are occupying (often it’s even easier to kill somebody then modify them magically with\out their consent).

  In [*The Games We Play*,](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/RyuugisTheGamesWePlay) for a non-obvious example, the monsters which were technogenic in nature and lacked magic and “soul” could be killed simply by violating their body structure (no magic = no defence against magical interruption). The author didn’t use it to its full potential, but it was there. Similarly, in [*Dungeon Keeper Ami*](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/DungeonKeeperAmi) one’s body was considered one’s own “magical territory” — meaning that its owner had more power over it in some aspects than anybody else.

  So, a properly equipped player is an aerial teleporting artillery sniper with a kill radius... But that's only the archmages. The less powerful might only be able to sustain a few teleports, or a single projectile. Army tactics might focus around training people until they can use projectiles, then graduating a few to specialize in killzone spells and act as a living minefield to keep the enemy from closing and activating spell circles. Stealth and extraction specialists might infiltrate and trigger spell circles within enemy fortifications, so frequent landscaping spells to destroy all cover within the Spheres they might use to hide while teleporting would be important. You might even have a balance of combatants who use the spells and engineers/researchers who build them. Another valid method might be decieving enemies into triggering spells and wasting Psi, then closing for a close-range kill once the effect expires.
  ```

  - u/Execute13:
    ```
    That's the jist of things.

    When there's more than one player per side, things get a bit more interesting. There is a trick (spell effect) that teleports all entities in a certain list (say, all nearby players) forward in the directions they are individually spacing, and another that adds momentum to a list of entities in an arbitrary direction. You can make mass flight spells, that'll effectively grow stronger as the group grows, like the Yangban from Worm. That's actually quite a good analogy.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      That'd make for some devastating strike teams - one group uses psi to carry everyone in at speed, maybe based on a disc arrangement, then one player ports out of the spell area-of-effect and engages enemy at close range - except the enemy has just been spending psi trying to snipe the group from the sky, so the paratrooper has psi advantage. Or if it's a defend-the-objective thing, setting up a 64*3*3 block tower in midair to plant a spell circle on top of for placing a LOT of TNT, then lightning to set it off.
      ```

      - u/Execute13:
        ```
        ^markdown ^is ^eating ^your ^asterisks

        Spell circles don't actually require a sensible-sized target; the side of a single block of sand about to fall will do just as well as a 3\*3 platform.

        Your mention of paratroopers reminds me: you can actually turn invisible, and there's a couple ways to cancel fall damage. Being inside each other's kill radius *usually* goes in favor of whoever has the best regeneration and health potions. So you can fly into the sky, turn invisible, take off your pants, parachute down, then put your pants back on to kill everyone.

        ...

        *Man* that sentence sounds weird out of context.
        ```

- u/MatterBeam:
  ```
  Are 'guided' spells possible? Are spell 'chains' possible (execute A, perform B, execute A again after delay C)?
  ```

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    Yes about the chains. Mana cost and complexity and potency add up, though, and there's a hard cap on summed potency in a single cast that you could use on three effects, or you could use it on one (Complexity usually doesn't come into play, but you can't make the logic *too* complicated). What do you mean about guided spells?
    ```

    - u/MatterBeam:
      ```
      Intention:

      Guided-missile launcher platform with another person acting as shielder and a third person acting as targeting, if necessary.

      Launcher just fires fire-ball type missiles into the air. Shielder protects him from incoming magic. Targeter points and actively or passively tracks a target. Missiles fall on target.

      Basically, applying modern weaponry to Psi.
      ```

      - u/Execute13:
        ```
        At engagement ranges, projectiles can't home in on targets -- but if they do hit something, they have an effective 'blast radius' of 32 metres.

        Chain spells are doable, but not terribly useful unless there's multiple opponents in the effect radius and they can't violate the Spheres of Influence.
        ```

        - u/MatterBeam:
          ```
          Sounds like a challenge!

          Can you have 'MIRV' spells that cast blast areas spaced 32 meters apart in a square pattern?
          ```

          - u/Execute13:
            ```
            In air-to-ground engagements, you can manually shoot projectiles in a rough square pattern; four shots per second, and between four and ten shots in a volley. There's no way to automate or alter the aiming of projectile spells.

            Unfortunately, any sensible opponent will be way up in the air on a moving platform. **Projectile spells can't have an effect unless they hit something**. Unless there are targets every 32-64 blocks, you can't really carpet someone who's flying.
            ```

            - u/MatterBeam:
              ```
              Ooh! Aerial warfare!

              How about 'bomb' blocks with a spell on a timer or distance trigger. The 'interaction' is triggered and it explodes anywhere.
              ```

  - u/TheAtomicOption:
    ```
    Yes.

    Not really because spells can't activate other spells. All effects must be contained in the original spell. There is a function to delay the start of an effect after a cast, but I'm not sure if there's a way to delay some of a spell's effects without delaying the others.
    ```

    - u/MatterBeam:
      ```
      Timers between effects, so that they're staggered?
      ```

      - u/TheAtomicOption:
        ```
        I'm not sure. I think it may be possible to trigger one looping effect and then switch spells and time the cast of a different one so that they're staggered, but I haven't tested it. AFAIK there's no mechanism for doing that automatically.
        ```

    If you're new to mods, I recommend using mod packs. They gather together a collection of most of the most cool mods and also make sure that they work together well. I've moved on to building my own using Forge and the specific mods I like, so I don't know which packs have Psi in them. Every pack has a mod list though so you should be able to find one.

    If you want to play around with Psi by itself, you just install Forge, edit your profile in the minecraft launcher to use the Forge "version" of minecraft, and put the Psi jar file in a /mods/ folder in the directory where your forge install is.

    The [Feed The Beast launcher](http://www.feed-the-beast.com/) is the most popular. Another is the [AT Launcher](https://www.atlauncher.com/downloads). I would have stopped playing minecraft a long time ago if it weren't for mods. As is, I probably have more hours playing it than any other game. Psi is relatively new though, so I haven't played it much at all yet.
    ```

  - u/masterax2000:
    ```
    Download the latest version of psi. figure out what version of the game it's for. Download the corresponding version of forge. Run it, and install the client version. Open your minecraft launcher and change the version of the game it loads to the forge version that should now be in your versions list. Run minecraft. Close minecraft. Go to %appdata% and open your roaming folder. Open your .minecraft folder. Open your mods folder. Drag and drop psi into said folder. Run minecraft.

    If that doesn't work, watch a tutorial on youtube.
    ```
