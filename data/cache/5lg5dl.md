## [D] Sunday Skills Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Sunday thread for discussions on writing skills!

Every genre has its own specific tricks and needs, and rational and rationalist stories are no exception. Do you want to discuss with your community of fellow /r/rational fans...

* Advice on how to more effectively apply any of the [tropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic)?

* How to turn a rational story into a rationalist one?

* Get feedback about a story's characters, themes, plot progression, prosody, and other English literature topics?

* Considering issues outside the story's plain text, such as titles, cover design, included imagery, or typography?

* Or generally gab about the problems of being a writer, such as maintaining focus, attracting and managing beta-readers, marketing, making it free or paid, and long-term community-building?

Then comment below!

Setting design should probably go in the Wednesday Worldbuilding thread.

  I'm in the mood to challenge myself in writing. Would anyone like to suggest a prompt or challenge for me to write about?

    Write a heist for the challenge! To randomly pick a canon, go with Harry Potter. If that doesn't work for you, then a near-future world where 1% of people can read surface thoughts.

  Happy New Year!

  Sorry for being a few hours late, I had a clock which was somehow set three hours ahead leading me to post this about three hours late.

  *grumble, grumble, stupid digital clocks thinking I'm in a different time zone, grumble, grumble*

  I also found an interesting 7 Beat layout which works very well for the plot of any relationship story.

  * Beat 1 - The Hook – Why the protagonist needs/wants the romance/relationship.

  * Beat 2 - The Meeting – The two characters meet and an attraction, or reason for one, is established.

  * Beat 3 - Conflict Point 1 – Wherein the protagonist realizes they should not be together, as it conflicts with their goal/dream/beliefs.

  * Beat 4 - Raising the Stakes – Wherein the two characters are bound together, despite the conflict. They accept their love/relationship/attraction.

  * Beat 5 - Conflict Point 2 – The relationship looks good, all is working, but there is niggling doubt. The conflict continues to gnaw away at them, it's a false happiness.

  * Beat 6 - The Black Moment – It all goes wrong, all hope is lost. The relationship seems doomed.

  * Beat 7 - Resolution – Obstacles overcome, romance achieved, or tragic ending.

  The 7 Beats are clearly designed for a romance story, but it can work as well for platonic friendship, frenemy, bromance, or any story centered around relationships.

  I planing on using the 7 Beat structure with a group of 5 characters so we'll see how that goes....

  This year I'm gonna harness my compulsive nature to guilt myself into writing by marking down my word count in a calendar file at the end of every day.

  I am getting serious about editing *The Timewise Tales*, a static-timeline fantasy novel. It's told from three points of view which are wildly out of sync with each other. The first draft is complete, but now I'm having some trouble hammering it into a workable novel.

  The general idea is that the narratives are woven backward and forward like so:

  ch1: A1 talks with B23  
  ch2: B1 talks with C12  
  ch3: C1 talks with A5  
  ...  
  ch31: A13 talks with B4  
  ch32: B17 talks with A14

  The general ***narrative*** rules I'm working under:

  1. Never show the same scene from a different perspective unless there's a really, really good reason to.
  2. Scenes from the same viewpoint character go subjectively forward in time. *(If there's a scene from A's viewpoint, then the next scene from A's viewpoint will be subjectively after the first scene.)*
  3. *Most* scenes take place from the viewpoint of the character who is "changing" from the encounter, with the other character being the one who is reacting, or acting the way they do based on future information.
  4. The climax of the end of the book happens at the subjective middle of each timeline (with the epilogue/denouement effectively spread out through the entire book).

  As might be expected, this is proving tricky to map/edit, not just in terms of cause and effect, but in terms of making sure that it works on a narrative/story/character level. It's partly tricky because I need to make sure that things are revealed in the correct way to the reader, while also coming naturally from the characters themselves, e.g. "I'm pissed off at you because of a thing you haven't done yet" or "I'm teaching you this as a way of making peace about a wrong that I haven't inflicted on you yet".

  I think what I'm going to have to do is go through and mark each character's subjective timeline, then read through the novel three times, *then* start editing. But if someone has a suggestion for a better way to edit this, I'm all ears (but it is *close* right now, close enough that I think editing what I have is still a much better solution than making the map first and then rewriting from scratch).

  So, JaNoWriMo (January Novel Writing Month) begins! I'm writing my yaoi paranormal romance novel (yes, really). 

  Yesterday was almost a write-off because I slept so badly following my "spending NYE playing board games sober" party, but I forced myself to write *something* so I would have no 0 days. 

  Of course, once I started writing it flowed easily (I chose something that was easy to write, though), and I enjoyed writing, though I hate the result (it was written after a night of poor sleep). It is definitely not ready for even basic feedback. 

  Here's my beeminder goal if anyone wants to keep tabs on me: https://www.beeminder.com/mad/janowrimo 

  Something that just occurred to me: the main character is a vampire. How do I bring this up? In an opening scene do I just sort of take it for granted that  the reader knows that the main character is a vampire, or do I have to go into a basic description of vampire society, lore, etc? How do I do that? Does anyone have a link to something available online that introduces the concept of vampires to the reader? My Vampires Are Different, of course, but all the reader needs to know for now is that he can't go in the sun and has better senses than a human - you know, the usual; they can find out the rest later as the vampire's lover does.

  Things I need to do to fix the scene I wrote yesterday:

  * Rewrite it entirely (really)

  * Find out what the level of warfare technology was in 550 CE

  * Describe what people are wearing

  Goals today:

  * Write a completely different scene

  * Aim: 3,000 words
  ```

    DO NOT go into a basic description of vampire society and lore or I will put your book back on the shelf, or close the tab, or whatever other way I can stop reading as quickly as possible.

    Show, don't tell. First ideas would be having them casually drinking from a pouch of blood stored in the refridgerator, or having them check what time sundown is that day in a restless "come on, I have shit to do" kind of way. This depends on the specifics of your vampires, naturally; there are small things that make the world seem real to the reader, and you're better off incidentally showing those than infodumping. (Some people will say that they like being started off with an infodump. I'm not quite willing to call those people liars, but they're in the minority.)

    Obviously you also have the option of saving the reveal for later, but if you do then you want to lay in the foreshadowing and have it actually have some punch to it. But I generally think it's more effective to just leave as much "out in the open but unexplained" as possible and then explain it all later on, unless you're really good at foreshadowing in a way that doesn't look like foreshadowing until after the fact.

      Yeah, I really don't want to do a "by the way I'm a vampire and I need to eat a pint of blood every three days also i have a superstition about carrying money" sort of thing because it's... stupid, like you said. It takes you out of it. It reminds me of when I used to read *The Babysitters Club* and the first chapter would introduce you to each of the titular babysitters (so that way new readers wouldn't be confused). Even at 10 I would skip through this part because I already know Claudia is bad at spelling, Stacy has diabetes, Marie-Anne and Dawn are stepsisters and that Jessie is black!

      The first part is set with WW2 as a backdrop, and the two characters who ultimately fall in love are an American deserter and a 1500 year old vampire, so any exposition that needs to happen can happen as the soldier finds out about The Big Truth of the vampire.

      I'm actually writing at the moment, the scene after the vampire first starts drinking from his love interest, and the guy is understandably confused. That said, before he had his blood drunk, he was like "okay, rich guy, weird, asks me to do these strange errands, has weird superstitions about sunset, he's probably a Jew". I'm feeling a lot better about this section because I got a good night's sleep!

      We'll see how we go! Thanks for your input and encouragement. I really appreciate it.
