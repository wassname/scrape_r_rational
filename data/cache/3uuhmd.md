## [RST][BST] Language as an early obstacle to the plot?

### Post:

There is this story cooking around in my mind that I never really got to starting. The premise centers around the main protagonist being pulled from the modern world into a high-fantasy/steampunk world where the laws of physics does apply to some extent (yet are modified by the presence of magic). In a way, the views the main character brings to the table compared to how the local population does so with regards to magic are rather reminiscent to HPMOR. 

However, there is one certain problem that comes to mind. Inevitably, there must be a language barrier, since to me it is highly improbable that both would speak English. Having this obstacle that early in the story seems like a dealbreaker, since the story isn't about the language barrier but more about the protagonist munchkinning/min-maxing his way to power, Rationalist-style.

What is the best way to deal with this in order to keep the story interesting? Show the MC slowly learning the language, or somehow flash-forwarding (which seems contrived)? I do have the idea of using language - more specifically, the *ancient language* - as an early method of demonstrating the MC's munchkinry. 

It could be as simple as the world using magic by saying these words because they work. But what if you were to say them differently? Experimenting with grammar structures, portmanteaus, etc. and all that with the Ancient Language would be unheard of to that world, but would be logical to the MC because of the foreign perspective. I don't know; any ideas?

  if its not important for the plot and you don't want to use it as a tool for having a chance to convey the experience why not just solve it with magic? to be honest if its not central to the plot who cares how likely is it that its unlikely they speak English? or alternatively you could just say the MC studied some random language at the university\school because of Reasons and was lucky enough that their language is the same\similar enough not to be an issue?

    I care because I want to minimize suspension of disbelief. Ie., reducing the parts of the worldbuilding which can be explained by "oh it's coincidence", and increasing the parts that can be logically deduced/explained.

    However, I never really thought about solving it with magic (brain-fart moment). Perhaps there could be a sort of linguistic magic that translates ideas/intentions into understandable language.

      While its best if those kinds of moments could be minimized in the end hand waving it away is not that big of a deal, and personally i wouldn't really be bothered by simply ignoring it either.

      In the other hand, if it seemed like an important thing magicking it away would bother me just as much.

  Take a look at [The World Waits on Evil](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-world-waits-on-evil-hivers-eoa-ww.274791/) for an example of a writer narrating an entire story in a not-quite english style due to the natives not having words for all of the concepts and connectives. Note how it is interesting at first as a cool idea, but quickly becomes annoying and disruptive as you have to go back and re-read things to understand their meaning. The writer sacrifices eloquence for realism, and I think in the final counting he comes out worse off as a result of that deal. It would have been fine as an early problem that was swiftly resolved, but keeping it any longer than that becomes problematic.

  Seems relevant, anyway.

  As a foreigner, he's the only person who can speak or write the Ancient Language without it having an impact. They use him to write the first magic dictionary ever, necessitating that he meet with all the top speakers. For bonus points, the language doesn't even need to be magical.

  Fantasy stories often work on [Translation Convention](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention).    And that works for language-specific things too.  If the characters don't speak English, and are saying some kind of thing that only makes sense in English, the reader is supposed to assume that the characters are "really" saying something equivalent in their own language.

  Frankly, though, there's a stock solution for this.  When he gets pulled over, he picks up a magic Translation Convention.  But because you want to use the different languages as a plot point,  for whatever reason he notices that he's not "actually" speaking english (or whatever his native language is).

  Then you also have an excuse for him to be able to speak Local both fluently (magic translation) and badly (what he's learned 'without' the magic translation).

  Or you could just do the "make him a linguist" thing.  Depends on what you want him to be capable of with his pulled-over knowledge.

    ```
    There are quite a number of rationalists here suggesting the plot device of a linguist if I were to further explore this field. This is definitely ripe in plot opportunities, but I'd have to take a closer look and study up on linguistics (since while I am a professional engineer and amateur mathematician/logician, I am no linguist) before I decide if going in this direction is feasible. I am rather keen on it if possible though.

  Your protagonist got pulled into a different world. Why is he so special? In fact, maybe he isn't. Maybe there were previous events of this happening, hell, maybe it's fairly common. But because people aren't typically well suited to being forced into an entirely new dimension most of the time not much change is had. Where interdimensional entities have made a significant impact on history, their supernatural origins are transmuted by the constant re-telling of their fables into something unrealistic enough to be dismissed as fiction out of hand.

  What does that mean for your protagonist? Cross cultural contamination, for one. Maybe interdimensional travelers have contaminated each world's major languages' jargon, syntax, and even grammar. Now, you're not working with a completely alien language, but something much more similar, and therefore comprehensible. Make your character a polyglot to begin with, and while you still have to take time to let them parse the language, they're not starting from square one.

  And if you're wondering, this is basically my anthropic principle of interdimensional travel-- we don't see an interdimensional traveler be successful because they're just that special, we explicitly choose one of the luckier interdimensional travelers, who have an even easier job because it's been done before to some extent or another, for whatever reason.
