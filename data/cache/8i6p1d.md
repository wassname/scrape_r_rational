## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  So, how many magic user/superpowered people can I have in a Superhero setting close to our world, without it being unrealistic that the setting is similar to our world? And what changes should be expected and what powers wouldn't let the world be like ours? (Assume details and limitations of powers are so, that the exploits don't work or aren't OP.)

  The Powers would be all powered with calories (meaning food) or rarely (1 in 1000 metahumans) with external power sources.

  Powers would be superstrength (like max 10t), invulnerability (like artillery shots, not nukes), telekinesis, mind reading (and like one or two mind controller), pyromancers (like a lighter worth of fire, since fueled by eaten food), flying (50km/h limit, and max 200kg), and general spiderman level of stuff.

  [Two weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8eu9f1/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/dxyip5g) I posted about how I found the premise of *Out of the Violent Planet* to be an intriguing idea but I had no idea how to use it to create a story, so you can imagine how impressed I was when I started watching *Full Metal Panic!* and realized the story would fit surprisingly well into that RPG setting. The Whispered and their ability to intuitively understand and build sci\-fi technology make perfect sense in a world where Lovecraftian aliens speak to people randomly born psychic. Skimming the book has actually improved my enjoyment of the show because it provides ways to rationalize nearly everything that hasn't been explained.

  Everyone wants to get more contact with the aliens so they can make bank, but need to keep their scheming hidden from everyone else. Suddenly all the terrorist plots, deniable ops, and private military contractors have a completely logical background to support them. Mecha is just what humans decide to build with alien tech and the Lambda Driver is a weapon aliens never thought up themselves. Even the little details like Tessa being in charge of Mythril make more sense, if we make the \*very logical\* assumption that she is a Whispered, since leading a mercenary company is her way of maintaining autonomy from any nation that would abduct her.

  The way the show combines those elements with anime high school hi\-jinks also works in light of this, since it turns the weird gimmick into a brilliant way of grounding the story in the lives of humans. That's exactly how I think the premise of the setting should be used, have the plot revolve around the people we can empathize with and get us invested in protecting the world they like living in. It isn't just a joke about fish out of water like in [Chuck](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck), it's also a metaphor for the way the human and alien worlds are colliding to create chaos. This was obviously unintentional on the writer's part, but it's the exact framework for a story I was looking for.
