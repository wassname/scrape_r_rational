## Secret Krampus Story Voting

### Post:

26 enters! 1 leaves! 26 enters! 1 leaves! Who will win the Thunderdo-

Ahem! Wrong contest!

Whoops! Who's ready to vote!

The winner will be ~~working in a coal mine~~ whoever gets the most votes!

All of the stories linked will be posted as top level comments and anyone can vote for whichever story that they liked.

The voting will close on September 13th, 11:59 pm (EST) and the winner will get a month of reddit gold and bragging rights.

Anyone can vote, including the participants.

Some people haven't submitted their stories yet, but I will permit stories to be submitted after the deadline. They just will have less time to gain votes just like how late submissions for the Biweekly Challenge had less time to gather votes and win.

Not all prompts had a story written for them and submitted to the sister prompt voting thread.

This means that some stories posted here were written for a prompt where the prompter didn't submit a story. So don't be surprised to see a story written for a prompt that is not available to be voted for in the other thread.

Furthermore, some stories were written in a way that the prompts themselves are a spoiler. Hence, all prompts will be put in spoiler text, and it's suggested that the reader reads the associated stories first before reading the prompts.

  Prompt: >!It's said there are a million keys in the City of Locks, and twice as many doors. The Picker Guild tries to force their way through the doors with ingenious devices and working knowledge of the locks, while the Keysmiths sort and catalog every key found. The Cannoneers take a different path, trying their best to blast through walls and circumvent the doors, but their successes have been few, and they've raised the animosity of every other faction. Lastly, there are the enigmatic City Locksmiths, the lockers of doors.!<

      That's so nice of you, thank you! Most of my other writing isn't posted anywhere (and what is isn't ratfic), but I have another piece I'm thinking of posting in the sub when I polish it up more. My largest project is a murder mystery game that I wrote a few years back and run once or twice a year.

      Thank you for pointing out the multiple chapters! AO3 doesn’t make it as obvious as FF.net. The first chapter alone is a fascinating story, but the entirety is most definitely a ratfic of the highest order.
      ```

      - u/CeruleanTresses:

        Yes, I hope people read the comments and don't miss out on the complete story! When I thought it was just the first chapter, I was disappointed because it felt incomplete. I might not have caught it if I hadn't noticed later on that the word count implied a much longer story than the one I'd read. I thoroughly enjoyed the work as a whole, so hopefully everyone who reads it gets to read the entire thing.

    This story is really good! I noticed you wrote some other short stories, but I hope you write something longer. I think you've got the skill for it. :)

    First chapter definitely left a lot hanging, so I'm glad I noticed when people pointed out there were more chapters. Awesome!

      Thank you. To be perfectly honest, I wrote the entire thing Saturday morning right before the deadline (kinda forgot I was in this contest), and I think some of the logic isn't quite whole, mainly in the middle sections. I took this from a different much longer story I had planned, which would explain some of the logic and ideas better, but I think it also worked as a short story in a strange way. Though, I'm curious, >!why do you feel the ontological part was a surprise? I thought I kinda laid it out from the get-go.!<

      (**TL;DR at the bottom.** I'm basically gonna use this comment to rant about my own story; your comment is just where it all happened to come spilling out of me.) :)

      I'm glad you liked it! That's actually kind of a relief to read, because truth be told, I wasn't pleased with the way it turned out overall. I procrastinated a little bit trying to come with story ideas, and then I think the story suffered from a lack of planning.

      The seed of this story was just something I jotted down in my brainstorming document, something like "A character's legs fall asleep on the toilet and they have to escape a serial killer." The idea was kinda lighthearted and goofy, and it *seemed* to fit the prompt well enough. I had this Scary Movie-esque mental image of someone pulling themselves down a hallway all overdramatically with a killer stalking behind them all slow and menacing - but, like, funny. Because... toilet.

      I came up with the "bursts of stupidity" thing and the "trapped in a horror movie thing" as twin catalysts to move the story along to the beat of a standard horror movie. I thought I'd be all clever and have the bursts of stupidity be an actual tangible element in the story rather than just having stupid characters - and, considering this is /r/rational, I figured a rational character could *recognize* when she was being unusually stupid and then try to account for it.

      But then when I started writing the actual story, I realized that the rational tone I was trying to strike didn't fit with the goofy story I'd hoped to tell in the first place. I could only pick one, and given what sub we're on, the rational tone felt like the indispensable one. Even that first ridiculous mental image of the girl and the killer in the hallway didn't work, because in a rational story, the killer would just walk up to her, slash her throat, and walk away. This gave rise to a new problem in that *that image* (now cut from the story) was really the only thing linking this story to the prompt I'd been given!

      I played up the "escape" angle to try and fool people into thinking the story had something to do with the prompt. That's why the story starts with that particular line and then flashes back, that's why I named it "*Escape*" - to try and make it seem like there was some sort of travel happening, even if just in the reader's subconscious. I felt a little bit bad because I really did like my prompt, but I was too deep in it now and had procrastinated too long to change course. Near the end of writing, I actually realized the story would be better (more natural, more satisfying, more subversive of horror movies, more... feminist?) if my character got the jump on the killer and took him down, but then the "travel" content of the story would drop from, oh, about 3% to almost literally zero. So as much as I wanted that ending, I stuck with my original one.

      The end result is something that's too serious to be silly, too silly to be taken serious. It's trying too hard to fit a prompt that clearly no longer applies to it even remotely, and it feels scattered and unfocused as a result. Even the basic prose felt lackluster most of the time.

      **TL;DR:** The story got away from me.
      ```

      - u/CeruleanTresses:
        ```
        I extremely relate to the self-criticism here. I *loathed* my entry for probably 70% of the time I spent writing it. Just remember that almost everyone is extra-harsh on their own writing, and you gotta account for that when modeling how your readers are judging it (almost universally less harshly than you). Every flaw feels super obvious and magnified, which is useful for identifying areas to improve but an unfair measuring stick for how to *feel* about our work and ourselves. You wrote a solid, fun, complete story that a minimum of 12 people verifiably enjoyed, and I hope you're giving yourself credit for that!

        I will add--it would be fun to see your ideal version of this story where you're not beholden to the prompt! Do you see yourself editing and re-posting it later on?

      Thanks
      While brainstorming for this story. I realized there was a lot of potential for munchkinery with the prompt. However most of the applications for such power would be negative. So sure my character could have committed crimes and got away with them. That route just didn't inspire me. I needed to know why my character did what they did and committing crimes did not fit in the peaceful society I imagined. I was more interested in asking what are the consequences to society in a world that's telepathic. I imagined people would be a lot more compassionate and understanding. That there wouldn't really be any major taboos of discussion. Then I asked how would my character fit into that world. What would they want? 

      The story was originally going to be a lot longer and focused on the performances they were giving. As it turns out having a show where you can't just read the performers thoughts is a bit of novelty. And the communities reaction to it. 

      I however procrastinated and ran out of time. I realized that what I wrote did work as a story albeit different from what I had originally planned.
