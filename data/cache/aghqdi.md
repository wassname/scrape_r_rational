  - u/Academic_Jellyfish:

    It was mentioned a while ago that she would need to amputate and  replace the limb entirely to fix that injury. And a magical prosthetic would be a liability when facing any sorcerous Named. I guess she'll just have to mug another angel to get it healed.

      By this point it’s basically a part of who she is as a Named. As much as her sarcastic wit and the Mantle of Woe are anyways

          Or, more specifically, her Story. If she isn't Named I mean. First of the Night sounds pretty name-y but it might also be a title
          ```

- u/Nic_Cage_DM:
  ```
  If she's in Iserre, doesn't that mean she's going to take a swing at the Tyrant of Helike? I thought her goal was to contain the Dead King, not prop up Procer by fighting their other enemies.
  ```

  - u/Academic_Jellyfish:
    ```
    Her goal is to present the plan to contain the Dead King and the Liesse Accords at the same time; she'll need support from the Grand Alliance to properly implement them. She definitely can't put the Accords into place without support from a majority of the Good nations.
    ```

    - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
      ```
      Ah, that makes sense. I figured before these last few chapters that she would just pop up in Hannoven, kick the Dead King in the balls, then turn to the Prince and say "whats up, i've just saved your ass AND I have an army of semi-named in your territory, are you going to get on board with the Liesse Accords or will I have to select your replacement?"
      ```

  - u/signspace13:
    ```
    I think it's more likely she will Ally with him, she is on the side that opposes the gods, and I feel like the Tyrant sits firmly in that camp after yanking around the bard's chain so hard.
    ```

    - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
      ```
      To me it seems that the Tyrant is pretty firmly in the Gods Below camp, and if she helped him she'd be undermining her own goals of having A- a safe border with a friendly state to the west of callow, and B- containing the dead king.
      ```

      - u/JesradSeraph:
        ```
        Thinking that the boy Tyrant is in any camp to begin with, seems to me that’s a serious mistake to make...

        ```
        Sure, but he's not just a villain, he's a true believer. Remember, betraying your own gods is a fundamentally pious act for followers of the gods below.

  - u/TaltosDreamer:
    ```
    I think she is looking for our newly demoted Black Knight. She will need his skills to take on the dead king.

  - u/Dent7777:
    ```
    In the first part of the chapter, it seems that she hasn't heard a report from anyone yet. And then later she acts as though she has.

    What am I missing?

    - u/Rice_22:
      ```
      Ubua nodded at her when she came in. They were probably confining everyone to their homes and seeing who talks first.

  Indrani is alive and fully human! Yeah !!

  Akua also seems alive and fully human! Yea- wait, what? At the very least, I can suppose that she doesn't have a gigantic hole in her chest anymore, given the mayor's lack of reaction.

  As for Catherine, well. Her new hobby is trolling goddesses who own her soul, so I guess she's still delightfully insane despite having done away with most mind-warping influences.

  So.....they are not only actively watching but also actively *policing* her thoughts, even if it is just [Insistent Terminology](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology) for humours sake.

  Like all of her interactions with them this chapter, it fell completely flat to me. EE is writing them as if they are the Woe, the old buddies she has known and worked with forever, but they *aren't*. They are two of the oldest, most blood drenched monster there ever was. And we *still* don't know the specifics of their relationship. We saw *her* act of faith but their response was obscured.

  At this point they are still just a pair of overpowered assholes with more death and chaos because of their incompetence then anyone else in the world.
  ```

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    You are forgetting the guy they are going to fight, and the fact that Sve Noc did most of their atrocities to prevent their people from being eliminated and another Kingdom of the Dead from being created.

    Also, the most harmful thing they've done so far was not talking to her for a couple of days. They ar treating Cat as an equal, just as she treated them as peers worty of judging her. Give up.

      > You are forgetting the guy they are going to fight

      I'm really not. All of Neshama's horrors were deliberate choices, not incompetence.

      > and the fact that Sve Noc did most of their atrocities to prevent their people from being eliminated and another Kingdom of the Dead from being created.

      Yeah, the best they could squeak out in their attempt to avoid it was a monument to deranged viciousness. It speaks very poorly of their capability.

      As much as I dislike Malicia, she has at the very least been *competent*, until recently. Cat traded a vicious but successful boss she was almost free of for a vicious boss who needed her to empower them and whom she is now tied to in ways that are deliberately obscured.

      > Also, the most harmful thing they've done so far was not talking to her for a couple of days.

      No, the most harmful thing they have done is the **millenia of ritualistic slavery and drow sacrifice**. And then fucking up their own apotheosis badly enough they needed a godling unwilling to exercise her power (and therefore far easier to take) to stumble in.

      > They ar treating Cat as an equal, just as she treated them as peers worty of judging her.

      They very clearly are not.

      > “So **where’d we land on whether or not I have power of expulsion** from the faith again?” I finally asked crow-Andronike.

      > “No,” she replied.

      >“Maybe,” crow-Komena said at the same time.

      .

      > “You just wait,” I grunted. “One of these days I’ll **talk the damned crows into letting me** write your holy book and there’ll be an entire hymn about how much of a prick you are.”


      Even in jokes, there is a strict hierarchical line. She needs to ask *permission*. She needs to talk them into *letting* her do things.

      This is an entirely new kind of relationship, something as yet unseen in the narrative, for good or ill. Whether or not someone likes it, it shouldn't be written the same as other relationships have.

      As yet the relationship itself is worryingly undefined and has been for far too long. We badly need to learn the specifics of their arrangement. In the mean time, not having this new Goddess-Priest relationship written with the same casual informality which defines her relationship with her oldest and most beloved friends isn't a lot to ask.

      > Give up.

        It's almost like the Twilight Sages' fuckup has left them with only one possible solution and nothing to pay for it. Reread their conversation with the Envoy: they weren't malicious, just desperate, and the Below twisted their arms into pretty much everything you blame them for. I'm not saying it *isn't* unimaginably horrible, just that no currently present character was there in time for better options to be availiable.

        > No, the most harmful thing they have done is the millenia of ritualistic slavery and drow sacrifice.

        Sorry, missed a word: the most harmful thing they've done *to her* so far was not talking to her for a couple of days.

        > She needs to ask permission.

        Only for the stuff that affects the drow (either long-term or the immediate commands), which is reasonable, considering that Cat cares about the drow only as long as they further her agenda and they all know it. This also happens to be near all of her decisions of import, since the only people in her army that aren't going to have to follow her decrees as the Priestess of the Night are Archer and Diabolist - but then again we didn't see them even close to those two's interactions with Cat, so far (and even then I'd argue that Akua is disposable enough to be fair game). Besides, Cat was going to do pretty much the same thing, only with Winter making the slope even more slippery and no supervision from the conquered drow, so this is arguably fair. I'd withhold the judgement until we see how firm is their grip beyond that.

        > Whether or not someone likes it, it shouldn't be written the same as other relationships have. Not having this new Goddess-Priest relationship written with the same casual informality which defines her relationship with her oldest and most beloved friends isn't a lot to ask.

        I think it's more a combination of Cat sassing any higher power she comes across, the crows barely classifying even as half a divine avatar each, and Sve Noc having absorbed a mantle of power with Cat's soul inscribed on it (see also: Diabolist changing her narrative arc by leaning into the same influence).
        ```

  - u/LordSwedish:
    ```
    >We saw her act of faith but their response was obscured.

    Well it was presumably healing her up and making her essentially their arch-pope. Everything else aside, if I had just given Cat (of all people) that kind of authority and power I'd certainly want representatives there to watch over her. Aside from that, I'm fairly sure they can just hear Cat's thoughts all the time, gods do tend to have a strong bond to their appointed representative.
    ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    The process through which the crows were made was described as pinching off slivers of divinity. The crows were made with the specific purpose of letting Catherine communicate with her goddesses in a way which she finds intuitive, and to let them keep a close eye on her from a perspective that wasn't inside her own skull. Both of these goals are facilitated if the crows are things Catherine enjoys keeping around. She wouldn't talk to minders she hates, after all.

    Therefore, it makes the most sense for Komena and Andronike to make the crows out of fragments of themselves which seem most agreeable to Catherine. It isn't that the goddesses are now Cat's old buddies, it's that they created constructs which would behave like old buddies of Cat's in order to best serve their own purposes.
    ```

    - u/AntiChri5:
      ```
      This is a really interesting perspective I hadn't considered. I don't entirely agree with it, but I thank you for sharing it.

      > The crows were made with the specific purpose of letting Catherine communicate with her goddesses in a way which she finds intuitive, and to let them keep a close eye on her from a perspective that wasn't inside her own skull.

      In particular I am curious why you say this. It is reasonable speculation based what little information we have but you present it as fact so I am wondering if it is something I missed.

      >

      This part, though, I particularly like as an explanation. I still don't think Cat should be barter-sassing back and forth with them the way she does others (variety is important - the protagonist can't interact with everyone the same way) but this serves as a functional justification.
      ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        I suppose it's not a fact, but it makes too much sense for it not to have been at least part of their motivations.
        ```

  - u/melmonella:
    ```
    Why didn't this happen again?

    >Cat: So how about you help me go against the Dead King in return for me giving you all the power? *suicides and lets the drow have all the winter*

    >Komena: or...or...and hear me out here...we don't go against highly dangerous Dead King, and instead go conquer defenceless Callow? 

    >Andronike: sounds good to me.

    >Cat: wait no that's not what I want

    >Komena: who the hell asked you lol, you just gave us all the power
    ```

    - u/Frankenlich:
      ```
      ...Because then the dwarves won't let them leave the Ever Dark alive. They got out because Catherine (an entity they had already had dealings with) negotiated an exit by offering the Drow as a force to fight the Dead King. 

      The Dwarves would just shit stomp the Drow if they tried to make for Callow.
      ```

      - u/Ardvarkeating101:
        ```
        Not to mention the story they’d create with that power base
        ```

    - u/tavitavarus:
      ```
      Because if they conquered Callow they'd be surrounded by Praes, Procer and the Golden Bloom, none of whom would ever tolerate having the drow for a neighbour, especially if they'd just conquered an entire human nation. 

      They aren't fighting the Dead King because of a bargain with Cat. They didn’t even know about her Keter settlement plan when she gave them her power. They're fighting him because it's one of the only reasons the dwarves would let them go, and because they recognise that the best way to rejoin the wider continent is to do it in a way that benefits the surface nations. 

      If they emerged in any other way they would be a net drain on the surface world, earning the enmity of every other nation, which would be disastrous in the long term. Especially with the Wandering Bard out there to shape the story against them. With Cat's plan however, the forces of the continent will likely actively help the drow rather than hinder them.
      ```

  ```
  Oh my Gods Catherine has *two* shoulder devils!
