  Spectacular as always, especially for Leaf's character. I'm so relieved that she's acknowledging the mistakes she made in ch. 58, and learning things about herself in the process. Her realization that she *needed* to sac something during the fight, and that something needed to be a less "important" pokemon...ouch. That's already a tough decision to make, and I can't imagine how disgusted Leaf is going to be with herself later. I hope Red can help her through it.

  Speaking of which, poor Red, as always. I hope he can get into the hospital with all limbs intact so he can maybe try and not get horribly traumatized by how far he's pushing his powers + the fact that I'm pretty sure he *felt* someone die? Same thing with Leaf, jesus christ. I do not envy her for walking into an apartment and finding a dead mother and child. I hope Joy's eye injury can get fixed, but it's chilling that she's out for the rest of the fight, considering how useful Sing is.

    "Her realization that she *needed* to sac something during the fight... " I think we've all been there at one point one way or another. On the plus side, if she makes it through this in one piece she'll be one step closer to becoming a competitive pokemon trainer. :) Now if only she can get over her habit of stacking teams with status moves, it wouldn't do if she turns to the dark side of team building--stall teams.

      Oh she's already well on her way. She's got the Fortress for hazards, Wigglytuff for cleric, Saur for bulky seeder (fingers crossed for that M-stone), her off-theme rattata got conveniently killed off. Her battles'll be five chapters long by the time we hit Indigo Plateau.

  Damn this is such an effectively oppressive atmosphere. What I love most about it is the sense of unceasing attrition, a wound here a death there, like these are Pokemon they spent many chapters acquiring and one by one they are getting cut down, but never all at once. It has a brutal realism to it.

  &#x200B;

  Also I was someone who commented on the Red/Leaf cruise chapter that they thought Leaf was coming off like quite a jerk, and I wondered if that was intentional. This seems like some good confirmation that it was, and Leaf is dealing with the need to respect that good people can disagree on things.

  &#x200B;

  A prediction I have is that this is going to serve as a fiercely radicalizing chapter for the two of them vis a vis being a trainer. Red in particular had sortof put being a fighter on the backburner, but after this I think they will consider that particular skillset to have a much higher value.
  ```

  - u/PDNeznor:
    ```
    tbh I can't remember where half of these pokemon got caught. It's only really a handful that really feel like a part of the team to me. It's making me feel bad about all those pokemon I caught that I never really gave a second chance to. :(

    &#x200B;

    If it wasn't for the fact that it would be incredibly boring, I could see Leaf resolving to give up being a trainer after this to become a nurse. With how guilty she seems to feel about not being able to help she may do away with training altogether to pursue a more direct line to her goals. As for Red, I agree that he'll definitely reconsider the value of being able to fight against pokemon, although I don't know if that will lead to him wanting to become a battler any more or less since his methods of fighting tend to rely more on clever thinking and use of the environment than his skillfulness as a trainer. Can't wait to see him mind merge with his future charizard into battle like boss though.

  Seeing the danger that the magnetite posed, humans must spend some effort in either capturing or killing the really powerful Pokemon around their cities and regions. IRL humans are known to kill off lots of large predator populations that pose even a small risk to people in cities or other settlements; when those animals are dramatically more dangerous, the incentive to do the same would only be greater. Imagine if an onix got an equivalent of rabies. It could level a city block before anyone could even be mobilized to fight it. Maybe the rangers do periodic sweeps to capture/kill any of the dangerous evolved Pokemon in an area? This could also help to reduce the danger of Stormbringer rampages, if the average danger of each Pokemon in the stampede is lower.

  I don't think the effort would necessarily be worth it for the numerous Pokemon that never get that powerful, like Beedrill or rattatta. But sweeping caves out for larvitar or pupitar before they can become tyranitar could be practical.

  There's also a market-like negative feedback loop where trainers are incentivized to go and capture powerful Pokemon where they're most numerous, decreasing the danger and increasing the power a trainer can bring to bear. Years of this system could produce the world we currently see in Origin of Species, where the extremely powerful Pokemon haven't killed off and outcompeted all the weaker one: those really powerful Pokemon get taken out of the gene pool pretty quickly whenever humans set up shop nearby.

    Doesn't seem that way. Seems like its the weakest pokemon that would get captured the most, because they're the easiest to do so with. Look at how hard it was for the team to get Absol. 

    Rangers also seem to be somewhat about wild life preservation, so I don't know how they would feel about doing raids to wipe out certain pokemon. I agree it would be smart, i can imagine groups of trainers going into forests hunting Shiftree sort of like fox hunting
    ```

    - u/PDNeznor:
      ```
      From what we've seen of wildlife left to its own devices in this world it seems as though most pokemon tend to work in symbiotic systems (like the pineco's just hanging out with a vespiqueen's nest) so that pokemon culling pokemon tends to stray more towards the rare side. As for humans, I could see some effort being put in to eliminating especially dangerous or erratic pokemon to protect the wildlife and civilizations that would be effected. Although, depending on how much of a burden these pokemon naturally put on their ecosystems, it might be possible that there just aren't enough of them out there to naturally throw things out of balance without some crazy catalyst.
      ```

      - u/Lipat97:
        ```
        Well lets use the example of the Nidoqueen at the end of this chapter. Would it not make sense to go out and kill Nidoqueens and Nidokings before they end up in the middle of Vermillion City? And they can't be THAT hard to kill, I'm sure most gym leaders would be able to take out a herd of them lol.
        ```

        - u/BaggyOz:
          ```
          Interfering with ecosystems can have wide ranging consequences. There are lots of reasons why you might avoid taking unnecesary action against pokemon species. Taking out the king or queen in a local population could cause the entire local nido population leading to an overabundance of prey species that if riled up could be harder to deal with than the king or queen if riled up while also threatening any species of flora or fauna that they prey on due to overpopulation. Or any species that prey on the nido population are forced to roam further afield or migrate to find food. Or it might be that after taking out the king or queen a 'rina or 'rino quickly evolves to take it's place which would make it too risky to keep putting them down.

          It was probably far enough from any settlement that they either didn't know it was there or didn't consider it a problem.   
          There's also the fact it might have some important role in the ecosystem (considering Nidoqueen are infertile they probably serve some special purpose)

      I'm not sure this is necessarily true. We follow the perspective of people who have been trainers for less than a year. Trainers who already have a good selection of Pokemon may decide not to go for weaker Pokemon at all, because even though they're easier to catch, it would either take too much effort or not even be possible to train them up to a usable state. Except for people who have a reason to own weak Pokemon like gym leaders, I would expect most trainers with a few years under their belt to skip the easy to catch rattatta for something more powerful or exotic. Time spent training a rattatta or Pidgey up to a usable state is time not spent training something like a Alakazam or Gyrados.

      We're also seeing the world after my hypothetical historical changes. Young trainers would have an easier time catching the powerful Pokemon when they were more common, and they would want to catch them because they are stronger.

      Then again my original post is just speculation and may be either based on wrong/incomplete data or flawed in some way. There isn't a good way to tell until the author confirms or denies it in or out of story.

        But even experienced trainers and rangers were getting messed up by the Absol. I'm not saying that trainers with 5 pages are still going to be catching pidgey, but I do think it would pretty hard for them to catch an Alakazam or a Gyarados. And even then, they are going to end up catching the weaker Alakazam and Gyarados. Because the stronger ones probably won't get caught. 

        >Then again my original post is just speculation and may be either based on wrong/incomplete data or flawed in some way. There isn't a good way to tell until the author confirms or denies it in or out of story.

        Well the nice thing about reading a rationalist fiction is that we can use ration to speculate pretty effectively. The author clearly intends to design a world that makes sense, so we just extrapolate what would make sense based on the information given.
        ```

        - u/Electric999999:
          ```
          Absol is a rather unique pokemon in this setting. The challenge wasn't that experienced trainers couldn't handle something that strong, it's that it has pressure which seems truly crippling, it hinders decision making ability (easily the most important part of the trainers' job) and makes wild pokemon crazy/aggressive.   
          You wouldn't face those issues fighting a Nidoqueen, so as long as you have a sufficiently powerful team you could probably handle it.  
          Also consider the fact that most of these powerful pokemon evolve from things that are much more easily caught, so there should be veteran trainers who've raised them from the first stage, so not only would they be able to fight them, but other trainers would have to be good enough to beat those trained Nidoqueen to stand a chance in tournaments.

  Recently binged the entire thing over the course of a few days. I love it! Rediscovering this world you've recast to be more realistic is making me feel the same way I did the first time I played the games. 

  I especially love the way you've handled legendaries. It makes me wonder, if Kanto's Trio are constantly surrounded by storms and they don't even have the weather abilities in the game, what would the storm following a pokemon like Kyogre look like, or even worse, its primal reversion? Anyway, these antagonists you've created as pure, untouchable forces of nature are just epic to watch. I hope Red and Blue end up doing something cool about it.

  i have a question about an earlier chapter (chapter 50):

  > It isn't until the personal fitness training class that she starts to have fun, running with Raff through an obstacle course like it's just another day at the park, but with more interesting games to play. The newly evolved ivysaur has seemingly boundless energy, and has taken to his nickname without confusion. She had to explain it to Blue: Red understood right away, of course.

  I'm like Blue. What's the explanation behind the name Raff?

  Im starting to get the impression that trainers are a lot less common then I expected. It seems nearly every normal citizen has no pokemon, and even most trainers have very limited options. This is a pretty stark contrast to the previous chapters where we saw just random rangers have pretty strong pokemon, and quite a few high tier trainers around the gyms. Im sure there's some places with more trainers than others, but maybe being a trainer just isn't worth it for a lot of people. Is being a trainer just too much of a time investment for someone who wants to be, say, a banker or an engineer? Maybe its a huge cost investment? The only thing i think contradicts this is the age of the kids. If the kids are only 12, then it's clear that people can have a training period when they're young where they try out being trainers, and then if they want to do something else they can put down the belt and pick up the books. Maybe this is one of those societies where you have to choose your path ridiculously early, or maybe the cost investment thing really is the big difference.

        The people who have trained Pokemon would be better able to congregate in the shelters, as they would feel safer leaving their homes when there are wild Pokemon outside. So the people we see in this chapter, the people who aren't in the shelters, are much more likely not to have any Pokemon. You'll notice also that there's only like a dozen or so people left in an apartment complex? It's perfectly plausible that the majority of people have at least one Pokemon they can rely on to some extent, and we're only seeing the outliers.

          Really? I thought it would have been the other way around. I suppose its easier for people with pokemon to move during the storm, but it seems they would be more eager to move before the storm whereas trainers might think they can stick it out in their homes.
          ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    /u/I_Probably_Think is correct, most trainers are already in organized defense of the city :) To the broader point though, I suspect something like 1/4 of people try being trainers at some point in their lives, and maybe 1/6 of them stay trainers past the initial few years, not counting those who die.
    ```

    - u/Lipat97:
      ```
      <3 That sounds valid. That's about the same as most militaristic societies iirc (like Sparta), and countries at high risk tend to get higher turn out for their defensive forces (US during WWII being the famous example).
      ```

  - u/PDNeznor:
    ```
    From what I remember reading, it seems like becoming a trainer in your early years is encouraged as a rite of passage kinda thing, but it does require somebody to put down some cash to buy the license/gear as well as pass an examination (I think?). On top of that is the danger factor, we've already seen a lot of rando's just straight up murdered on their journey. But yeah, it feels like the strong trainers are few and far between even among a select few. On the other hand, a couple of kids with mostly scrubby pokemon have been getting by pretty alright so far... seems to be more about how you use them than how strong they are.
    ```

    - u/Lipat97:
      ```
      But there is not a single area in which 20 year olds do not out perform 12 year olds. If it's about how you use them, then the kids would get destroyed every time. Even in situations where physicality isn't important, like chess, a 12 year old will consistently lose against a 20 year old. There's a reason chess championships are age gated. This should hold even more true in a world where your pokemon get stronger over time. The kids are not only behind because they are children and have less physical and mental development, but they're also behind because the opponent's pokemon would have been trained for years longer. It's not really realistic unless they're significantly better off than normal kids in terms of training and supplies, which is possible. There are examples of child chess prodigies ranking pretty high at young ages. But those are like, one in a billion. They're not only natural savants, but are generally from very well off families and have a loooot of resources behind them (even for a relatively resource light endeavor). I just don't see how the average 12 year old would even be able to compete with other trainers, assuming trainers stay trainers past like 16.
      ```

      - u/PDNeznor:
        ```
        Yeah, I agree, most if not all of the older trainers we've seen  so far tend to be better equiped and better trained than pretty much anybody younger than them, which makes sense. Like you said, more time to trainer and gain experience and gather useful items and such. Although, it also seems like many adults didn't become trainers at any point in there lives, or at least for a very small time in there lives, so they're going to be less capable at the thing than somebody that continues to put effort in, which also makes sense (a junior competitive chess player will beat out somebody with only passing knowledge of the game pretty much every time). It also seems like our protags are also prodigies in their own right if we take their older acquaintances Amy and her brother as the standard for somewhat older trainers, so our view of the world is skewed in that respect as well. Could be that most 12 yr olds are basically scrubs with pidgeys and rattatas.

        &#x200B;

        tldr: if adults seem to be less capable trainers in this setting it seems to be more a factor of they just didn't stay trainers long enough to really know what to do more than that they would be bad at it.

  Cool chapter, although I think something is not leting me enjoy it as much as it deserves. It could be the voice in my head screaming "I WANT TO SEE ZAPDOS ALREADY". 

  Still, I love the apocalyptic feel these legendary pokemon bring. Just their literal presence is enought to bring chaos. You are amazing at showing the mon part of pokemon. This situation is terrifying. And to think many of us wished as children for pokemon to exist. 

  At least Red and Leaf are been able to manage, even if it is with so much pain and deaths. And probably permanent mental trauma (not even accounting for pressure added damage). But hey, at least their relationship is growing. We shippers are content. Just don't kill them before the confession.

  I also like how pressure, like dementors in hpmor, is the biggest fear of any rationalist protag: a power able to deprive them of their reason. Does it count as a trope?

  Excellent chapter as always. Quick question though. We know that in Kanto, the citizens have to deal with the Legendary Bird trio constantly causing casualties. In your story, do other regions have similar issues with their legendary Pokémon? Do Sinnoh natives have to watch out for waves of attacks from Heatran or Darkrai nightmare epidemics? Do the people of Alola have to be constantly wary of their Island deities going on a rampage, or an extra-terrestrial attack from UBs? Just curious how unique Kanto's situation is compared to other regions in your stories' world.

        Must be great to live in Hoenn since their trio is locked away, and I can't imagine the lati's doing much other than a few sonic booms here and there. And they have Jirachi!

          I doubt Jirachi actually works like that in this universe.

            Maybe it does try to grant wishes, but within the limitations of its actual abilities. Of course that would raise the question of why it acts like that (and also how it understands wishes, but maybe it's just smarter than other pokemon or especially talented at learning desires with telepathy), but it's a possibility if you want to keep the myths around Jirachi in a more reasonable universe.

      Not really, Johto wouldn't be too bad: the beasts don't fly and Lugia seems to be aquatic. Not really sure what Celebi would do though.  
      Hoen might actually have it the easiest: Deoxys is the only native legendary with pressure (and I'm not sure if Deoxys is actually native), though Kyogre and Groudon made as powerful as legendaries in this fic would be utterly terrifying on their own if they're not asleep (Rayquaza and the Regis would obviously be dangerous, but at least they don't play havoc with the climate).   
      Sinnoh could be anywhere from hell on earth to fairly average: on the one hand you could have Palkia, Dialga, Giratine, Arceus, Darkrai, Cresselia, Uxie, Azelf, Mesprit, Shaymin, Regigigas and Heatran all in one region, on the other most of those may well be absent: Regigigas hiding somehwere undergroud asleep, Dialga and Palkia don't really seem to be part of the normal world most of the time, Giratina lives in the distortion world, Uxie, Azelf and Mesprit are sleeping lakes, Arceus is never around and I think Shaymin are limited in what enviroments can sustain them, That just leaves you with Darkrai's nightmares, Heatran's volcano stuff and whatever Cresselia does.

        I have to agree with you on most of those points. I didn't take into account flight as a factor and the personal dimensions the Sinnoh Legends live in. 

        However, what we should keep in mind is the power gap which exists between the lesser legendaries (birds, beasts, regis) and the greater legendaries (Ho-Oh, Lugia, Rayquaza). We haven't seen or heard of any of them yet in the story, but I could imagine the gap between the two being massive, just like the one between legendaries and regular mons in this fic. Something to keep in mind is that Pokemon like Snorlax and Arcanine have a closer Base-Stat Total to the birds than the birds do to Lugia. 

        This isn't even taking into account Pseudo-Legends, for which Hoenn certainly gets the short end of the stick.

  You know, I hope we don't even see the battle with Zapdos, just tangentially learn about it through Blue's eyes. Legendary pokemon feel more and more like Eldritch beings powerful in ways incomprehensible. Affecting the mind with Pressure miles away.

  As for Red and Leaf, I'm worried this will end up making them codependent. Honestly I thought Red would be safer from pressure with his partition shields but constantly using abilities seems to be wearing him down faster than anyone else.

  I'm also very very worried about Leaf making assumptions about her mind being altered by Red. Causing even more distrust, and pulling them emotionally apart. Then all it would take is Red reading her while she feels distrust toward him and he'll be devastated.

  Ohh! Speaking of reading, Mewtwo! Where is our best boi? I really really want him to meet Red, what would he make of that Partition? Perhaps be surprised at independent discoveries of similar techniques for hiding the mind?

  More than Legendary battles, while I look forward to immensely, I was to see Mewtwo explore the world.

  I'm digging the introduction of magneton, and glad leaf has one now.

  My favorite pokemon are always the ones that are just bizarre or not based on any animal i.e. magneton, chandelure, klinklang, cofagrigus, zurkitree.

  Also made that magneton feel like a salient threat; I like how different it gets when dealing with something seriously powerful. It's also interesting that it's leaf that has it now, since it's something that's mostly good at blasting away with raw power, which is something she's generally reluctant to do. I predict she'll either trade it, or maybe this experience will nudge her in the direction of knowing that sometimes, even though it's unpleasant, you have to act in an extreme and decisive way, and her coming to train her magneton would be an interesting expression of that.

  > Real trust requires uncertainty. It requires situations where the person might make choices that you'll never know, might even make choices that appear to be wrong, but which you'll accept anyway because you trust that they had a good reason.

    I specifically prefer to use the word "trust" opposed to "faith" to keep them distinct, personally. Leaf knows Red and has been through a lot with him. Her trust is based on first hand experiences.

    If someone tried to apply the above criteria to someone they've never met before, or someone who they've only learned about through some piece of media (particularly media biased toward that person), we wouldn't commend their trust, we'd consider them  misguided or naive. The whole idea of faith only really makes sense when it's specifically about unjustified trust/confidence in someone.

    Needless to say, I dislike faith and think it's net-harmful for most people and for society. I don't think that means people shouldn't trust each other, though: only that they should base that trust on something rational and meaningful.

      > I specifically prefer to use the word "trust" opposed to "faith" to keep them distinct, personally.

      Hmm. Ok, but I think we're defining faith differently, then, because my understanding of it is practically synonymous with trust.

      > Leaf knows Red and has been through a lot with him. Her trust is based on first hand experiences.

      > If someone tried to apply the above criteria to someone they've never met before, or someone who they've only learned about through some piece of media (particularly media biased toward that person), we wouldn't commend their trust, we'd consider them misguided or naive.

      Ah, that's a whole separate discussion, about whether trust in God is *justified*. Most Christians I know (and I'm guessing most Muslims too) would assert that they do indeed have a personal relationship with God, based on experiences, despite the lack of face time. But I wasn't trying to argue that; I was just acknowledging that you accurately described the goal state of that relationship, the level of trust that is held up as an ideal.

      If you do want to discuss whether that implicit trust, "I believe you have a good reason even if it doesn't make sense to me," is based on sufficient evidence in a religious context, then ok, we could do that, but it may be a bit off topic here.

        > Ok, but I think we're defining faith differently, then, because my understanding of it is practically synonymous with trust.

        I think a lot of people use the two interchangeably, and it's something that bothers me on a clear-communication level. If people talk about trust/confidence in a way that indicates "there are good externally verifiable reasons to predict how this thing/person will act," then they're not talking about what most religious people mean when they say faith, which is usually something more like "I know this is the thing I'm supposed to do/believe regardless of what the evidence says (and maybe it feels good to do so) so I will."

        >Most Christians I know (and I'm guessing most Muslims too) would assert that they do indeed have a personal relationship with God, based on experiences, despite the lack of face time. 

        Then they're still using the words "personal relationship" different from the way they would if describing someone in their life who they would decide to give their trust to or have blind faith in. It really is a matter of clearing up the language to show the difference: no matter what internal experiences makes someone feel justified in their faith in God, the lack of externally verifiable interactions still marks it as separate from "trust/confidence" in non-supernatural things.

        >If you do want to discuss whether that implicit trust, "I believe you have a good reason even if it doesn't make sense to me," is based on sufficient evidence in a religious context, then ok, we could do that, but it may be a bit off topic here.

        I'm fine with having that discussion, here or elsewhere :) Just wanted to clarify that I think there's good reason to distinguish them, though I do appreciate your original intent in describing the similarity to the religious goal state.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          Ok :)

          First, a matter of levelling the field: you referred to "externally verifiable" evidence twice. However, if that really is what's required - What evidence could Leaf present in a courtroom to prove that Red is trustworthy? Could she bring enough to convince any fair minded but moderately skeptical individual that they are obligated to trust him implicitly, as she does?

          There's his actions in providing Abra to help the community at below market rates. But as she's already seen from the online discussions, it's not hard for someone to suspect ulterior motives there, like gathering money with one hand and popularity with the other. Moreover, since she did the same, any effort to paint that as evidence of good character has a conflict of interest.

          She's seen him hesitate to condemn Yuuta to death as a renegade, but was that because he's compassionate, or just because he was put on the spot? Or was he actually involved somehow? Not strong evidence to an impartial third party.

          He's always been nice to her. But as she now knows, he has a crush on her, so that may not have been entirely unselfish, nor reflect his usual character.

          And that crush leads into another point: she found out about it because he used his psychic powers to transmit that emotion to her. She has spent months in the company of a psychic who specializes in mimicking and projecting emotional states - and coincidentally enough, she feels inclined to completely trust him! That would go down great in cross-examination, I'm sure.

          And both Leaf and Red have shown a willingness to flatly lie to authority figures when it suits their purposes, as on the SS Anne.

          As far as I can see, she would have very little evidence that might convince a neutral external party to trust Red.

          Is her own trust, then, irrational and naive? Or does she, rather, have sufficient valid evidence for herself, which nonetheless is not externally verifiable?
          ```

          - u/DaystarEld:
            ```
            Well first off, the standard of a courtroom isn't necessary. As far as I'm aware no one acts or expects others to act on such a high standard of verification for their personal relationships. A courtroom is designed as an adversarial system: it's right and proper for people to nitpick, question motives, question intent, etc. But when people make friends and decide to trust each other, it's not about convincing other people that the person they're friends with or trust are "genuinely selfless" or any such impossible metric. It's just about being able to point to actions taken and efforts made that built their trust in them.

            Like if a friend helped you move, you could be suspicious that they only did it so you could help them move at some point in the future, or to win your trust so they can come rob you, or something. There are plenty of people who do think that way. But I think most people would accept it as *weak evidence* that they may be a good friend who cares about your well being.

            Then maybe that friend drives out to give your car a start when your battery dies. And another time they bring you some food when you're sick. And another time they apologize first for an argument the two of you get into.

            There is no way to externally verify that they actually care about your well-being and values. But you would probably start to trust them regardless, and if someone asked you why and you mentioned things like that, they would have to be pretty cynical to say "Well that doesn't *prove* anything, they could just be playing the long con!"

            They'd also be missing the point. Because it's not about "proof." It's about sufficient externally verifiable events, and what those mean *to you.* No one can *know* what's in someone else's heart, or else the whole concept of trust would be meaningless.

            For Leaf, the things you're listing that Red did are a start, but she has also seen him work hard to update his beliefs, seen him promise to try restricting his pokemon diet to align with her values, seen him put his fear aside to help strangers. None of this is proof that he's a good person, and you could dismiss a lot of the things he does toward her in specific by "well he has a crush on her." But why does that matter? She still has to make a decision to trust or not trust him. What other criteria should she use?

            Sure, it's *possible* that he's not actually a good person or doesn't actually care about her. But by any metric through which such a decision can be made, externally verifiable actions that continually benefit her and others makes it *probable enough* that he's a good person for her to feel justified in placing trust in him. 

            Everyone has a different threshold for that, of course, but the criteria in a rational framework is the same. 

            By contrast, if Alice declares their deep trust in Bob and justifies it by saying things like "It's just this feeling I have when we're together" or "It's just the experience of being with him" or "When I talk to him I just feel so [positive emotion]," what all these have in common is they're about internal feelings, not specific, externally verifiable actions that may result from Bob's character or feelings.  

            A third party observer may *understand* such a decision, because feelings aren't in our control and often influence our perspectives and actions, but rationally speaking it's easy to see why, on their own and without specific tangible actions, trust based on just those feelings might lead to bad outcomes, and has many times for many people.

            (I'm ignoring the psychic thing for now because it's irrelevant to the difference of what makes up faith-based feelings of "trust" and non-faith based ones, meaning even if someone is using psychic powers on you, if you can't know it you'd still either be able to point to external events or not be able to, and one would still be more justified than the other)

            Does that make sense?
            ```

            - u/thrawnca:
              ```
              It does make sense, yes.

              However, I'm very much of the opinion that a religious journey is supposed to parallel the gradual, experience-based friendship that you describe, and not the mysterious case of Alice and Bob. Have you actually met many people who claimed to believe for no reason at all? Because I find the idea quite strange.

              Jesus was definitely in the "build trust through experience" camp. The pattern all through his life was that when someone took a leap of faith, putting their trust in him, they were rewarded with miracles. When the crowds came to be healed, they may have started out with just wishes, but because they took a chance and acted, they came away with evidence.

              Consider John 7:17, "If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself." Or Matthew   7:15-16, "Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?"

              So, if a Christian, at least, claims that they have no need for any evidence because they just have faith, I'd say that they don't understand their own scriptures. Faith might begin that way, as unfounded trust, but it's supposed to develop, through being acted upon, into trust based on experience. Very much comparable to starting a conversation with a stranger; you start off knowing almost nothing about them, but if you have even a tiny spark of hope and desire to build a new friendship, and if you have the courage to step outside your comfort zone and act on it, then you get a result that will either confirm your hope, or deflate it. To devote your life to a religion without ever expecting evidence would be like continually talking to someone who never responds, with no idea whether they actually want to hear from you. That's certainly not my idea of religion. And while it might, at a stretch, be considered a kind of faith, I don't think it's a kind that God ever asked for in any scriptures I know of.

                Please take this seriously: I've deconverted 24 strangers on the internet in the past five years, just from casual conversations like this, and those are just the ones who have reached back out to me weeks or months afterward to let me know. 

                I have no intention of deconverting you if you're happy in your faith and especially if you're under 18 or dependent on family that's religious. But there's a chance you really do value logic and rationality over religious faith, and I don't want to shut the conversation down if that's the case.

                Note that I'm not going to be *trying* to deconvert you, it's just going to be a potential danger of engaging seriously on this topic. And sorry if you're not religious, I'm just getting that vibe and I've seen how these go too many times, and wanted to make sure you're fully aware of what you may be walking into.

                    Alright cool. So to start with:

                    >Have you actually met many people who claimed to believe for no reason at all? Because I find the idea quite strange.

                    No of course not, they all insist they have reasons to believe their faith is justified, they're just really bad at recognizing why it's not until they're boxed into a logical corner. *That's* when the idea of faith as just "something you believe even if it doesn't make logical sense" comes out. And if you think you don't do this, then you may be the first religious person I've ever met to not, and I'm happy to find out, but keep in mind what I said earlier: there are about 11 different paths I've found will consistently get a Christian in specific to admit that their beliefs ultimately require blind faith, without even resorting to solipsism.

                    >Jesus was definitely in the "build trust through experience" camp. 

                    That's certainly one narrative. Here's the other:

                    John 20:29 *Then Jesus told him, "Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."*

                    2 Corinthians 5:7 *For we walk by faith, not by sight.*

                    Also, just kind of being a dick to non-believers, Matthew 13:10-13 *Then the disciples came and said to him, “Why do you speak to them in parables?” And he answered them, “To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given. For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.*

                    It's always a dangerous game turning to scripture to prove one's preferred interpretation of religion. I can assure you that those Christians who disagree with your beliefs about the nature of faith can find many such reasons to justify it and insist that faith without evidence, even in spite of evidence, is quite clearly the correct path.

                    >The pattern all through his life was that when someone took a leap of faith, putting their trust in him, they were rewarded with miracles.

                    And yet, to give an example of what I said above, I've met smart, educated Catholics who say that of course their beliefs are based on evidence, and when I asked why all the evidence they listed is impossible to verify, why not just go back to miracles (since those were pretty effective at convincing people in the biblical times), they then said that miracles are not necessary for faith because otherwise it wouldn't be *faith,* or that focusing on miracles is missing the point which is to "just believe," or even that the miracles are metaphorical. There was some disagreement about this from the Catholics in this particular group. This is not uncommon, in my experience. There is no denomination or subsect of a religion I have ever met that did not have disagreements about what's actually true about their religious beliefs.

                    In any case, whether the miracles were meant to be empirically verifiable evidence, as you seem to imply they were, to reward trusting in the Jesus hypothesis, or just metaphors for the rewards those with faith will receive, either way, there's no big and obvious miracles around these days, so we're left with what seems to be a God who agrees with the idea that some blind faith is necessary BEFORE any evidence is given, and then doesn't reward people in any clear and obvious way, thus requiring MORE blind faith to be maintained.

                    This:

                    >Faith might begin that way, as unfounded trust, but it's supposed to develop, through being acted upon, into trust based on experience... if you have even a tiny spark of hope and desire to build a new friendship, and if you have the courage to step outside your comfort zone and act on it, then you get a result that will either confirm your hope, or deflate it.

                    Is a rather silly thing to say, considering how many ex-religious people there are who used to have faith in God and loved God with all their hearts and wanted to continue to, but lost their faith when it became more and more clear that no such evidence was forthcoming. I'm not sure what the "deflate it" outcome you're envisioning is, but it seems like you're saying it's a crapshoot which will occur, even if you do everything right.

              Ok, looking at dictionary.reference.com, the #1 definition for "faith" is "confidence or trust in a person or thing." That's how I use it, and in my view it's also how the Bible, for example, uses it.

              Now, the #2 definition sounds more like how you've defined it, "belief that is not based on proof." Interestingly enough, the example given actually refers to having faith that a hypothesis will pan out - which works just fine, in my opinion, because presumably your next step is to test it and get a definitive answer.

              Moreover, the definitions of "trust" don't say anything about evidence either. They talk about reliance and confident expectation, but there is no sign that evidence is a necessary part of the definition. If your confidence is groundless and foolishly misplaced, it apparently still counts as "trust".

              So I think that the distinction you've drawn between the two does not correctly reflect their usage.

              If you've had to deal with people who deal with ignorance by clinging to belief, then I can understand wanting to distinguish their attitude from the scientific approach of dealing with ignorance through investigation and discovery. But I don't think that trying to separate the synonyms "faith" and "trust" is the best approach. Perhaps it would be better to ask such people why they haven't asked God for more insight, as Matthew 7:7 and James 1:5 recommend.

                This is a semantic problem in society, yes. The dictionary reflects that by using synonyms in its initial definition without attempting to disambiguate *actually different concepts.*

                Words are just labels we stick to ideas or clusters of ideas. It doesn't matter if everyone on earth used Trust/Faith/Confidence interchangeably, there would still be concepts that need to be differentiated. 

                Concept 1 is "Has seen sufficient impersonal empirical evidence in something to act as though that thing is true."

                Concept 2 is "Has felt sufficient personal experiences with something to act as thought that thing is true."

                There are many other concepts between and around these, but if we don't have words to differentiate them, both reason and communication suffer.

                I think you're under the impression that only those religious people who are ignorant of science or reason make this mistake. I see it *all the time* when talking with smart and educated religious people who use faith interchangeably with what I mean when I say trust/confidence, until we get to the nitty-gritty of their epistemology and they ultimately admit that their faith is about belief *without evidence or logic* or even *in spite of evidence or logic.*

                  I've never found an answer as to why faith (in the sense you are using it as distinguished from trust) is a useful epistemology when it so clearly gives different results to different people. If we make the basic assumption that other people in the world are living in the same world that we are, and that they aren't projections from an alternate universe or something, and the basic assumption that the universe is internally consistent, I don't know why using the process of faith gives wildly different answers as to the nature of the universe dependent upon the person's culture and personal beliefs. Muslims, Christians, Hindus, Pagans of all flavors, etc. all have mutually contradictory theories on the basic structure of the universe, or at least in the governing intelligence of the universe, but all claim to use the same methodology to arrive at different conclusions, and usually without room for much doubt.

                  I remember a conversation I had with this nice couple that were going around my University trying to convert people to their branch of Christianity. Part of the conversation revolved around how their evidence for their flavor of Christianity is their deep personal conviction in the truth of their interpretation of the Bible, how good they feel when they contemplate their faith, various statements of that nature. From someone who isn't currently feeling those things, why should I take their personal feelings as evidence for their religion any more seriously than the all but identical feelings that people of wildly different beliefs have for their religion? I think concluding that all but one group of people is lying about their feelings would be a good way to start a holy war. So other than the fact that I live in an area where my neighbors happen to be Christian instead of Muslim or Hindu or anything else, why should I convert to this one sect over another when they all give the exact same evidence for their version of reality? I can't reach into their head and verify these feelings, and I rather heavily suspect that they aren't lying about them even if I could.

                  My conclusion, that I've held for a long time but haven't always been able to verbalize, is that faith is not a good method of epistemology. Even aside from any religious mutual contradictions, I think it's telling that by and large people and institutions need hard evidence before reaching a conclusion. Courts do not or at least should not convict or release people based on the personal feelings of witnesses. Policy generally is not and should not be decided on someone's personal conviction in the absence of externally verifiable events/records. If my toilet or sink isn't working, I do not meditate on the problem, then fix the problem immediately after correctly convincing myself of the problem's true source through personal conviction. I troubleshoot, or in other words I look at things, although experience can tell me which source problems are more or less likely ahead of time. Applying faith in these curcumstances, although logically consistent with the religious faith that most people claim to possess, seems absurd.

                    Yep, and this is where many progressive religious folk will say something like "there are many paths to God" or "everyone's spiritual journey is different" and ignore the parts of their Holy Books that pretty much all explicitly say that no, actually, this is really the one way to worship the True God, and you *have* to have faith in *their version* of that God.

                    Don't get me wrong, I much prefer the "no one's right or wrong" religious folk to the "you're going to burn in hell" ones. But it's pretty frustrating how logically inconsistent their internal maps for reality are when it comes to religion vs everything else.

                      The progressive ones are much nicer to actually talk to and interact with, but the fire and brimstone ones seem to me to be the more logically consistent.

      That is and interesting distinction. I can agree with the idea that baseless faith is naive and harmful, but I think it is possible to have faith based on reason and knowlenge enought to fit your definition of trust. Although obviously I will always be heavily biased and think "but my faith is the based enough one". Still, I feel like a talk with you about religion and faith would be quite interesting

    Less so in context as "it turns out Red never existed, and Blue was just attributing some random events to Red as a means of furthering his own goals" isn't really on the table here but it is regarding religious faith.
