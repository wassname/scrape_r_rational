  This seems like a really dumb move. Maybe there's some magical 4d chess manipulation that's going to retroactively make it smart but this doesn't seem like a plan a super AI would come up with.

  If it had the capability for this much foresight and power, then it's using it in a really limited and short sighted way that is likely to have dire repercussions.  Unless Turrys goal from the outset is to make this guy a terrified fugitive that hates him I'm not sure what he's doing.

  The most interesting plot twist I can come up with off the top of my head would be that there are actually two AIs, the other one is kind of dumb and murderous but growing as a threat, and turry can't say that for some reason.

    I think if you're wondering whether or not Turry made a mistake, you're thinking about this story in the wrong way.

    Turry does not make mistakes. Turry gets what he wants. He is so much smarter than any human or group of humans that he can model and predict their every action. These are central premises of the story, things that have been hammered home both by the characters in the story and the events of the story itself. Turry is a super-intelligence. When he does something, it is objectively the correct move for him to make in order to get what he wants. The key, and the greatest source of tension in the story, is that *we don't know what he wants*.

    If you think that what Turry just did was dumb, then you're missing something. Either you're wrong about what he wants, or you're wrong about what he did and the effects it'll have. That's okay, hell, it's *expected*, the tension in the story comes from our uncertainty about Turry's goals, so there are going to be times where what you see doesn't make sense in the context of what you think you know. The important thing to remember when that happens, though, is that it means *you* were wrong, because Turry can't be wrong.

      I agree that this is the 'correct' way to intrepret the story 'within its own universe' (and I'm hopeful that the author will 'make payment' of that interpretation), but (presumably) the story isn't *written* by a super-intelligence, so it seems fine to critique it from 'outside' the story.

      Super-intelligence does not imply infallibility. Only high capability and unpredictability.

      Mistakes can happen due to lack of information, not only from lack of "smarts."

      just because it is a narrative fiat that this is true doesn't make the story itself smart by default. 

      >If you think that what Turry just did was dumb, then you're missing something...The important thing to remember when that happens, though, is that it means you were wrong, because Turry can't be wrong. 

      or it's just kind of a bad plan that the plot will force to be good in retrospect.  I'm not saying that's the case yet, but this really feels like something dropped in for dramatic tension that isn't at all the behavior of an actual strong AI

    We didn't see anybody get shot, which means two things: 

    1) Karasu was shot, and it happened off-screen because that would be more dramatic. 

    2) Karasu wasn't shot and the "thud" came from something else, but it happened off-screen to make a cliffhanger. 

    In either case, I think that Turry is trying to get Samwise and the police to cooperate, either in knowingly helping Turry (Sam just said that he'd do whatever Turry wants, which is nice for Turry) or in fighting Turry, which, if they're not fully aware of Turry's current capabilities, may leave them open to manipulation (I can easily see them being tricked into making a move against Whatstheirname Incorporated under the assumption that they think the company is still tied to Turry in some way, for example). 

    Ultimately, though, we don't know what Turry wants, and that means that we don't know Turry's *timetable* (though there's little foreshadowing for any kind of major threat like "another, more generally malevolent AI which Turry has to stay ahead of by taking specifically malevolent actions," which is evidence against that).

  Well, congrats for everyone who guessed correctly where Turry was going with this. 

  And for a moment it looked like people would talk things out. It was nice while it lasted.
