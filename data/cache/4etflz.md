  Ultimately, the size of the town or city and the state of government has a huge effect. Were I in such a situation, I would be careful of begging as a negative stigma is quickly attached to beggars in a smaller town. 

  The first priority, therefore, is gathering information on where to find work. The typical fantasy story usually let's the main character instantly join an adventuring guild, but let's assume they won't let someone with zero background in. Your best bet is to find a job for the government or a business that hires laborers, like construction. If you can read the world's language you should be able to quickly find clerical work. 

  Although you'll want to appear as a foreigner, certain gaps on your knowledge will become apparent quickly. It's best to find a public library or source of information early, but that priority isn't as immediate as survival. 

  In the best case, you could meet a government official and convince them you had secrets from another land. After some demonstrations of basic mathematics and engineering, you might be able to find work there. Or get executed, so it's best to find information before taking such rash action. 

  If worse comes to worse, you can always beg or steal for your survival, though you will most likely run amuck of the law. 

  Tldr : information comes right after survival

    It should probably be a red flag if they *do* let just anybody in. The first thing that comes to mind is a certain type of private military contractor, that doesn't care what credentials you don't have, because they'll just send people into the gauntlet and see who comes back out.

    Mid sized city (not a capital, not a small town) and relatively stable government.

    Any ideas on how to do that? My bias would be to wander around trying to find a mercantile district, then say something to the effect of "I'm new in town and terribly lost, could you possibly point me to someone who could employ me as a scribe or accountant?" But I'd wonder if there would be a better option.

    I'm getting flashbacks to konosuba. The MC *does* join the adventuring guild immediately... but they spend a few months doing construction work anyways.

  How rare is writing literacy?  Arithmetic?  Can you get work as a scribe or accountant?
  ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    About as rare as they were in <time period>. It probably varies pretty heavily, honestly, as it did in europe, but it would be a safe bet to assume it's not widespread.

    So, yes, you could be a scribe or accountant.

  Since I assume I'm going to die for lack of meds*, I look for some kind of church or house of worship and hope they can make me comfortable for a while.

  If I'm miraculously cured, for the sake of narrative interest, then I'll look for a university or equivalent and see what contributions I can make.

  ^(* That's something else that doesn't happen much in fantasy novels.)

  - u/GaBeRockKing:

    narrative fiat, you no longer need your meds. (I'm trying to make this more realistic, but there's still an upper bound to how realistic a story can be when you're dumped into a fantasy world.)

      OK, I have a Nexus 4, pen, keys (now just lumps of metal, except for a rather low intensity keychain flashlight), wallet and checkbook containing mostly worthless bits of paper and plastic ... the pictures of my kids are probably the most valuable things in it, some cash (probably worthless), battery pack that's good for maybe six full charges of my phone, Square credit card reader (now worthless), and a Kindle Paperwhite that happens to have the complete "Foreigner" series by C. J. Cherryh loaded on it. 

      I normally carry a messenger bag but you said "pockets". If I have my bag I have a tablet and either a netbook or a macbook pro depending on which I happened to be carrying that day, plus more pens and a notepad.

      Oh and a hat, it's a very nice hat.

      First thing, turn off the phone and kindle. Then go look for a university or equivalent.
      ```

      - u/GaBeRockKing:

        Yeah, it's just pockets. Bags have too much variability, and we don't usually wear them anyways.

        >Then go look for a university or equivalent.

        I don't think those were particularly common, no? Of course it would depend on the time period, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it.
        ```

          If it's closer to 1100, they're called "monasteries". If it's closer to 1500, there might not be an actual university in this town but people will know what I'm talking about.

          There are almost 40 universities in Europe founded between 1100 and 1500 that are still in operation today.

  If my magi-translator has given me reading/writing as well as speech I'll probably go get myself a job as a scribe.

  I'll also turn my phone off and make sure to boil all my drinking water and cook my own food.

  There is a none-zero chance I might also accidentally kill the entire population by breathing on them. so I'll try to avoid getting my own germs on anyone.

    They're literally speaking modern english, so you'll be fine.

    >There is a none-zero chance I might also accidentally kill the entire population by breathing on them. so I'll try to avoid getting my own germs on anyone.

    Lol, yeah, I forgot about all our modern resistances. I'd just hope readers would forget about it too.

      Yah, I have a pretty applicable skill set for a lot of stuff related to this kind of thing these days.

      I know how to cook, I can draw decently (I'm no renaissance master but I could do stuff with a 'shocking degree of realism') I am confident that with effort I could eventually build a hand crank generator, a capacitor and a battery. So I can actually RECHARGE my phone. Although that holds a risk of burning the thing out as I'm not sure how to get the right balance of volts/amps.

      I know how to build the first versions of movable type and printing presses in theory.

      I like mechanical puzzles enough that I could probably make for a poor man's leonardo da-vinci or hero of alexandria.

      The middle ages is sadly a little bit EARLIER then my prime boot strap point.

      But I still am confident I could probably be a pretty successful wizard.

      Also I like teaching.

  This inspires me to design an app that lets you specify a tech & resource level and plots a bootstrap path. That plus a good selection of e-textbooks and a solar charger would leave you pretty well set to be excessively wizardly.

  Definitely.  What if the player comes into contact with people that antagonize them? Will there be a proverbial good samaritan, or will you have to eek out a living?

    Do you normally come into contact with people that antagonize you? If so, what typically happens?

    >Will there be a proverbial good samaritan, or will you have to eek out a living?

    Not as such. You'll find nice people and mean people, but you wouldn't just come across someone immediately willing to take care of you. imagine the reverse scenario-- someone's claiming they're from a different world with better technology/magic. Maybe you believe them, maybe you don't, but at best you're probably still going to try and alert the authorities.

      Why on earth would I do a damnfool thing like that for? What's in it for me? No, I'd offer to hide them and then figure out how to use them to get rich.

      Sure,  but the premise of the second part of my post was predicated on the first  part- having people do others harm in  alleyways is not uncommon at all, especially in older times when it was one man's word against another's. 

      As a foreigner you would most certainly  draw attention, at the very least the attention of people curious  about your looks/clothing. If you weren't careful and depending on the time of day or part of the city the type of inhabitants you'd meet may not be innocently curious, especially  if you were a female. 

      If you were in a poorer part of town your clothing could be misconstrued as that of a foreign noble and you could end up getting mugged. Modern clothes and people are generally more clean and well shaven than most people ever were in the past, which is even more likely if we were clean shaven clean clothes pale skin and being able to read/do arithmetic on paper.  

      The first thing i would do after finding food and a water source would be to find a way to fit in with the middle/upper class because there is no way i would want to stand out.
