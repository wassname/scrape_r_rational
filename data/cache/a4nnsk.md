  I'm sorry, this is crazy and I love it, but I don't see in what conceivable universe it qualifies as rational.

      I mean, yeah but also the players are 4chan randos with little temporal consistency.

      I'm not saying it's not cool. 

      edit: Also I admit the Sparta riff has me in stitches rn. "This ... is the mother of all medical malpractice lawsuits."

        Hi, Left Beyond QM here, just wanted to say that I love your Space Engineers mods! Hope you liked the quest. Should I run it again?

          This is the oddest meeting!

          Sorry I haven't been very active on the trains mod, I basically don't play the game at all anymore because the rift between what it should be and what it is is really wide, and also every time I try my vehicles crash, spaz out and explode.

          (Proper orbits when. :-( )

          That said the quest was fun but it kind of ended in a weird place where it didn't seem like any of the plans worked out, there wasn't any planning coherence besides, the random lobster person the players made on a lark did significantly more damage than the strike team, and the players won by either fiat or luck using a method that really shouldn't have worked. It was weird.

          If you do decide to run it again, could I recommend that you use a forum with an active quests section, like [SB](http://forum.spacebattles.com/), [SV](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/) or [QQ](https://forum.questionablequesting.com)? That should lead to more coherence over time, hopefully.

            Thanks!

            The "fork bomb" thing was always a possibility, I dropped a few hints along the way (how Heaven and Hell worked, the temperature sensors going haywire and continuing to go haywire unless they were on their own subnet, the Hell-experience desktops), but I wasn't expecting people to figure it out at the very end, especially since the prevailing wisdom was doing a terrible job of self-hacking that would have resulted in the Omega freezing up and needing to be rebooted. The ending is ambiguous because the stratagem didn't QUITE work: the Alpha Centauri colonists will eventually die and face the judgement... although by then the mass dieoffs, which thanks to the Omega clones happen in twice as much time as the previous one, will be far enough spaced aparts that a new generation will, hopefully, have been born. The only problem is that everyone would need a metabolic controller from birth. I'd like to redo the last thread, in all honesty, since nobody was very awake for it, least of all me.

            I left the players a choice to help either Ihuriel and the strike team, or Kat, and they went with Kat (Whichever they decided to help with the Omega's remaining processing power would survive; the other would die, either by burning up on reentry or by being crushed under rock).

            Thanks for the recommendation! I'll check them out. SV looks like it would be a great place for a sequel, since it'll be space based. SpaceBattles is a bit problematic because of The Salvation War, I liked the story (bit too curb stompy for me though) but I understand there was a bunch of forum drama at the time?

            I agree with you on planning coherence, I'm blaming spidertank guy.  Although the spidertank caper would be a funny short story, if told from the MFer perspective.

            BTW do you play KSP? KSP with Principia gives you really good orbital mechanics and, since the graphics are more basic, should run on anything that can run SE.

            Speaking of forks, I went ahead and put up a simplified variant of the train mod, that can be used for funiculars. It links back to your original mod and gives you credit; let me know if you want the credits altered or the variant mod removed.
            ```

              Removed? Good god no. I put that thing on Github for a reason. Link?

              Yeah what I want is the crafting/belt mechanics of Factorio, orbital/rocket mechanics of KSP, and building mechanics/graphics of SE. All of that is possible! Somebody just has to do it, basically.

              > I liked the story (bit too curb stompy for me though) but I understand there was a bunch of forum drama at the time?

              Yeah I don't even remember that, but it seems like the sort of thing that you might want to poke the mods about first. I don't think there'll be an issue though. Though one of the most steady authors on SV recently moved their story to QQ over mod drama about the pronouns of an in-story character, so don't discount the pornboard - it does have an active non-NSFW section and seems generally more liberal, in the laissez-faire sense.

      I've got a reminder to come back to this one when I have screen, vice speaker, time and a lower priority "let's do this" to code a 4chan prettifier to make text to speech so I can consume this in my favored format (text to speech)  but it's not worth the effort at present.

      &#x200B;

      That said I probably listened through half to a third of the first post this morning and, yeah I think I get the idea and this has a nice mix of "The salvation war's" ethos  or own communities favored munchkinry, and that special flavor of rebellion 4chan brings.

    So is this a quest, an RPG, or a second person viewpoint story?

    Also, what order should this be read in? Are those multiple stories with similar premises or continuations of a single long story?

        I tried to read it a bit but the 4chan style and the fact that everyone involved is called "anonymous" and can't be told apart really annoyed me. It also seemed to have some dense, system-heavy elements that I didn't want to read through.

          I've been trying to serialize the whole thing as a story, the first 14 turns are on fanfiction dot net and also linked in the tvtropes page for Left Beyond.
          ```

  - u/spiritplumber:
    ```
    The bulk of the story is in the threads themselves, I used the wiki to make a sort of worldbuilding document. A settings bible if you will :P

  Hi, I'm the QM. Ask away if you got questions!

  And be sure to not miss the side fics, they're on the Left Beyond tvtropes page (by me and others).

      I left it intentionally ambiguous for as long as possible; as it is, within the LBQ timeline, if it had come up significantly, heaven and hell are basically individualized time loops in which the soul/mind is stuck in extreme bliss or extreme pain. The time loop is long just enough to cause the experiencer to go insane, and will thus vary. Hell armor was intended to make someone last indefinitely, best-case-scenario - this would force the entity running the afterlife to expend more processing cycles than are gained by absorbing that soul.

      Glad you like my stuff! Feel free to reuse any of it since it's all under a creative commons license.

        Read through the entire thing from top to bottom. Whew. Really liked the first half, pre hiatus. Overall great quest and you did a fine job as a QM, ending was kinda unexpected but still played out nicely.

        I must say it was rather frustrating to watch the hellmouth-spidertank r&d anon constantly trying to derail the quest with his crazy schemes of demon summoning, bubble shields, powered armor and declaring war... and also repeatedly trying to bargain with every other player to follow his half baked plans. You have incredible patience putting up with all of that. 

        Bonus question if you're up for it: why was tsion surrendering and what was his plan?

        - u/spiritplumber:
          ```
          Thank you! How do you think I should've done differently in the second half?

          The ending was unexpected to me too (That 1 on a 1d1000 was hilarious). The person who inspired the character of Kat showed up for the last couple of threads.

          Spidertankanon was.... well, pretty funny in that it fit pretty well with the source material. I thought about posting a fic about just that episode on a Christian board to see what they said. Patience is sometimes necessary :)

          Tsion was surrendering because he was going to try a Doctor Who gambit, essentially: appear to give up and subvert his captors from the inside. In the source material, he has the ability to convert just about anyone and, in fairness, the Doctor goes against hordes of drones/zombies/etc a lot, and well, it fit.

            There was a lot of arguing which slowed down progress, I don't think there's too much else you could have done regarding that (Well I think he finally got the hint when you told him to take over the quest).

            On a meta level, pausing the quest for a few months meant that many of the original players (like Sarasti) left, and the new anons who joined didn't have a full picture of what was going on.
            ```

            - u/spiritplumber:
              ```
              Yeah, that's fair. The pause was due to, well, life stuff that couldn't be postponed :)

              I'd have liked to play in this scenario, and I designed it to be a repeatable game, so i was actually hoping he'd do a parallel quest!

  Does the QM have any other quests?

    Some internet stocking led me to to this [thread](https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/thread/58219793/) looks like QM is discouraged from writing any more.

    - u/spiritplumber:
      ```
      Part of it is that I got the aerospace job I wanted. Kinda discouraged from being on 4chan at all but hey, I get to do astrobiology stuff IRL now. I'm hoping that with the splitting off of SFW boards they'll chill out about it a bit.
