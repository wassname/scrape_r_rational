  How much canon knowledge is required for this story?

    Zero! It's a pretty obscure series and most of my beta readers haven't read canon. You should start with book one of the series, though - the link for the overall series is here: https://archiveofourown.org/series/936480

      Thanks. Was this the final part of the series, or it’s just this 3rd volume that’s been completed?
      ```

        Just the third volume. It, um, keeps going for quite a while - I've written up to volume 6 and there is more to come.
        ```
