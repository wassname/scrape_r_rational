## As writers, we face a problem: We’re not the reader. This may sound obvious, but it has important ramifications.

  I think there's something to be said for ditching a large portion of your audience right off the bat because they aren't like you.

  > Our reader is, in many ways, unknowable, because we have no idea of who will end up picking up our work. We do know some things, though: Their background probably won’t match ours. Their tastes will be different. Their age group and education will be different to an unknown degree. And, there’s a 50-50 chance that their gender will be different, too. In fact, it’s unlikely that we and a given reader have all that much in common.

  This isn't true. If I write a story and post it to somewhere like /r/rational, then I know a great deal about my average reader; I know that the average age will tend to be a bit younger, that they'll tend to be a bit better educated, and that they've been exposed to certain concepts before. I can generally assume that they're not religious. They'll be male *far* more than 50% of the time. (Assumptions like this generalize to all publishing, which is intrinsically tied to marketing and word-of-mouth.)

  So why would I want to write for the ideally anonymous reader, especially when this is almost certainly going to make things worse for the people who already have the appropriate background? If I want to write a book that's steeped in videogame tropes, I'm going to make the book *worse* for people who don't share that cultural knowledge. I mean, I'm not going to go out of my way to alienate readers, but if I'm writing what amounts to a commentary on effective altruism, then I don't think that I'm well-served by explaining effective altruism first, because the commentary is going to be largely lost on someone who has only been introduced to the concept a few pages back. (I feel like this idea is really central to fanfic, where writers are often offering their own variation/commentary on canon.)

  We already know that there exists a set of "people who will read the book", and we know that there are differences between that set and the set of "people who will not read the book", so why constrain ourselves to imagining that those sets are both evenly distributed throughout the population?

  The larger point of the article is just "show, don't tell", which is fairly old (and good) advice.

  Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

  In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

  Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

  “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

  The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

  Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

  Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

  L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

  I found the associated link to "writing the perfect scene" alternating between 'Scene' and 'Sequel' with 'Motivation-Reaction units' to be quite compelling and illustrative.
  Scenes are story structures comprised of Goal-Conflict-Disaster.
  Sequels are story structures comprised of Reaction-Dilemma-Decision.
  The author suggests that writers alternate between these structures link two different links in a chain, scene, sequel, scene, sequel, etc.

  For example, Wildbow uses this technique very nicely in Worm.

  Take Taylor's first fight, for example. (I'm going to strip it of its context so it remains recognizable but overall, spoiler-free.)

  1.3 Gestation is the Scene.
  Her Goal is to become a Cape by fighting some baddies so she ventures out into the Docks.
  The Conflict is the ABB gang -- she stumbles into a meeting between the kooks and their boss.
  The Disaster is that she overhears someone snarl “…the children, just shoot.  Doesn’t matter your aim, just shoot.  You see one lying on the ground?  Shoot the little bitch twice more to be sure.  We give them no chances to be clever or lucky, understand?”

  Gestation 1.4 is the Sequel.
  The reaction is that Taylor thinks the gang is going to murder children.
  Her dilemma -- "do I call for help, retreat or attack?"
  Her decision is prompted by the advancement of the gang.
  And she becomes Skitter.

  The motivation-reaction units is basically alternating between external-objective-description and internal-subjective-reaction... with each sentence or paragraph. This draws the reader directly into the mind of the player character. This dynamic seems to mirror the role playing game structure of a Dungeon Master/Storyteller describing what happens and the PC reacting (not reacting only with actions, but emotions and instincts as well.)

  I was going to use Skitter's fight with Lung as an example, but it became too laden with early spoilers. Just read the article, it's given me a lot to think about, structure-wise!
