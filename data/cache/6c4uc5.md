  Hrm. The 'only talk when explicitly allowed, despite the fact that you both know this place better and have friends other than me here' makes me feel uncomfortable. Especially since it happened by mistake *and* Blue-Eyes didn't ask how he can reverse it (or even just temporarily turn it off) despite that. Seems both irresponsible and sad. It seems to limit Lyra in her being. And it distracted me from fully enjoying any other sexy stuff mentioned quite as much.

  I guess it's just not my kink?

  This story is just a self-insert wish-fulfillment fantasy with no plot. Why is it being posted here? It's neither rational nor rationalist.

    I'm curious; what evidence do you have for the SI comment?

    Which no plot? The non-plot where they escape from Earth being chased by literal markov chain demons? Or the non plot where the characters learn about demon magic? Or the not plot where they travel to another world? Or the total lack of hints of a great war against Seraphim?

    What lack of rationality, we are literally treated to a blow by blow(heh innuendo) of how, why, what, and motivations behind things, with hints of more in the future. So the plot is sex driven, its literally a rational story about SEX demons, that doesn't mean its not a plot, or are rationalist now also puritans?

      You seem very confused about what the plot of a story is actually supposed to be. It's not often that I link to wikipedia articles in a discussion, but I think you would really benefit from reading [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_%28narrative%29).

      >Which no plot? The non-plot where they escape from Earth being chased by literal markov chain demons? 

      >Or the total lack of hints of a great war against Seraphim?

      These two things happened in probably the only interesting sequence of events in this story, but until they're actually relevant for anything else, that's all they're going to be. We are at book 3 now, so maybe something plot-related will appear soon.

      >Or the non plot where the characters learn about demon magic? 

      Not a plot.

      >Or the not plot where they travel to another world?

      Not a plot.

      >What lack of rationality, we are literally treated to a blow by blow(heh innuendo) of how, why, what, and motivations behind things, with hints of more in the future.

      Just because things are "explained" does not mean it's a rational story (or even just a story). This is world-building at best.

      >o the plot is sex driven, its literally a rational story about SEX demons, that doesn't mean its not a plot, or are rationalist now also puritans?

      Writing a lot of sex scenes is not a plot. Saying that does not make me a puritan.

        The thing is, there is a coherent plot of sorts. I agree, it's moving *very* slowly but that's all; it's moving slowly. He's not telling a series of unrelated anecdotes; we're literally going on the journey from Earth to Sade Hall and everywhere in between. It's pretty wordy and very full of exposition (which is a good or bad thing, depending on your tastes) but there's a definitive sequence of events occurring. 

        BE's going on a journey to become the human partner to a magical demon girl. That's the plot.
