  Does the version of Eberron you're using have spell schemas or ring gates? If I remember correctly, you could cause pretty much any kind of extinction event you like with those. Any evocation spell cast once every six seconds for a few weeks should do it, and ring gates are pretty obviously capable of blowing up an entire planet.

  This is, of course, provided that it's the *world* you care about and not the people.
