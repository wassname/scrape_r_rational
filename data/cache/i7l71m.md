  Robber chapter oh yes I have missed that dynamic so much and it never disappoints. Also, Night-Goblins? Considering how Cat uses Night in conjunction with munitions, that is all kinds of terrifying.

    Komena needs to stop being such a buzz kill and get behind this. Imagine how horrifying it could be.

  True friendship is leaving minorly deadly pranks. This story focused a lot on the aging of beloved characters though, between Robber and Hakram. Catherine seems immortal, and the Dead King didn't mince words when he said that she'll live long enough to see everyone she cares about gone.

  I honestly think that Catherine is right about Hakram though. There's no way he can ever fight Named again, and he's far more useful paper pushing than manning the battlements with eighty other Named. Catherine is changing her role further from the battlefield to commander and politician, and if Hakram wants to be useful he should follow her.

  The Scribe is bound to be interesting. Cut off from Black she's a completely free agent, and that spells big trouble. Perhaps she'll want to support Black from the shadows, perhaps she's found a new cause. I hope she has some news on Assassin as well, his abscence has been a mild worry of mine for months now.
