  So I get the sense that the Parahumans setting is sort of controversial around here with respect to if it's rational or not, but the current arc really has me wanting to see /r/rational 's analysis.

  I had to give up on twig very late in the story because it dragged on really badly for my personal taste. Then immediately started ward, but couldn't get past the bizarre intro chapters. Given that I loved worm and pact and 9/10 of twig, should I try ward again? Should I just skip the glowworm chapters with all of the code name internet forum stuff, or is that part relevant to the story? It was really tedious to try to read, only guessing at who the names could be,  especially since they were likely to be all new characters.

    Glow-worm becomes relevant eventually, but by the time it did I had mostly forgotten what was in it and had to go back and re-read anyway, so you're probably fine to skip it for now. Lots of hints about the backgrounds of new characters you haven't met yet.

    Like you, I gave up on Twig somewhere around 3/4ths of the way through. As others have said, you can skip the Glow chapters. But I'm bored, so let me bombard you with an unrequested review:

    Ward is basically Twig re-written into Worm's universe without Sy & Co.'s explicit time constraints or some their other quirks. It has a heavy focus on psychology and teammates needing to know if other teammates are "all right". I don't find intra-team politics entertaining. But Wildbow just jumps right in to that stuff, when, honestly, I would barely care if he just started killing them off. It's too early in the series to expect readers to be invested in that sort of thing.

    And, I've been thinking this for a long while, but after reading Worm, Pact, most of Twig, and Ward, it has become obvious that Wildbow's 1st person fight scenes are very hit or miss when his character isn't effectively omniscient. I understand this this can be a tool to demonstrate the character's own limitations and scope of action, but in practice these scenes have not been well-written or fluid enough for me to appreciate them.

    That said, Ward is a fulfilling addition to the Worm-verse. Wildbow still hits his interludes out of the fucking park, which is amazing. If he wrote the entire series like interludes 3.x or 8.y... Well, one can dream.

    The biggest problem with Ward--at least well through the Fallen assault arc--is that it gives you **glimpses** of all sorts of very interesting things occurring in the universe, then shoves that into the background to focus on a very small story where the characters do their best never to get involved in such things, and instead spend a vast majority of their time resolving personal issues or undergoing therapy sessions.

    We see some of the old characters like Weld and Tattletale, who are up to great things but only briefly cameo directly.  We have new 'cluster' variations of the Passengers that have made the powers go from simple, focused abilities to weird combinations that interact differently with others.  We have the inter-world portal system get messed up in a big way.  We have worlds that are like an expansionist Wild West where anything goes.  We have worlds themselves potentially going to war with each other (including one that despite its apparent low number of Metas seems quite well motivated).  We have a kind of machine race that disguises itself well and spreads like a virus.  We have the remains of Nibolg's old Goblin creations struggling to survive.  We have some new side characters that are more interesting than many of the main characters (I would happily read a "Buddy Cop" series based around Ratcatcher and Crystalclear, for instance).  We have the views of common people shifting to where being a hero or villain isn't as important to them as who can make their lives better.  We have heroes going more 'corporate' and having to sell their brand rather than just being controlled by one generic government agency, and the inevitable corporate competition that follows.

    We have ALL these cool references, and almost none of them are considered for more than a few updates before we go back to Team Therapy doing their thing separate from all of it.

    It gets better, but it takes **awhile**, and I can easily see some people not wanting to go through that effort.

    Have you read Pact yet?

      Yeah, I blasted through Pact. The pacing was the best of his stories in my opinion. Seems like I'm going to hold off on Ward until it's finished. Then I can  power through the stuff that I find boring or tedious. 

      The reason I had to quit twig was because I was reading it one update at a time. Towards the end the pacing got really bad and each update was disappointing, and I could power through because I was reading  it as it was getting released.
      ```

        Damn, Pact was hella difficult for me in terms of pacing. Just ramping up the ante, no breaks.
        ```

        - u/Rorschach_And_Prozac:
          ```
          Which can be bad, I agree, but definitely makes sense for a story about deals with demons. I like the constantly ramping pace because it fits the story.
          ```

      Wildbow's work at its best scratches the same itch for me as qntm's Antimemetics Division stories. We get fantastic narration of what it feels like from the inside to try to act rationally on the knowledge that your perceptions, thoughts or desires are actively being subverted by a hostile agent, and it's all very relatable because although there are no master/stranger/thinker powers, reality-eating demons or antimemetic SCPs in the real world, we all have to wrestle with the fact that the human mind doesn't actually need any such subversion â€” it's already catastrophically compromised at baseline.

      So I have really appreciated Ward's tendency to stay very character-driven without sprawling out too much and getting overly distracted by the very rich worldbuilding going on in the background.
      ```

      - u/RynnisOne:
        ```
        Getting distracted by?  Yes, what a terrible thing to employ that awesome worldbuilding for more than background information.  It would be terrible if the story retained character development while **also** doing interesting things in a rich, detailed world.

        There are plenty of stories with unreliable narrators.  And rational fiction is chock full of ones that involve some level of mind control and a protagonist who has to either realize this and find a way to resist it, or who undergoes it and learns how after their thinking was altered.  So that's not quite as impressive to me, although its interesting in short bursts.

    Glow-Worm was basically a teaser for the fans to get hype rolling, it can probably be skipped
    ```

    It's very subjective. A lot of people love Worm and hate Pact and Twig, or hate Pact and love Twig, etc. I think a lot of external factor in too (like "how busy was your life when you read it?" or "did you read it all in one go, or as it was coming out").

    That said, a few pieces of advice:

    * If you read glow-worm (which really isn't necessary), don't worry too much about pinpointing each character. Just get a feel for the broadstrokes, what kind of dynamics the characters are likely to have, what kind of personalities they seem to have, etc.

    * Avoid reading too much at a time. Wildbow recommends reading one arc at a time, but pick your own pace. The story takes some time digesting.

    * Read some of the comments and the relevant r/parahumans threads after every few chapter, especially if you're confused. A lot of the action and the themes are a lot easier to follow with the reddit hive-mind helping you discern what were the major beats of the story, or pointing out subtle moments you might have missed (eg: "Character X rubbed their wrist when Character Y mentioned Master-Stranger protocols! It means X is the traitor!").
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Wildbow posted summaries of the characters from Glow-Worm.  
    I think half the fun in these chapters was trying to figure out who or what each person was supposed to be.  
    There is quite a bit of stuff in there, you should at least read everything by the account named "Point\_me\_@_the_Sky", as they are our POV character.
