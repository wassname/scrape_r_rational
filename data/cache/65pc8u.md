  New prediction: Anton Hellas is actually a robot controlled by Kamay Alcosebaâ€™s daemon.

  Well

  This changes everything 


  So if I get this right: the supposedly evil malicious AI is actually frightened of the aliens and wants to save humanity (nevermind the orchestrations of mass deaths for furthering some unknown plan) 

  I really like this development

    We don't know that for sure yet.  It's also possible that the AI wants to exterminate humanity, and thinks the chaos of aliens arriving gives it an opportunity to succeed.  Time will tell I suppose.
