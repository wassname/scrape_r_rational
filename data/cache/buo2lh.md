    This is a very good theory.

    Also, I think the leader of the military group is supposed to be The Comedian from Watchmen based on army guy + smiley face pin, but is he giving anyone else serious Randall Flagg vibes?

  Haha, as soon as that girl was given a bow and arrow of aim assist+1 I knew that it was only going to come up as grazing wounds. Way to unintentionally munchkin the rules there Hailey!
  I'm pretty sure cowboy hat guy is gonna be the real focus for the story, although having a cosmic horror Aslan instead would be sweet.
