## [BST] CYOA on Ems?

### Post:

It occurs to me that CYOAs ( https://www.reddit.com/r/makeyourchoice/top/?sort=top&t=all ) are, effectively, a genre unto themselves. It also occurs to me that the setting I worked out for LoadBear, at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nRSRWbAqtC48rPv5NG6kzggL3HXSJ1O93jFn3fgu0Rs/edit , could form the basis of one. Eg:

Choose Your Origin:

* Old cryonicist: Frozen before humans could be reliably brain-scanned. Latest death-date: 2035. Starting budget: Your trust fund (if any) is tied up in legal knots; you have $10k in donations from a cryonics mutual-assistance group.
* Research subject. Earliest death-date: 2030. Due to glitches and experimental procedures that didn't quite work, -1d6*5% to starting humanity.
* Medical upload: You were going to die anyway, so why not?
* Enthusiastic Volunteer: You had your whole life ahead of you, but decided going digital was even better. Earliest death-date: 2035. Starting budget: Your life's savings, $20k.
* "Volunteer": Pressures were applied by those more powerful than you, and getting your brain diced was the least-worst option.

Hardware, Running Speed, and Copies

Mind-tweaks and Software

Job and Lifestyle

... etc, etc. I'm reasonably good at the worldbuilding side of things; not so much at the graphic design elements. Anyone want to help me hash out the details on this, and assemble an oversized GIF or three?

  I would recommend changing the references to hard drives. It's unlikely that hard drives will remain the price-volume leaders for slow random access storage in 2040, and references to "hard drives" will be as dated as references to "tape" today.

    Well... People seem to have no trouble calling solid-state drives "hard drives", so that doesn't seem a large priority. But if you can find me a trend-line I can extrapolate for some other storage medium, I'll be happy to throw it into the mix.

      Sure, and people talk about video being "on tape" when they really mean a hard disk, but when they're talking specifically about the technology they refer to DVRs instead of VCRs. Heck, "tivo" has pretty much become a generic replacement for "tape".

      They're talking about SSDs lapping hard disks in peak storage in 2016. Hard disks will remain cheaper for a while, but I suspect that by 2020 nobody's going to use hard disks for anything but super high capacity "nearline" data center storage. By 2040 it'll be like talking about film cameras.

      Anyway, I just found it kind of jarring. That's all.
