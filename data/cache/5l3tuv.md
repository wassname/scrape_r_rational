## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  Y'all are great folks, and I'm grateful that this community exists. /r/rational is why I started using Reddit to begin with, and if it disappeared then, well, I think I'd still use Reddit, but maybe just checking in once a week or so for fanfic recommendations and stuff. I'd probably get everything else from other places or just stop spending time on those things.

  It isn't just the good fiction. /r/rational feels like a community in a bigger way than most subreddits, in part because of these Monday and Friday threads. We've talked about politics, commiserated together, helped each other become more productive or discussed headspace issues. We don't just talk fic, but support each other, is what I'm saying, and I wanted to make sure that I expressed my appreciation of that in this, the year's last off-topic thread.

      I've thought about it, but I'm always worried about (1) butting in on a conversation that nobody invited me to and annoying people, even though that's a bizarre concept for a public chat server or (2) interrupting someone's conversation by accident.

  This past year I discovered that I have depression and lack direction in life. The worst part of 2016, for me, hasn't been what life has done to me but what I've done or failed to do for myself. This sub has helped me out a lot, but my situation hasn't exactly improved. I still haven't gotten around to finding a therapist or figured out what I'm passionate about doing.

  I keep hearing people be optimistic about next year, but I'm terrified of what's coming. I'm going to have to find a job for my physics degree but have no idea what I want to do. I'm also freaking out over the [direction politics has taken](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/america-is-becoming-a-land-of-less-liberty/2016/12/29/2a91744c-ce09-11e6-a747-d03044780a02_story.html?utm_term=.83fe39520171#comments) both in and outside of America. My faith in humanity has always been a core belief of mine, and it's being severely tested.

    I think that "the political leader I don't like was elected, therefore I'm losing faith in my country / my culture / humanity" is a subtle failure mode of politics; it's a type of failure that's less intense and spectacular than the "my political opponents are inhuman and evil" bias, but comes from the same patterns.

    It's pretty intuitive to me that in any system that is somewhat democratic, you're going to end up with leaders you disagree with more often than not. Parties are formed around controversial ideas, and optimize their policies to get as many votes as they can, so most elections are going to be split between a few popular parties (as opposed to a monolithic hyper-popular party); which means that at least some of these popular parties are still not going to be elected.

    Combined with the fact that both the media and the parties' supporters (you and me included) have strong but subtle incentives to focus on and amplify the negative aspects of the other parties... and any given political leader is likely to have a sizeable portion of their electorate who thinks they're completely awful and will bring the world to ruin (or keep it ruined). SSC's article "You're still crying wolf" comes to mind.

    Of course, I don't know what to make of this. On one hand, I'm pretty sure the pattern I describe does exist, and that people of every political orientation in every democracy have been announcing that the last election that didn't go their way marked the imminent collapse of their country since forever. On the other hand, countries aren't immortal, the economy can be screwed up, minorities can be oppressed, and all of these things do happen all the time, so "relax, politicians aren't dangerous" isn't true either. I don't know. Just... assume that whatever awfulness happens under Trump would probably have happened under Clinton anyway? (as well as whatever awfulness *doesn't* happen)

      My problem isn't that the guy I didn't like won, but the general trends and values among the supporters I've seen on r/AskTrumpSupporters. I'm so sick of arguing with people who distrust intellectuals and science, hate political correctness so much they tolerate bigotry, think it's acceptable for businesses to discriminate against people like me for religious reasons, and consider it acceptable behavior for a political leader to unironically spout lies and insults in any context. I despise them so much I can barely articulate why.

      Edit: Forgot to mention the paranoia over illegal immigrants and Muslims. They treat these people as an existential threat to America's economy and culture but can't formulate viable solutions.

      The worst part is that I don't see this extreme political polarization going away any time soon. Political discourse between people who disagree is broken. We used to argue about strawmen, now we can't even agree on what constitutes a strawman because we both think our interpretation of the situation is accurate and the other side is biased and misinformed. I don't see how any good can come of this situation, at least without doing a whole lot of easily preventable harm first.

        I feel compelled to wonder what kinds of people actually populate /r/AskTrumpSupporters.  Given that it's a dedicated subreddit for the purposes of, effectively, having conservatives defend Trump, my prediction for such a place would be that you'd have a heavy bias towards the people most zealously supportive of Trump, and those who associate with him in such a way that attacks on Trump feel like personal attacks.  I would expect such people to be more likely to hold extreme opinions and/or be obnoxiously loud and confident about their opinions without having thought through them.

        Further, I would expect that this bias towards the zealous would come from a tendency for the zealous to stay and continue debating while the more regular supporters feel uncomfortable between both the zealous and the liberals, and leave the subreddit after a shorter timeframe.  In total, I think that the impression you have received from /r/AskTrumpSupporters risks being representative only of the zealous and more extreme parts of his voterbase.

        Remember that half of the country voted for him.  Unless I had reason to believe the conservative voterbase was either that bad back in 2012 or has become that bad in those four years, I would be inclined first to expect extreme views to indicate the extreme portion of the voterbase.

          Considering that polls by The Economist, YouGov, and Public Policy Polling have returned these results, I'm inclined towards cynicism.

          * 67% of Trump supporters say unemployment increased during the Obama administration

          * 39% of Trump supporters say the stock market declined during the Obama administration, and 19% say they are unsure

          * 74% of Trump supporters think the proportion of people without health insurance in the US remained the same or increased over the last five years

          * 46% of Trump supporters say that leaked Clinton emails refer to a child sex and pedophilia ring

    Preface: I don't want this post to sound condescending or trivialising your problems, but I'm not very good at expressing the right tone over text. The post is very 'take a problem you mentioned and offer a possible thing to try / consider', which might or might not be helpful to you. Apologies for the length and rambling nature.

    >I still haven't gotten around to finding a therapist

    Have you tried talking to your everyday doctor (GP in the UK; not sure what the US nomenclature is) about this? Depression doesn't necessarily mean you need a therapist; you can just ask a doctor for antidepressants, which are usually inexpensive. If they don't work, you're rarely worse off (side-effects are very minor most of the time) and can try something else; if they do, it helps a *lot*.

    That's what I've done about 8 months ago, and 6 months of taking a small dose of SSRI has helped quite a bit. (I've recently stopped taking it to see if it kept, or if i'll return to baseline) No therapist involved, largely because I figured I wouldn't have the time.

    > or figured out what I'm passionate about doing.

    I think passion's a bit overrated, and it's talked about waay too much in college. There are *tons* of people out there who either don't have a particular passion, or they found their passion late and it's more of a hobby. They go to work, hopefully enjoy their job without it being everything, and then build a good and satisfying life outside of work.

    (I'm kinda assuming you're fairly young at this point, given that you're finishing a degree and looking for a job)

    I have no idea about the job market for physics graduates in particular, but usually STEM graduates have a lot of options. Beside working in jobs directly related to your degree, there's things like analyst positions, or even programming. One friend of mine after finishing an Avionics degree went to work for a wind energy company analysing and modelling the flow of wind over an area; he developed statistical analysis and programming (python) skills there, and took that to his next job where he oversaw an integration of a data analysis project at a cargo shipping (as in huge ships with containers) company. And now he's doing a similar data analysis / project management thing at Palantir.

    Another friend went straight from physics degree to a small programming company where he helped make games. He knew some basic programming from college but mostly learned on the job.

    Basically I'm trying to say you shouldn't focus too much on the actual 'knowledge' you gained from college; if you're not having much luck finding physics-specific jobs, consider what *skills* you've gained during the course (data analysis, logical reasoning, etc), and find entry level positions in businesses that value those skills.

    > have no idea what I want to do

    It's very hard to know what you want to do before you try things. (this ties into the above, I guess). You're not commited to a 40-year career when you join a particular company, or take a particular role. Don't be afraid to just try a job just because it's available. At worst, if you hate it after 6 months, you can just leave.

  I've been writing a story where the, er, founding concept(that is, the idea that the whole story revolves around) is that it's set in a simulated reality, and the MC comes from a near-future civilization that discovered this several decades before his birth. 

  I'm in doubt as to whether I should make this explicit from the beginning as a hook, or to foreshadow it, perhaps reveal it at the end of the first major arc. What does /r/rational think?
  ```

  - u/Anderkent:
    ```
    IANAW but I think if the simulated thing is common knowledge in MC's civilisation, it should be revealed pretty early on. Whereas if it's something that characters learn about when trying things, then you should hint at it but only reveal it when / after the characters find out.

    Which one you should go for really depends on what kind of story you want to write
    ```

    - u/GlueBoy:
      ```
      I guess the question doesn't really work how I phrased it, specific to my story. Too subjective. 

      You're right though, I need to decide what story I want to write, more specifically what story *format.* If you think about it, it seems like all of r/rational's most popular stories (or most discussed, at least) are serialized fiction. From what I've seen, a hallmark of serialized fiction is a continual cycle of teasing and payoff, which is necessary to retain interest through months and years. If you take this place as a guide, you have to front-load world-building, and back-load plot. 

      Novels don't have to tease so much, though some do. The pace of revelation there tends to be dictated by what can be revealed naturally ("show, don't tell" being the catchword), and what is required to advance the plot.

      Most serial fiction I've read have really shitty hooks in the beginning. Worm for example, was pretty mediocre for the first few 10k words. Mother of Learning isn't anything special at the beginning, either. They all get carried off of the strength of their concept: Realistic, grimdark superhero world. DnD timeloop. That, and the fact that everyone finds these stories through recommendations, and there is no buy in, so people can invest more time than they would otherwise. 

      Sorry for the diggression, thinking out loud, so to say.

        > If you think about it, it seems like all of r/rational's most popular stories (or most discussed, at least) are serialized fiction.

        If you check /r/rational/top/, with the exception of *Mother of Learning* (by far the most upvoted thing to this subreddit) there are lots of short stories (and some novella length). And the discussion on them isn't actually that much less than the discussion for serials, especially once you correct for number of commentors (most serials have a pool of "invested" people who do the vast bulk of the commenting).

        The big strength of serials is that they can draw people in week after week. If you read a short story, it stays in your head for maybe a few days, eventually fading into "that thing you read one time". But a serial stays in the reader's head pretty much as long as it's running, and new chapters with new discussion that serve as advertisement when they get posted to places or talked about by invested readers. It's not so much the cycle of teasing and payoff (though that does exist) but just the sheer length that acts as a powerful asset.

        I'd suggest against front-loading the world-building, though it somewhat depends on what you mean by "front". The first chapter is the most important chapter of any work, especially online, because that's where people are going to decide whether they're going to read or bounce. The first chapter should have only enough worldbuilding to get the actual plot in motion, and if the first chapter needs a lot of worldbuilding for the plot to make sense, pick a different starting plot. The worldbuilding can come after you've sunk your teeth into the reader. (That both *Worm* and *Mother of Learning* defied this is a testament to their ability to draw in readers through other means, but you can't count on that unless you can pass a critical threshold of readership, which you might no be able to, and you'll have to write for quite a while to build up steam.)

  Is there an accurate simple definition of liberal and conservative? I know what positions are considered liberal and which ones are considered conservative but if a new issue with two options came up I'd have no idea how to classify which is which. Change vs no change can't be right because people want things a certain way and when they are that way they want them to stay the same and when they aren't they want them to change to the way they want.

  I've been learning Go recently. I'd definitely recommend it. It has a different feel than other turn-based two player board games. It doesn't require looking many moves ahead, which is nice for me because I have bad working memory.

  What are some ways I can nudge myself into wasting less time? I often have trouble convincing myself to not just pursue mild/familiar entertainment because it's easy, but it leads to a certain unpleasant long-term equivalent of boredom. I guess by "wasting time" I mean doing things that do not lead to any sort of long-term goal, just wandering around reddit or playing more of whatever computer game I'm feeling nostalgic for, etc. I find that "feeling productive" is more my limiting factor than time availability. If I could reliably be productive without feeling like it (or find ways to reliably make myself feel like it, like my ADHD medication used to) I think my life would improve.

  Also I have trouble convincing myself to get organized and make any sort of plans, which is also room for improvement I'm not sure how to exploit. I'm very good at coming up with excuses to be lazy, and it's hard to counter them all.

  Sorry for rambling.

    For liberal vs conservative, the most successful predictor is probably going to be something along the lines of "Does this seem like something the Red Tribe would like, or does this seem like something The Blue Tribe would like?"  The actual positions are all a horrible mishmash that cheerfully flip around based on signalling, countersignalling, being in or out of power and more.  Simple tribalism probably has the best predictive power.

  - u/zarraha:

    This is somewhat oversimplified, but perhaps the simplest way to describe liberal/conservative is with the Nolan Chart:

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Chart

    Conservatives believe that the government should interfere less in economic issues, and more in personal ones (like same-sex marriage)  Liberals believe the government should interfere more in economic issues and less in personal ones.  And then there are Libertarians who believe it should interfere less in both, and Authoritarians believe it should interfere more in both.

    Of course, all of these lie somewhere on a spectrum.  Everyone has some collection of opinions which doesn't perfectly match any particular ideology, but it's useful to be able to group together with people who have similar ideas and try to work in a direction closer to what you think is optimal.

  Question: The thermosphere above Earth measures about 2500 degrees celsius. That is, the gas particles up there sit at about that temperature (it actually fluctuates wildly but that's besides the point) But due to the fact that it's near vacuum, the amount of heat transferred there via conduction or convection is minimal. So you wouldn't actually feel the heat if you were able to actually put your hand out into it safely. 

  However. That means we can't just put a thermometer out there and get a reading of the temperature. So how have we figured out that the heat of the thermosphere? All I can find is a vague conclusion that it has to do with gas densities and formulas. I was hoping for something more concrete than that. And I figured, out of the subs here, one or two of you had to know enough about physics and space to give me a more certain answer :)
  ```

  - u/Gaboncio:

    One of the best ways to measure gas temperatures in low-density fluids in astrophysics is through their EM emission and absorption properties. Emission and absorption produced by specific atomic ions (like the emission lines from catching a free electron) is ideal, because at a given temperature and density [most atoms are in a single ionization state](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bernardine_Wong/publication/254495787/figure/fig1/AS:297956151447553@1448049690335/Figure-1-Argon-ionization-fractions-dependences-on-plasma-electron-temperature-for-atom.png). Luckily, on Earth we don't need to rely on radiation and can go directly to measuring ion concentrations and gas densities to extract the temperature. The hard part in this case would be to pick a good probe element, because it needs to have an ionization temperature of 2500 K which is pretty mild, astronomically. Implied here is that we can also look for atmospheric emission and absorption to corroborate the results

    Epistemic status: I took AP Chem last year, so this should be fairly accurate on the simplest level, but I'm certainly not an expert. Also I have no idea if they actually do it this way, this is just a way that they could.

    So the ideal gas law is that temperature of a gas is equal to the volume multiplied by the pressure divided by the number of moles of gas, multiplied by a constant. We know the constant, and we can experimentally find the pressure and number of moles of gas in some volume that we decide. So from those, we know the temperature. 

    Note that this is a simplified explanation because real gasses aren't ideal gasses, but it's still fairly correct.
    ```

    - u/Gaboncio:
      ```
      Real gasses are actually pretty close to ideal! Even low density ones like this. The hard part, I think, would be having an airborne barometer that is accurate at such low pressures, although I may be underestimating how dedicated atmospheric scientists are to precision measurements.
