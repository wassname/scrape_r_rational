Eight Cedrics Diggory attempt to rob a magical casino in Vegas.

u/eniteris' offered an excellent prompt for the Secret Krampus contest:  *A person has to plan a heist with multiple copies of themselves.* I found myself wishing I had gotten that prompt, as I had a perfect fit of an idea bouncing around my head from years past. Then I just wrote it in addition to my actual contest entry.

  > His Lesser Invulnerability was stripped away, as was the Time-Stretching charm, and the Forget-Me-Now, but he was still invisible in three ways, had heightened his five senses and added three others.

  My favorite line! Great work.

  That was a lot of fun! I love the concept of >!layering actual Spontaneous Duplication with the Time Turner.!<
  ```

- u/kevshea:
  ```
  Super awesome! Great work. 

  Only confusion was that the explanatory part just before it starts says "no one actually has spontaneous duplication", but the whole premise of this is that Cedric Diggory does, no? Maybe a slight rewording is in order. 

  I'm also extraordinarily curious about how Cedric got it.

    I just removed that line; the explanation should work without it.

    > I'm also extraordinarily curious about how Cedric got it

    As the story says, there was an accident in the final round of the Triwizard tournament, with a temporal trap in the hedge maze. More details are, I'm afraid, not available at the moment :)

  ```
  I’m having trouble keeping track of the time-turner, specifically how 9 gave his to 6, but got another left by 8, then turned into 8 and left the time turner to himself. Unless I’m missing something, seems like an extra time-turner came out nowhere in the middle of the story.
