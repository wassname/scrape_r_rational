  That letter. So excellent.

    I know what the 'magical object' would be as soon as it was mentioned. It will be interesting to see where the story goes from here, it is delightfully off the rails now.

  >"Cadmus Peverell"

  And then *I* said, out loud, "fucking genius!" He had no reason to rush seeing the dearly departed that he wishes returned, and no desire to risk emotional damage to himself or spiritual damage to them. The Peverell Brothers, or even Roger Bacon-

  Hezzel, well done.

  You summon a wizard of pre-Hogwarts lore *without asking Dumbledore whether he can think of any possible bad consequences*?

  You know, just because this prophecy says that you'll save us all doesn't mean you should go about releasing existential risks all over the place!

  Oh, man, when I read the title I was so scared that this would be the very last chapter. Good to see that, even if this might be the last arc, there's still a bit more closure coming up.
