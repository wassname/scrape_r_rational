## [BST][D] If you woke up as your five year old self tomorrow, with the memories of your lived life intact, what would you do? • /r/AskReddit

### Post:

Wasn't satisfied with the comments in the Ask Reddit [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/56x58o/if_you_woke_up_as_your_five_year_old_self/).  It would be great if you respond creatively with a story-snippet, plan of action, etc.

    Yeah.  Had to try my best to ignore that bit for the thought exercise.  Although with the neurophysiology of a five year old you'd rebound relatively quickly.  What then?  And would you plan to contrive an encounter with your partner?

          She would never become the woman I love, because we have been married almost 10 years. I have shaped her life, as she has shaped mine. With me changing, I couldn't provide the same influences to her, even if I wanted.

          There would be a woman out there with her face, but not her.

          I honestly don't understand why, but the thought is legitimately upsetting to me, even though I know it's just a thought experiment.

            Out of curiosity (and you are free to not answer this if it's too personal): how would you feel if your partner was in an accident that made her forget a year's worth of memories? Say this past year, for example? Would she still be close enough to the woman you love to want to stay, as there'd only be a single missing year? 

            I ask because I feel your issue with the scenario is a matter of degree more than anything else, and am curious as if that's the case. Again, I stress that you don't need to answer if you feel like I'm prying.

            - u/failed_novelty:
              ```
              I am not sure. In that case, my feelings would likely not be much changed, just tinted with more sadness. There haven't been any major life-changing events in the past 12months, though, so simply losing some memories would not change her much. I agree it is more degree, but in your example there are other significant differences (such as: she would likely be aware that she was missing memories, our kids would exist, and there would be physical evidence of what I said was happening).

    I wonder about the ethical implications of creating Minecraft or a clone of any other video game/work of art that you know will be popular.

    It's plagiarism of a sort, but only you will know that it's plagiarism. And it's even possible that the person you're stealing the idea from will not have even thought of it at the time that you begin to make the game.

    There's also the possibility that your version of the game/book/movie or whatever is either worse quality than the original, or perhaps you're just not in the right position to promote it well enough to make money off of it.

    Then at that point you've effectively exposed the idea to the world that would have been profitable for someone else and maybe influential to future works. And it's possible that the person who would have originally had the idea will be discouraged by your failure or even success.

    Though I don't think this would be the end of the world, I think it's possible you can have a negative impact doing things like that.

      > I wonder about the ethical implications of creating Minecraft or a clone of any other video game/work of art that you know will be popular.

      In my understanding, until someone actually creates the idea, all bets are off. It's not plagiarism in the same way that the clones of Minecraft are not considered plagiarism. My ethical wall in that situation would be if I were to go back with my own (pirated) copy of Minecraft and claim it as my own. 

      That would be unethical. So long as I would be able to make my own from scratch, I don't see anything unethical about it.

      It is a good thing to discuss though.
      ```

      - u/Fresh_C:
        ```
        I somewhat agree with you. But I think in a practical sense, you really are screwing over the person who had the original idea.

        It's worse than copying concepts from a successful person, because you're effectively taking away from their potential for success.

        If you make it big by making a Minecraft clone, it's very unlikely that Notch (the main inventor of Minecraft) is going to make it big by making the original Minecraft in the same timeline.

        So you've more or less traded their success for your own. Which to me feels shady, though not necessarily criminal.

        Edit: You make a good point about clones not being illegal, but this is basically the difference between building on someone's success and taking their success for your own.
        ```

        - u/Dwood15:
          ```
          > it's very unlikely that Notch (the main inventor of Minecraft) is going to make it big by making the original Minecraft in the same timeline.

          >this is basically the difference between building on someone's success and taking their success for your own.

          I approach the situation with three arguments, and if irreconcilable, an idea for reducing the net bad. From your quote it sounds like you're assuming this is zero-sum- because I have success means another person can't have success either. 

          1) (The game is not zero-sum)- While not sharing in my success, Notch would not be left homeless if I succeeded with the idea. He made no big bets on the game, and the fact that it got as big as it did was as much chance as anything else. Someone else would have come up with something similar that would have caught on if MC didn't catch on.

          2) This is assuming my implementation is successful. Let's say I deliberately do a C++ version (which can't support mods) that allthough has good FPS and basic gameplay, never ends up getting bukkit or pistons, etc due to the work required to reverse machine code. I make a couple million off the game, not a couple billion. Minecraft comes out for Java and is moddable. Notch loses little (if any) money between timelines.
          2a) I can still make a TON of money if I only make a little amount of cash, because some companies are still getting big around this time, like Nflx and TSLA, as well as a couple of medical companies

          3) I believe the net harm to the disadvantaged party in this case is less than the net good from utilizing my knowledge to gain wealth in this manner. As a selfish individual (and perhaps conceitful) I think that I could make better use of millions and millions towards public good during the time I have foresight than Notch would during the same amount of time with the same amount of cash (Not saying Notch is using his money unwisely).

          Attempt to reconcile: If none of the above points reconcile the issue, One could attempt to 'invest' some portion of the earned money into Mojang during this time period, giving them a chance to create a separate/decent product with the proper funding.
          ```

          - u/Fresh_C:
            ```
            1) I agree that his success may in part be contributed to luck, but it's a hard argument to make that he doesn't lose a lot. Yes there is a vast difference between making someone homeless and not giving them millions of dollars. But I don't think this point really adds anything to the discussion. The fact of the matter is that you know that so long as you don't change reality significantly Notch is going to gain millions. And you're making a deliberate effort to gain those millions for yourself, utilizing his ideas/methods.

            2) It's possible that you could make a little money and still leave room for Notch to make his money... but I think it would be incredibly hard to actually plan to do that. Especially since seeing your game come to market might discourage Notch from creating his game in the first place. And if your game comes out first the brand recognition you gain may be more important in the long run than the quality of the game itself. Things might work out the way you described, but I don't see any way for you to be reasonably sure that they actually will turn out that way.

            3) This point is your strongest point. If you actually believe the good you can do with the money is significantly greater than the good Notch has demonstratedly done with his money, then maybe you do have a point.

            Though I would argue that all your other methods of gaining money in your original post are probably sufficient that you don't NEED to go through with this plan in the first place. But if for some reason whatever altruistic plan you have cooking requires more capital than the other ideas/investments can provide, then I say you're justified in going through with this, knowing that there's at least a chance that you're significantly altering someone else's life for the worse, for the sake of potentially improving many other people's lives.

            As for your attempt to reconcile: that's better than nothing I suppose. But I'm sure if you gave the people at Majong the choice between already having created a widely successful game and an investment towards making a potentially successful game, they would choose the former.

            So I say, sure you're justified in doing this if you intend to use the money for The Greater Good™ and you have no other less morally ambiguous way to gain the money. But if those conditions don't apply I don't think this is a particularly moral plan.

      There is an actual story with that kind of premise. Main character goes to an alternate earth, but the earth has slightly different culture, missing alot of our world's shows, books and poems. Main character has the dream of becoming famous, so in this new world, uses our worlds literature and shows in a bid to fame. It's not by any means rational, and ethnical implications are never mentioned, but i enjoy it alot as it's a fun read.

      Sypnopsis: Zhang Ye, whose only goal was to become a celebrity, had tunneled to a brand new Earth that was different.

      At the radio station, during the host hiring interview:

      A loud voice narrated, “Up above the sea’s grey flatland, wind is gathering the clouds. In between the sea and clouds proudly soars the Petrel, reminiscent of black lightning. Glancing a wave with his wingtip, like an arrow dashing cloudward, he cries out and the clouds hear his joy in the bird’s cry of courage. In this cry–thirst for the tempest!”

      However, the interviewers of this world that had never heard of Gorky’s “The Song of the Stormy Petrel” and were so shocked that they stared with their mouths agape!

      The story begins from here.

  Werter knocks on his brother's door.

  "Wilhelm?" he asks, opening the door.

  "What is it?"

  "I need to talk to you about something serious."

  Wilhelm glances at Werter standing in the door frame.  "I need to finish my homework," he says, and turns back to his books and papers sprawled across his bed.

  "Are you almost done?"

  "Come back in an hour or so."

  "But we have dinner shortly thereafter, and this is not a conversation I should like to be disturbed."

  Wilhelm pauses in his notetaking and considers his little brother, standing with a smirk in his room's doorway.

  "Did Wulfric tell you to say that?"

  "違うよ。ただ真面目な話がしたいんだけだ。*I wonder if you understood that.*"

  Wilhelm gapes at his little brother, who enters the room and closes the door behind him.

  "How much of that did you pick up?"

  "It takes a moment to switch.  Just the end."

  "You'd agree though that I'm fluent in both this and Japanese, which should be impossible for your five year old little brother?"

  "Unless Wulfric has spent the past few weeks teaching you this to prank me."

  "*Wulfric can speak*日常*conversation, but*彼の*ability*が*this level*とは懸け離れているんだ。お前*also that, right?*  How much of that did you pick up, Wilhelm?"

  "Wulfric can speak conversationally but his level is something?"

  "His level doesn't compare to mine, and neither does yours."

  Wilhelm stares at Werter, eyes unfocused.

  "*Brother*, it's impossible for me, a five-year-old, to suddenly become this proficient in two languages.  Something strange that you can't explain is going on.  Do you agree with that much?"

  Wilhelm thinks it over, then nods.

  "And you're right, it is impossible.  Because I'm not your five year old brother Werter.  I'm your thirty five year old brother Werter.

  "Have you ever told me how you met your best friend, Erik?"

  "I don't know.  No."

  "You bonded over sharing darknet URLs while riding the bus.  You taught him the URL for a site about video game easter eggs.  Also, you already have a car parked down the road but haven't told anyone in the family about it as you bought it with funds earned illicitly on the web."

  Werter climbs into the chair by the computer desk while Wilhelm processes.

  "Do you believe me?"

  "I don't disbelieve you."

  "That's good enough for now, because Father is cheating on Mother right now, and if he doesn't stop Mother will find out a year from now.  The resulting divorce will render our family poor and ruin Wulfric's life.  Once you believe me we can bring him and Wulfric in.  In the meantime, you need to figure out how to convince Father to invest in some stocks I know are going to boom shortly."

  "What about lottery numbers and sports outcomes?"

  "Never paid attention much to either, so I don't remember with enough reliability to place bets.  Pete Sampras will do something unprecedented in Tennis.  Most Championships, I think.  Don't know if you can bet on that.  I don't know if he's active, yet."

  "What did you do with your life?  Can you do something with that?"

  "Oh!  I was a liberal arts professor.  Maybe I can write a bestselling novel series I remember.  But I don't remember the writing style, and that's what made it sell so well."

  "Sure.  I still am confused about what I should believe, Werter, but at this moment I'm certain that you're useless as a time traveler if somehow you are telling the truth."

  "I know when wars start and stock bubbles end!"

  "How do they start and when do they end?"

  "Not sure and at least a decade from now."

  "*Useless.*"

  "*I know.  That's why I need help from my brother.*"

        Probably just the suggestion that time travel isn't an automatic "I win", but there isn't really a fleshed out conflict yet. A struggling time traveller without too much useful foreknowledge sounds like a good hook.

        I think what I liked the most about it is the lack of explicit backstory despite the *in media res* beginning. Being trusted to work it out without being beaten over the head with explainers felt nice.

    I actually think you wouldn't be able to win _even a single lottery_.

    I think you're vastly underestimating the butterfly effect, you can't buy tickets the same day they do the draw so that's at least a day for things to change. The lottery is an extremely delicate system, given it's designed to be unpredictable. If you traveled back even 30 seconds in time betting on roulette and changed your bet to the number that just came up, you wouldn't expect it to come up the same this iteration, the lottery is the same way it's just not as intuitively obvious how delicate of a system it is.       
    The same thing goes for reproduction, which sperm meets the egg is a delicate system. Expect everyone born in this new iteration to be half twins (same egg) of who would have otherwise been born starting out.     
    After a while things will diverge even further, don't count on anything happening unless it was basically inevitable, even then you might be wrong about how guaranteed that outcome actually was.

    If tomorrow's date is 2016, another possibility is just to go public, especially if you have a way to prove your identity (fingerprints, retinal scans, signatures, maybe genetic tests).  (And if your job depends on being physically adult, try to force your insurance to treat you as having a disabling condition that takes 10 or so years to heal.)

    Also, if you do change your identity, do you want to claim to be the child of your old identity?  (DNA tests would certainly show a similarity, but some tests may show you as too similar.)

    ```
    Also, in this context, if tomorrow's date is 2016, watch the Detective Conan anime.  He's only aged down to around 6-7, but that's close enough for this purpose.  He's basically in hiding from criminals.  His parents become aware fairly early on but they are not present, and he's staying with his childhood friend and her father, who is a detective.  He does try to pretend to be his physical age.  Through impossible TV tech, he solves mysteries and pretends that it is her father who is really solving them.  Every so often he solves one himself (usually when alone with the perpetrator, but he has plot armor), which never causes any problems.

    Another character is also deaged to that age and doesn't normally bother to hide it.  Nobody notices, except the kids "her age" occasionally think she's mature.  It helps that she is living with someone who knows the circumstances.

  Well due to many circumstances I will not be actively trying to change anything on my formative years, I will let things play out as they did before until I am living in the USA. Then things get interesting. Accumulation of wealth is nearly impossible until bitcoins come around. If i remember correctly, I should sell them around 2012 November. And start acquiring them much, much sooner. As soon as they appear. 

  If possible invest in tesla cars and apple as well as google. Now assuming I can get a few hundred thousand or something north of a million out of bitcoins, my investments on tesla would pay out quite nicely. I would then invest into getting a good amount of minecraft stock.

  Keeping all of this and my finances secret ofcourse, I want to keep things as close to this timeline as possible. I will work as a wage slave for about 4 years but then I get the opportunity to meet the one person that means everything to me. From then on, I'd start using my riches to their full advantage. Including trying to work with the gates foundation on eradicating Malaria.

  I'd launch into wholesale laundering of ideas.  There are so many academic and business ideas that would be easy to turn into massive success.  Off the top of my head:

  - PageRank
  - Social networking websites
  - distributed version control
  - cloud computing
  - Airbnb
  - Uber
  - Adwords
  - high frequency trading
  - Wikipedia
  - Bayesian spam filtering

  While the specifics of world politics and the economy would be inevitably contaminated by the butterfly effect, foreknowledge of some of the broad economic shifts that have taken place would almost certainly make you tremendously rich and allow you to accelerate the world's technological progress by a couple years.  I think the hardest part would be the early years of trying to be taken seriously and accumulate capital when you're only five years old, and just waiting for Moore's Law to make certain technologies possible.

      I've spent several hundred hours of software engineering time on unsuccessful side projects that were intended to become startups, so I'm aware that there's an enormous chasm between a "good idea" and an actual thriving company.  But I've also had a lot of professional experience in software engineering and finance, have read a lot of academic CS papers, and am reasonably persistent.  My parents even knew several active angel investors quite well when I was 5.  Beyond just having certain knowledge that an idea could work, I'd be the beneficiary of knowing exactly how certain product decisions should be made.  Lots of iteration and testing and market selection went into the final design of any of these sites. There's also 25 years of improvement in software engineering knowledge to draw from -- stuff like A/B testing, MapReduce, eventually consistent databases, etc.

      Could a random member of the public turn a "good idea" into a successful business?  Probably not.  Can a smart specialist make a large impact in their specialty?  Absolutely.

  I would first be very weirded out and it would take me a few days to adjust and to really accept that it was happening to me.

  The first and biggest change I would make is to slowly ramp up my general competence and ability. I had mental issues as a child and was almost classified as mentally retarded (then in high school was classified as 'genius' go figure!). So my education and life would improve if I could make myself appear as a very smart child early on. Then I would study and review everything I need to know to pass high school courses.

  I would insist on certain surgeries for a medical condition I have. First time around I got it in late teens and I believe it would be so much better to get it as early as possible and it would be relatively easy to convince my family.

  Convince my mother to not date that guy. He's a jerk and it'd be easy to prove it with foreknowledge.

  Start participation in some sports like running, swimming, or martial arts so I can develop good exercise habits early on. Probably learn a foreign language and music. Get myself classified as a prodigy and attending college level courses at a very young age. Where I live is well placed for me to attend courses at a nearby university.

  With some academic credentials under my belt, it'll be much easier for me to publish about future research. During the years it would take for me to get through college, I'd be working on code for Facebook and attempt to use it for my university like Zuckberg did for Harvard. Since I was sent back in time to 2000, I'd have 4 years to do it. I'd invest into stock markets concerning companies I know will do well.

  Once I have a hefty chunk of money and used some of it to help out my family, I'd go into space research and fund organizations like MIRI and Khan Academy.

  The first thing I'd do is convince my parents that I had knowledge of the future. It wouldn't be that hard to do, and I'm pretty sure I could convince them to more or less keep this information to themselves.

  From there I'd look out for any publicly traded companies that I know are going to become huge. This would be right around the time of the Internet boom, so we'd have some choices of where to invest.

  I don't think I'd do anything like trying to prevent 9/11 or any other major tragedies, since I don't like the spotlight and I don't think such knowledge of the future would be that big of an advantage.

  I mean I can prevent a few deaths, assuming anyone takes me seriously, but the more you directly change things, the less accurate your future knowledge is going to be. And in the grand scheme of things, even preventing something as big as 9/11 probably won't have long lasting positive impact on the world. Though maybe that's just the pessimist in me speaking.

  So after making a boatload of cash with my family, I think I'd probably change the direction I took in life a bit. Focus more on different areas of education and try to pick up different skills.

  For the vast majority of the world, me being sent back in time would have pretty much no effect on their lives. For me personally, I'd be richer... and have an awkward relationship with my family since I know some things about how their futures turned out that they themselves wouldn't know.

  Edit: I have a feeling that my future knowledge would probably lead to some of my younger family members not being born. That would be kinda sad...

Did the modification originate in the present, or was it initiated in the time of my 5 year old self (i.e. selecting my mental state from out of a number of potential futures)?

  Whatever happened would be the most profound and illuminating phenomenon in human history, and it would be important to understand it.

  Assuming no preparation:

  Step 1: Take immediate measures to record and preserve the knowledge of my former life, so that those memories aren't forgotten (as many early memories are) during the process of childhood brain development. I would surreptitiously obtain a notebook and pencil, and start writing everything down, and try to hide this from my parents.

  Step 2: Slowly give indications of being a child prodigy.

  Step 3: Get my parents to let me take a fast track through the school system. Attempt to invest in certain companies, or get my parents to, as soon as anyone takes me seriously. Become an entrepreneur in my teens, maybe after getting a PhD. Establish contact with lots of people who will be important in the future. Maybe aim to become an influential world leader.

  Also, have lots of fun messing with the other kids my age.

  I am actually doing this as my nanowrimo this year, so I have thought about it :-)

  I am 50 years old, so I would first of all throw a huge temper tantrum about not having the internet or a mobile phone or even more than three TV channels for aaaages.

  Then I would settle down and try to enjoy my childhood until I had more clue what was going on. You can get away with a lot as a kid so I'd ask everyone I met if they would remember being older. I'd try to act like a child, more or less, but I would let myself be good at school so I got a chance of a better school. I'd save most of my pocket money, clean my teeth religiously and eat as healthily as I could. I would try to be better at making friends and keeping fit (maybe if I could hate PE less I'd make more friends). Try to persuade my granddad to bet on Red Rum in the Grand National. He'd probably do it, even though he'd put the money in a crappy savings account for me.  

  I would assume the lottery numbers would be different, and couldn't invest in shares till later, but I'd invest some of that pocket money in things like comic books which I would store very carefully.

  I'd have really difficulty deciding whether to tip the police off about murderers, or Jimmy Saville, or major bombings. I'd be very wary of being implicated or investigated myself, but I would probably try.
