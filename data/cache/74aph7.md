            If you didn't mean to say "1.", the reason that happened is that Reddit automatically thinks any number you put at the start of a new paragraph followed by a period is the start of an ordered list, and re-numbers it from 1. To fix it, put a backslash in front of the period eg. "6\\. [text]".

            6\. Like this.

  If I tell a Druid "you shouldn't have been able to do that" after they just did something, my statement is clearly false in the sense that the Druid's magic worked anyway. I wonder if this implies that the important thing is the Druid's confidence in their magic. A way to test this would be to feed a blinded Druid a plausible but incorrect explanation of why their magic shouldn't work and then see if they're rendered unable to cast the spell again in the future.
  ```

  - u/PanickedApricott:
    ```
    alternatively make a known really hard thing seem easy and watch a convinced druid do it easily. Also memory wipes are necessary.

    - u/derefr:
      ```
      It seems like cocaine or amphetamines would be really helpful for druids. "I can do anything" self-confidence → magic power.
      ```

      - u/i6i:
        ```
        I think people are going really wild with theories that aren't supported by anything in the text. 

        The fact that better understanding of the precise mechanics of something a druid is trying to do is  sometimes detrimental to them trying to do it intuitively doesn't imply that worse understanding equals infinite power. 

        All the talk about memetics and what not seems to be overlooking the simplest answer which is that the locus is deliberately trying to throw attempts to analyse it so that any spell being cast for the express purpose of trying to understand how it works OR by someone who is naturally inquisitive OR somewhere where someone naturally inquisitive would have the opportunity to study it would fail because the locus doesn't want to be understood and would prefer to die rather than have its secrets revealed.
        ```

          > The fact that better understanding of the precise mechanics of something a druid is trying to do is sometimes detrimental to them trying to do it intuitively doesn't imply that worse understanding equals infinite power. 

          I agree.

          Though my guess would be that the "detrimental understanding" thing is a feature of the magic itself, rather then something the locus is doing.
          ```

- u/sicutumbo:
  ```
  A solution to the magic system being not "magical" is to have rules, but not have those rules all known to the player. So the players can have their set of spells, but because they don't know everything about the magic system they can't rule out lots of potential spells or circumstances without learning more. Because I've read it recently, a good example is The Gods are Bastards. The author has said that his magic system is basically completely mechanical. But because no one in the setting, aside from the deities, really knows how the magic works sufficiently well, there are regular occurrences of things that the characters think should be impossible.

  You then have a system that still retains that hint of mystery and exploration, while not being completely arbitrary or plot driven.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    This is discussed explicitly in the chapter. The problem is that this is basically a delaying action, because anyone sane in such a setting eventually makes 'solving' the unknown rules a priority, because obviously they do.
    ```

    - u/Schpwuette:
      ```
      It took us a long time to get as far as we have on physics - maybe it's possible to (easily) generate magic systems that are Hard to solve?
      ```

    - u/derefr:
      ```
      Where this kind of druidic magic is one potential solution to that, yes? The magic "shies away from" rational observation, going so far as to cease to exist altogether when examined systematically enough.

      Another option is, to paraphrase Douglas Adams:

      > ...if ever anyone discovers exactly [how magic works], it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable.
      ```

      - u/696e6372656469626c65:
        ```
        Yeah, everyone here is pretty much ill-suited to druidic magic in exactly the same way Juniper is, but less self-aware about it. If you're told "poke this thing too much and it goes away", the correct response is *not* "let's see how much we can poke it before it goes away".
        ```

        - u/derefr:
          ```
          I don't see why not. As long as the DM is willing to keep coming up with new kinds of anti-aristotelean magic, a munchkining player could just treat them as guns with limited charges, where you "fire the gun" by learning enough about the given magic system to exploit it toward your ends (and in-so-doing prove to the DM that you now know enough about that system that it will then be taken away from you.) After "firing" the Foo magic system and having it disappear from the world, you then throw away your now-useless Foo MU, and roll up a new Bar MU to exploit the new Bar system.

          (I guess that also assumes that the DM will tolerate perfectly-healthy characters committing suicide for obviously-munchkining reasons. But it's kind of rational in-universe, insofar as these characters presumably spent their whole lives learning Foo and now, with Foo gone from the world, they suddenly have no other skills and no identity.)

          Heck, with a DM who really *likes* coming up with new magic systems, you could make this into a whole *thing*. A meta MU class who studies whatever the new magic system of the week is, then forgets all those rules to learn something else the next week—or, in other words, a **Fad Mage**. In that case, the DM doesn't even have to remove the magic from the game once it's found to be exploitable; one of the rules of Fad Magic can simply be that its practitioners are guaranteed to get bored once they've mastered something, and then forcefully blow away all the old knowledge to start over again with fresh excitement on something new. Every other (NPC) practitioner can keep on using the system.

          (Famous Fad Mages: Mega Man; Ash Ketchum.)
          ```

          - u/696e6372656469626c65:
            ```
            Is there any evidence that a new form of magic is starting to replace druidic magic?
            ```

            - u/derefr:
              ```
              Oh, no, I meant more, in the context of one's own tabletop session, which is what this subthread is talking about—how to Keep Magic Weird in one's own games.

              In the story's case, it's certainly not a good idea. The DM doesn't seem the forgiving type. And Joon can't "roll up a new character"—or even be guaranteed to get a replacement companion if he has all seven slots filled and then one dies.
              ```

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      Oh, must have missed that line. Anyway, just because it's possible in theory to discover all of the rules of the magic system doesn't mean the players will have the resources, time, or insight to do so. Uncovering that fire spells work much better if you can isolate them from outside humidity, for example, isn't that much of a priority when you're under siege from Orc hordes and you need to kill the Orc king.
      ```

      - u/nicholaslaux:
        ```
        It's more of a world building concept. Your team may not have the safety or time, but someone, somewhere, sometime probably did, so a believable realistic world with any sort of relatively accessible magic should have had someone do this already.
        ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Hence my use of the word "eventually." Yes, you can probably rely on the delay to last until the big, pressing threat is dealt with, and if you end the story there, the problem is, technically, solved. It's just a question of priorities.
        ```

    - u/serge_cell:
      ```
      Not if rules are evolving according to high complexity algorithm. Especially if any experiment, that is application of rules, causing rules to change. The time to even accumulate sufficient information (without actually processing it) may exeed game lifetime on many orders of magnitude.
      ```

- u/Kuratius:
  ```
  I assume the author knows that the author's current portrayal either makes druids:

  a)
  dumb 
  or  dangerously ignorant (explains why most of them got wiped out)

  c)

  extremely overpowered

  (No clear limits on complexity, even if the amount of energy were limited. You can trick druids into performing really complicated spells by sheer virtue of them not realizing that it's supposed to be complicated)

  I could see Queen-Administrator-level shenanigans that are even worse than Skitter at her most powerful. And that is only the beginning. 
  From my understanding, they could create  sentient plagues etc. ^(Blacklight^TM)

  d)

  the most immoral/insane (and possibly the most advanced) magic users in the setting?
  Because not being able to know something won't actually stop truly determined researchers, it just forces them to be more ruthless and strategic.
   It just slows the research down by a little if you have to kill or memory wipe your researchers every so often. 



  See the SCP wiki for the [antimemetics division](http://www.scp-wiki.net/antimemetics-division-hub) and its operation procedures. Take a look at [SCP-055](http://www.scp-wiki.net/we-need-to-talk-about-fifty-five) for what I would consider the hardest thing to research, but they're still researching it.

  They ARE not very nice because they deal with extinction-event-level antimemes.

  Everyone there is more or less insane, and I wouldn't be surprised if the only reason they still exist were that they have ensured their own existence through a causality paradox of some kind that prevents them from being wiped out or automatically erases information that would cause this.

  If that's how this druid operates, Juniper should be running away from them *yesterday*.
  For all we know the reason why she's the only druid left is that she used the other ones and their loci for experiments. Or maybe loci are the druid equivalent of Marion's memory eater.

  e)
  The most vulnerable magic users 

  Again, see antimemes.


  Even quantum mechanics is exploitable (performing extremely complex calculations), and that's literally the universe itself conspiring against you, not a magic entity that can be tricked into revealing its secrets by accident.



  Edit: Here's a scary thought:

  **This isn't the first time they've met a druid**, just the first time they remember....
  ```

  - u/Noumero:
    ```
    Why is there no explanation listed under b)... Oh, I get it, it's an antimemetics joke. We can't perceive it. Very funny. ^\*sigh\* *^(Okay, I'll go get my mnestics.)*

    In any case, we don't actually know that there's no limits on complexity. There may very well be, just hidden.

    Memory-wipe-guided research is an interesting idea, yes. Two druids would be enough for this: one who would develop the magic to erase memory and be kept from research, another who would be conducting research and repetitively have the memory of it erased by the first one.
    ```

    - u/Kuratius:
      ```
      There's probably a secret druid conspiracy, given that they would be stronger the less people know about them. They are the ones most likely to have the means and the motive for memory wipes.
      ```

      - u/Noumero:
        ```
        Counterargument: description of the quest ["Taking Root"](http://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/27832635) states that "The world has but a single druid, tending to but a single locus".

        Of course, if there *was* such a conspiracy, I would fully expect the DM to play along with it, not reveal it at the earliest opportunity. I suppose I have no evidence contrary to its existence, then.

        I do think game messages invalidate your speculations about the party meeting  Solace previously, though. Or the locust, at the very least. **Edit:** Wait, you've said "a druid", not "this druid", nevermind.
        ```

        - u/Kuratius:
          ```
          Possibly, yes. We'll see. If quest descriptions have to be true and achievable, that's another way to perform divinations falling into their lap.
          ```

  - u/InfernoVulpix:
    ```
    A combination of a) and e) sounds like the right answer, though a bit uncharitable.  The thing about c) is that we're given to believe not that a druid can do anything they haven't concluded they *can't* do, but that the more you know about druid powers the less potent (in terms of power, complexity, what have you) they are.  Unless we've been intentionally misled, all signs point to druids having concrete limits that merely constrict the more clearly you see them.

    I say a) and e) because the druids died out because they were fixed to unmoving loci so once they were found they couldn't run or hide, and also because their nature as unordered and natural meant they pathologically rejected any of the actions that could preserve them.  Being fixed in location makes them very vulnerable, hence e), and their unordered nature counts as stupidity or ignorance in an oblique way, hence a).
    ```

    - u/Kuratius:
      ```
      Remind me, what was b) again? I can't seem to remember....
      ```

- u/BlueSigil:
  ```
  "When I grow too old I perform the rite of Yaxukasu Axud, which allows me to be birthed again. I have lived for four hundred and eight years, across a number of bodies. The Lost King was before my time, sadly."

  My theory is that all the druids and Loci are waiting in the Hell's for the situation on the surface to improve, when things get better, they will preform this rite to be born again.

  Story continues to be amazing.
  ```

- u/valeskas:
  ```
  So, it is like, double self-insert. Probably-old self as DM, young self as MC.

  On an unrelated note,

  In ch. 43:

  >zombies to the unicorns, right?” asked Fenn

  z-word is probably a mistake.
  ```

  - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
    ```
    Er, right, will fix. We don't say the zed word.

    Edit: Fixed.

  >"Grak started it. Do you know what he said as soon as you left? He said, ‘Now we finally have a chance to speak freely’! His first joke!”

  >“I understand jokes,” said Grak. “It was not my first one.” He 
  looked at Fenn with a frown. “I regretted it immediately.”

  I'm really loving the humor in this story. I'm getting genuine laughs from a lot of the jokes here.

  >“Are you worried that I’ll let thoughts like that get in my way?”

  >“No,” I said. “The opposite.”

  And all the little characters moments are great too.

  ```
  >I’ve been the only druid left on Aerb for the last thirty years.

  So Solace waited 29 years before casting that Deep Search spell after it killed the previous caster? Assuming that the Deep Search is what killed the others.
  ```

  - u/GeeJo:
    ```
    Could take some time to regrow enough strength after reincarnation. Druids in Diapers would be a pretty adorable movie. 

    But I've got to say that, from an in-game perspective, it would be pretty horrific to essentially have your newborn infant possessed by a foreign consciousness.
    ```

  - u/InfernoVulpix:
    ```
    I mean, you *could* use it once a year, but unless you're meaningfully changing the search criteria you're likely to get the same answer every time.  It makes sense for Solace to wait a generation or two before trying again, to maximize the number of new potential helpers.
    ```

  - u/Agnoman:
    ```
    I assume there were other options being explored. I figure you don't use the magic that may kill you (and therefore the grove, if you're the last druid) except as an absolute last resort.

    It's even possible that Deep Search *was* being used to gather up low hanging fruit, by searching for things that  could certainly be found.
    ```

  - u/serge_cell:
    ```
    > Assuming that the Deep Search is what killed the others.

    I'm getting vibes that Solace somehow related to diminishing of druids population. I mean more then just encouraging Deep Searches
    ```
