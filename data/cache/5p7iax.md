- u/Radvic:
  ```
  Direct Pandora as she explores an original setting built off rational principles (with a few super powers thrown into the mix). Current player knowledge of the world is somewhat limited as Pandora is 18 months old.
  ```

- u/eaglejarl:
  ```
  PSA: Radvic has writing chops and a keen eye for analysis. I expect this to be fun.
