## Harry Juniper Potter-Evans-Smith (minor spoiler for Ch. 229 Worth the Candle)

### Post:

"Harry Juniper Potter-Evans-Smith. I would like to talk about the threat you made this morning", Dumbledore moved a hand through his beard as addressed the boy seated behind the desk. "You must understand that the safety of the students at Hogwarts is of paramount importance."

"I would like to talk about the bullying that happened last evening, *Professor*", there was a trace of venom in Harry's voice, "You must understand that the wellbeing of students is of paramount importance!"

"Indeed it is. But if you have any concerns, the proper way to raise an issue is to speak with a senior member of staff, who have both the authority and the experience necessary to address conflicts among the students. Vigilantism is unacceptable", the Headmaster looked at Harry with a stern expression before continuing, "And the wording of the threat is another point that concerns me."

"'Anybody that harasses a white student will face the full wrath of a Level 100 Multi-Mage'", HJ quoted himself with some satisfaction.

"I confess I am not completely fluent in the language of the youth these days, but I believe that last part to be a boast of magical strength", Dumbledore said.

"Sure", Harry decided to humour him.

"More importantly, may I ask why you chose to word your statement in a way that is meant to protect white students specifically?", the Headmaster wore a perplexed expression.

"Protecting any student is a worthwhile endeavour, wouldn't you agree?", Harry deflected.

"While I would stress, once again, that vigilantism cannot be the answer, I would of course agree that it is noble to be concerned about the welfare of your peers", Dumbledore chose his words carefully, "Still, I must come back to this point: why focus on white students? As someone who values rationality, or so I heard", he directed a meaningful look at someone behind and above the boy, even though nobody could be seen there, "would not a focus on one race at the expense of another betray a kind of irrational bias?"

It was at this point that Quirinus Quirrell burst into the room.

Dumbledore was the first to regain his composure, "Quirinus, to what do I owe the... pleasure?"

"I burst in because tensions are high", Quirrell said. "We need to air them. Better to do it now."

"Go ahead", Dumbledore said after a moment.

Quirrell spoke dispassionately, as though reading a receipt, "Harry knows why he focuses on protecting white students, which is that he personally finds it more shocking and horrible when bad things happen to white people than to black people. He recognizes this as being inherently unfair to *both* white people and black people, but his efforts to reframe his view of the world have so far failed, and in his opinion, so long as his actions don't reflect that bias too badly, he's *not going to worry about it*. There's some unresolved guilt there though. Harry's hatred of whites--"

"Hang on a minute!", Harry interjected.

"Let me finish", Quirrell snapped, "Harry's hatred of whites cuts both ways. He views blacks as being stronger and more self-reliant than whites. He trusts blacks more to be on their own."

"Can I have a moment to defend myself?", Harry asked.

"No, I will", Quirrell said. "Generally speaking, it doesn't cause problems. It's all a product of his West Country upbringing, he understands and acknowledges that. He's killed his share of whites, not letting their race stop him."

"What?!", Dumbledore displayed an uncharacteristically pained expression, "Harry, you always stress rationality, yet..."

"It's as good a defence as I would have given", Harry gave a nod of thanks to his mentor, "Professor Quirrell is right, as usual. Seeing white people hurt makes me uncomfortable in a way black people don't, and that's at a sub-intellectual level. I don't really agree that it's a hatred of whites, but there's probably some other, more appropriate word to use."

"There is one that comes to mind", Dumbledore said.

  i feel like this is trying to satirize juniper's misogyny but it's mostly just doing so by reframing it as racism and changing the setting to kinda-hpmor for some reason, without actually changing the content, which just sorta makes it confusing? i can only see this post making sense from the position that (from a doylist perspective) you're not supposed to think juniper has an actual problem in WtC?

    Thank you for thinking and sharing your thoughts.

    I had initially thought that the intended message of my little parody would be too obvious, to the point where some people would dislike it precisely because its self-evidence, but it seems that my judgement was wildly wrong.

    >i can only see this post making sense from the position that (from a doylist perspective) you're not supposed to think juniper has an actual problem in WtC?

    May I ask why you think this? If Reasonable!Dumbledore in this story is explicitly disappointed and "pained" after listening to Juniper!Harry and Valencia!Quirrel's essentially-WtC-canon arguments, how can you come to the conclusion that my message is that Juniper has no problem in WtC?

      Then why haven't you clarified it?

      Since the comment I'm replying to and quoting from, there's been another comment that also misunderstands your point, and instead of replying to that with an explanation, you posted more hints trying to get people to tease out the intended message, rather than just coming out and expressing the point you're trying to make.

      I get that you're trying to express your point in a way that you think is clever.  However, you've already acknowledged that you've failed at that, and we all know what [the failure mode of clever](https://whatever.scalzi.com/2010/06/16/the-failure-state-of-clever) is.

      Edit to add: To be clear, as I don't want my own cleverness to count against me, I'm not calling you an asshole.  What I'm saying is that however much better you think your point will be received due to your cleverness (if compared to the same point, plainly spoken), it will be received that much **worse** by people who fail to realize its cleverness.  And every time that you try to resort to cleverness rather than clarity to try to explain your point, you're only going to make your problem that much worse.

      No, no, I mean that my interpretation of your message is that the *author of WtC* thinks that Juniper has no problem.
      ```

  I was confused too, and here is why:

  JS comes from a world where on average there is an asymetry in power between men and women. The women get the short end of the stick, so JS (a man) subconsciously sees women as 'more important to protect'. 

  HJPEV comes from a world where on average there is an asymetry in power between white people and black people. The black people get the short end of the stick, so HJPEV (a white person) subconsciously sees...white people as 'more important to protect'?

  That is where my brain goes 'what?'

  I admit that my first uncharitable assumption was that the author was trying to misrepresent what was shown in WtC, and send a weird anti-antisexism message.

  I hope it helps.

  So what's the intended message? Is it that Juniper has anti-men attitudes, but that the author/readers/other characters twist this to mean that he's anti women?
  ```

  I see what you're trying to do but it doesn't really work. I guess because racism is fundamentally different from misogyny, specifically in a way that's highlighted here.

  In the real world, racism that consists of only protecting whites (pretty much THE racism that exists) is racism in favour of whites, white pride or whatever, which is disgusting. So this idea elicits a strong emotional response, at least from me. But somehow, in your parody, this is racism AGAINST whites. It's weird.


  Also, I don't remember the original text, but Harry Juniper's actions are definitely being strongly affected by his "racism" here.

  People are really obsessed with this stuff, huh?
  ```

  - u/Puzzleheaded_Buy804:
    ```
    With power, protection, domination etc? Well yes. As far as a can tell, the rare people that are not 'obsessed' with it are those that already have it in spades.

    It would make sense that inequality would be harder to not-see or not-care-about when you suffer from it personally, no?

      I could say something like "I'm sure starving kids in North Korea are thankful the brave autistic neckbeards and sex weirdos of this internet thread are debating the putative 'misoginy' of the main character of a nerd web fantasy", but that would be disingenuous.
      ```

      - u/Puzzleheaded_Buy804:
        ```
        Yes, and also a nice ad personam + ad hominem + whataboutism combo fallacy.

        Aren't you glad you didn't say something like that on a rational thread?
        ```
