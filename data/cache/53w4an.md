## [Challenge Companion] Memory Modification

### Post:

**tl;dr: This is the companion thread to the weekly challenge, post recommendations, ideas, or comments below.**

Memory modification is a pretty big topic. There are a lot of works of fiction which take some small aspect of being able to change a person's memory, because it's a really convenient conceit. Amnesia, [which we've done previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3rk5kv/biweekly_challenge_amnesia/) is a subset of memory modification which gets used all over the place in order to maintain the status quo.

Here are different threads you might want to go pulling:

* Adding in procedural knowledge and declarative knowledge, AKA "I know kung fu". Primary examples that come to mind would be *The Matrix* and *Dollhouse*.

* Taking out memories. [See the previous challenge companion](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3rk7ny/challenge_companion_amnesia/). If you want to do a rehash of amensia for this challenge, that's totally acceptable.

* Altering memories. *Harry Potter* is probably the primary example I'd go with, but it's an incidental detail of the setting rather than core to the premise. *Total Recall* is probably a better example (as is the *Rick and Morty* episode "Total Rickall").

One of the challenges with memory alteration is that the *audience* doesn't have their memory altered, which means that you have to either start past the point of memory modification and put the reader in the same position of finding out the truth (as happens very often with amnesia tropes), or set up dramatic tension where the audience knows something that the protagonist does not. Memory modification can allow for some fun narrative structures in that regard (though this obviously doesn't apply to purposely implanting memories that the protagonist knows aren't real).

  I've had the idea kicking in my head for a while now of a Gilderoy Lockheart who absorbs people's memories and personalities when interviewing them, who stops being a fame obsessed individual and starts to be a collective embodying all the most successful unknown heroes of the past hundred years. Competent Lockheart stories seem fun with a lot of potential, to me. Most authors I've read who've attempted it have been weird, but the premise is solid. Need to think of a way to derail canon somehow, of course.

  It's always seemed to me that you can use the False Memory Charm in Harry Potter to get around the limitations on Time Turners.  There's already acausal bootstrap paradox going on all the time with Time Turners, so why not just get someone to FMC your past self into remembering what you remember, thereby freeing you from the reality of any events you hated by making them bootstrapped magical delusions?

  Also, Total Rickall is my favorite episode of Rick And Morty.  Great premise implemented very well.

  I've [mentioned this](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/26wgfe/d_the_sixth_day/) before, but the guilty pleasure Arnold Schwarzenegger movie *The 6th Day* contains a *really, really* overlooked technology. The movie is about clones, and to a lesser extent personal identity and the concept of self, but beyond the physical technology of cloning a person, they also have the technology to grab a person's entire brainstate with a flash of light to the eyes, which can then be stored on a hard drive the size of a sandwich. Worse, the memories can be played back like a video. Leaving aside all the technical problems there (MEMORY DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY, GOODNIGHT!), it strikes me as an awesomely powerful technology that's basically used for a tiny sliver of what it should be.

  I don't know how to turn that into rational fiction. Maybe you could justify keeping the technology secret because stealing memories from people is enormously useful if they don't know those memories are being stolen. That implies a plot where the protagonist's entire memory file has been stolen and is being used against them, which might be fun. ("Keeping the technology secret" is a tall ask though, simply because of how many precursor technologies are necessary.)

    Maybe you could do a Twilight Zone-esque story that's just about living in a world where this technology exists. The only thing I can compare it to is the Black Mirror episode, An Entire History of You, my least favorite episode of the otherwise brilliant series. The first few minutes show off some interesting ideas like having your memories scanned by airport security and even a lawsuit where someone would use their memories as evidence that their parents didn't give them enough attention growing up. Why couldn't that have been the plot?

    Sadly, the rest of the episode is about some asshole fighting with his wife and suspecting her of having an affair, which was boring and didn't have a coherent theme. There were still some cool details, though, like parents watching their child's memories when they come home or couples reliving past erotic memories when they were angry or unsatisfied with each other. 

    The only other thing I can think of to add to this discussion is the question of whether having your memories used as evidence in a trial would be considered a form of self incrimination, and therefore protected under the Constitution. That would certainly make for an interesting debate as to the purpose of the legal system, does objective fact outweigh someone's rights?
