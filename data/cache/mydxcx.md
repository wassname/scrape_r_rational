  Not sure why you chose this subreddit.

  Edit: just skimmed a few sentences and I feel like you've already succeeded. Please stop.

  I hate to say it, but this doesn't read like a parody. This literally reads like a bog-standard xianxia novel, where everything is already described as being extreme, astounding, the most, the greatest, etc.

  You can't parody something like that. To quote Seinfeld (I'm going by memory here), "It would be like making fun of a clown. What, are you gonna make fun of their big nose, their floppy shoes? It just doesn't work."

    I feel like what's twigging it as a parody for me is the sheer dryness of the prose. Things are described as the super awesome bestest, but like, in a flat way that emphasises how stupid the description is.

    ...I feel like it would be really funny to have a text to speech program read it in a flat monotone, actually.

    (EDIT: Oh the other main thing is using very flat descriptions in most of the narration and the usual metaphors falling on their face next to that)

  At this point I feel like we need a parody of xianxia parodies

  Aw, this got deleted. It was fun while it lasted.
