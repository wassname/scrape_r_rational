  Man, Rain's build is only mildly useful with Tallheart's broken ass gear.
  ```

  - u/PDNeznor:
    ```
    Tallheart was the true mvp of the battle and he didn't even know it happened. Honestly, the shit crafters can make in this series can get pretty busted.
    ```

    - u/Watchful1:
      ```
      Isn't Tallheart like way higher level than Rain though? It's not surprising he can make gear that's powerful for Rain's level.
      ```

      - u/PDNeznor:
        ```
        Yeah, he's like lvl 33 or something. Even still, his handiwork caught Velika's attention, so it seems like levels matter a little less for crafters than skillfulness does.
        ```

        - u/Izeinwinter:
          ```
          Worse. I suspect Tallheart is literally the highest level crafter alive. Because nobody else takes crafters on dives into the deeps.
          ```

          - u/RUGDelverOP:
            ```
            I'd be very surprised if there wasn't at least one super high level crafter in the Empire as a gear slave.
            ```

          - u/InfernoVulpix:
            ```
            I doubt it's that bad, because places like the City of Lights exist, and IIRC you can get Guild people to help raise your level with enough money.

            I think it's more that crafters are valued above their rank, with a Silver crafter being rare enough that the only ones with a shot of buying their products are goldplates, and Silvers having to buy stuff from Bronze crafters, and Bronzeplates only being able to pick up the scraps.

            So Tallheart's gear would be *level-appropriate* for a Silver, but in the current state of the world are fit for a Gold.
            ```

            - u/zorianteron:
              ```
              And because of the atomised, feudal, might-makes-right societal situation, being a crafter is taking on relatively high risks to yourself.  You're forgoing personal power for in return for making yourself an attractive slave, who can be chained to an anvil and pump out gear till you drop dead.  So crafters are rare in part because nobody wants to be one.

              (Add in that the lone-wolf mentality and lack of efficient parties means it's even harder to raise your cap as a crafter.)
              ```

              - u/InfernoVulpix:
                ```
                I'm somewhat skeptical that 'slave' is the common outcome to high-level crafters.  'Patron' seems more likely, as in the crafter reaching an agreement with some Goldplate to settle down in their domain and make what they want, in exchange for protection and a comfortable life.  After all, a high-level crafter is a goose laying golden eggs, and keeping them happy with their arrangement means they don't cheap out on your gear or try to escape to a rival or something.

                Sure, a clueless crafter without a support network who happens across a merciless Gold might just get fully enslaved, but I figure most crafters would angle to either find a patron or join a group like the Guild who'll stick up for them if push comes to shove.
                ```

                - u/zorianteron:
                  ```
                  Sure, I was being hyperbolic.  But it's still a path that relies on the surrounding culture being healthy for success, and people in this world don't seem to feel that way, generally.
                  ```

                - u/eaglejarl:
                  ```
                  Seems like a very bad idea to enslave someone like Tallheart.  They're making the gear that your life will depend on, so what's to stop them from building in something with a vulnerability -- maybe when they say a command word your armor shrinks to doll size and crushes you.  

                  And that's leaving aside the whole "in a cave with a box of scraps" potential, where they simply make gear for themselves while you aren't looking and murderize their way out.

                  Definitely a good idea for a Gold to hire a high-level crafter but absolutely vital that they be happy to work for you and not feel taken advantage of, enslaved, or threatened.

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    Really highlights how badly people need to start focusing on actual party builds and their crafters instead of everyone going edgy-lone-wolf damage dealers all the time.
    ```

    - u/Izeinwinter:
      ```
      Tallheart and his wife were likely able to level as high as they did simply because they were a combat and crafter duo.
      ```

      - u/LazarusRises:
        ```
        Teamwork makes the deer dream work.
        ```

  - u/zorianteron:
    ```
    There's a reason everyone says dynamos are weak: they are, at least at level 18.

    It just turns out the folk wisdom is basically right, here.
    ```

- u/kurtofconspiracy:
  ```
  Urgh. I know Rain has the means to generate plentiful XP, but it still hurts to see him have an epic battle and gain nothing.
  ```

  - u/ZorbaTHut:
    ```
    Worse, all that XP stolen from his teammembers and burned :(

    I hope at some point he finds an XP equivalent to the Essence Well aura. Things could get *crazy*.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      >I hope at some point he finds an XP equivalent to the Essence Well aura. Things could get crazy.

      He'd still be constrained by the Blue supply.
      ```

      - u/ZorbaTHut:
        ```
        True, but it'd be a much *much* weaker constraint - he'd basically be able to level-cap anyone at a reasonable level in days. Val, for example, is probably not at level cap right now, and boy would it be nice if he was.
        ```

- u/Revlar:
  ```
  I wish Rain had never learned to talk, because his meme-spouting drags me out of the story every time.
  ```

- u/Watchful1:
  ```
  Now that's what I call some action. Maybe now he'll get his ass in gear and figure out the soul stuff.
  ```

  - u/ZorbaTHut:
    ```
    Yeah, I'm not sure he's going to survive another night of this - he needs, what, a million mana to repair his armor? Assuming I've got the numbers right, he can self-generate about 18MP/s, which means about 16 hours straight of jamming mana into his armor . . .

    . . . which is *possible*, but isn't going to be comfortable, and precludes giving mana to anyone else, and makes it somewhat difficult to sleep, and I feel like bad things might happen if he burns through literally a million mana in a single day.

    And it's not like the rest of his team can heal up as fast as he can.

    So, yeah, the timer's ticking here.

    (Numbers may be wrong.)
    ```

    - u/Watchful1:
      ```
      I'm not that worried about surviving. Presumably now that it's light out the city will get itself in order and get torches set up better so that at least big monsters can't spawn inside the walls.
      ```

- u/PDNeznor:
  ```
  Woo! Go Wolf! Kick its ass!

  My god razorclaws are terrifying, if this is what we can expect from a fully powered Musk Wolf then whoever summoned Rain gave him the biggest set of training wheels it could find.
  ```

- u/wadledo:
  ```
  Huh, I wonder if he will discover a skill that lets him ignore his own effects?
  ```

  - u/natron88:
    ```
    Fire resistance aura and the skill that lets him use two auras at once. He can get that with two level ups.
    ```

    - u/IncendiaVeneficus:
      ```
      If Rain takes Prismatic Intent before he gets his specializations I don't believe he will have the points to unlock all 5 specializations.
      ```
