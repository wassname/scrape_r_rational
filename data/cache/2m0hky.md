## [Q] Seeking a Wise Reader

### Post:

EDIT:  Thank you everyone!  The position is now filled (multiple times!) by some of your lovely folks.
------

As y'all probably know, the Kickstarter for "Pay Attention" hit not one but *two* stretch goals.  For each of these stretch goals, I am writing a rational story (one horror, one fantasy) of at least 10,000 words.

The first one is done; it's 15,000 words of rational horror entitled "Baby Blues."  I have sent out notices to all backers that the ARC is available, and I've done enough touch-ups on it that I'm generally happy.  Before I sign off on it completely, however, I'd like someone to do a Wise Reading(*) for me.  If you're interested I'll send you a download link for it (it's in HTML).

Any takers?  


(*) Wise Reading = read, take notes as you go about your reactions to various parts.  When you finish, send me your notes along with any further comments you have.  Copyedits are welcome but not expected.

I can be reached at david.storrs@gmail.com

PLEASE NO UNTAGGED SPOILERS IN COMMENTS.
