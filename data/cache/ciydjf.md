  I'm not really sure if it can be called "rational". It provides an examination of Scars goals and motives, so at least one feature is there.

  This is my first submission here. Any feedback is welcome.

    My only critique of the story from a "rational" point of view is that it doesn't quite make the case for why public opinion is so important to ruling the kingdom.

    Assuming that Mufasa would have been willing to make the same hard choices that Scar made, then why would it be such a bad thing for the people to temporarily hate Mufasa until the drought was over?

    The best answers I can think of is that long periods of discontent might lead to some unqualified ruler attempting to overthrow Mufasa instead of someone who could see the bigger picture like Scar. In which case, the lions would be doomed long term. 

    Or alternatively, the Lions no longer trust Mufasa, but don't want to go through the trouble of overthrowing him. So they find ways to subvert and disobey his orders whenever they can get away with it. Basically leading to the same results of dooming the lions in the long run, because their uncoordinated/careless actions break the circle of life. Though if we are to assume that Scar was able to prevent this from happening, there's no reason to say that Mufasa wouldn't have been able to do the same.

    On a related note, why didn't either Scar or Mufasa try and educate the population so that they would understand the reason they needed to make the hard choices they were making? Mufasa explaining why they were going through hard times would make it less likely for the people to rise up in discontent.

    In short, I like the idea that Scar was willing to make unpopular choices when the lions were in a lose-lose situation. But I'm not completely sold on the justification that Mufasa needed to die in order for those hard decisions to be made. There are some potential justifications, but they weren't really presented in the story.

    Edit: I did enjoy the story btw. Not sure if that got through in my ramblings here.

      Interesting point. I'm considering to sneak in some history lesson like "Remember your grand-grand-grand-father Uwazi?" or "Remember how the first lion become king of the Pridelands?".

      In my mind Mufasa was in denial about the draught. Rafiki and Scar decided that immediate action was necessary. I see that this does not come through in the story.

  Good premise and idea, but introduced a bit clumsily, maybe too quickly. I think the core concept here is very strong, and there are only execution issues. 

  It's hard to believe Simba would be so patient. 

  It might help if someone else could give credibility to Scar's testimony, or if Simba made some direct assumption that Scar could rhetorically flip on him. Then it'd be more sympathetic that Simba might be stunned into passivity.

  Also, why did Rafiki deceive Simba? It might be good for Scar to indicate Rafiki isn't trustworthy before moving into his overall pitch. "Rafiki is the one truly responsible for your father's death" or something similar might have suitable impact.

  I'd like to know Simba's reaction to this. Does he forgive and exile Scar, or refuse to acknowledge the truth and denounce him as a liar, or something else?

  Finally, it'd be cool if you could somehow work in some ambiguity about whether or not this is all a lie that Scar thought up on the spot.

    Thank you. Good ideas. A little bit more back and forth might also provide the opportunity to some action. The story is practically only dialog.
