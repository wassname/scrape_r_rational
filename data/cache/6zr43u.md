## [Monthly Book Club] Perpetual Book Suggestion Thread (September 2017 - December 2017)

### Post:

So, I've decided I'm going to commit to running the book club for the rest of the calendar year and then we can decide whether to continue based off interest / personal motivation / motivation of others to assist in curation.

Because the first book suggestion thread got so many comments, and a reddit thread can be commented on for 6 months, I've decided to try a "perpetual book suggestion thread". Suggest the book you want to... suggest in the comments. For 2017, I (MagicWeasel) will be the czar of book selection (unless overthrown) and will try to do so fairly (feedback welcome in meta sub thread of this post). So don't worry about upvotes/downvotes: if you have an opinion about a book (for or against), reply to the suggestion with your reasons - that would be very helpful for choosing books I haven't already read.

Anyway, here's the [past suggestion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6y53xc/monthly_book_club_september_2017_book_friendship/) (feel free to copy past book suggestions over, though I'll probably use it anyway if nothing strikes my fancy in this thread).

Here's the format to post your own suggestions:

    **Title**: 
    
    **Ebook cost**: 
    
    **Word count**: 
    
    **Genre**: 
    
    **Synopsis**:  
    
    **Reasons /r/rational would like it**:
    
    **Content warnings**: 

Check out the past thread (linked above) if you need further explanation for how to format it.

  Copied over from the previous suggestion thread. It currently holds the largest amount of upvotes in that thread, yet was not chosen. Sic Semper Tyrannis!

  **Title**: Cordyceps by Benedict_SC

  **Ebook cost**: [free on ao3](https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868) (the Download button is at the right side of the page)

  **Word count**: 64k

  **Genre**: Sci-fi, Irrationalfic

  **Synopsis**: An unnamed main character wakes up with amnesia, in a strange hospital they do not recognise. As they attempt to figure out how they got there, the mystery they face soon becomes far stranger than expected.

  **Why r/rational would like it**: On a first glance, it conforms to the rules of rationalfic; characters take their time to figure things out and act according to their motivations to solve a mystery placed in a world with coherent rules. In some ways, it's also a clever whodunnit; an astute reader will figure out what is happening before the characters do.

  That is what the work looks like on the surface, but soon enough, it becomes obvious that the work is an irrationalfic, in which rational thought is not the optimal route. I found this to be very interesting and would love to discuss both this work and the genre in general with this sub.

  Also, the work is of course well-written.

  **No content warnings.**

    I don't agree with the characterization of irrationalityfic.

    There's a solution to the central problem (that doesn't require irrational action) it is just something none of the characters considered.

    The designated rational character isn't.

  **Title**: Anna Karenina

  **Ebook cost:** Free. [You can read and/or download it here.](https://archive.org/stream/annakarenina11tols?ref=ol#page/n7/mode/2up) It's not the best translation, but it's easily accessible, which is convenient.

  EDIT: [Here's a less attractive version](http://www.planetpdf.com/planetpdf/pdfs/free_ebooks/Anna_Karenina_NT.pdf), but it's the full text, whereas the link above is not. I'm partial to the first one's introduction though, and it also has illustrations.

  **Word count:** ~350,000

  **Genre:** Literary Realism

  **Synopsis:** (From Wikipedia) Anna Karenina is the tragic story of a married aristocrat/socialite and her affair with the affluent Count Vronsky. The story starts when she arrives in the midst of a family broken up by her brother's unbridled womanizing - something that prefigures her own later situation, though she would experience less tolerance by others.

  The novel explores a diverse range of topics throughout its approximately one thousand pages. Some of these topics include an evaluation of the feudal system that existed in Russia at the time - politics, not only in the Russian government but also at the level of the individual characters and families, religion, morality, gender and social class.

  **Why /r/rational would like it:** It's Tolstoy. It's just one of those books that you really ought to read at some point in your life.
  ```

  - u/himself_v:
    ```
    It should really have been named "Konstantin Levin"! More than half of the book is his mostly unrelated soul searching. And that's the main storyline of the two. Karenina's one is just there to liven things up and maybe serve as a counterexample or something.
    ```

    - u/Iconochasm:
      ```
      I read the book in one time pressure fueled night (with a report due the next day).  All I recall of the last several hundred pages was summing it up as "Levin thinks about farming".

    Very thoughtful of you to create a meta thread.    
    I have a few suggestions regarding the format.

    >Ebook cost

    Perhaps "Availability" would be better: some books are free, and "$0.00" or "Ebook cost: Free" look rather silly, or even misleading.

    Unless it's an attempt at subtle manipulation to discourage people from submitting books that aren't available on the Internet, in which case sure, leave it at that.

    >Why /r/rational would like it

    "Reasons /r/rational would like it" would sound more formal.

    >Any content warnings

    Is "any" necessary? With it dropped, the phrasing would be more formal.

    (I also have a penchant for being annoyingly pedantic about some things.)
    ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      RE cost: one of the "conditions" is that the ebook is available, just because it's not feasible for someone to locate and read a book within a month, whereas ebooks are available immediately after purchase. Whether "has to have an ebook" is a good condition is worth discussing probably at the end of the "trial".  I hope it doesn't discourage people from suggesting fiction that is available online for free, though!

      I've made the other wording suggestions though! Thank you for making them  :)

    Is it possible to have this thread autosort to newest instead of best?

      Yes. Contact one of the moderators for it.

    Seeing as this isn't getting much traffic, perhaps you should put the link to it at the beginning of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6zr8cx/monthly_book_club_september_2017_book_discussion/) post instead of the end, preferably in **bold**,
    ###***ENORMOUS, [ENORMOUSLY BLUE!!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6zr8cx)***
    ...letters? To increase visibility.

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      Great idea! Thank you.
      ```

      - u/Noumero:
        ```
        ... Also fix the "SUGESTIONS" typo.

        In fact, perhaps it would be better to have a large link and an explanation below, instead of relatively long string of large text? I think the following form maximizes attention-grabbing, though it's my very subjective opinion.

    It might just be me but it seems a bit confusing the way it's arranged right now... Is there any way we could do it more like the biweekly challenge, where there's a stickied "Monthly Book Club: Friendship Is Optimal" thread which has ongoing discussion about the current book in the comments but specifies that Foucault's Pendulum will be the next book, w/ discussion starting Nov 1 (or w/e the date is..)

    It could also have a link to this thread, but to me at least it'd much more convenient and encourage more book discussion to have the actual discussion stickied rather than this meta thread.

    And thanks for organising it!
    ```

    - u/Noumero:
      ```
      That's how it was until very recently, yes. I don't know by which agency Perpetual Book Suggestions were sticked in place of the current discussion thread, but it's not how it initially was. u/MagicWeasel, any comments?

  If you haven't read any of Christopher Nutall's "Schooled in Magic" series, go read it. I am fairly certain that most people on this sub would probably like it a lot. It is my favorite novel series, even more so than HPMOR. Yes it really is that good. The first book in the series only costs $1 as an ebook and there's an audio version too.

  I suggested this here before, but iirc a bunch of people who had read the crappy space battles version of the first book jumped on to warn everyone (falsely I might add) that the SiM series sucks and they basically said it was my guilty pleasure or something, and when I tried to explain that the paid version of the series is actually REALLY good no one seemed to believe me and were all like, "I don't want to waste my money too risky" even though it's on Amazon and they should already have known they could try a free sample of the beginning of the book.

  Seriously, go read it! :D

        Most people didn't even read the free sample last time because iirc I didn't link it. Now could you please explain to me what exactly makes the sample read like bad fanfiction? I just took another look at it to try to see what you are talking about and I still don't understand how you could say that it is bad writing. I honestly do not believe that the whole sub besides myself would consider the SiM series that bad unless they were looking at the space battles version. It would be one thing if everyone was saying that it's not their cup of tea, but for basically everyone here who comments on it to say it's trash and that the writing quality is awful? I call bullshit. There is no way any sane person would look at SiM and say that it's as poorly written as bad fanfiction. So either you're crazy, or I'm crazy, or you are lying about having read the sample, or you're exaggerating about how badly written you thought it was. I know it's normally considered bad faith to say that, but sometimes there really is no other explanation that makes any sense.

        **Edit: I just looked over the sample more carefully. It's not bad but it's not good either. It's been a long time since I read the beginning of the first book, and I forgot that it wasnt as good. Sorry for the stupid crap I said.**

  Any thoughts on Robert Heinlein's "Gulf"? Only a novella, and old, but it has some good points.

  Title: Gulf

  Ebook cost: Free, http://www.baen.com/Chapters/9781451637854B/9781451637854B___2.htm

  Word count: 26100

  Genre: Speculative fiction

  Synopsis: A super-spy discovers a secretive race of "supermen" working behind the scenes to benefit humanity.

  Reasons /r/rational would like it: Interesting take on [writing smart characters](http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/55148880135/how-smart-is-smart). Doesn't check all the boxes, but does put some thought into it.

  Content warnings: Gruesome murder of NPC (writing is not heavy on the grue though).
