  I feel like this quote from the Vol 4 epilogue is of interest to this sub, (from one of the players monologuing to a minion):

  “In the bardic epics, fairy tales, even the modern chapbooks and comics, enemies never talk to each other—at least, not openly. And now I find myself greatly threatened because so many of my opponents have simply had conversations, like adults. Foolish of me, unforgivably foolish.”
  ```

    While the story does enjoy subverting some standard narrative tropes I found this quote a) too on the nose and b) not consistent behaviour with the character quoted who is a ‘behind the scenes master planner/schemer’ who has somehow elevated himself to a position of great power without realising that people in his world do not function like narrative cliches. 

    It feels like, in order to highlight how most characters in the story are not holding the idiot ball that the author has a character act as if people *do* hold the idiot ball, then be surprised when they in fact do not, which really is just its own form of the idiot ball.

  Can I ask why no one was posting updates of this story? I've always felt that it's pretty rational, with well fleshed out characters, logical plot and awesome world-building. Is it just that no one here has read it?

    >Can I ask why no one was posting updates of this story?

    I can hazard some guesses. FWIW I'm a big fan of the series, but I also know that some parts of it rub people the wrong way.

    * The plot isn't purely rational. In fact, the biggest complaint I've heard about the story is that every character has plot armor. It's like the anti-Game of Thrones... if you have a favorite character, odds are they'll survive no matter what. After 13 books, the number of characters who have actually died can probably be counted on one hand... and none of them were "main" characters. Heck, or even secondary characters. This was actually addressed as a plot point in a recent book, where [Spoiler](#s "Justinian reveals that all the characters are caught in his web and are fated to survive until a specific time"). But the result is that the stakes never feel that high because the characters aren't in actual mortal peril. They survive purely because the plot requires it.

    * Parallel to that last point, the cast is HUGE after 13 books and no deaths. With eight primary characters in the freshman class (plus Tellwyrn herself), that's already a big cast. Then you get Darling, his apprentices, and then his group. And then the gods. And then Justinian's villain group AND his underlings. And all of the Unseen University students and staff. And then Basra's group. And then Trissiny's spin-off group. And then all the other families/friends/various oddballs. It makes for great world-building, but it also makes the story *very* long and somewhat rambling (DD Webb has acknowledged this in his comments, and plans to streamline his future books more). It also makes it tough to take a break and come back later, because you likely won't remember who some characters were when they were mentioned several books ago and not since.

    * Outside of the non-rational plot and the length, the main complaint I've seen is about artistic choice. Namely, the author seems A) Very progressive in his social views, and B) Very much like an otaku. Neither of these bug me much; heck, I like having a diverse cast of characters and find the tension between Avenist and Shaathist philosophies super interesting; but I've read people complain that it feels like "an agenda" is being pushed at them. The otaku part is more a personal complaint from the the last few books as more of the Old Gods' pasts were revealed and Siif was brought into play. But having characters suddenly break into Japanese, or discuss how the Old Gods loved Cowboy Bebop and World of Warcraft, just kinda breaks the immersion. I like the references, but cringe a bit too.

    It's still a really good series. But when I've seen it recommended here before, there are usually people who complain about the things I wrote above.
    ```

      ```
      My single biggest problem with this story is how what we are informed of the characters by the narrative is completely at odds with how the actual characters act. That is, we are told by the story Trissiny is rash and hot-headed but good at fighting... but then she never is in the actual story.

      I'm just going to quote from a [Spacebattles Thread on the story](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/d-d-webbs-the-gods-are-bastards.535450/) rather than rewriting this specific criticism's examples myself. This contains **a bunch of spoilers for the story**:

      >The biggest problem with the story is that what we're told is completely at odds with what we're shown, for basically every character in every scene.

      >Tellwyrn is talked up as being super powerful, unstoppable, and someone you can't reason with. Someone who might kill you as soon as look at you, and who could totally get away with it even if she did. She's a natural disaster, a Z-20, etc. etc. etc.

      >But despite all that talk? She never once actually does anything meaningful to the plot with that power. She can manifestly teleport people to alternate planes of reality, orbit, or anywhere in between. Instead, she gets taunted at by the various in-story villains, and just... puts up with it. For no discernible reason.

      >At one point in section 12 she even comments how she can't kill one of the villains because, oh no, she'd get in trouble with the empire. The same empire that- in previous chapters- was repeatedly said to have a policy of 'let her do anything she wants, because we can't stop her'.

      >Similarly, Trissiny is supposedly an awesome warrior, champion of the goddess of war, etc. etc. and is constantly being harped at about flying off the handle and using force instead of reason.
      Except, she doesn't do that. She has a very real tendency to lose plot-relevant fights. She has (very nearly) never killed any sentient foes, possibly excepting the centaurs in the very first portion of the story- but that was done off-screen.

      >She has caused a mook to die by being clever at them- but that was in turn, used to set up a scene where she tries it on one of the actual villains, and the trick doesn't work. In short, Trissiny is shown to be caring, second-guesses herself frequently, and is extremely loathe to engage in fights which she seldom wins if her winning those fights would inconvenience the villains of the piece.

      >But despite that, everyone on the story is constantly lambasting her for being too quick to use violence and brute force. The Trissiny-centric chapter 11 is cringingly bad as far as that goes, as neither her attempts to be clever nor her attempts to fight pan out, resulting in her being shown up as entirely useless at everything forever.

      >Teal is a bard. A bard that never plays music, tells stories, nor generally engages in bardic activities on screen. She did, twice, in the dungeon crawl. Doing so got her smashed with a rock, the first time. It worked the second time she did it. She's never done so again on screen. Great bard, she is. But, uh, they say she's really into that stuff, honest. She's in the music program!

      >Poor Gabe Arquin's already been discussed.

      >>I think the most blatant of this is probably Gabriel's characterization - the text keeps on insisting he is supposedly smart or book-smart or intelligent or something, but that characteristic is completely at odds with both his actions and words and most of the time everyone else spends time teaching him basic stuff he should probably know already, and he never seems to be the guy coming up with intelligent insights into anything important.

      >His buddy Toby is just, ugh. He's one militant sonofabitch for someone who supposedly serves a god of peace. All he tends to do is just be judgemental at people. The way Trissiny is supposedly being? Toby's actually doing that, but is almost never called out on it- and when he is, he doesn't do anything different.

      >Juniper, oh god. She had some character development! Juniper, supposedly the Only Sane Dryad, or anyway the only dryad that's been out in the world to learn more, to grow, to see others as people? Yeah, no. By the time we get to segment 12, there's at least five others. Considering there were supposedly like no more than double digit dryads in all of the world, in the beginning of the story? It really devalues Juniper as a character, and makes you go "but author, y u lie to us?"

      >And, of course, the drow priestess darling Shaeine. I think I misspelled that. Anyway. She's talked up early on as having a really different culture. It comes up a few times, in the very early work. But then after some point it just... stops. And she's just this normal kid. She winds up being the shield bot slash heal-dispenser. For one of the supposedly smarter characters, who is more cleric than diplomat, she doesn't really seem to do much of anything related to her goddess. She explicitly calls for judgement once, because Juniper asked her to do so, and... that's it.

      >Blah.

      >And, of course, the constant drubbing about how brute force takes second place to cleverness. Except, brute force works pretty darn well for the guys that use it, on the rare occasions they do so, and 'cleverness' seems to be summed up by the bad guys having a copy of the script. Pretty much any time the protagonists attempt to sneak around and plan for things, it doesn't work out in their favor.

      >And I guess the biggest telling-different-than-showing is, of course, the revelations previously mentioned, because dude, just... don't. Anne McCaffery you are not, and it didn't work very well for her when she did it either.
      ```

        I can try and elaborate later if you wish, but the main thing I want to mention is that this is at least partly a coming of age/school series. What we were told about the characters at first was meant to change. Especially in the case of Trissiny and Shaeine, what you see as a mismatch between what were told of the characters and how they actually act, I see as character development. 

        Trissiny for example *was* quite reckless and hot headed. From attacking Gabriel for being half demon, to attempting to stand against a hellgate alone and solo a demonic version of a dragon. Perhaps more than recklessness in combat, her largest problem has been recklessness in thought and words (remember the arc in what was essentially the drow ghetto?) 

        As for Tellwyrn, her careless use of power is *exactly* what caused the whole issue with the rouge Hand that was central to this most recent book. Which she was rightfully chewed out by the Empress for. She's also done a number of really badass thing's on screen. 

        Shaeine *DID* act quite alien at first, and that has fallen gradually by the wayside. However that's her entire reason to be at Last Rock. She was raised to be a diplomat and then immersed herself in another culture to learn their ways. I'd be far more concerned about the story if she was still acting alien. 

        Someone mentioned Ruda, but she has indeed demonstrated her leadership ability and competence multiple times. Off the top of my head the first example I can think of is her performance in Sarasio. 

        I could defend Toby too, he very much serves as the team mom and helps provide emotional support to his classmates. He also played a much bigger role this arc than in the past. I will, however, agree that he and Teal are the weakest of the main cast.
        ```

      - u/sparkc:
        ```
        This is spot on and doesn’t even mention Ruda who we’re told only seems like a loud mouthed idiot on the surface except she does nothing to actually disabuse us of this notion. Perhaps that’s why Frost has been my favourite of the group; she’s not an especially complex character but she behaves consistently and in line with what we’re told in story.

        I do believe the author has the writing chops to pull off the character subversion and growth that he was attempting but he’s forever adding additional extraneous characters and trying to reign in this unwieldy sprawling plot at the same time.
        ```

        - u/AurelianoTampa:
          ```
          Agreed. Well, Ruda does have *some* moments of strategy, like in that bar fight where she set it up so that no one was killed and they all ended up listening to her. But this most recent book was very much "Hot-headed Ruda rushes in and yells a lot." For a book mostly about her home, I actually ended more annoyed at her rather than less. Usually when individual characters get more attention it goes the other way!

          Fross is just the best. Although I keep expecting some dark twist, where she realizes how much smarter and more powerful she is than almost everyone else, and turns out to become the next Tellwyrn or something. Then I remind myself that that's not how Webb writes characters, and I should stop looking for sinister overtones lurking everywhere, haha.
          ```

          - u/18scsc:
            ```
            Yeah that did kind of annoy me, I expected her to do better. It does make sense that'd she'd be more emotional and irrational than normal though, considering her home is being attacked.
            ```

        - u/18scsc:
          ```
          Ruda has done a number of things to demonstrate her competence, the first thing that comes to my head is her performance in the town of Sarasio on the class's second field exercise. I'm sure there's other examples I could think up as well.
          ```

    - u/sparkc:
      ```
      I’m a fan of the series but I strongly agree with your first two points, which annoy me no end, and to a lesser extent the third point, though the ‘agenda pushing’ trails off as the series progresses.
      ```

      About the plot armor... honestly I've never felt it, because I felt like violence and possibility of death were never the concern of the story itself. In most the arcs, especially early on, the cast encounter increasingly complex problems that simply can't be solved by just bashing someone, where the main source of tension is whether they mess up the delicate political balance of myriad factions.

      And well... by the standards of the world, the main cast is pretty overpowered.

      Darling has [spoiler](#s " two of the strongest mortal beings in the world as his bodyguards"). Justinian apparently has [spoiler](#s " some amount of control over the gods"). And most of the other cast that we encounter are protected in some form by their own strength or the strength of the institution backing them.

      Also helping the case is an antagonist who [spoiler] (#s " doesn't want any of his enemies dead, yet") .



      About the agenda, well, I feel that's dependent on the reader how they want to take it. Personally, I disagree with his views, but I don't feel like his political views have seeped into the story, at least not yet (please tell me if I missed something in this regard).
      ```

      - u/AurelianoTampa:
        ```
        I agree with most everything you say; I'm just pointing out that it frustrates some readers. Webb has stated that he doesn't like grimdark settings or killing off favorite characters. In many ways TGAB is like the anti-Worm. I can at least vouch that if you've read Worm and feel like you need a palate cleanser, TGAB is an *excellent* choice to turn your mood around. And yes, the main cast is overpowered; however, they also frequently get lucky or deus ex machina'ed out of trouble. In context a lot of this makes sense; several of them have literal gods watching out for them; but as I said, it just takes a lot of the tension out of things. You *know* they won't get too hurt or killed.

        I'm not too sure of Webb's political views (besides him being anti-Trump), but I meant more of his social views. Through his characters and the way the culture and cults are discussed, he is pretty clearly pro-homosexual relationships, pro-trans people, pro-feminism, anti-patriarchy, and anti-traditionalism. I think all of that is fine, and I think he's been doing well at showing times when it's *not* ok (Basra's "relationship" with her subordinate is obviously cast negatively, and Shaathism's positive features are praised with Brother Ingvar), but I remember early on people were asking if there were any exclusive heterosexual romances because the homosexual or polyamorous ones seemed to take center stage. It was something that never bugged me, but it seemed to irk some other people.
        ```

        - u/GirlsHateMtgplayers:
          ```
          As someone who doesn't share his views, it seems to me like he is blatantly pushing his agenda. It's what drove me away about a year ago (around arc 11 or 12), but I've recently started reading again. Anyway, a couple of points to illustrate my frustrations with the way he (is he confirmed as a he?) inserts his views into his book:  

          * woman good, man bad: Most of the main cast is women. Now that's not inherently a problem, but it ties into the following. At first, the only male protagonists are Gabe (socially awkward nerd dude), Toby (Gay pacifist) and Darling (Chaotic neutral at best in his alignment). What I'm trying to say is that there is a distinct lack of a positive traditionally masculine character among his protagonists. Darling comes closest, but even then he's more of a behind the scenes kind of guy, a thief and morally gray at best. The Tirasian king, once you get a bit deeper into the book, is the closest to a traditionally masculine character.  

          * matriarchy good, patriarchy bad: the abstraction of the above. The societies in TGAB are very left-leaning as a whole, a reflection of the author's views and perhaps of the views of the people who created the world (The Elder Gods). The military cult (Avenists) is all female (and that's somehow okay) and feminist - call me sexist but that makes no sense to me, especially when considering the fact that men are more suited to combat than women.  
          I may be particular in this regard, but it really makes it hard for me to suspend my disbelief. Even so, I can accept that humans in Tiraas aren't the same as humans on Earth (really ironic when you find out Tiraas was created by a bunch of people from Earth), but it would make sense to have a male equivalent of the Avenists right? Wrong. The closest thing to that would be the cult of Shaath which is a gross caricature of traditionalists and portrayed very negatively even disregarding that.  
          Not to mention the fact that there exists a whole species of humanoids that organizes itself in a Matriarchal order, but no real masculine equivalent - again, I find it hard to suspend my disbelief.  

          * demonization of male sexuality: a lot of men are grabby, rapey bastards, are described as "ugh" by the women.  This is demonstrated quite literally by Jeremiah Shook and Alan Vandro, who are again, caricatures of the traditionalist view on the norms of male-female relationships. At least a female equivalent is present in Basra Syrinx, although she seems less reviled than her male counterparts. And even still, Basra seems to be lesbian and acts in a very "toxicly masculine" way towards objects of her sexual interest, so I'm not sure that she is a clear parallel to the male rapists.
          ```

    Been reading it since it was dropped in a monthly recommendation thread here I dunno how long ago, but it feels like years. I've puzzled over whether it belongs here as well, and I think it just comes down to it not really being a rational or rationalist story.

    There's two real levels to the story, so far as I can suss out - pretty standard boilerplate, almost JRPG-like fantasy.

    [Complete with](#s " the leader of an organized religion as a villain lamenting the sorry state of the world as he unleashes the Black Dragon from his moonbase.")

    On the next level up, it's an attempt to treat with the fact that we, in a modern, industrial or post-industrial context are still enamored with the values and ideals of pre-Enlightenment, agricultural, feudalistic societies. It attempts to showcase how and why those values break down in the face of a modern, interconnected society.

    However, it also attempts to reconstruct that society in the same breath as it deconstructs it - it offers something of an alternative set of values in the guise of Tellwyrn imparting those values to the student class - hence the complaints that an agenda is being pushed. Because it is. However, D.D. Webb's particular choice of values for an industrialized or post-industrial society aren't necessarily everyone's, which is the first hit against its ability to popular traction.

    That might not alone be enough to stop it from climbing the charts - HPMOR certainly didn't shy away from pushing a transhumanist agenda as part of its presentation, but the second major hit is the pacing, and the ratio between the story acting on its first level as boilerplate fantasy vs. its second level as societal analysis.

    TGaB spends so, so, so much time on the first level, filling chapter after chapter with fantasy adventure that I could find by pulling a random book of the shelf at Barnes & Noble with the author's name in big shiny letters on the cover, and spends less than 10% of its time actually engaging with the societal issues that might make it interesting on a rationalist level. As it stands, TGaB has been running for three and a half years, making pretty regular updates the whole time, [and](#s " we still don't know *why* the Gods are bastards.") If Webb expects to actually spark or have a discussion on values they're presenting and their merit, it'd be pretty useful to actually have laid them out at some point.

    Instead, I get the impression that TGaB's thesis which I think I can best summarize as "we should be focused on network effects, system level consequences and incentives, and our role within institutions" will continue to be doled out by Tellwyrn or whomever else gets to be the author mouthpiece of the book, and we'll get a triumphant win at the end of the series when society is reconstructed all for the better to prepare for the coming industrial revolution and every pre-existing institution will have reshaped itself to better integrate. More "The Next Generation", less "Battlestar Galactica".

    Still gonna read it until the end, 'cause it's entertaining, but it certainly doesn't feel like much more than an entire world constructed to showcase how great things are when people wise up and start behaving like Webb's ideal version of themselves. [See](#s " how everything at the Rock got tied up nice and neat by Ayuvesh being focused on getting the Rust integrated into Punaji society rather than in control of it.")
