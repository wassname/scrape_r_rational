  Present tense again? I thought you said you regretted using it for Origin of Species.

    I think I said it's complicated: could be wrong and I've changed my mind since, but while I do regret that many people are not used to it, some even to the point of genuinely being unable to enjoy it, I find it a more compelling form and want to help people get more used to it.

  Not expecting this main character to get a happy ending.  He’s literally going out of his way to start fights with beings that are more powerful than him, more clever than him, and that he knows he doesn’t understand.  I don’t see that going well in rational fic.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Ah, but he has some things they don't: pluck and gumption!

    Also some of the methods of rationality, for whatever that's worth :P
    ```

    - u/Ibbot:

      Some of them.  He certainly tried to find the most effective way to bait the far.  Hopefully he learns to avoid starting unnecessary fights, so he still has the ability to deal with necessary ones if/when they come.  Of course, you may well have that planned out already...

  >A spell in the form of a story, Puck had said. A glamour woven word by word, by all who speak and to all who hear.

  This is so cool. I very much look forward to seeing it develop.

    Very practical guide to evil fae, which I really loved.
    ```

  Hey everyone, finally got this written out and edited! For those that forgot, this is my original fiction about fae set in the modern world.

  I'm hyper aware that [Spoiler](/s "I'm now writing two stories in which the male main character has lost their dad and has to deal with some kind of magic that interferes with him grieving. Even though this is an original work and thus potentially publishable, I'm still going to make sure they're not too similar in that aspect, but I feel like it's a useful tool to explore intense and immediate grief without letting it derail a story's plot."). I'm curious to know if they feel too similar or out of place at any point, though.

  Hope you enjoy it, and all feedback welcome!

    It's... Somewhat interesting.

    Will there be a character who *doesn't* belittle the protagonist and desire to eat his intestines with fava beans and Chianti?
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Hmm. I guess I should *probably* include one, just for variety, right?
      ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Hooray! It's out!
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    \o/!

    Hope it was worth the wait :)

  ```
  I'm a bit late to the party, but I gotta say it's rare for me to be so completely enthralled by an original story just from the beginning. This is such a promising start, it sorta reminds me of the best qualities of Pact without any of its worse components!
  Is it also gonna be updated on a monthly schedule?
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Thanks, glad you're enjoying it!

    Unfortunately it definitely won't be out on a monthly basis, but I'm hoping to put out a few chapters per year at least. On the plus side this will be a much shorter story than Pokemon.

  ```
  Typo thread!
  ```

- u/gammagurke:
  ```
  Why the change in font? Maybe this is just me being used to the font in origin of species but it seems wrong somehow
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Woops, didn't even realize I'd done that. Thanks for pointing it out!
    ```
