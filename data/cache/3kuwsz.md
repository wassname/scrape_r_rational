## [WIP] Alternate Ending to "The Metropolitan Man"

### Post:

I really enjoyed reading [The Metropolitan Man](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/13/The-Metropolitan-Man), but I couldn't help but feel the author handed Superman the ["Idiot Ball"](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall) in the final chapter. I have attempted a rewrite of the final scenes from the final chapter, with a different outcome from the original story. This is my first stab at this sort of thing, so I would appreciate critiques, grammar checks, and mentions of any plot-holes.

  I'm not sure it is fair to say that Superman was holding the idiot ball there. 

  [Spoilers Metropolitan Man](#s " Superman didn't truly understand why Lex was so afraid of him, nor the depth and length that fear would drive him. He might have expected the kryptonite bullets, but I can't see him expecting the kryptonite hidden in the lead walls.")

  More importantly, [Spoilers for the rewrite](#s " I think that you're underestimating how much Superman was weakened when Mercy opened the lead door with a huge chunk of kryptonite in her hand. He clearly had enough power to blast through a lead wall, but I think it's reasonable to guess that considerably more power would be required to operate fast enough to spend that much time thinking.")

  Could Superman have been smarter? Sure. But that's not enough for him to hold the idiot ball. He was acting in character, and he took a reasonable course of action given his options. 

  Nevertheless, an interesting rewrite. Thanks for sharing it!

    By the end Superman knows that Lex has kryptonite and knows lead blocks his vision. At that point it's stupid not to treat all lead as if it has kryptonite behind it just in case.

  I wrote a [retelling](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11405691/1/Vulnerable) of the ending of Metropolitan Man a few months back. It's from Superman's POV and I think it's pretty decent.

    Wow that was really good. I thought that Superman acted that way because it was the first time he was vulnerable so the fear and shock overrode all his higher functions.

    I still find it a bit hard he could analyze three days worth of information in seconds and not find a way to beat that challenge but at least it gets close. I like the way you phrased your story.

      Well, from what I interpreted, it wasn't so much that he couldn't "beat" the challenge. It was more that he didn't identify just how many layers to the challenge there were. The challenge he perceived was "Get away from here right now without harming these frail humans" whereas it was actually "Get away from here right now without harming these frail humans AND avoiding the kryptonite studded walls." Simply put, Superman wasn't paranoid enough. Which is almost understandable, as Superman doesn't face any real challenge, in regards to physical, visceral damage, which is what this threat to his life was. Even with the advanced caution he entered with, I can easily accept that his danger sense wasn't calibrated enough, as an invulnerable alien being.
      ```

  An enjoyable read, although I found your Superman to be a far departure from the Superman in u/alexanderwales' original story. The character seemed very different from what we got in MM. I liked the writing style though.
