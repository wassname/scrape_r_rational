## [Biweekly Challenge] Moloch

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4zfbud/biweekly_challenge_underground/?sort=confidence) the prompt was "Underground". The winner was /u/kishoto with their story, [ViD](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4zfbud/biweekly_challenge_underground/d789jmw). Go read it now! Congratulations to /u/kishoto!

##### This Time

This time we'll be doing **"Moloch"**. If you haven't already, go read [Meditations on Moloch](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/). If you're too lazy for that, I think it can be best summed up as "many systems are composed of individual elements with their own optimization functions which work in their own favor but to the detriment of the system as a whole". This is a very abstract topic, and I highly suggest making it concrete by thinking about 'Moloch' in the context of a business, government, colony, species, etc.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, September 21st.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Next time we'll be doing **Memory Modification**. Your challenge, should you chose to accept it, is to write a story which involves the alteration of memories in some way, whether through memetics, anti-memetics, erasure, neural tinkering, or anything else. It's a good chance to try out some alternative narrative structures or play with presentation to the audience.

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 9/21.** Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread [is available here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/51okid/challenge_companion_moloch/).
