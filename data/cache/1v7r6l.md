  One of my favorite books, available free at the above link by the author (/u/cstross). There are nine chapters and each one takes place about ten years after the previous one, which covers the leadup to the Singularity and more or less out the other side. I've got my dead trees version of it, which I treasure greatly, but it's *free* here for the reading. It won the Locus award and got nominated for a lot of others. Lots of transhumanist themes going on, as it's more or less about the Singularity.

    If I were the type of person to have an all-time favorite book, this could be it. Extremely formative to my current world-view and lifetime goals. I'm excited to read it again in a few years once I've forgotten more details. Also, lobsters.

  Really good. He made a serious effort at trying to depict the future as realistically as possible. I especially liked how unconventional, alien and weird some of the events were and how he littered these [fringe technical concepts](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Accelerando_Technical_Companion) throughout the book. The pyramid scheme scam corporation AI and those sentient lobsters were probably my favorite little details. My only criticism probably is that 


  [Accelerando, spoilers until the end](#s " the overarching arc that the cat was in control of everything was a bit dull and overhyped in the end.")


  I'm not sure how rational the book is though. I have been thinking about submitting this book here before, but this story doesn't really revolve around rational decision-making. It's more like there were these little people who were thrown into a storm and try their best to act under the influence of events outside their control. But now that it's submitted I think it fits well here because none of the characters are really idiots and the story is otherwise really smart.

    It's not really a rationalist book, but it's a book that the sort of people who like rationalist fiction will probably enjoy.

      Oh, and I almost forgot that the sidebar allowed hard science fiction.

  Wish I had of read this earlier.

  >Manfred is at the peak of his profession, which is essentially coming up with whacky but workable ideas and giving them to people who will make fortunes with them.

  Describes pretty much exactly what I want to do for a living. Well that an assess the viability of whacky ideas.

  Reminded me to email some people about some stuff anyway.

  >The nude woman turns toward him. She's the spitting image of Amber's mother, except for the chellipeds she has in place of hands. She hisses "Equity!" and takes a wobbly step toward him, pincers clacking.

  That is all.

  Loving it thus far! Thanks for sharing!
