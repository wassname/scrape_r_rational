  There's something special about that blaze boredom with fates worth than death; "[I'd be pissed if I'd have to] murder my way back to a semblance of humanity". Ahh, Cat.
  ```

  - u/MoralRelativity:
    ```
    Nice. I remember that brought a smile to my face.
    ```

- u/ForgottenToupee:
  ```
  I forget, is Zombie the Second an undead horse? I thought it was, but then describing it as skittish around Nauk makes me think it isn't. Good chapter though! Can't wait for the Wednesday update
  ```

  - u/AurelianoTampa:
    ```
    IIRC, it's not yet dead, but they figured knowing the stuff Cat faces it will be eventually so they named it in advance.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  What do you all think the deal Cat is going to offer Thief is? Return the treasury and I'll let you live?

  Alternatively, Cat already bled the treasury dry and blamed Thief, so she'll guarantee Thief's safety if she stays out of Cat's way and keeps up the lie.
  ```

  - u/MoralRelativity:
    ```
    Interesting reminder about the treasury. Maybe Cat will tell Thief about the treason and Thief can put the funds towards the war effort (paying for cavalry) or helping refugees? Thief will have to return the jewels though.
    ```

  - u/JdubCT:
    ```
    Maybe she'll get a seat on the ruling council representing the dark guilds? Catherine wants to re-assemble the nation and Thief wants to steal something big.
    ```

- u/Empiricist_or_not:
  ```
  Anyone have any thoughts/bets on the ongoing wish/hypothesis in the comments of Robber becoming named?
  ```

  - u/CeruleanTresses:
    ```
    I wonder if "Little Shit" can be a Name.
    ```

  - u/DCarrier:
    ```
    I'm betting his Name will be Robber. It's different from Thief because it implies violence or threat of violence.
    ```

  - u/MoralRelativity:
    ```
    Murderer? Killer?

    Robber seems to tame. Although his crew's motto is something like "kill them and take their stuff" so maybe that's right. 

    I really, really want Robber to get a name but there's no guarantee that it's going to happen.
    ```

    - u/russxbox:
      ```
      What about Bandit? It seems to have the right flavor of theft and threats of violence.
      ```
