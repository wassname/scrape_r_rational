## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

    > White smoke rises in a cloud,

    > Light and silver parting the sky's blue.

    > I can hear the rustling grasses,

    > See the heather of your hillsides.

    > The world of my dreams.

    > Babbling brooks,

    > Flowing crystal through eternal glades -

    > Peace and freedom..

    > The hour will come when my sins are forgiven

    > And I meet the dawn in the midst of your hills.

    > Taking up a staff

    > I will travel, a wanderer

    > Through the land of my dreams

    > Where the cries of the eagles

    > Spreading their wings

    > Over the stone cliffs

    > Speak of peace and freedom

  Recently, I was very surprised to see in my daily ~~Goodreads~~ Kindle Deals email\* a [story](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25746699) whose protagonist had the (involuntary) power of being forgotten within minutes by anyone who saw her. Is this (dis)ability more common in fiction than I'm aware? This is at least the fourth time I've seen it, after [*Background Pony*](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/19198) (protagonist Lyra Heartstrings, involuntary), [*Radiance*](http://luminous.elcenia.com/story.shtml) (minor character Allirea, voluntary), and [*Worm*](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/) (minor character Imp, voluntary). (Insert accusations of sexism against science-fiction/fantasy authors for constantly giving invisibility powers to women.) See also the tropes [The Nondescript](https://allthetropes.org/wiki/The_Nondescript) and [Perception Filter](https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Perception_Filter).

  \*[Goodreads Deals is being discontinued in favor of Kindle Deals.](https://i.imgur.com/jrAWbbS.png) Amazon, which owns both Goodreads and Kindle, obviously doesn't like it when Goodreads sends out links for buying books from B&N and Google. However, since e-book prices are set not by sellers but by publishers, it doesn't really matter&mdash;I'll just have to manually go to bn.com whenever I'm alerted to a Kindle sale for a book that I want, rather than being able to immediately click on a bn.com link in the email.

  Anyway, *The Sudden Appearance of Hope* is in my opinion significantly more akin to *Background Pony* than to *Radiance*. It constantly bounces back and forth between the one's pretentiousness\*\* and the other's coolness, but overall it definitely feels more pretentious than cool, especially when you take into account the cultural and political jabs that the protagonist thinks to herself with some regularity. IMO, it definitely doesn't deserve more than three stars.

  \*\*IIRC&mdash;I haven't read *Background Pony* in *quite* a few years. (It's hard to imagine that, at some long-past date, it temporarily was my favorite story, above even [*Time Braid*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644). I probably should get around to reading it for a third time.)

  (I find it extremely pathetic that the phrase `mens reus`&mdash;[obviously erroneous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mens_rea) not only to anyone who knows Latin but also to anyone who reads legal opinions&mdash;was retained in *multiple* places by the editor. How hard is it to look up a two-word foreign-language phrase on Google?)

    Invisibility superpowers and similar are often metaphorical, and the most common metaphor is marginalization. It really shouldn't be a surprise that it's a power most often given to women. The last place I recall seeing the power was *The Laundry Files*, where this was made quite explicit.

    (*Soon I will be Invincible* was also pretty blatant about it's commentary, but that was stock invisibility.)

    There's an issue of Xmen that features a mutant with a similar power.

    The comments here remind me of a [This American Life episode](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/178/superpowers), which has a segment on Flight vs Invisibility.  In the words of one of the people interviewed:

    >Flying is for people who want to let it all hang out.  Invisibility is for fearful, crouching, masturbators.
    ```

    - u/Amonwilde:
      ```
      Never got this. They both seem like lame powers, the only lamer thing being perhaps super strength. Though invisibility seems more useful.

  Anyone has recs for Steven Universe rational fic?

  More specifically, I'd be looking for fics that fit the tone of the series, so more "Steven has a chat with Garnet about relationships and the nature of fusion" than "Steven figures out how to leverage Gem physics to win the war against Homeworld".

    Wow, there was one like that called "The World is your Oyster, the Universe is your Namesake" that apparently has been removed from the site, no idea why. It wasn't stellar but it was an alright read and what you are asking for, so that's a shame.

    First, I'd recommend *Le Ton beau de Marot*, which is about that kind of thing, by the same guy who wrote *GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach* (Douglas Hofstadter).

    Second ... I think it really depends on the translator and their goals. There's are, obviously, selection effects for which works get translated, so I would expect translated works to on average be better than works without a translation, probably by a considerable margin.

    But beyond that, some translations are "bare bones" in that they seem like they've just been run through a translation service, and *those* generally feel like they subtract meaning. I watch a fair amount of Korean dramas, and sometimes entire *plot points* require outside explanation, because whatever person did the translation failed to explain the cultural context of what was happening, or the wordplay that the scene hinged on. I've seen translations that *don't explain a Korean homophone which isn't a homophone in English*.

    So, I don't know. I feel like translated works are a mixed bag, in that translators and the effort that they'll put into translation are variable. The selection effects for translation should be in the direction of better works being selected, making them comparatively good when put next to the baseline, but meaning isn't always at the forefront of the translators mind. (At a guess, 'I need to finish this translation so I can get paid' motivates a lot of translators who do half-assed work.)

    Do media that you enjoyed untranslated tend to have translations into other languages?
