## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  Magic systems can typically be divided into "cost" and "effect", with both having quite a bit of weight in terms of how that magic system is used within the world it's embedded in. (Here, "cost" should be considered a catch-all for "what does it take to make magic", which might include things like bloodlines, pacts, genetics, etc.)

  There's a particular variety of "magic" where each practitioner is bound by their own magic system, sometimes with overlap into a cohesive system, sometimes free-floating without connections to each other. Some examples ("magic" here is obviously loosely defined):

  * Powers in *Worm*
  * Superhero settings in general
  * Magical girl specialties
  * Quirks in *My Hero Academia*
  * Semblances in *RWBY*
  * Entads in *Worth the Candle*

  ... and a bunch of others.

  From a writing perspective, it's pretty clear why this is done; powers/magic can then have a tighter thematic link to a person, allowing their power to be a reflection of them or say something relevant about their character. Beyond that, if you have X people with different powers, then you can have X \* X-1 different match-ups between them, each of which will be unique in its own way.

  Unfortunately, these types of systems have some real problems when it comes to worldbuilding, if you have enough people with their own magic. Instead of the traditional magic/worldbuilding problem of defining "what can magic do", you have the more complex problem of "what can magic do, at what rates, and within what limits".

  You need to know whether there are mind-readers, how common they are, and what kinds of drawbacks they typically have, because even a small handful of them can have a pretty significant impact on all aspects of society. Basically, you need to create a possibility space for all the magics that people can possibly do, then create probabilities within those possibilities, and you have to explore the outer limits as well, because the people/magic at those outer limits is probably vitally important to defining who the movers, shakers, and linchpins are in the world.

  Worse, you have to then somehow communicate that to the reader in a concise way.

  I'm not really sure that there's a one-size-fits-all solution to this problem, insofar as it *is* a problem, but I'd be interested in hearing how people deal with it.

    Old stories had this kind of one-off magic. Some guy drinks dragon's blood. Now he can talk to birds.

    Consider old customs as a possible solution to the kinds of problems you're describing.

    \* Bring political power in alignment with magical power

    Take mind control. The social problem is that a mage could take over someone else's community. The solution is to just give the mage a title. Now that he's Lord Mage they're his peasants, so the act isn't illegal or a threat to society in general .

    \* Enforce Ettiquite

    I'm obliged to announce myself when coming into your territory . I know your schtick because you openly rule kingdom. The meeting gives you a chance to size me up and feel out my trick .

    And maybe I can pull one over on your court. But, that's going to get me a reputation in short order .

    Sneaking magic users should be assumed to be hostile .

    \* Heroic Responsibility

    The evil king isn't breaking any laws or treaties. He's just cruel. But Conan doesn't feel a need to get a grand jury indictment before going after someone. He doesn't need external validation for his moral decisions .

    \---

    I'd suggest letting the world break, and have fixes evolve from there. The first person to get a power to control a town now owns a town.

    What happens when he wants to trade? Maybe he can capture the first few travelers who come into his area. But people stop coming unless they have protection from a bigger fish.

    For as far as showing the reader the different levels of power, I think that what's really important is how you show the culture of the world and the types of societies that exist. I think by changing the cultural customs to accomodate different types of powers, you can signal to the reader that the levels of rarity that each type of power has. For example, if mind readers are very uncommon, then only high-profile and paranoid people would like have systems in place for them. If they were fairly common, then it's more likely that the average person has some sort of system in place to protect themselves.

    In my own story, that kind of strides the line between superpowers and xanxia-styled magic, and I'm not sure this is the best way to do it,  I use large distances and powers that don't have huge areas of effect. This lets me work on each area as if it were a self-contained bubble, which means that there's a lot less pieces for me to keep track of.

  In a fantasy/medieval setting, people sometimes acquire intangible chunks capable of computation and magic. It is possible with practice to expand one's thought process into the chunk of computation, primarily to intuitively use it to control the magic it comes with. The downside is that the more one leans on the chunk the more one's thought patterns follow those of the chunk (e.g. evil, good, greed, travel, fire, etc.). The magic being relatively normal fantasy stuff, a limit of power per time-span with some sort of cap, fireballs, regeneration, control of plants, sacrificing people for more power, etc. Almost all chunks provide a basic improvement to the owners body in strength, speed, perception, and endurance etc.

  Explanation: It's sort of a strong AI computational medium of fixed speed (like say 10 times more computational power than a brain, maybe more, and often very large unused memory) attached to human brains, with a lot of the "computer" architecture kinds of tropes. For example: with like "user" permissions, being able to copy minds around, magic is a sort of "port" or "device" (albeit a very complex one often tied to many "virtual" neurons, which are then plugged into default "drivers" that cause the magic to actually do specific things). However by default any thinking done on the chunk is subject to learning with the chunk's innate goal function, while it can simulate the human brain's biological structure (so as to be attached to humans), it does so in such a way as to be reinforcing the goal function. The point is that for most people, they use the computational power to make the magic work (the magic already being attached to pre weighted chunks of brain (the last person's...), so it feels like a limb) and when using the magic are often influenced to carry out the goal (people who use the magic constantly, slowly seek to follow only the goal).

  Also I am toying with the idea of there often being embedded within the chunks personalities with experiences and knowledge from previous people, that are subject to goal function manipulation (as they run on the chunk) but are separate beings - a special user/watchdog that can't be removed (but can be suppressed) with about the computational capacity of a person - but with no control of the magic or the person's body or thoughts (outside of limited communication). Basically demons that try to convince one to use the power and achieve the goal.

  The story would focus on a character who acquires one of these chunks and approaches it rationally (rather than just a tool to exercise power). What consequences might there be in a medieval world that would be different than the normal rational fantasy and rational super-exponential AI tropes? (what might I be missing in my world building - interesting intersections would be awesome to hear - for example: magic involving creating semi-intelligent agents, like necromancery, involves, even without a rational viewpoint, bits about security around the authentication of who can give orders to them, necromancers will often look for security flaws when fighting each other)
  ```

  - u/causalchain:
    ```
    Also, consider that it doesn't need to be a mechanical AI. We're talking fantasy, so there could be an explanation such as 'a soul bound to the item', or even an amalgamation of souls (maybe past users?).

    The computer architecture tropes can be replaced with equivalents that match your magic system. If you have a limited set of instructions that you can give with magic, then you can imagine what kind of structure a mage could/would put into it to assist the user. Maybe this can result in unique and interesting user-item interactions (I'm thinking orange-blue morality).
    ```

    - u/Mason-B:
      ```
      I intend for them to be intangible in the first place, and to an extent choose their own users, they bind to people's souls more or less.

      Yea I don't have good names for them yet. Mostly I was quoting the existing terms to show their translations.

      The orange blue morality is definitely going to be a part of it, many of the chunks will have goal functions aimed at human/humanoid concepts. Some were definitely going to be weirder and have goal functions based on incomprehensible-to-humanoids concepts.

    I feel this would be cooler if it was in a post apocalyptic setting with medieval level tech, (1000 years past apocalypse kind of thing).

    Where magic items are old technology, and your magic is also ancient tech instead of generic fantasy flare.

    Your chunk could be a brain implant of some sort, that had to be formatted before transfer or that wasn't meant to be traded around between people because they could just make more.

    interesting concept, and it makes me wonder what a D&D Monk would get in term of a 'chunk' with his Ki abilities. at 7th they get still mind, which removes outside influences of charm and fear from the mind. perhaps the monk is one of the rational paths? 

    when you have elves that are better at magic somehow, does this mean elven minds are better at interfacing with or adapting to chunks? or are the chunks themselves perhaps fragments of dead elves? parts that survive death maybe?

  There's two parallel worlds: the one we live on, and a "shadow" earth (really just another planet in a non-specified location, be that in another solar system/galaxy or literally in another universe) with all sorts of demons and mythological creatures living on it. 

  There are a series of "portals" that were created long ago by strong magics the kind that are no longer seen, and they are relatively small in size so only things roughly human size can pass between (so the e.g. krakens are stuck). There are relatively few of them: maybe one per 10 million humans.

  They mostly remain in the possession of 'demons' who use them for personal use, though some are probably in deep cult chambers.

  What are some consequences of these portals existing, and how do we stop Earth being overrun (the demons don't really have any reason to visit Earth, so...). Is there an economy where portal owners sell tickets to move between the veil? Is it inevitable that a governing body will buy up / steal all the portals and control access somehow? Is there an obvious munchkinry opportunity? Is there an obvious consequence of this system that would result in undesireable consequences?
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    I think it's pretty likely that control of the portals ends up in the hands of a monopoly, and that this monopoly is probably some kind of government entity.

    On of the big things I would think about is that fact that the portals circumvent national borders. There are (roughly) 700 of them, which means that there are probably useful endpoints with regards to immigration, smuggling, insertion of foreign agents, terrorism, or state-sponsored attacks.

    The U.S. government has a lot of incentives to A) find every portal within the U.S. and B) establish firm border control with regards to all of them, as one example. If set during the Cold War, the powers-that-be would probably be concerned with the potential for nuclear attack through the portals.

    If you wanted to do political commentary, you could follow immigrants taking the "shadow paths" to cross the border and circumvent border control, but that would require the powers-that-be not to have border control with respect to the shadow world.
    ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      Thanks for that - I didn't think of the potential for bad actors on Earth to use them to do regular Earth bad things. Even if you handwave and say the Shadow planet is the size of Jupiter and humans are regularly hunted for food by powerful, ineffable creatures, so there's no way to reliably travel between portals in the Shadow, that still doesn't help as the Government doesn't know that, and some Demons look pretty humanoid so could even be bribed by Russia or ISIS or whoever (or, at least, the Government would be worried about it). 

      Then again, as the story I'm thinking of writing isn't set in the US, it could be quite possible for the portals in the US, Russia, and wherever else to be owned by shadow government organisations, which only makes the portals that aren't controlled more valuable. Then *again*, my story's set in Australia, and if the US has a shadow government organisation keeping track of portals, then Australia most certainly does also. 

      Then *again*, the plot hook I had in mind was a low-level Demon moving a portal from Europe to Australia, so perhaps that's why it's a good business decision to do so: perhaps there are no other "free" portals in Australia and he wants to make $$$, and the plot could involve the shadow government organisation breathing down the Demon's neck.

      Then *again*, I don't like the "shadow government" trope, but it's also kind of impossible to  imagine a world where the Masquerade was successful enough over a long enough term for there *not* to be one. 

      Thank you!~ You gave me a lot to think about.

        Why would there be a shadow government organization? That doesn't seem at all likely to me. What you have here are self-checkpointing international borders.

        More likely, there will be an Interplanar Travel Authority that checks passports, collects tariffs, helps demons get work visas, and determines which of the portals should be used for domestic travel and which ones should have internet trunks and oil pipelines run through them. This would be done in cooperation with the nations and sapient beings on the other side, with whom we can trade and make treaties openly and legitimately.

        If demons don't have a reason to visit Earth, perhaps we can entice them with electronics, education, and chocolate. It sounds like they have a monster problem; Maybe we could interest them in high caliber hunting rifles? I'm sure they can offer something in return. Forget moving *people.* Biological materials alone would be more than worth the trouble! What are kraken beaks made of, and do they have the same smooth hardness gradient as our squids? How much steak can you get out of a minotaur? What's the amazing smell on that man-eating flower and can we make a perfume out of it? And if they've still got some of that magic... Hey, Mr. Stopheles, I represent a marketing firm and if you sign on with us, the only question left is: How rich do you want to be?

          All this talk about open use of the portals makes me want to write a story set In The Future of when the story I want to write is happening, just to explore all these social things. You did make me realise the Underworld could have "airports" around the portals on *their* side, though, which might be interesting. 

          >  Biological materials alone would be more than worth the trouble!

          *That's* an interesting thought. I had a plot bunny a while ago that vinegar was worth a lot of money in the Underworld as it was very expensive to make there, but obviously very cheap on Earth. Maybe I should work out something more logical to have that rareness gradient (Aluminium being an obvious choice, though why Demons won't have the technology to produce it *en masse* is another question - but perhaps their planet does not have aluminium rich whatever-it-is-we-get-aluminium-from like Earth does...).

            We mine (mostly) bauxite, which gets turned into alumina via the [Bayer Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_process), then turned into aluminum through the [Hall–Héroult process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall%E2%80%93H%C3%A9roult_process). I mostly know this because aluminum went from being rarer than platinum to a bulk metal in the space of two decades, which makes it great fodder for something a time traveler or portal-goer might invent.

        > a low-level Demon moving a portal

        If the portals can be *moved* then there's the option of using them as shortcuts. Consider - assume that there are two portals in two different, distant major cities on DemonWorld (think along the lines of New York and London on Earth). Now, take the Earth ends of these portals and bring them together, in the same room. Suddenly, you have a route between two distant major cities (for purposes of trade or tourism or whatever) that takes less than ten minutes to walk along.

        Similarly, if the American government can arrange to have the portals moved on DemonWorld (by a military operation, or bribing the Demons, or whatever) they can have their spies strolling out of the Stalingrad portal within seconds of leaving headquarters. (Alright, if the Russians know about that particular portal, then those American spies are going to really regret their life choices in fairly short order...)

        - u/MagicWeasel:

          My conception of the Underworld is that humans are, essentially, dead if they enter without a Demon escort - it's dangerous (humans are a food item) and the lingua franca is not only impossible to read but hearing it spoken causes neurological symptoms (headaches, dizziness, that sort of thing). 

          I'm thinking perhaps there's a government in the Underworld that severely limits use of the portals, meaning that Earth has significantly reduced "exposure" to creatures from the Underworld.

          Of course, why an Underworld government would stop people visiting Earth, I don't know. I have some ideas of vaguely lovecraftian-scope horrors who live in the Underworld, and they'd make the rules and I can't imagine they'd care about low-level Demons visiting Earth the same way you wouldn't care about grasshoppers visiting a particular anthill. Especially when I just want access to be limited/regulated in such a way that Earth is mostly unscarred from the exchange, rather than completely cut off.

          I mean the best I can come up with is that there's some sort of benevolent diety who wants Earth to be kept as a nature reserve or something, and that's kinda lame...
          ```

          - u/CCC_037:
            ```
            If Portal A and Portal B are placed face-to-face and basically right on top of each other in Demon World, then an American spy can leap into the portal in Washington, and land on the ground in Stalingrad, without having spent even as long as a full second in DemonWorld. Sure, it's dangerous - a predator could just move Portal B and then sit and wait in front of Portal A with its mouth open - but it's the sort of dangerous that one could imagine a government risking, given the benefits.

            > I mean the best I can come up with is that there's some sort of benevolent diety who wants Earth to be kept as a nature reserve or something, and that's kinda lame...

            Maybe it's not benevolent. If humans are a food item, then perhaps Earth is a free-range human farm - with a farmer who comes by every now and then to harvest a few to eat.

            And perhaps Earth isn't the *only* free-range human farm.
            ```

            - u/MagicWeasel:
              ```
              Oh, that's actually pretty perfect! A free-range human farm is something I was considering a lot anyway. It'd be very bad for the farmer if humans became well aware of the portals, as they'd be able to cause problems to anyone who enters (since bullets/etc mostly work on Demons). 

              I'm also imagining a scene where a Demon takes his human boyfriend through the portal, and his boyfriend has a "passport" stamped. 

              Boyfriend: The writing on this is funky! What's it say?

              Demon: Well, mine says I'm a 300 year old mixed breed and that I'm visiting for religious reasons.

              Boyfriend: Cool! What's mine say?

              Demon: .... um, "livestock" ?
              ```

              - u/CCC_037:
                ```
                Considering that (a) we've been allowed to figure out all this technology, and (b) there are no massive unexplained deaths, this implies that we might be a human farm that's been left un-harvested for a very long time. Perhaps the farmer forgot about us for a couple of thousand years or so?

                > I'm also imagining a scene where a Demon takes his human boyfriend through the portal, and his boyfriend has a "passport" stamped.

                Would that demon be considered - by the other demons - to be guilty of bestiality?

                - u/MagicWeasel:
                  ```
                  or, (c), the harvester doesn't find any of our stuff threatening - but then the reason for secrecy (Farmer doesn't want to fight humanity) goes away. Maybe it's a farm turned nature preserve, then? Ugh. Complicated!

                  > Would that demon be considered - by the other demons - to be guilty of bestiality?

                  Bestiality is a funny concept to demons because it's well-accepted for different species of demons to bone. It's more a low status thing - but like, frighteningly low status: imagine it's 1500 and the King of England has declared that he's in love with a (male) slave from some other country, that's probably the sort of level of "why on earth would you do that when you could have done LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE" that people would think. 

                  While at the same time, there's tons of demons who have relationships with humans (sometimes reluctant ones kidnapped from Earth and saved from being dinner; sometimes people who lived in Earth for a while). 

                  More and more, I think the attitude I *want* is for Demons to "leave Earth for Earthlings", somehow being very respectful of human territory even though humans are a food that are just *begging* to be harvested from Earth. 

                  Perhaps it's a farm originally owned by Standard Evil Farmer, but then it was inherited by her more kind-hearted son, who was an abolitionist of sorts and declared Earth a nature preserve.

                  Alternatively, I can see Earth being much like the Earth from the MIB movies, being used as a place for demon refugees to hide. Perhaps it just smells really, really bad so nobody wants to go there. Or maybe it's more like Australia in the 1700s: there's little infrastructure, why would you *want* to go there.

                    Maybe the farmer has been kind of distracted for the last couple of thousand years by a *really* good book. (When your lifetime is measured in millions of years, you can write some doorstoppers so big they could double as skyscrapers...)

                    He's not too worried about the farm, because meh, the humans can keep themselves alive no problem. He either hasn't heard about bullets yet, or he doesn't believe the stories. After all, the last he saw the humans, they hadn't yet figured out what fire could be used for...

                    > More and more, I think the attitude I *want* is for Demons to "leave Earth for Earthlings", somehow being very respectful of human territory even though humans are a food that are just *begging* to be harvested from Earth. 

                    Harvesting humans - in any sort of quantity - would be effectively stealing from Farmer. Maybe they really, really, *really* don't want to annoy Farmer.

                    Which, if the humans find out about Farmer, is also a reason for a certain amount of worry on Earth... what happens when Farmer gets to the end of his book and comes to see whether his harvest is ready yet?

                    I also kind of like the "no infrastructure" idea. Presumably their cellphones are not compatible with humans' cellphone towers - not that human cellphone towers can sustain what they consider a half-decent data transfer rate in any case.

                      I'm, like, of six minds about this whole thing.

                      I like the idea of Earth being under the protection of some Demon Corporation, that is one of many Demon Corporations that farms Earths. I also kind of like the idea that Earth was created, *in the first place*, as a farm, and the Underworld is "the original world", and a place where their magic/tech is so powerful that creating an *entire universe* so they can farm one life form on one planet is kind of intriguing. (Plus, they could be using Earth not just for human meat - I'm sure Demons want to eat bear, tiger, etc and visit beautiful tourist sites). So Earth is probably a "clone" of some planet they particularly liked, maybe? I don't know. 

                      I really like the idea of Earth being somewhere that Demons go to, perhaps as refugees, or perhaps because they want to live a simple life "off the grid". 

                      But I can't reconcile these two together, but I also don't really *need* either of them to be true.

                      Perhaps Earth was created by a bunch of "doomsday preppers" to provide somewhere "off the grid" they could live, with a bunch of precautions to stop "bad demons" coming in the event they need to go into their "bunker planet". So the sun is enchanted against vampires, the portals are too small for a sphynx to get through, pollen is poisonous to harpies, etc. There's a few species that can live fine, but they're generally either peaceful or were part of the doomsday prepper collective. It also doubles as a place to go "camping". 

                      So if you want to go to Earth, you need to pay the Preppers some amount of money (easy), pass a basic screening test (to make sure you're not a danger to their Bunker), and go through their checkpoints that they maintain. Then, of course, all the Earth portals come out at one of their "airports" - and maybe they have only half a dozen.

                      That's a pretty good way to conceptualise it, maybe.

It requires informed consent from both parties involved and a rather complicated ritual to work. I'm trying to think what pitfalls does this system have and how can a character break it for their own benefit, but constantly get distracted by ideas of changes in the society that would bring, especially considering the setting has other gimmicks aside from this one. I'll gladly hear any thoughts.

    The rich get richer.

    Now, the *how* of that probably depends on what we mean by 'objectively measurable' (e.g. does IQ count? resting heart rate?), but the rich *definitely* get richer, because they have more resources that they can offer in the exchange, and capital begets capital. Given that the 'extras' aren't part of the ritual itself, you would probably have money (or whatever else) held by a third party, but that's not terribly unusual in the real world, just another inconvenience/expense on top of whatever the ritual imposes.

    If the ritual can trade *time*, as implied, then most people will end up selling their hours rather than actually working at minimum wage; if a software engineer gets paid $75/hour, their time is worth x10 what someone on minimum wage makes. I suppose you would have work out the supply and demand here, but time is *really* valuable for some people, and practically worthless for others.

      >Does IQ count?

      I'm not sure. That's one thing that I wanted to discuss. I know that some IQ tests take into the account possible cultural differences and other things that can influence the score, but at the end of the day, the results of the test are an *estimate*. So I have my doubts that the magical system would consider IQ measures to be objective.

      >Does resting heart rate count?

      It counts as measurable in my eyes, but I'm not well-versed in medicine.

      >If the ritual can trade time, as implied, then most people will end up selling their hours rather than actually working at minimum wage.

      Yes, the world is currently written with this in mind. This makes me wonder what would happen with the low-wage jobs.

      Thank you for the answer!
