## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  I was looking at [the Warren equation](http://www.alcor.org/Library/html/WillCryonicsWork.html) for whether cryonics would work, along with [Robin Hanson's breakdown](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/03/break-cryonics-down.html). At the end of Hanson's article he says:

  > If you make 50K$/yr now, and value life-years at twice your income, and discount future years at 2% from the moment you are revived for a long life, but only discount that future life based on the chance it will happen, times a factor of 1/2 because you only half identify with this future creature, then the present value of a 5% chance of revival is $125,000, which is about the most expensive cryonics price now.

  My problem with this analysis (okay, my *main* problem) is that I don't value life-years qua life-years, I value *quality-adjusted life years*. Living an extra year in extraordinary pain is worth far less than living an extra year feeling satisfied and fulfilled. I have existence as an instrumental value, not a terminal one.

  *But* this means that if I want to correct for that, I need some way to discount based on expected quality of life in the future. What's the best way to do that? Just make a distribution of expected QALYs assuming successful thawing and then sum the expected value? For example, if I think that there's a 20% chance of being thawed into a dystopia, which I value at 0.1, a 70% chance of being thawed into a world that's much like this one but weirder, which I value at 0.7,  and a 10% chance of a utopia, which I value at 1 ... then

       (20% * 0.1) + (70% * 0.7) + (10% * 1) = .61

  This looks more or less logically correct to me, but I'd like a second opinion.

    MY first thought is to do something like "Forecast the Human Development Index" but I have *no clue* how that works in a useful manner, and you definitely don't want to mess it up.

  My next star wars fanfic will revolve around a group of padawans who go on strike,  refusing to refer to the senior members of the order as "Jedi *masters*," complaining this is insensitive to victims of slavery throughout the galaxy. The bulk of the story will consist of a monologue by Yoda  thinking through the ethical issues in his inimitable verbal style.

    The sentence "I am a proper noun." is grammatically correct but factually incorrect.

    edit: "I is a proper noun" is also factually incorrect because it is actually a personal pronoun unless there is a person named "I".

  Possibly the wrong thread, but I can't find an easy answer to this: why is Shakespeare the best/greatest writer of English? He lived centuries ago, and the population of people speaking and writing the language has increased since then, so why haven't we produced any writers we can point to and say "Yep, this person is unambiguously better than Shakespeare was"?
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    You'll never be able to point to someone and say that they're unambiguously better than Shakespeare; the question of who is best is an ambiguous one.

    As for why Shakespeare is considered *one of* the best:

    * A lot of what he was writing were what we'd now consider transformative works; he was taking old stories and rewriting them. It's easier to write a good story that's been written before, because it's basically as though someone else has done the work of a first draft for you. (A skilled fanfic author can file away the rough bits and breathe life into throwaway characters because they're looking at the work from a distance that the original author didn't have.) Shakespeare happened to live at a time not too long after the printing press came along, so many of his plays became the canonical versions of their story, so he gets more credit than he maybe should get.
    * Shakespeare is most famous for his plays, which were developed iteratively. A modern writer hammers away at his manuscript, puts it through an editor, and then publishes, hoping that it passes muster. Shakespeare didn't write the play and then leave it as it was, he could listen to how the audience reacted every time it was performed and adjust the lines and (to some extent) the plot accordingly. His plays are highly iterative in a way that modern publishing doesn't allow for. So advantage to Shakespeare right there.
    * Shakespeare was undeniably a skilled writer.
    * Shakespeare worked his way into the English canon and then just stayed there.
     * Some of the regard for Shakespeare is just because everyone says that Shakespeare is great. Lots of people say that without understanding half the fart humor in his plays. So there's some degree of "Shakespeare is good because everyone says Shakespeare is good", though there's no way of evaluating how large this factor is.
     * Because lots of people have read Shakespeare, there are a lot more people around to say that Shakespeare is great. It's much easier to hit "top 10" lists if people are aware of you; the world's sexiest man [according to magazines and websites] is almost always someone famous, which seems statistically unlikely even given that famous people tend to be more attractive than non-famous people.
    * Shakespeare is competing in uncompetitive realms. It's hard to compare plays and sonnets to novels and films. While there *are* more writers today, they're mostly not writing plays and sonnets. Few people are going to make the apples to oranges comparison of saying that *The Shawshank Redemption* was better than *Romeo and Juliet*, because that's even more subjective than value judgements normally are. Besides that, a large number of the things that writers now do are collaborative; you can't lay the success of *The Avengers* entirely (or even mostly) at Joss Whedon's feet. [Plays are collaborative too, but Shakespeare is judged on his prose, not on the plays as performed in the Globe. It's likely that he didn't write everything in his plays himself -- I can't imagine him not ever getting input from other authors or the actors -- but he gets all the credit.]
    * Shakespeare's best stuff is what survived. Most modern authors are judged by their entire body of work and Shakespeare benefits from some of his worst stuff having been forgotten or edited away. I'm sure there were some terrible poems he wrote, but they've been lost to history and Shakespeare looks better for it.

      > Shakespeare's best stuff is what survived.

      Actually, a lot of Shakespeare's stuff that survived isn't very good. But you don't get many people doing Random Tedious King Wossname so it doesn't effect how he's perceived.

        How dare you insult such wonderful plays as [Pericles, Prince of Tyre](http://ferretbrain.com/articles/article-878)

        (this play is hilarious, but not intentionally).
        ```

  - u/TaoGaming:

    Argument -- we under rate him. Speaking with friends who read translations impressed on me just how much English has changed and how little of the Bard we really get. Half of his stuff is gibberish and the other half seems clich√©d. But he's inventing the cliches (both linguistic and, to a lesser extent, dramatic) .

    Realistically he is over-rated, but try reading any other 400 year old work without updating. It's a slog. Hell, try reading a 200 year old play. Or the best play from 100 years ago...

    And let's just admit. When it comes to a single line or sentence. Big Will crushed it time and again. His greatest hits are truly great. Look at Howard Hughes' rule for a good movie. Three great scenes, no bad ones.

    By excluding everything but dialogue, Shakespeare massively narrowed his technical challenges.

    Prose has undeniably advanced, especially the development of technical dialects--for technical merit, your average scientific paper is totally to a higher standard than Shakespeare.

    But for fiction, yeah, this is pretty bothersome. Bobby Fischer was heads above his opponents at the time of his height, and did more with less than Kasparov, but Kasparov is objectively greater. You wouldn't expect anyone to be more influential, but why not better. The best answer is that literary evolution has been mostly horizontal, focusing on problems like creating new and more complex plots, coincident with a devaluation of formal lingual experimentation by the commercial audience. Relatedly, among the creators, the idea that an ideal, lucid prose style already exists has dissuaded conscious experimentation with English. And it's true that, for efficiency of communication, maybe a local maximum, or even a soft cap, has been reached.  

    TLDR; Shakespeare attempted technically much simpler creations than what is expected now, making them individually more flawless. 

    Also, let's be honest, the peeps just be lazy.

    Maybe it would be easier if we broke down what we mean by "better" into multiple categories. While the quality of literature is relative to the preferences of those who read it, people's reading preferences are not SO different that we can't set any standards of good writing at all. At the very least, we can rate his performance against our own preferences and the preferences of different target audiences. Here is how I would probably rate Shakespeare out of ten based on my own literary preferences.

    World-building: 6

    Characterization: somewhere between 5 and 7

    Dialogue: somewhere between 7 and 8

    Meaningful content(10) or fluff(0): probably an 8 or a 9 for its time, but somewhere between 6 and 8 relative to some of the really good modern works of literature I've read. Maybe a 4 or a 5 for some of his works (i.e. Twelfth Night was basically a romantic comedy that is kinda similar to a lot of modern romantic comedy movies, and there was actually a movie based on it which takes place in modern times, I think it's called "She's the Man"?)

    Description (how well he can describe something in detail in his writing): Maybe a 6 or a 7? It could be an 8 or even a 9 if he was relying on his audience at the time to fill in certain details which might not be noticed so much by a modern person reading the script.

    Also, you know how they say that good writers should show not tell, or at least show more than they tell? Shakespeare tells quite a lot but he doesn't show quite as much. A lot of the action takes place off the stage and is only talked about by the characters instead of enacted by them. However, the descriptive quality of the dialogue and dramatic monologues could make up for the insufficient amount of visible action in a format that is meant to be seen rather than just heard.

    Because Shakespeare is ridiculously, ridiculously good. People have tried. It's hard. He's the best.
    ```

  - u/notmy2ndopinion:
    ```
    In the words of Newton, we "stand upon the shoulders of giants." The past shapes the present and anyone who is great now can in part attribute their success to past works.

    No one can deny the influence of Shakespeare has had on the structure of classic stories, memorable characters, famous quotations, etc. However, how many famous contemporary playwrights can you name? The process of writing has expanded far beyond plays into books, movies, web serials, video games, etc. that "best/greatest" is now being broken down into subcategories.

    It would take a very prolific and versatile writer to tap into the different markets of today's world and have the same influence as Shakespeare on English literature and writing for future generations for someone to say "yep. Definitely better than that guy."
