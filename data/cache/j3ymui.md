  The paper says that after a change in the timeline is made, a vague process labelled "w" occurs that changes it back.  There is no indication of how or why that would happen though.  It just says "if time is consistent and everyone at any time has free will, then if it wasn't consistent, something would happen to make it consistent."  Nowhere does it disprove the many worlds version of time travel, as w would be unnecessary if you were now in a new universe.

    I've seen the argument that the "many world" version of time travel is simply doesn't count as time travel as there it's impossible to travel to *your* past - you always end up in another timeline that is independent.

      If it's the same in every way then the saying its not your own past is just pointless semantics.

  First off: This is a terrible paper to use as a basis for generalizations about CTCs.  It talks about very specific dynamic processes that aren't really applicable to most circumstances. Maybe start with something by [Kip Thorne](https://www.its.caltech.edu/~kip/index.html/PubScans/II-121.pdf) if you want something technical. Or just the [wikipedia article on CTCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_timelike_curve).

  Second: Yes, CTCs are solutions to general relativity equations that allow for time travel--specifically of the "you can't change the past" variety.  That isn't to say, necessarily, that the past cannot be changed (ie, that you can't create multiple timelines). It means that you can't change the past with a CTC. CTCs take you to the past of the current timeline, where you cannot change things. 

  The Many-Worlds Interpretation is a completely different phenomena (and not at all related to time travel or coin flips or the like, but that's a different topic).

    Doesn't MWI have consequences for relativity-compatible time travel such as wormholes?

    If you take two entangled particles, one up & one down, and take them a lightyear apart, and measure which you have it'll reveal you're in the world where the other particle is the opposite. But that information of which world you're in can only propagate at lightspeed, so if you step through you're wormhole to the other particle a lightyear away then the world on the otherside is still indeterminate and you could step into the other world where the particles have resolved the other way round when measured.

    In fact, since natural entanglement happen all the time, wouldn't all wormholes lead to other worlds in the MWI sense?

  I have only skimmed it. The paper mentions quantum physics in the preamble but the actual analysis seems to be based on classical physics.

  The paper proves that it's possible to time travel using CTCs without causing a Grand Farther Paradox. 

  It also proves that you'll be able to have freedom of choice in two scenarios as long as all other scenarios are kept consistent, i.e.. you can only have two scenarios that can be influenced by what happens in the other scenarios.

  It seems to more have the "you can't change the past" as a parameter and a process called W will happen to bring the past in line with the expected future.

  As for the many-worlds interpretation this has little to no influence. It only talks about time travel within the same timeline. Nothing is mentioned when changing between different timelines.
