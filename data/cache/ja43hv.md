  Jun is a precious gem and he deserves more love.

  Regarding Ana's plan... oof. She really shouldn't be surprised that she made her already volatile nation erupt into riots, nor should she be surprised that her "loyalists" (read: reactionaries) are just as violent as the members of Commonplace. I'd say I don't know what she was expecting, except it's pretty clear she just didn't think that far ahead. She's been operating on gut feelings and emotional leaps for a while now, mostly because thinking too hard about what she's doing or why she's doing it tends to cause pretty severe emotional distress. Which is understandable, considering it means thinking about questions like "is the government I've idolized my whole life actually a brutally repressive regime?" and "do the terrorists I've been fighting, who I've witnessed commit multiple atrocities, actually have legitimate grievances with the status quo I've been upholding?" That being said, she should probably knuckle down and figure her shit out before making any more bold moves, unless she wants to accidentally start a civil war.

  It's okay, Ana. You did your best, and you couldn't know it would turn out th... wait, no, you could absolutely predict that this would be the outcome, and also you did it on an impulse for selfish reasons with no regards to how it would impact your friends and/or innocent people. This isn't okay at all. Fuck you, Ana.

  That said, the rest of the team really share some responsibility. They should *really* have known better than to give Ana a platform without proofreading her at first.

  So Ana's plan is essentially race-baiting? Like, the people are supposed to know to go after the "bad" Shenti, but leave the good ones alone... and she's surprised that this started a race war on top of a civil war?

  Her obsession with Tunnel Vision really is taking a dark turn.

    Her plan wasn't just race-baiting, her plan was to air all of Commonplace's dirty laundry (that she knew about, anyway). The Shenti tie was part of that, and she definitely emphasized it, but her speech is better summarized as "don't trust Commonplace because they're monsters who don't actually care about you" than as "don't trust Commonplace because they're controlled by the Shenti". 

    I agree the reaction to her speech was predictable, but it's not like she yelled "kill all Shenti!" and then was shocked when there was violence against Shenti. She thought she was discrediting Commonplace by, among other things, tying it to foreign backers, and failed to account for just how racist and xenophobic her countrymen were.

    > Her obsession with Tunnel Vision really is taking a dark turn.

    The fixation on Tunnel Vision isn't what's driving her actions, it's just a symptom of a broader problem. The real issue is that she's incapable of accepting criticism of the ruling regime or the status quo. Her plan here wasn't even focused on Tunnel Vision, it was instead her best effort at helping the Principality fight Commonplace despite being a wanted fugitive in the Principality. 

    The Tunnel Vision thing is just her brain's way of ignoring any time someone affiliated with Commonplace makes a legitimate argument that she can't deny or dismiss. She just goes "oh, well, they work with Tunnel Vision, so whatever they say they're still okay with hurting lots of people so actually nothing they say matters." It's a psychological defense mechanism preserving her worldview, not her actual motivation.

      She basically handed the racists the justification they needed to drag Shenti from their homes for treason and was okay with that. From her own words we can see she was counting on hatred for the Shenti more than anything else.

      >And it accepts billions in military equipment from its real backer: Shenti Warlords.  The foreign monsters who almost destroyed this world are now conspiring to break our nation from within.”

      >That was the strongest bit.  The mob, Wethers, scams – those were all bad, but after the war, **Principians hated the Shenti more than the rest of them combined.**

      And she's definitely taking advantage of a racial divide. Look at the language she uses

      >“But **these monsters scare me more than anything else**.”  The recording raised its voice.  “So, to the citizens of the Principality.  If you believe in order.  If you still love this nation, despite its flaws.  If you still believe in magic.  **I ask you to fight.  Beat back the Shenti**, and their puppets.  Take back the Principality.”

      She's basically asking them to go out and form lynch mobs. It sounds like something you'd hear at a Klan rally in the 60s.

      Even internally, she thinks playing the people against the Shenti is her strongest card.

      >I nodded.  In my speech, I’d mentioned Afzal Kahlin – connected him to the mob, Commonplace, and **most importantly, the Shenti**.  It wouldn’t be legal evidence, but if it turned public opinion enough, it might help bring action against the Broadcast King, wipe out the Ebbridge’s debt, earn favor from his mother.

        > “But these monsters scare me more than anything else.” 

        I took this to be a reference to Commonplace rather than the Shenti. Looking back, it's unclear which specifically she's referring to, which is admittedly sort of the problem.

        I'm not saying there's not a race-baiting element to things, just that I wouldn't say her plan was "just race-baiting." If you look at how she speaks and how she thinks about things as well as how she reacts to her speech's reception, it's pretty clear she wasn't trying to encourage people to "form lynch mobs." Her words were taken that way pretty easily, and that's frankly not surprising, but that wasn't her intention.

        I think the disconnect between her expectation and the public at large's reaction is because when she thinks and says "Shenti," she's thinking "rich foreign warlords supplying money and arms," whereas the public at large is thinking "someone who looks like Jun." I think she was going for "tool of a foreign government" rather than "~~Jewish~~ Shenti conspiracy." She seems to be thinking in national rather than ethnic terms and is genuinely horrified when people take her words differently than how she intended. She thought the Shenti thing would hit hard because it's the country they were at war with not long ago, not because her countrymen are racist fucks.

        Moreover, she focusses on more than just the Shenti thing. Yes, she thinks the Shenti thing will be the most effective part, but her speech reads as a big list of reasons why Commonplace is bad rather than a list of reasons to attack your Shenti neighbor. She's clearly trying to vilify Commonplace by using (among other things) its Shenti ties rather than the other way around. While she was playing off existing nationalist and xenophobic sentiment, she wasn't trying to incite racial violence.

        Obviously she fucked up and she *did* inspire lynch mobs and she clearly shouldn't have given that speech, I'm just saying that she didn't go on the radio trying to ruin Commonplace by getting innocent Shenti people beaten in the streets. Her plan was to discredit Commonplace by painting them as monstrous and insincere in their beliefs as well as tools of a foreign power. She just REALLY didn't think things through.

        Holy shit, yes. Reading it a second back, her speech is even worse than I thought.
