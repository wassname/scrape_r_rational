  It's not as much completed as discontinued. Interesting read though, I liked the idea behind it.

    I *may* have posted this part way through my reread when I saw that it was marked complete, but hadn't finished yet. 

    Still an amusing read in the way it plays with some conventions, and the meta commentary in the notes.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Interesting read, but it started to be kinda boring and repetitive somewhere after ch6-7
  ```

- u/zajhein:
  ```
  The ideas were fun for a while but each chapter started to feel less and less connected to the last, culminating in just a mishmash of loosely connected thoughts.
  ```
