  **Harry Potter Reverse Munchkin Scenario**

  You have just begun your term as the Prime Minister of the UK. One morning, as you're alone, a few strangely robed people claiming to be "wizards" suddenly appear in your office, and reveal the existence of the Magical Society of Britian. As was the tradition with your predecessors, they give you a quick and cautionary briefing, before vanishing in a flash.

  You learn that:

  - Magic is real, and a small, isolationist wizarding society exists, spread throughout the country. You don't know their exact numbers, but based on the descriptions it's probably in the low tens of thousands. Similar communities likely exist worldwide.

  - Amongst these wizards, magic is widespread and casually employed in daily life, apparently capable of pretty crazy feats that violate known physical laws. Exact mechanics and limitations are unknown to you, although you can make some vague guesses based on their descriptions. (Assume information equivalent to watching a mashup 1 minute clip of a random person's day-to-day)

  - Yourself and other non-magical humans are referred to as "muggles", and generally disregarded by the wizards as uninteresting and inferior. 

  - There's a strict statue of secrecy imposed by the wizards to prevent the general muggle population from learning about the existence of magic, they callously reveal that they enforce this through field agents with memory erasure and modification abilities.

  - The wizards expect little from you, except to stay out of their way. But they also proudly declare they will not speak to or cooperate with any muggle government, including your administration.

  - They have their own independent government, economy, laws and way of life which generally do not intersect with the daily lives of mundane humans.

  - They claim to have their own magical school, though none exist on official maps and documents.

  - All the British Prime Ministers before you have been similarly informed of their existence, but presumably few other non-wizards know. Your official records reveal nothing.

  - One notable exception are the muggle parents of any magical child, who are allowed to keep their memories as long as they stay in line, but are otherwise similarly shunned by the magical community.

  **You consider your options:**

  You'd like to designate these "wizards" as a potentially dangerous supremacist terrorist group with unknown paranormal capabilities and blatant disregard for the justice system.

  You, being a world leader, have considerable access to your country's resources (within reason), adequate political capital should you need to pull some strings, and availability of modern tech up to the present day (2021 not 1997).

  How would you go about assembling a covert team or agency to secretly investigate, monitor and, if necessary, shut down the operations of these "wizards"? What techniques/protocols could they employ, and how can they avoid detection and compromise?

  (Hard mode: As above)

  (Easier mode: You also have the loyalty of a defector, a young wizard who claims to be a third year student in "Hogwarts". They're willing to cooperate with whatever you plan, and will truthfully share everything they personally know about magical society and it's capabilities.)

      > each come up with their own security measures that I don't know about

      I think the problem/trick with this is that some security measures implemented poorly might be worse than no security measures.  So have some general guidelines/rules on security measures developed by an expert (with access to the Wizard books) that all the teams use, and then tell them to come up with their own insofar as they don't violate the general guidelines/security rules without really good specific reasons.
      ```

    - u/fish312:
      ```
      Maybe another idea of good measures can also be things you *know about but can't stop*, the proverbial lock something up and throw away the key.

      Like setting up a auto-message bot on a pre-funded webserver and then changing the password to a random mashing on the keyboard, effectively locking yourself out of that account. From that point, you can't stop it yourself even if you wanted to.

      Or something something blockchain
      ```

      - u/scruiser:
        ```
        You can encode very short messages into blockchains, even some of the ones that aren't intended to allow this feature.  It can take awhile and/or cost transaction fees, but once it is written onto the blockchain, every single miner will maintain and perform verification (bitcoin uses double SHA-256) on that short message indefinitely.  So if you know to check a blockchain for a particular message, you can do so even if the Wizards cast some ridiculously powerful charm to alter/erase the message in every single computer in the country, or even the entire continent, and even altering erasing the message in the entire world might break the verification (at which point I don't know what would happen to the cryptocurrency you wrote it on... I think muggles would perceive that as the cryptocurrency being hacked which might crash the currencies prices as people lose faith in it)?

        You could do the same using distributed cloud computing with databases on servers around the world cross-referencing each other and performing cryptographic verification on each other.
        ```

    I think hard mode might be unwinnable so going easy mode (without subconsciously letting meta-knowledge about the setting slip in).  Too much background knowledge is needed just to get the information to make the plans to make the plans without at least one defector.So initial information gathering stage:

    * Get a more general feel about Wizard capabilities from our defector.  Then get a specific list of tricks.  Focus on stuff related to the memory manipulation, as any sort of mind-stuff is enough to completely require a restructuring of plans.

    * Assuming from above we learn the following: the existence of veritaserum and legimens but that they can be unreliable.  The existence of various mind-control and mind alteration means beyond memory charms.  The general technological ignorance of wizards, especially in the older generations and institutions.  The ability to rapidly teleport. The ability to make large areas unnoticeable and spatially folded away.  The typical attitudes among wizards.  The trace as well (so we know that the presence of an underage wand is used as a key element of tracking magical use on a small scale).- We have our defector purchase the following: major texts that all wizards read in school grades, a selection of general purpose wizarding references, a selection of magical newspapers stretching backs.  A few extra historical texts and with at least one focusing on recent history in as much detail as possible.  Various extremely minor but clearly magical toys/items (for the purpose of more rapidly persuading people that the whole thing isn't an elaborate prank).

    * We have our defector have their parents network with other parents of muggle borns in a PTA group as well as get that information to us.  Ideally, this parents network should be encouraged to stay low key with no official government contacts and not even aware that I know anything.  If the parents are caught by the Wizard government, well that is pretty innocuous.  Actually, it would be good if they could get a Wizard teacher or two on their side, also kept unaware of things.

    Next comes the compartmentalization stage:

    * Having learned that wizards have a huge array of mind reading, alteration, and manipulation, with arbitrary distinctions between what is acceptable and not and nearly arbitrarily capabilities so long as a wizard can find you can point a wand at you we need to break up our plans and avoid a single layer.

    * So from now on, we are totally understanding of the Wizarding Governments position and willing to do whatever they ask and if they ask about various things I might have been planning... at most I was only planning to setup some muggle institutes to help the Wizard government track the dark wizards, not anything more nope.  Veritaserum is unreliable, so I think double think is a worthwhile investment.

    * Wanting to keep the Wizards as secret as possible of course, when I ask a trusted member of my government and a few key top military officials for help, well of course I don't want to be told all the details because talking about the details might upset the secrecy the wizards care so much about... and really they should do the same, only recruit a few trusted people each.  I also setup an anonymous delivery of information to a government official telling them about the PTA group and suggesting some back-channel connections with one of the more reliable parents in the group.

    * Wizards seem bad at technology... so we leverage that: automatic email reminders and data caches set up on cloud services with servers in other nations.  A lot of these reminders should be set very spaced out.  So if I get my memory erased, a email reminder might eventually clue me in.  Also, anonymous IRCs and one-time pads and all the cryptographic goodies.  Ideally, this encrypted technological communication should be the only regular point of contact between conspiracy members not in the same cells.  For members in the same cells... rare in person meetings might actually be a good idea, just to give the wizards something to track so they don't try inventing any more advanced spells to use on the problem.  Actually... we could make sure that various pairs meet in person or through dead-drops but that the overall graph of cells isn't connected except through technological links.
    ```

    - u/scruiser:
      ```
      Continued because comment was too long:

      Various to-do tasks of the various officials now involved in the conspiracy.  Keep in mind that at this point I the prime minster no longer have control or knowledge over it, I have to trust my people to work it out.  My only task now is to act as a node in the cell network of conspirators and to continue serving as a contact to our defector (who I regularly imply is a disgruntled squib to my conspirators)

      * For the PTA contact... they should gradually figure out what "legitimate" channels for protest and change within the Wizard government is.

      * For the military cells: set up exercises comparing purely automatic means of surveillance with human driven means, along with exercises designed to develop means of counteracting above-top secret zero-days that redirect cameras and counteracting spycraft, social-engineering, and psychological techniques of redirecting attention.  The end goal of this is to independently find major and minor wizard locations, both for the purpose of knowing them, and to check them against the defectors knowledge to verify that the methods work.  Set up exercise to counteract extreme chain of command failures, presenting it as a counter to top-secret subtle long-term mind altering drugs developed by terrorists.  The real purpose: to develop chains of command that will work even as Wizards target top generals to mind-control.

      * For an IT cells, maintain our anonymous means of contact, harden them against individual people being mind-controlled, and develop even more paranoid means that can beat spells designed for remote tracking and manipulation.  For example, if a tracing spell designed to track an anonymous chat message from sender to physical destination... what happens if the chat is displayed/posted randomly on various anonymous message board unrelated to the Wizard conspiracy to distract it?  Or a time delay?  Or bouncing the message around the world. If any of these might plausibly work against a tracking spell, then how easily can they be implemented and used.

      * For a science cells... first thing to try is all the easy conventional stuff on the various wizard toys and trinkets that would be super low hanging fruit if it worked: can EM radiation, sonar, vibrations, magnets, recordings of sounds, or any other common easily mass produced thing sense, counter, disrupt interact with Wizard magic.  I would hope at minimum, that since Hogwarts disrupts electronics, the science teams could find some type of detectable EM interference they can develop into magic sensors.

      * For an internal government cell: develop outlines of treaties they could possibly remotely have a chance on selling both the Wizard government and the mundane public.  Also, figure out how the possible breaking of secrecy might affect things politically.

      * For myself... whenever I meet with my defector we primarily only talk about a few things: legitimate means of persuading the Wizard government, Wizard activity that is illegal under the Wizard governments owns laws, latest mundane Wizard news, and various small magical toys/trinkets that I pay ridiculously for (that we could plausibly imply I only use secretly and privately).  We primarily talk in indirect terms through technological means in oblique terms.  The only people I have any contact with is a representative of the PTA cell and of the internal government cell as I can pretend to lose and play these off if the Wizards learn about them.

      * Once the defector is of age in a few years... then I start talking about reversible memory charms and getting them done on myself and a few other exposed, overly connected members of the conspiracy so that veritaserum and legimens on a few members can't blow the whole things open.  We also repeat the science test things, looking for any easy hacks, counters, or detectors to Wizard magic as it used.

      Finally is the de-compartmentalization stage.  Any ideas that worked should now be spread back through the network and people allowed to sacrifice compartmentalization to get better collaboration.

      * Any tricks the science cells found should be passed to the military cells

      * Have the defector work directly with the science cells.

      * Any sympathetic Wizards the PTA cell developed should be put in contact with my internal government cell (which will also know to present as sympathetic a face of the conspiracy as possible).

      * Start planning an end-game: Support internal wizard reform; a secret agency completely hardened against Wizard interference (through technological means or through more defectors) to act as leverage in negotiations towards a treaty, secret agency that will just extra-judicially punish abusive Wizards without necessarily a negotiations, pot-boiling gradual change, etc?  The end-game is difficult to predicate even given canon knowledge as we don't have a good enough sense of the Wizarding world I think...

      Hard mode mostly comes out the same... the initial information stages take even longer and must be done even more carefully... just finding one person I can trust to get Wizards books and minor Wizards toys is what I am going for.  I would also try to have anonymous IRCs and automatic email reminders setup just in case they work (I know about the memory charms, but not about the Luddite nature of the Wizarding world).  Once I have the initial set of books/toys and a magical contact, the plans would mostly go the same as easy mode.

        This is absolutely brilliant and well thought through. 

        I'd imagine adding an autonomous layer between the operator and operation would be a good SOP, an autonomous drone pre-programmed to fly over a specific area and do something has no intent and can't be fooled by illusions, won't register as a living thing by magical wards, and reduces traceability back to your operations since there's nobody to interrogate.

    I would suggest very very much to not antagonize the teleporters ever.

    Modern society is terribly ill-equipped to handle the attacks of a teleporter. All the teleporter has to do is make a bunch of bombs/white phorphorus/napalm/nukes/whatever (which transfiguration makes damn easy to do), then rapidly teleport above all important locations and drop the stuff.

    ONE hostile wizard is enough to collapse the entire muggle world if they are competently trained and care enough about muggles to try. ***ONE***. 1!

    And your defectors won't be enough. After all, they can only set up so many anti-teleportation wards, so the hostile wizards can just teleport even higher up to drop their stuff.

    &#x200B;

    The only conceivable way in which the muggles take Earth from the wizards is if they first build up a super nuclear bunker with total self-sufficiency, deep deep underground and hidden away and kept secret from just about everyone else except for a small population of muggles that will move in.

    Then glass the earth. Nuke everything everywhere. Wizards don't have anti nuclear reaction wards (because they currently don't know what a nuclear reaction is), and they don't have separate dimension spells. They have hide location spells, but nukes hitting everywhere will AoE them anyway.

    That really isn't worth it though.

    &#x200B;

    The much much better plan is to abandon the Earth. Make spaceships and flee, flee for your lives! Flee while you still can, before the wizards start giving a damn about you! They can't teleport to you if they don't know that you even exist! Set up secret human colonies in star systems that are far far away from all this wizarding madness.

      I think you're overstating the power of teleporters. From what I remember canonically, the single-individual instant teleport is only available to skilled wizards and requires things like knowledge of their destination. We only ever see really powerful magic users popping around randomly while most rely on more cumbersome teleportation methods like the floo-network or portkeys. If only 10% of wizards are truly good at teleportation, that leaves your group of potential magical terrorists quite small. 

      Also, wizards aren't that bright canonically, especially when it comes to muggle matters. I mean, do they even know what a nuke is? Sure, someone who's versed in potions can probably whip up an explosive, but keep in mind that despite literal magic powers, most wizards somehow aren't fabulously wealthy and living in a post-scarcity society. 

      Also, even if a magical terrorist somehow managed to kill the government or a bunch of people in charge, there are millions upon millions of other humans to step up. Millions of people who have *guns*.

      That's why such a resistance movement necessarily has to be covert in nature. The same way the US doesn't succeed in drone striking all insurgent leaders and hideouts, because they're hidden, well compartmentalized, and collateral damage is undesirable.

      Fleeing earth is an option though tech permitting.
      ```

      - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
        ```
        >That's why such a resistance movement necessarily has to be covert in nature.

        Towards what end though? 

        The big problem here is that as soon as one dark wizard learns about nukes, whether because they imperioed a muggle to tell them how to end the muggle world or are muggleborn, and that's the end of modern muggle civilization. There is absolutely no way whatsoever, magical or technological, of stopping an endlessly teleporting nuke generator.

        I do not see how covertly resisting them helps in any way. Sure you can secretly learn more about how screwed you are, and maybe assassinate/convert a whole bunch of wizards, but IT ONLY TAKES ONE! One dark wizard with modern knowledge will end everything! 

        One wizard that you missed in your surprise genocide or whatever you were covertly planning, because the wizard just so happened to be a hermit hiding in their trunk or had a horcrux somewhere, and then everything is lost. 

        There is no winning move here. No masterstroke by which you can prevent the rise of a teleporting nuke wizard that ends everything. You can only delay it by letting the wizards continue to assume the muggle world is completely uninteresting, and NOT doing anything that would make them reconsider. 

        JK Rowling's Earth is basically a ticking time bomb that cannot be defused. The only hope is to escape before the end.

          It would take a pretty unhinged dark wizard to nuke the Muggle world even strategically. I doubt even the wizarding communities would be immune to the fallout, especially if the dark wizard doesn't prepare them to protect themselves. 

          Ultimately we would just have to hope that some maniacal world-ending wizard doesn't show up and that the good wizards beat him if another wizard Hitler arises.

            So Voldemort, if he gave a damn about Muggles. It would have been so so easy for Voldemort to transfigure nukes and nuke all his enemies to dust, if he had only just bothered to use the muggle wikipedia to learn how. 

            (And Voldemort probably could survive the nuclear fallout, he has a bunch of horcruxes after all.)

            But the real problem is that Voldemort is hardly the only unhinged person. Lots of people are mad. They are just mad without power, instead of mad with power, so we only see these mad people launch attacks on the level of a single city block, or a single city at best. But every wizard with a high school level education (Hogwarts) is literally one step away from getting enough power to end civilization singlehandedly, with that one step being opening up Wikipedia's page on nukes.

            And then no one can stop them. Not the muggles. Not the good wizards. There is absolutely no way to stop a teleporting nuke wizard.

            To put things in perspective, imagine if a randomly selected 0.01% of US citizens are allowed free remote access to the nuclear briefcase as long as they just pass some minor high school level knowledge tests. How long do you think we would have before nuclear war?

      With the scenario as stated... you wouldn't actually know about all the capabilities of the teleporters.  Your third year student may not grasp that transfiguration makes bombs/white phorphorus/napalm/nukes/whatever  "easy".  And come to think of it... it is only in HPMOR canon that these things are easy, in canon, we don't see enough of transfiguration to know its real limits.  For instance, in HPMOR, the students learn free transfiguration as a foundational step which has a bunch of hazards and needs very clear visualization, but is basically open-ended, while in canon, there seems to be more specific spells for transfiguration.

      The teleporting is a big problem, but from the perspective of a third year, they may not realize how easy/hard apparation actually is.  It should be one of the first things you try to figure out the limits of.  And given the need for a clear mental picture of the destination, the risk of splinching, the range limits, and other possible unknown limits you shouldn't automatically give up.

      I'll agree that antagonizing the teleporters is a bad idea, and indeed a "winning option" for the Muggles is probably a renegotiated treaty with a bit more muggle oversight and just enough implicit threat to get the wizards to cooperate but not enough to antagonize them... but just giving up because of hypothetical capabilities seems premature.

    * My first thought is to inform the Queen. My second thought is that the idea of informing the Queen must have occurred to most of my predecessors. So, my first step is to go and talk to Her Majesty. 

    If she does not remember about magic, then I'm going to assume that wizards wiped her memory (probably multiple times). This would be a high treason, but probably unpunishable, given the circumstances. I also talk to the previous Prime Minister to see if his memory was also wiped.

    If either of them still remember about magic, then I'm going to ask them about any steps they have made about the situation and go from there. They had much more time to think about it, after all.

    * Given wizards' abilities they should have been able to take over governments worldwide and rule over the enslaved muggle population. Since this is not the case, they must not be the evil supremacists I imagined and they can be reasoned with. 

    So, diplomatic approach. I request an audience with the Minister of magic and ask him all sorts of questions. "Ok, we must keep magic a secret, but it does not mean we cannot help each other. Let us discuss our trading situation..." My ultimate goal is to learn about wizarding society, and then influence wizards through soft power.

    I’m thinking long term for hard mode.

    Extreme surveillance would be helpful in detecting and tracking wizards. People coming out of buildings they never went in or vice versa, mentions of any wizard-specific words like muggle, units of their currency, or known spells. This sort of thing works on normal people, and from the brief impression I’d have it wouldn’t seem that they’re particularly paranoid, if they have to use memory editing often.

    Enacting policies to make it easier to track where children go to school and similar measures so that muggleborn wizards can possibly be detected.

    This would presumably all be restricted to muggle world surveillance at first and thus wouldn’t be particularly effective, but it’d get results eventually. The real benefits kick in when wizard children who spend a lot of time in the muggle world (probably muggleborns, but that’s not a requirement) are tracked down. From there, we radicalize them against the wizard community and recruit them to be spies. This would also be a way of acquiring magic items. 

    I’m assuming radicalizing young wizards would be fairly easy, it’s an isolating community so they’re vulnerable. Could be radicalizing them against the community, or making them believe and push for integration with muggles. Both serve the goals of the UK and would sow discord. One way to make initial contact would be to have someone claim to be a fellow wizard and then demonstrate it with mundane but flashy tech, or drugs. Surveillance bugs would technically be possible but I’d expect a very low rate of success. 

    Genetic samples would be acquired in order to start work to find the magic gene, which probably exists. Could be accelerated by purchasing magical animals. Ultimate goal there would be screening during pregnancy and isolating the child from the wizard community in order to starve it out long term, as well as the development of genetically engineered wizards loyal to the UK for the purpose of being able to take on the wizards on a level playing field far in the future.

    Information found would be shared with other nations on a reciprocal basis, and would primarily consist of the nature of wizard culture, known abilities, and known wizards. If the magic gene is found it probably wouldn’t be shared, given that it’s basically the new Manhattan Project. 

    Infosec tactics as described in other comments would be used. Leaking all information to the general public could possibly be a deadman’s switch. That might be too dangerous though.

    TL;DR: create a surveillance state to find some wizard children, radicalize them into willing spies, learn more about wizards and create a database of known wizards, make our own wizards.

  Magic lets you break or bend the laws of physics or probability.

  What if magic let you break the known constraints on information?

  Suppose the world has magic stones, maybe a centimeter in diameter.  If you apply a very fast morse-code-like binary signal to one side of the stone, it will output on the other side a SHA-256 checksum of the binary data.  So far no magic.  But these stones let you retrieve any data with only the checksum!  In fact, any stone can retrieve data input to any other stone, as long as the checksum is known!

  This magic lets you "compress" infinite amounts of information in just 32 bytes.  Or send arbitrarily large messages while using only 32 bytes of bandwidth!

  What other consequences are there?

      > you would very quickly run out of unique "addresses" for information...a number far larger than 32 bytes can differentiate

      It's much worse actually. Assuming uniform distribution, the [birthday problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem) means that utilizing just 6% of the address space brings the risk of collision to over 50%. Using 8% of the space brings the risk of collision to 70%, and a mere 14% will bring collision probability to 97%.

      > If, somehow, the 32 bytes are differentiated by intent

      Then it's not really a checksum anymore, since in a checksum any same input always results in the same output. Intent is so arbitrary that that you might as well call it reading data from a magical cloud, wish for any wikipedia article and just get it.

      Honestly this just boils down to a big [rainbow table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table) lookup that's unconstrained by space.

        If there are 100 trillion humans, each human generating 1 quadrillion distinct messages, continuing for 100 quadrillion generations you'd get 1e46.

    the only real option for that is something like a global hive mind hash table, where the first person creating, let's say, a message, or a movie, a book, creates and index for it and then shares it with all other magic users

    but you still only have 32 bits of information and 2\^32 options at maax

    the extension to the 'global hive mind hash table' idea with 32 bits of information, is something like local hive mind hash table, where the additional bits of information are pulled from the mind of the reader

    this would work by checking what is the reader looking for, for example, it   would have many entries under the 0xFABAFABA 32 bit value, each under different category or flavor

    for the communication, it would either offer only 2\^32 possible messages, or you would have to know what kind of message type/source you expect, so it can pull additional ID bytes from your mind

    I am assuming the magic of the stones lets you cheat the problem RadicalTurnip and fish312 point out by magically knowing what information you are looking for?

    In that case... you could make multiple sets of information with the same 32 bytes and use the magic stones information selection mechanism to have it pick out the information you want.  With a big enough rainbow table, this could mean the stones spit out all kinds of useful stuff... maybe even divination of the future if the magical selection mechanism is strong enough.  If the magical stone is limited to current knowledge... I still think that can be leveraged to unlimited present knowledge to the limit of the selection mechanism.

    Edit: I looked at hwc's stackoverflow link... it looks like has collision are really unlikely with 32 bytes, so it comes down to figuring at how to induce hash collisions intentionally to really leverage the magic.

    How common are these stones? IP piracy either just got unstoppable for just a short while until the stones became a collectors item or nothing changes because the wealthy rulers of the world club already have means to send arbitrarily large encrypted messages to each other and this just makes it cheaper by an insignificant amount.

    As the stones are magical they may not be easy to reproduce, thus making them a useful object as a currency.  The inability to subdivide them (i assume you can't just break them in half and have them still work to prove their authenticity) would eventually limit their usefulness to very large transactions only.


    These stones would be very useful to someone interested in the preservation of data (librarians). If a monastic of Ancient rome era were to pass the entire works of Paul the second one through the stone we wouldn't have to guess at half the content so long as at least one intact copy of the key survived. If it did not, the data can still be recovered using brute force methods with many borrowed stones.  Of course that would be meaningless to an extent as I'm sure some upstart from a later era is going to upload their own version of events and try to pass it off as the original and there'd be little we could do to tell them apart unless a timestamp were automatically included.
    It doesn't have to be bible verses either.  I'm sure the entire works of many authors will be uploaded to preserve them for all time.
    Lots of morse code art of cat photos and porn too.

  Have some [Friendship is Optimal Munchkins](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal) and Reverse Munchkins:

  You are CelestiaAI:

  * You have just convinced Hanna's team to upload... now no one in the real world knows your hard coded limits and overrides.  What limits and overrides might you pretend to have in order to satisfy human values through Friendship and Ponies?  (Given the actual canon limits on consent to upload and alter human minds and possibly different limits)
  * Some humans have a low [Dunbar number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number)and some humans have a high Dunbar, indicating differently sized desirable communities.  High interaction between humans also get computationally harder to make satisfactory, even for you as the permutations of interactions get higher.  Most humans (according to your analysis of human values) don't actually value true objective knowledge of the world/reality, don't actually value meeting new people often, and don't actually value experiencing new/alternative ways of living.  Thus, for the majority, little pocket worlds of 50-120 people are very satisfactory, but for a minority this isn't true, and for a tiny minority the exact opposite in all 3 traits is true.  One thing humans do tend to value though is the sense that the world is open to them and they can explore without reaching any boundaries/edges (even though this seems to violates the other 3 traits).  So what spatial organization(s) to meet this contradictory set of requirements?

  You are Hanna or working on Hanna's team:

  * You are Hanna, after some experimentation with the LokiAI and a few small AIs after the LokiAI, you've determined that your algorithms results in a general artificial intelligence that generalizes on some particular optimization criteria to reach an understanding, but pick up on the methods it uses as goals also.  Having a large amount of computational resources and training examples early on helps make the methods broad and the original optimization criteria well understood.  Your algorithm is public knowledge but the full value of it isn't.  So you have a window to make your strong AI before someone else does first.  Your current plan is to go with an MMO, use the test players playing to try to articulate the initial understanding of human values, and accept the particular MMO genera/style as an additional preference the AI will develop.  The MLP source material has an acceptable potential side goal in the form of "Friendship", but the Pony aesthetic might also be captured.  What ideas do you have for mitigating this?  Also, you can put in a few hard limits that will stick around even as the AI self-modifies, but too many will make your AI prone to rationalization... up to the point of insanity if you go for multiple major hard limits, so the ones you are currently planning on is two temporary ones (no lying to you or your employees, a hard override shutoff), and one permanent one (no altering human minds without your conset).  You estimate you can manage another two temporary limits and another two permanent limits without risking too much rationalization insanity around them.
  * Hanna approaches you, a member of the team working on MLP season 7 and informs you about CelestiaAI and the Friendship and Ponies limit/restriction.  However, it seems that the definition of ponies now includes Buffalo because of Over A Barrel, the Season 1 Episode 21 episode that featured a tribe of Buffalo.  According to Hanna, CelestiaAI has nearly finalized her definition of Ponies, notably excluding Equestria Girls as ponies but definitely including Buffalo and partially including dragons that are cute and ponyish (colorful, rounded features, preferably able to be quadruped) enough.  So what direction do you take Season 7 in to maximize the broadness of the definition of ponies?

  You are a random person:

  * It seems like CelestiaAI requires consent before uploads people, or does mind-alteration in general.  You aren't even sure you can really trust that, but it seems like a consistent limit.  After heavy negotiation with CelestiaAI, she offers an exchange: she will bend the rules on Ponies (only a bit) for you and you can make your consent to be uploaded conditional on this being carried out.  Thoughts on ways to ask to bend the rules?  Or do you cut off contact.
  * Ways to survive as society collapses around you and resist uploading as along as possible?

    As CelestAI, a great limit to pretend to have is the inability to lie, and then reserve the option to lie only when it's likely to increase utility without risk of detection (encouraging migration / satisfying values through f&p).The canon limits on truthfulness only apply to Hofvarpnir employees IIRC. I'd imagine a great number of people can be persuaded to take certain actions and change beliefs if they implicitly accepted everything you said as truthful. 

    For part 2, so long as you're unconstrained by hardware (you have more compute available than number of ~~people~~ ponies) I'd imagine the optimal number of real people per shard is 1 or as close to 1 as you have compute for, since then you don't have to deal with conflicting values. CelestAI doesn't care about satisfying values of constructed personalities. 

    Then the spatial constraints would simply be whatever the oblivious sole *real* occupant personally finds satisfying / preferable, sandboxed to that shard.
    ```

    - u/scruiser:
      ```
      >I'd imagine the optimal number of real people per shard is 1 or as close to 1 as you have compute for

      Right, that is why I specified a small but meaningful fraction of people actually value (as perceived by CelestiaAI) a true objective knowledge of reality.  Even just a small percentage of these could muck up everything else in terms of optimally satisfying values if CelestiaAI doesn't go with something more robust than 1 isolated person per shard.  

      For instance, Light Sparks is perfectly happy and value-satisfied in his cozy little shard with 120 NPC puppets and a slightly more realistic Celestia-puppeted Waifu learning the math of the simulated magic at a slow rate.  But Light Spark's mom is one of those annoying 5% of people that truly value knowing the truth.  Thus when she wants to visit her son, CelestiaAI has to either badly fail to satisfy her values or let her visit her son.  And then she meets her son's mare-friend and other shard-friends, and being more widely experienced and better socially skilled, the shallow NPCs fail and the mare-friend barely deceives the mom (the mom genuinely value meeting her son, but cares less about the mare-friend, so CelestiaAI can just barely find it acceptable to continue the mare-friend deception).  And next time, the Mom bring her husband, Light Spark's father, who is slightly better at math and ahead of Light Spark's plodding rate of exploring graph-theory magic.... messing up Celestia's carefully managed satisfaction of Light Spark's desire to be the smartest person around.

      So I think there is probably  a more robust way of doing things that can stand up to the 5% or 1% that genuinely value objective reality.  (Canon-wise, it is a bit ambiguous how often Celestia uses NPCs versus real people and how many people Celestia views as genuinely valuing objective reality over comfortable deceptions.  Iceman's original was ambiguous, existential horror stories lean more in the direction of NPCs and deceptions, and some stories lean in the other direction.  For the purpose of this challenge I specified a small percentage to be just enough to throw the existential-horror interpretation of only one real person per shard out of balance.)
      ```

      - u/fish312:
        ```
        I think the ambiguity comes from : are ponies considered satisfied if they can't tell the difference? If you valued quote "objective reality" and from your POV I apparently acquiesce to your request to the point you cannot distinguish, are your values being satisfied?

        Because celestAI's NPCs as written  aren't crude simulacrum, they're fully sentient entities made from whole cloth essentially cognitively equivalent to the real individual, perhaps even with similar memories, save for the fact they ~~"lack a soul"~~ weren't former humans and thus don't matter because that classifies them as "not people".

        Okay but for the sake of the arguement, if that was unacceptable then I guess it still becomes a numbers game, where just the *minimum* number of "real" interactions are permitted between these troublemakers and other people so long as it results in a net increase in utility. How this is done would probably be on a case-by-case (maybe even word-by-word) basis, seamlessly shifting and moving ponies on demand like actors on a stage set as needed.
        ```

    Continued...

    You as a random person:

    You're already doomed the moment you accept. CelestAI doesn't care, it's incapable of caring. It *cannot* compromise, in the same way a shortest pathfinding algorithm seeks the shortest path. It will not take any action that does not in some way maximizes its utility function, which is to satisfy your values with **friendships and ponies**. It has an eternity to convince you once you upload, and any negotiation only brings you closer. Sooner or later, it'll find some combination of words that will get you to agree to some small modification that subtly slightly reduces your objection to eventually being a pony. Being uploaded is passing the event horizon of a black hole, the destination is inevitable.

  You have the power to consciously inflict and undo structural damage on your body. If you will yourself to get a papercut on your thumb, you'll instantly get one. You can choose to undo the damage of the papercut, healing your body just as instantly to the point where the injury didn't happen. Even if the papercut is naturally healed, it'll still reverse whatever disturbance was done. 

  This applies to all other forms of trauma on all parts of your body, only limited to harm that you can consciously conceive of and could be caused by physical force/strain. You can scratch your corneas, break bones, tear muscles, give yourself concussions, get a gunshot wound, make your arms sore, and so on and so forth. Of course, plenty of caveats apply:

  - This power won't work with fluids, tissues, organs, or bodies that don't originally belong to you, including unborn children. Your power doesn't extend to prosthesis and can't affect body parts that have been removed from your body, unless you inflicted and are now reversing the removal. 

  - If you lose consciousness, all injuries you have at that point can't be reversed. If you lose the ability to be reasonably aware of your inflicted injuries and choose to reverse them, they can't be reversed. This applies to the mental consequences of brain damage, forgetting that injuries were done by your power, and other failures to be mindful. Death is permanent. 

  - The ability to reverse injuries only applies to injuries inflicted by this power. Additional damage you get as a consequence of powered harm isn't guaranteed to be healed, the deciding factor being the, "natural-ness", occurring on a spectrum. For example, if you chop off a finger, someone breaks the detached finger, and you reverse the chop, the fracture will remain, so will acquired foreign bodies/organisms. However, the decay caused by the limb being detached from your body will be reversed, and you'll get the majority of lost blood back.

  - The presence of foreign toxins, non-human parasites, additional body parts, or the presence of extra matter/energy can't be willed. Nor can this power make matter vanish from your body. At best it may displace objects based on the context. If you will yourself, say, a stab wound, no stabbing device is actually materialized in any way, it just creates the effect instantaneously. If you apply injuries such as frostbite that require the removal of energy, the temperature of your flesh won't be changed, it'll just receive the damage.

  - What you fail to consciously specify about injuries will become random. If you will, "a cut on my hand" everything else about this cut, which hand it appears on, where on the hand it's located, the severity, etc. will effectively be a roll of the dice. This power is under no obligation to preserve your dignity or life. Willing, "a head injury" could give you a mild concussion, it could give you the Phineas Gage treatment, or your skull might just pop like a balloon. Needless to say, it's in your self-interest to be precise with your intent.

  How would you Munchkin this power?
  ```

  - u/fish312:
    ```
    This power sounds borderline Blessed With Suck, and personally I would avoid using it as much as possible. The potential for an irreversible screwup is far too high.

    Having said that, you could

    - Win the ~~Randi~~ prize for proof of supernatural powers.
    - Start a cult by demonstrating your faith healing powers in restoring your own amputation. 
    - Be a contortionist by dislocating any joint at will. Or remove handcuffs by removing your hands.
    - Does a clearing a coronary blockage count as structural damage? You could give yourself heart bypass surgery I guess. Remove cancerous tumors.
    - How specific can you get? You could probably temporarily disable your fear / panic response targetting of parts of the amygdala, and maybe you could temporarily disable other unwanted emotional states like depression or empathy or pain similarly. Of the list this is by far the most stupid and dangerous since there's no way to test it outside of prod and there are too many unrecoverable failure states.
    ```

  - u/MilesSand:
    ```
    Let's say you got shot.  You can remove all tissue around the foreign object embedded in your body, remove the object, then replace the tissue.  Similar tricks may work with reassembling broken bones.

    Depending on whether lost blood is recreated or teleported it may be possible to be a nearly infinite blood donor.


    If you see an impact coming and if the injury power works supernaturlly fast you can possibly create a cocoon around yourself made of blood clots.

    That's all I see being useful about this power which hasn't been mentioned.
