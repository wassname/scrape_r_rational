## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I'm going to recommend the book *[This is How you Lose the Time War](https://www.amazon.com/This-How-You-Lose-Time/dp/1534431004)* by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone.

  The story is about two rival agents from different utopian(ish) futures fighting across time to make sure their future is the one that actual happens, or arguably is more likely to happen.  It focuses on their letters and the relationship they develop over space and time.  I'm recommending it for two reasons.  One, it's very well written.  The prose is some of the most beautiful I've read recently and the imagery is frequently striking.  Two, the mechanics of time travel, though never explicitly discussed, are internally consistent and result in a brilliant conclusion that makes everything fall into place in a very satisfying way.

  That said, it's not particularly rational in that it focuses more on the characters feel than on what they think.  I can think of at least one time when a character makes a blatantly stupid decision, though in their defense they make the choice fully aware of the impending negative outcomes.

  It's also fairly short, so if you're looking for something sweet to pass the time, give this one a try!
  ```

  - u/PresN:
    ```
    I cannot recommend this highly enough; it's a novella so it won't take you long. The letters from both agents were written by different authors so you get a very strong difference in voice, and the story and writing is excellent. I'd argue that it is rational, though not rationalist- at every point, the characters are thinking about the potential and likely consequences of their choices before they make them, and even the "stupid" choice referenced above is taken with the explicit acknowledgement of the likely consequences for both options and the information they do and don't have about the causes leading to the choice- that emotions heavily play into the choice doesn't make it not a rational decision, in my opinion.

    huh... local library has 14 copies checked out, and 8 people on the wait list. no e-book tho. it is really amazing how much libraries do online these days. 

    as the library is apparently closed until april 30th, its a good thing they have stuff online. kinda makes it hard to check out physical books tho.
    ```

- u/BoxSparrow:
  ```
  I've recently reread a bit of Problem Sleuth, and am again amazed by how it can take completely ridiculous premises and use them to make a consistent and predictable 'magic' system and also a coherent story.

  Are there any other stories where the world or its mechanics are weird and whacky but the story and systems are completely coherent? Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett come to mind, though their plots aren't all that consistent either.

  I've been looking for good stories where the MC is a mage of some sort, and is reasonable but not necessarily rational. Bonus points if it has an interesting premise, or isn't as cliche as these tend to be..

  &#x200B;

  Some examples that I enjoyed: Delve, Cradle, MoL, Red Sister.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Pact by Wildblow might count, the MC is thrust into urban fantasy and has to learn magic, but he's always behind the curve on raw power/technique and needs to use non-magic cleverness to skate by.

    The Gods are Bastards may count too, it's a fantasy book with a lot of different MCs, some of them mages.
    ```

    - u/fassina2:
      ```
      Is pact super hero based ? If not I might give it a shot.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        No, it's urban fantasy. Similar genre to Dresden Files or Harry Potter where there's a hidden magic society in the modern world. It's pretty dark, if you have read Worm by Wildblow the themes/depressingness is similar.


        Also if you haven't read Dresden Files, they're a pretty good book series too. About a mage who's a private detective who uses magic to solve his cases, but usually gets pulled into larger plots of evil wizards when he starts investigating whatever the novel's plot is.
        ```

        - u/Nimelennar:
          ```
          >About a mage who's a private detective who uses to solve his cases, but usually gets pulled into larger plots of evil wizards when he starts investigating whatever the novel's plot is.

          Although, as the series goes on, there's less of that and more of him immediately being pulled into the plots of evil wizards at the start of the book, as a consequence of something that happened in a previous book.
          ```

        - u/xachariah:
          ```
          Pact is like Wildbow wrote worm then decided it was a bit too cheerful.

          The story is well written but couldn't keep reading with all the grimdarkness.
          ```

          - u/Bowbreaker:
            ```
            "Everything is horrible. Then it gets worse." is how I usually describe it to friends.

            But I have to say that at a paced read through it is better than it was either with waiting for updates or binging it.
            ```

      - u/SpiritLBC:
        ```
        Be warned it's peak wildbow's bleakness. Protagonist isn't making good choices because there are no good choices. There are much no stops on downward spiral of depression. I had to drop it halfway through because it was too much.
        ```

  - u/Solonarv:
    ```
    Most of Brandon Sanderson's cosmere stories fit the bill.

    *Warbreaker* is free to read (available on his website). Of the four viewpoint characters I remember (Siri, Vivenna, Vasher, Lightsong) one is a mage from the start, one gets magic midway through the book, one is sort of made of magic but can't use it for much.

    The main magic system in *Mistborn* is "burning" metals for some magical effect, like limited telekinesis or enhanced senses. All protagonists and many side viewpoint characters have access to some form of that magic.

    *Stormlight Archive*'s three main viewpoint characters all end up with magic, but only one of them has it from the start (and she doesn't know right away).

    *Elantris* is a bit of an outlier; nobody does any overt magic until the end, unless you count "being a zombie" as magic.

    The *Arcanum Unbounded* is a collection of short stories and novellas. All but two of them (a side story of a few pages, and a slightly longer story) have mage protagonists.
    ```

    - u/fassina2:
      ```
      I'm a Brando Sando reader myself. He's one of the best out there. Mistborn is incredible, most people here would love it. What if the evil immortal lord won ? How do you organize a rebellion against a tyrant godlike figure.

      /r/cremposting is going to make your day if you didn't know it existed..

    Pretty much anything by Lawrence Watt-Evans FWIW
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      Yeah, particularly his Ethshar novels. I think the grandparent poster would appreciate _With a Single Spell_, to make a specific recommendation - the main character is a mage, barely. As the title implies, he only knows a single spell. So he has to be clever and thoughtful to get the most out of it.
      ```

      - u/Teulisch:
        ```
        yup, Lawrence Watt-Evans is one of my favorite authors. it is a lot harder to find some of his newer stuff, you basically need to order it off amazon. 

        Ethshar is a series of books about magic, from the perspective of a spellcaster, and explore the mechanics of how magic works. 'with a single spell' is an apprentice wizard who shows up in later books. 'the misenchanted sword' is earlier in the timeline. other books cover warlocks, witches, and even sorcerers from the far north with their devices, and demonologists.

  Recommending Peerless Dad. This has been my favorite manga/ manhwa ever since I found it last year. 

  &#x200B;

  Brief summary: The story follows the life of a powerful martial artist after his wife dies in labor and leaves him with 3 kids and no family support or stable job. 

  At it's root, it's a martial arts story but it's very different from the norm. The MC isn't a teenager murder hobo causing trouble and picking fights. He's just an adult man, with responsibilities doing the best he thinks he can for his family.

  &#x200B;

  Not necessarily rationalistic but likely rational adjacent, the MC is a likable, reasonable and cautious person.  It's a different, more mature take on slice of life that's good and enjoyable even though I'm not normally into that genre. There's plenty of action but less than you'd expect in a martial arts story. 

  &#x200B;

  The pacing is wonderful with time passing, his kids are around 10 yo by chapter 100 and have their own personalities and are proper characters in and off themselves.

  &#x200B;

  It's a very feel good story that has become one of the main highlights of my week.

  Does anyone have recommendations for rational worm fanfics? I've read a dozen or so just by going to the worm section on spacebattles, but there's no way to really tell the tone of a story without just wading in, and lots of them are written over years and the quality changes by the end.
  ```

  - u/4t0m:
    ```
    I can add links later but:

    Cenotaph (and the rest of the Memorials series) by Notes.  Early Canon divergence where Taylor takes on the gangs and sets out to fix Brockton as a solo rogue/vigilante.  Very good.  2 "books" completed with a third on indefinite hiatus.

    Weaver Nine.  Jack Slash and Taylor switch places.  Jack is a manipulative young sociopath entering the cape scene in Brockton and Taylor is the leader of the Society, an organization determined to kill the endbringers.  Probably dead.

    Fling a Light by Redwavespectrum (or similar). 
    A great, short, take on Taylor with powers similar to doormaker.  Emphasis on non-combat applications of powers.  Dead, undergoing a rewrite.

    Seed by TheAnt.  Taylor with Blasto's power.  Focused on Taylor as she gains power and becomes a warlord of Brockton Bay.  Great worldbuilding.
    ```

    - u/Sonderjye:
      ```
      Thanks for the recs. I'll check out Cenotaph and Seed for sure.

      I was so bummed when Weaver Nine stopped updating. It was going interesting places.

  With [Deep in Pact](https://www.doofmedia.com/deep-in-pact/) having finished, the two hosts Elliot and Reuben are now looking for their next podcasting topic. Currently they're trying out several series, doing an episode on the first x installments each. Their first pilot episode, [On the Lamb](https://old.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/fopugj/on_the_lamb_arc_1_taking_root/), covering Wildbow's third work [Twig](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/), has just launched. This is the one I'm looking forward to the most, to be honest, you just don't get protagonists like Sylvester very often. Also the world just pretty fascinating.

  Other topics in coming weeks will include the Expanse, Dresden Files, Stand Still Stay Silent, and Sandman.

  I'm looking for space exploration related books. Preferable uplifting in tone, and moderately hard-scifi.

  Some books like this I really enjoyed:

   - Bobiverse trilogy by Dennis E. Taylor

   - Post Human by J. P. Koenig

   - House of Suns by Alastair Reynolds

   - Perilous Waif by E. William Brown

   - Vorkosigan Saga by Lois McMaster Bujold

   - Children of Time by Adrian Tchaikovsky

   - 2312 by Kim Stanley Robinson

    Have you ever read the Uplift universe books by David Brin? They're pretty good space opera adventure type books, though not particularly scientifically accurate.
    ```

  - u/BoxSparrow:
    ```
    Diaspora by Greg Egan is pretty good. It's focused more on the discovery than the exploring, though. The science is based on  actual (very theoretical) real world science, so it's pretty hard. Lots of interesting ideas explored.
    ```

  - u/Panksworth:

    Have you read Children of Ruin? The sequel to Children of Time. It's an interesting book, although I personally prefer CoT.

    I'm in the Bobiverse-Vorkosigan-Tchaikovsky triangle, so these books should also tickle your fancy as they tickled mine:

    A Fire Upon the Deep by Vernor Vinge

    Semiosis by Sue Burke

    Lockstep by Karl Schroeder 

    (Greg Egan has been recommended on this forum so many times, it feels silly to do so again, but here I go anyway)

    (I am also trying to reread one of the Uplift books right now and I'm finding it hard going. Those books haven't aged well. Vinge, on the other hand, is even better now)

  So, I just finished a re-read of HPMoR... it'd be interesting to find something in the same vein. I've checked out a few lists of fics, but a lot of them are fanfics based on works I either never read, or didn't really like.

  If anybody would care to recommend me something, that'd be great - I'm not extremely into sci-fi (although it isn't a turn-off, either), and I would prefer something "original" (ie not fanfic) though I guess the Harry Potter universe is fine. I'll be taking a look at Significant Digits.
  ```

  - u/MagicWeasel:
    ```
    Luminosity: yes, it's Twilight fanfic, but I'm mostly unfamiliar with the source material and I gobbled it up. Rational characters acting in their rational interests, you love them, and there's all sorts of cool power stuff that does not exist in the original story AND is really, really well examined and munchkined. I wish it was an original story and not twilight fanfic because I think everyone gets turned away by the twilight aspect and doesn't give it a chance.
    ```

  - u/lo4952:
    ```
    Which parts of HPMoR are you looking to find more of? Purely the magic aspect, or the quantification of magic itself, or something more like the plotting between characters?
    ```

    - u/robhol:
      ```
      The "analysis" was good, but the plotting is where I feel MoR really shines. I'm a sucker for magic in general, though - particularly when the systems are well thought out and [Magic A is Magic A](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA).

      I find it really hard explaining exactly what itches MoR scratches, I guess it just feels... mentally stimulating somehow, when it's in its stride?

            Yeah I've got a strong bias towards finished work but I haven't been able to find any good ones recently. It doesn't help that most subreddits focus on ongoing works, since there's something new to talk about.

  If you're in the mood for something kinda Good Omens-y, I'll recommend [Doing God's Work](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25442/doing-gods-work). 

  I haven't read far enough to see if it's especially rational, but it *does* seem to have a rationalistic deconstruction of religion along similar lines to Good Omens, but from a more contemporary "hey religion is basically a business these days right? What if Providence was literally a public stock?"

    I like Blue Core a lot, although I should warn people that it's only half rational.  

    The Protagonist actually has *two* out of context ability sets.  One that is great with his inventing that's mentioned above.  But his other is probably an order of magnitude more powerful and doesn't really get maximized at all.  

    As a result it feels like there's two modes of the story sorta sandwiched together.  There's a hard science-fantasy setting trying to apply physics to create paradigms of magic and exploring all combinatorial interactions between spells ... and then there's waifu time where abilities are never explored and some abilities pop up and never show up again in the story.  

    I like all parts of the story.  It's a great read.  But be prepared to activate selective rationality filters when you read it.

      It amuses me that of the warnings you could give this is the one you chose and not the one about the protagonist also being a hentai tentacle monster.

    What's the level of completion/update rate like?
    ```

    - u/lo4952:
      ```
      There are 95 chapters on RoyalRoad, and the series updates weekly. However each weekly update is usually 2-4 posts on RoyalRoad. Completion-wise the story seems to be only ramping up, but I believe its coming up on the end of the second arc/volume in the next few chapter or two.
      ```

      - u/Watchful1:

        > 2-4 posts on RoyalRoad

        Usually not. This last week was an exception. Most of the time it's just one.
