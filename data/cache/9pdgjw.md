## How could a character exploit the power to never need to sleep?

### Post:

I'm writing a short story and the idea of one character is that he is intelligent (not super intelligent), motivated, and he doesn't need to sleep. He is always completely rested as if he has had 9 hours of sleep.

  If the "always well rested" factor applies to things like stress levels, then your character could have a noticible advantage at something like day trading.  They could follow trends 24/7 and never mentally snap.
  ```

  The simple fact they have more time awake than others. That could let them leverage when others are asleep to let them learn, etc. Any more background? Student, professional, gamer, etc. would obviously determine how his time is best spent. Also if this is a secret or known to others could affect what he does.

    He is a college student. He isn't necessarily keeping it a secret, he just hasn't seen the purpose in telling anyone. Most people think he is either a night owl or an early bird and assume he sleeps when they do and just goes to bed after them and wakes before they do.

      If he's a college student it's a bit unrealistic to think he wouldn't spend all that extra time watching Netflix.

        and playing video games and drinking, and unable to sleep through hangovers.
        ```

    - u/DrFretNot:
      ```
      If he is sufficiently motivated, doesn’t procrastinate, and not distracted by video games, tv, etc. he should leverage that into double or triple majors in what field he wants to do, or get a masters or PhD early, or even just graduate a year or two early. Does he have life goals and is the setting of the story realistic? Example, if it was a magical setting, he should definitely be using “normal sleep time” to be learning magic to get ahead of others secretly while keeping up mundane studies.

  They're the perfect spy. They're difficult to assassinate, can stake out 24/7, they have more time to improve their skills, and always have a steady hand. They can also just keep driving for ridiculous lengths of time, and heal faster.
  ```

  - u/LazarusRises:
    ```
    Actually this would probably slow down healing, as sleep speeds up the body's restorative processes. 

    Would be interesting to know if this MC *can* sleep if he wants, or if he's stuck awake forever. If the latter, I hope the poor guy never gets migraines.

  Does the character just not tire at all?  Physically, emotionally, mentally, none of it?  He's always fresh as the morning dew?

  If that's the case, endurance athletics.  He could win the Tour de France while barely trying.

  If he can physically exhaust but never mentally tires, he could still be a great deal more productive than a normal person (as they tend to top out at about eight productive hours a day, giving this guy triple the productive time, compared to anyone else).

  He would make lots of money as a truck driver or airline pilot (if the company could be convinced to exempt him from workplace safety regs).
  ```

  - u/PathologicalFire:
    ```
    The never-tiring thing is something I'm fond of, and I've used it for a few characters before. Being able to maintain maximum sprinting speed and the like is relatively strong, if not on-par with stronger super-human abilities.
    ```

  It so depends what you mean with being perfectly rested.

  Even if you got nine hours of sleep each night, factors always change. You could have restful or restless sleep. What if you're on something comfortable or not? Lights on or off? What if you do an all nighter, get nine hours then 24 hours later, get nine hours? What if you constantly shift when you go to sleep, even if you get nine hours every time? What if you do your best to fuck up your circadian rhythm?

  Point is that no sleep is equal. Now, if that character always has perfect sleep, what about this: some nootropics make you feel like you can focus perfectly. You know how some days, you wake up and can focus perfectly, but others you can't? Is that included? Do they essentially have perfect focus/brain restfulness, or is that also going to be limited? What about when you focus doe too long, and need a break? Is that included?

  What about the fact that when you sleep, your brain does stuff to help you understand and remember stuff? Is that process running all the time, but just without dreams?

  If these all are perfect, your character essentially got a lot smarter, and maybe even got a (near?) perfect memory. And that's ignoring all the free time that character now has.

  So yeah, you can definitely make it op if you want. Just remember any downsides. Like, can they go into any different state of consciousness/are prevented from some states? There's others, but you can probably think of some of them.

  By far the most straightforward and also most generally applicable would be the general concept of a "side hustle".

  &#x200B;

  Holding down two real jobs (or otehr full time occupation like education, or home improvement) has a lot of potential advantages form the obvious increased income and developing more diverse skillset, but also in ability to take employment risks.

  Where a normal person has to consider the expected value of any high risk high reward venture which is usually pretty low thanks to the high risk part and compare it against the opportunity cost of the safe predictable option, our hypothetical insomniac can do both.

  As much of what separates the extremely successful (Bill Gates) from the average (Bill from IT) is having taken one of those risks and it having worked out, being able to have one high risk thing and one low risk thing going all the time, is very powerful, and while doing it by sacrificing any social life/hobbies is a common way for the "highly motivated" to brute force success. This person can do so without the sacrifice, which also has the advantage that having a social life and hobbies is frequently how one comes up with the idea of their high risk venture in the first place as well as the connections one needs to get things done.

  Let's get real: Just eight more hours on Reddit.
  ```

- u/fassina2:
  ```
  1/3 more time than everybody else.

  &#x200B;

  There are people out there that live on 2h of sleep per day using polyphasic sleep, in general they just tend to be better than average at most things.

  &#x200B;

  I know a guy who is fully rested with 4h of sleep. He goes to bed at 12am wakes up at 4am everyday. 

  He is average, if anything the only thing he has going for him is that he's a doctor with a degree from a top university which can be attributed to the extra time he had to study. Well technically he co-owns a hospital, and has done so for 20+ years. 

  Other than that, he's fairly normal. 

  &#x200B;

  I assume that unless your character has some really big passions he'd be mostly bored. It's like what'd you do if you didn't have to work or go to school? Well play games, watch and read stuff etc. But when you played everything, read and watched everything and there's nothing left you want to do right now you get bored and start searching for things to do. 

  &#x200B;

  But in his case it's even worse since his massive extra chunk of free time is at night, when everything is closed, and most of his friends are sleeping.

  Since other people are posting actual answers, [here's a Japanese web novel with a similar premise, for your consideration](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/no-fatigue-24-jikan-tatakaeru-otoko-no-tenseitan/).

    ```
    That's awesome! I knew it wasn't a very original idea but I didn't think someone had made a novel about it. I'll definitely check it out, thanks!

  Nancy Kress had some suggestions:

  https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68333.Beggars_in_Spain

  Children who are genetically engineered to never need sleep. Lots of social and interpersonal consequences, debates about whether a Sleepless should be allowed to compete in the Olympics, political character assassination, etc.

  That depends heavily on his character motivation and goals.

  I'm picturing a lot of scenarios where he gets the jump on someone while they're asleep, but that's assuming he's in a scenario where there's physical danger. In fact, any kind of one-on-one mortal danger could be averted if he turns it into a standoff and just waits as long as necessary for the other person to fall asleep.

  He'll naturally be more well-read than most people, but he will also be able to react faster to news and world developments: he could react to developments in the asian stock market while a normal person won't know a thing until the morning.

  If necessary, he could pull off the appearance of magically appearing somewhere, when in reality he had been concealed and patiently waiting for hours, tirelessly vigilant for the perfect moment to reveal himself.

  Similarly he could maintain the illusion of having an eidetic memory or being super-intelligent by goofing off and partying all day, and then secretly studying for hours every night.

  He would have time to maintain two identities, both with jobs, ID, and friends who can vouch for their existence.

  No one has mentioned it yet, but without the need to sleep a person wouldn't necessarily need a domicile.

  I can see having one for a place to work / study / live but it wouldn't be required. (Not to mention a lack of a bed taking up space.)  They would be able to live in a much smaller place in a more expensive area while maintaining a higher standard of living.
  ```

- u/SimoneNonvelodico:
  ```
  The straightforward answer: just use the extra time to master more stuff. The simple "never tired" status would alone make them incredibly more productive than any other person on Earth, and thus they could get an edge by focusing on gaining mastery of one skill.

  The less straightforward answer: everyone assumes that you *do* have to sleep, so if you manage to cover that fact up, you sort of have an interesting alibi for all sort of double life shenanigans...
