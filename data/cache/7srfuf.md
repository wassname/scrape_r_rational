## [Challenge Companion] Pioneer

### Post:

**tl;dr: this is the companion to the [writing challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7sqylx/biweekly_challenge_pioneer/), post ideas, comments, chit-chat, etc. here.**

On reflection, I think that this prompt has a whole lot in common with some previous challenges:

* [Portal Fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3a7ypf/weekly_challenge_portal_fantasy/)
* [One-Man Industrial Revolution](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3b0aqq/weekly_challenge_oneman_industrial_revolution/)
* [First Contact](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/47g108/biweekly_challenge_first_contact/)
* [Inexploitability](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7d7nx2/biweekly_challenge_inexploitability/)

I think that pioneers of various stripes show up in fiction so often because they provide some ready-built tensions, first the tension of the unknown, and second the tension of the new order against the old order. It also allows for a bit wilder of plot swings as well, because nothing is as set or established, and the question of "why did no one think of that if the world has been this way for hundreds of years?" isn't around to cause trouble.
