  I'm mostly posting this because it has one of the best explanations for tinker-tech I've read.

  It seems pretty interesting so far, but I don't think it's gotten the attention it deserves. Hopefully the author will post more frequently.

    I agree that it is interesting so far, but what has been posted amounts to an introduction. I hope the author posts more.
