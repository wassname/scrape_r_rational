## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  Apologies for not updating last week; Thanksgiving took up a decent chunk of my time in preparation, and there wasn’t much to update on besides.  This week is no better, and this is just a ping to ensure I don’t let this project get too far off my radar.

  At least this week I had an excuse that I’m actually excited about: I finally [pulled the trigger on a  new PC rig](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/ketura/saved/DQ9FTW).  I’ve been trying to upgrade for two years now or so, but it just wasn’t in the cards until now. 


  Mostly-completed build taking up most of my desk: [image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/196309529850281984/386040258829221889/20171201_002510.jpg)

  But you can’t really see how massive this shit is, so here’s an xbox controller for scale: [image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/196309529850281984/386040643732111362/JPEG_20171201_002639.jpg)

  Incredibly appropriate wallpaper: [image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/196309529850281984/386075535446638592/JPEG_20171201_024557.jpg)


  So I’m likely to continue tinkering with this over the weekend and then drooling over frame rates and the like, but I’m *also* curious to see what Visual Studio makes of 16 threads, so who knows, maybe I’ll stumble my way to productivity once more.

  Some of you have run or played campaigns in DnD, right? I'll be playing my first ever game soon, and I'm looking for advice on how to ensure a first time DM has an excellent time first-time-DMing. Experienced DMs -- are there any things you wish your players did more or less of, especially when you first started DMing? Anything you wish they kept in mind? Common pitfalls? Once we really get rolling I'll make or commission some drawings or 3D prints of our characters, which I reckon will go over well, but I want more day-to-day tips (more details [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/7eommp), as well as some answers from posters on /r/DnD).
  ```

  - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
    ```
    Tips for players:

    * Don't ask too many questions about irrelevant things, unless you think the DM has an answer prepared. My least favorite part of a session is when I get put on the spot and asked what a minor, one-off character's name is. (I have a long list printed out that I pull from at random for this, but it's still annoying and usually doesn't add much to the session.)
    * Don't thumb your nose at the offered quests. Having to scrap a bunch of work because people have hidden goals that aren't aligned with what I've prepared is a bummer, and ends up with a mostly improvised session, which newer DMs usually aren't good at.
    * Describe what you're attempting to do, rather than the results of your actions, especially in combat. It's not for you to say that you cut someone's head off, you say that you *try* to do that and then the DM narrates the action. It does help if you add that flavor yourself though, because that relieves some of the mental load on the DM (especially since it can be hard to remember what everyone's attack/weapon is).
    * Make sure at least one person is keeping track of loot, and at least one person is keeping track of names and quest notes. Offloading this onto the DM makes more work, and the DM already has a lot of work to do. (The DM knows the names, and the quest details, but having to ask the DM for a refresher every fifteen minutes is bad.) Make sure that at least one person is keeping the game moving forward, rather than stalled out on digressions, especially if you have a timid DM.
    * It's your responsibility to make a character that can be part of the game. One of the common things that I've seen people do wrong is make their character a weird, anti-social loner, and then play them like a weird, antisocial loner, and then when that gums up the works, complain that they were "just playing their character". That's why you don't bring characters like that to the table in the first place.
    ```

  - u/Kinoite:
    ```
    Pick a tone for the adventure and set expectations before you start.  Something like: 'this arc is fast-paced swashbuckling', 'we're running an intrigue and mystery game', or 'this is an old-school puzzle-dungeon'.

    This gives players a sense of what to expect.  And it gives them queues on how they should respond to the world around them.

    Give players clues about where they can dictate details of the world.  

    Before my current campaign, I asked my players to tell me about their home cities, and about the backstory-adventure where they met another member of the party.

    During the game, I'll say things like, "that attack hits.  Dragon's at 0 hit points.  It's defeated.  What happens?"  And then I'll let the player fill in the epic details of how their character lands the final blow.

    But, my biggest piece of DM advice is that you're playing to lose.  Plan your loss so that characters seem huge and competent and heroic.  Everything exists to serve that goal.

    Is the Big Bad an evil wizard?  Then he's not just evil.  He's smugly, sneeringly evil.  Have him gloat about his victory halfway through the session.  Let him escape halfway through the arc.  Let him grandstand in front of his army in the final battle.

    Set things up right and, when the story reaches his climax, the characters will be narrating some truly epic death-scenes as they heroically crush their hated foe.

  What (if any) opinions do you have on the [changing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maiden_and_married_names#English-speaking_world) of names upon marriage?  
  \- Neither spouse changes his last name  
  \- One spouse assumes the other's last name&hellip;  
  \- \- &hellip;and abandons his original last name  
  \- \- &hellip;and replaces his original middle name with his original last name  
  \- Hyphenation:  
  \- \- One spouse's name goes first for both participants  
  \- \- Each spouse puts his name first and the other's name second  
  \- \- Each spouse puts his name second and the other's name first  
  \- \- What about the next generation?  
  \- Both spouses amalgamate their last names

  I'm inclined to think that the simplest option is the best option, since changing one's name incurs a risk of mistakes (e.&nbsp;g., on credit reports) and makes filling out forms a hassle ("Have you ever worked under a name different from your current name? If so, list all other names."). I was quite surprised when, some months ago, I [saw](https://i.imgur.com/4tBgZk8.png) that the wife of Prophet Yudkowsky (pbuh) had assumed his last name.

  Having gotten halfway through of *[A Game of Thrones](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13496)* (without having seen any of the television series), I have to say that, so far, it's seeming to be just another piece of [generic medieval fantasy](https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Medieval_European_Fantasy) rather than something particularly impressive. I definitely prefer *[The Runelords](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/144127)* (discussed [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ket47) and [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3t143r)).

  (I really should get around to reading the first four books of [the *Runelords* series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/41322) for a second time, and maybe even finally reading the second four books for the first time. On the other hand, I *still* haven't bothered to finish cleaning up the hideous formatting of my [DRM-free](http://www.baen.com/baenebooks) copies of the last three books of [the *Belisarius* series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/40821), which have been sitting on my hard drive for *literally* a year! And I haven't re-read *[Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644)* in something like a year, either, so I probably should either get started on a seventh reading or finally complete the thorough editing job that I've been too lazy to do for *several* years. *So* many choices&hellip;)

  Scrolling through image-heavy threads in Discord is *significantly* less tiresome if you use [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en) to shrink the thumbnails&mdash;e.&nbsp;g., to a height of 125 pixels, which is the size that 4chan uses: `img.image{max-height:125px;width:auto;}`

  Still, as I've [explained](http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/62lpoc/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dfnkwc5) previously, I definitely prefer 4chan to Discord.

    A Game of Thrones was notable back in the day, for being Medieval Fantasy, with realistic people and realistic consequences. There aren't Big Damn Heroes, the protagonist doesn't give you plot armour, etc. 

    You've got to remember... that was twenty years ago! It's very much an Original Sin type series. There've been tons of derivative works since, and the context in which it arose is no longer accessible. So it seems generic now, but it wasn't back then.

      [This is a trope.](https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Seinfeld_Is_Unfunny) With that said, however, when I call AGoT merely "generic", I'm thinking of books that are as old as, or older than, AGoT: *Redwall*, *Ivanhoe*, and *The Vicomte de Bragelonne* stand out most prominently. I don't think I've read much medieval fantasy newer than AGoT. (*Vicomte* includes some pretty major character death, you know!)
      ```

      - u/kraryal:
        ```
        Well yes, it is a trope, but that doesn't make it untrue. But it's odd to make the comparison to Redwall, since Redwall specifically has all the heroic tropes that AGoT eschews. The setting is, so far as I can see, meant to be medieval fantasy specifically to play up the lack up the usual heroic tropes.

        After all, the heroes always win in Redwall even if they suffer along the way. (Martin is my favourite, though I'm partial to the badgers in Salamandastron too). Everybody has tremendous virtue, it's really a different atmosphere entirely. 

        I will admit to unfamiliarity with *Vicomte*. Would you recommend it?

        The Runelords is a pretty interesting example of a high fantasy series with a whole bunch of "what-if" in its magic system, but I'd almost call that an entirely separate genre. In fact I much preferred it over AGoT just for the lower level of grittiness.

    > What (if any) opinions do you have on the changing of names upon marriage?

    My partner and I decided to keep our surnames (we'd both published under them, and also liked them esthetically, and also didn't like the implicit subsumation/loss of individuality and asymmetry of keeping only one surname), and we found hyphenation clunky, but we still wanted some sort of symbolic name-y union, so we adopted each other's surnames as our middle names. 

    We haven't decided on the children-naming course of action yet, in part since that's far enough away, but we might either give each (of two anticipated) children one of our surnames, or give them both a blended surname (there are some combinations that look and sound pretty neat and natural imo). IDK how inconvenient this would be though.
    ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    As someone with a hyphenated name, it's pretty annoying. My name never fits on forms with a limited amount of space, I have to tell them about the hyphenation every time or it will be put into systems wrong, and it's just a hassle to write the whole thing out. On top of that, I have a middle name as well, which makes matters even more complicated.
    ```

  - u/Tinfoil_Haberdashery:
    ```
    Hyphenating names is the worst possible solution, to my mind. It's a short-sighted have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too strategy with little to recommend it.

    While there are a lot of good reasons for the bride to keep her own name, at least there's a societal framework for maiden-vs.-married names. The groom has all the same reasons to keep his, plus the lack of societal framework.

    I don't think there's any real need to faff about with name changes, except for the trickiness surrounding name inheritance, or if one spouse doesn't like their name.

    Unfortunately, neither I nor my SO particularly like our surnames. She's pretty intent on taking mine, which I guess is as good a solution as any.

    You sir, are a liar.

    You pretend to have the position that changing names upon marriage is irrational. Your actual position is that marriage is irrational. I find this deceitfulness highly offensive.

    - u/ToaKraka:

      > You pretend to have the position that changing names upon marriage is irrational. Your actual position is that marriage is irrational.

      I didn't say that marriage was *irrational*. I said that it was *meaningless*. (More specifically, I meant that I considered marriage to be devoid of social meaning&mdash;*i.&nbsp;e.*, to no longer imply a strong and lasting social bond.) For example, if getting married would result in a reduction of the taxes owed by the participants, then that reduction is one rational reason in favor of marriage. Other such reasons for marriage obviously exist (e.&nbsp;g., immigration shenanigans).
