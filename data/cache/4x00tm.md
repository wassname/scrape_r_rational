  If you're asking...  what the case *for* it being considered rational?  What's the case against?

  With that, the community can engage in something more than just reading the whole thing and reporting back.

    My apologies for the confusion. I was simply wondering if members of this community would consider elements of the fiction or the entire fiction, as it stands, one that met the requirements of a rational fiction. You're right, I am asking if people would be able to put forth ideas on where it meets rationality, and where it needs some work.

    The fiction itself is still in its infancy, and I was hoping to get some feedback so I can have a solid foundation to build off of for further installments and so I can go back and do some revising to help this meet any requirements that any reader on here would like to see. I'm constantly revising and updating the material with any input I can get. 

    I've been lurking here for a while and really like the fictions presented here, how the community works and the elements of rationality/rationalism that many people can bring to growing a fiction. That is my motivation for presenting this project. I understand it may not be a work that appeals to a vast audience, but if a few people that were interested and had some time would like to rip it apart and let me know what works for them and what doesn't. Perhaps following the 'wise reading' example, if people would like to try that.

    If you're asking if I could present a case for myself, I'll try to bring up a brief summation of points on where I feel it meets the appeal of rational fiction. I can mention where I feel I have strengths, but I hope to seek other's views on where my weaknesses lie.

    Where I feel the fiction currently meets some of the characteristics of rational fiction:

    * item 1 - Each of the main characters uses their own sense and perceptions of the world to make plausible (within the context of their own identities) choices that affect the world in believable ways.

    * item 2 - I avoid 'plot armor,' 'deus ex machina,' and 'railroading' elements as much as possible. I must still preserve an epic and fantastic setting of the story, so some events are out of the character's direct involvement, but there is a definite sense of cause and effect.

    * item 3 - I avoid moral or ethical dichotomies of "good" versus "evil." Everything built within this story and this setting is on an existential spectrum from a given character's understanding of the world around them. What would be acceptable to one character would be abhorrent to another, based on their own individual ethics, or societally enforced/constructed sense of morality.

    * item 4 - Every character solves problems according to their own perceptions of the world around them, their own availability of knowledge or understanding they have, and with what limited resources they are able to draw upon.

    * item 5 - The setting of the world has a heavy amount of world-building (which will become more present as the fiction moves forward) with very consistent elements. I have created separate languages for each of the major cultures. I have a consistent, although fractured (based on culture) magic system that works within a fantasy sense of 'Holmesian' pseudo-science. The cultures present in the story have their own detailed histories, their own motivations and their own anthropological elements that make them unique. Even the gods have an explanation for existing (or not existing, as the story may reveal at a later time), and any large-scale events will have explainable or logical elements causing them should those details become necessary to the story.

    * item 6 - I deliberately avoid any elements of "Mary Sue" or "Marty Stu" character development. Any abilities that characters may gain throughout the story are treated in a sort of "tabletop RPG levels of experience" sort of fashion. They start out as 'normal people' and through the plot garner specialized abilities based off of their choices and who they are. Most gains are slow and arduous, coming with severe costs to other aspects of their character.

    * item 7 - The plot of the story is consistent enough that a reader can begin to figure out puzzles, elements, and future events on their own. I use a great amount of foreshadowing, detail dropping, and lore-keeping to keep readers who enjoy those elements busy while they are reading. There will be some red herrings and Hitchcockian elements thrown in at later times to keep readers guessing, but keep the plot logical and consistent. So far one of the most noticeable elements used is that of oracles and divination being used to perceive elements of the world beyond human perception and the disastrous effects this has on individuals as well as cultures. Not all divinations in this form are true, as outside powers may corrupt or subvert such abilities to manipulate others for their own long-ranging plans.

    I don't believe the fiction meets all of the requirements to be a rationalist fiction, thus far. I do hope to use elements in the characters to 'pick apart' the setting using a demystifying sense of scientific methods in application. A bit of setting deconstruction to show the power of the human mind triumphing over vast supernatural elements. Or fighting against the traditional and superstitious ways of their own cultures to bring back an enlightenment of rational thought. I don't want to give too much away, but the story has yet to get to those plot elements. I will be dropping more puzzles, riddles and logical 'games' within the plot-line as the story grows, so as to reward those readers who enjoy such while trying to remain unobtrusive to those who are more casual types. I will also be making regular updates with world-building lore, and am wondering if readers would enjoy this or if many would find it a detriment to their enjoyment of the story.

    I ask the readers here, whoever is open to checking this fiction out, where I can work to fix any problems in the story thus far. What I can work on. What I need to revise. What elements people feel works and which they would like removed or tweaked to a better form. I've read a lot of really great input from the fellow Redditors here to other authors. I'm reading and learning from those, right now. If people can light the way here, more concretely, I would really appreciate their efforts and the time they took to check this out and let me know. Thank you.

      It sounds pretty rational to me!  Thanks for the long response - I'll certainly add this to my read-queue.

  I understand I may sound as a jerk... But DO you have an abstract of your story?
  ```

  - u/SovereignofAshes:
    ```
    Not at all. Thank you for letting me know, I seem to have scattered a bit of info about the story over multiple areas. I forgot that there is no readily available abstract directly on the site. When I work on some revisions and 'sprucing up' of the site in the next few weeks, I'll make sure it gets posted.

    The present one available is this one:

    *A serialized web-fiction in the Swords & Sorcery genre* 

    *The world of Aelth Myrris is dying, the world-god is in her death throes. This was not caused by rampant environmental devastation, the fall-out of some cataclysmic war, nor a random happenstance of celestial events. This act of murder was entirely intentional, caused by capricious, hidden entities even more powerful than the gods themselves.*

    *The many groups that call the world-god Myrris home have been abandoned. Once proud societies are crumbling into ruin and barbarity, as those with ambition vie to seize what few bits of fading power they can. Still, amidst this tumult, there are stories to be told about those few who cling to life, wanting more than power and trinkets. This is the saga of those few who hope for a better future, who defy the hidden entities that devour their world, who refuse to be the pawns of fate.*
