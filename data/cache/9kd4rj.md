  So.... the spilled cup on the table was definitely Bard, right? Who just disappeared right before Cordelia came in, and might also be one of the “monsters of both sides” Saint mentioned?
  ```

  - u/AurelianoTampa:
    ```
    Absolutely, I immediately thought the same thing once I read about the laugh and the spilling cup!
    ```

  - u/MutantMannequin:

    The question is, what does Bard gain by pushing Saint (and possibly Cordelia) like this? The setup we've got so far goes:

    1. Hierarch disables Bard temporarily, an opportunity Dead King takes to start making moves again.
    2. Bard returns and speaks with Dead King, only to give him permission to "eat the baby" without her interference.
    3. Bard encourages Saint of Swords' dogmatic outlook, potentially sowing discord between Cordelia and the church and/or Good named, potentially pushing Cordelia toward some kind of name.

    Even if Dead King doesn't decide to mobilize (and I'm not sure I would, after that exchange), it still looks like Procer's about to collapse. How does this play into Bard's game? Why does she seem to want that?

  Hey, what do you know? Cat was right - the Saint really is Ranger with a coat of paint and a socially acceptable pretext for murder. Don't like Procer? Stab it! Kind of funny that she doesn't seem to accept that every institution goes the way of Procer though. Praesi are a pack of ravening lunatics, but at least they're honest about being a pack of ravening lunatics. Proceran's seem to think that they can't possibly be in the wrong. Heaven Is On Their Side! Cordelia herself rambles on the topic of Procer's history and it's about as bad as it is now. 

  Really helps to drive home the view of the heavens and Saint though - this nation didn't work? Hey, let's burn it and try the same thing again!

    That duality is one of the things I love about this series, the gods bet about good and evil means that *good* and *evil* have to exist, when they objectively do not, all that exists is morality and ethics that are agreed upon by society. This forces the world into a broken cycle of stories forcing people who want to make a difference into roles so that they can achieve their ambitions, but depending on where they are, who they serve and how they do things they are arbitrarily divided into Hero's and Villains. This all leads to self righteous people like Cordelia who think they are right just because they aren't villains. Cordelia is every bit as ruthless and villainous as Cat, but she happened to be born in a place of power and privilege, so she didn't have to make the compromises that Cat did to make a difference. I could go on about this forever, I fucking love this series.

    What I find interesting is that Saint's desire to burn down Procer to start from scratch mirror's Black wanting to stab all the high lords before rebuilding Praes.
    ```

    - u/notagiantdolphin:
      ```
      I'm not sure the Saint is capable of learning and planning like Black is, though. Her entire plan seems to be 'everybody charge, it doesn't matter if everyone dies. Let god sort us out.'. Petty arson instead of grand plan.
      ```

      - u/tavitavarus:
        ```
        It's exactly the sort of attitude Cat hates the most. Forget the human beings who will die, the destruction of cities, the mass starvation. Just mindlessly fight Evil because the Heavens will it. Force other people to die for your principles all in the pursuit of some 'Greater Good' that helps no one.
         And of course, rather than have an actual plan, just trust in the power of prayer and narrative to deliver your victory.
        ```

      - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
        ```
        Yeah, Black would have had a plan to rebuild Praes to further the interests of the nation. The Saint neither knows nor cares what will happen to Procer afterwards, so long as "Good" wins and "Evil" loses.
        ```

- u/cyberdsaiyan:
  ```
  This is Cordelia's pivot I think. She has so far been very much a "down to earth" sort of ruler, her thoughts and perspective all guided by her love for her people and the desire to keep the principate intact.

  And now she comes across a greater power that threatens to undo all of that. A power that she thought she was on the side of. 

  Now she will have to decide which side she prefers, from the perspective of gods rather than men.
  ```

- u/Agnoman:
  ```
  So uh, Procer's fucked, right?

  They've got to fight the Dead King, who has, amongst other advantages, dozens upon dozens of Named (which include some of the most powerful beings to have ever turned up in the story), millions of foot soldiers, and the general raising-the-dead issue that the Hidden Horror brings with him. Then they have the Woe to deal with, who a dozen heroes couldn't deal with   and now are probably going to have the Drow with them when they next turn up to fight. Then there's Black, who's been pretty damn successful in tearing up Procer without any supply lines, reinforcements, or basic logistical support on any level. Praes and the Warlock are getting ready to smash Ashur. And then the Tyrant of Helike is doing his thing (which is always quite fun).

  By all accounts Procer would feel threatened by any one of these things, let alone all of them. Looking at [the map](https://ibb.co/b9DLMF), they've got enemies in just about every direction they *can* have enemies.

  On top of this that the Dwarves are poised to stop selling them cheap armaments. They're running out of soldiers to the point that they're throwing out farmers en masse, leadership is being questioned and their alliance is splintering.

  The Crusade has failed to win a battle even before things got turned up to eleven. Now? I don't think there's been any evidence in the story that Heroic Stories can really save the day here. Hell, haven't the heroes *lost* every battle they've been in, bar that off-screen one with the demon of absence and the Champion killing the Captain (with the Bard's assistance)?
  ```

    ```
    That is how the stories go though, just when the side of good needs it the most someone is gonna get a god-tier powerup or pull an army of named outta their arse. It's a fine line that the author is walking where Deus Ex Machina is literally the way the world works and the story is still compelling. The pilgrim has some story on the backburner somewhere and we haven't had the bard do anything lately so she's probably in the shadows somewhere scheming. Lastly, love it or hate it this world seems to work the same way as the force has been characterised in star wars lately. Doesn't matter how strong one side gets the other side is gonna rise to meet it. The dead king is a huge enemy with overwhelmong force. If the side of good wins that fight, no matter what they lose, they might have some absolute units left over to mop up cat with.

    So yes, Procer is fucked. I don't see Cordelia working her way out if this one. She called the crusade as a political move. Now she's gotta face the music, even if it means the country she loves so much gets taken out and its entirely on her. 

    I love this series so much.

      >just when the side of good needs it the most someone is gonna get a god-tier powerup or pull an army of named outta their arse.

      One of the big issues I'm having here is that there isn't any example we have of this happening. The closest we've come is the Champion killing the Captain after the Bard manuevered the situation. Otherwise the heroes have been pretty ineffectual and haven't really had any meaningful wins. I'm finding it hard to believe that *this time* things are going to be different when there's no evidence of Heroic narratives having much of a lasting impact in the conflicts thus far and the crusades haven't won so much as a single file battle.

      But if you can point to a moment where the Heroes received Heavenly help in a way that mattered beyond a few chapters, I'm all ears.

      No, it says it works that way. It literally never does. Here, I’ll make my prediction for the dead king invasion. arc outright: 

      no good charachter gets a deus ex machina powerup or otherwise becomes a serious threat onscreen.

      heroes and Procer continue to be toothless unless they’re offscreen.

      Narrative still doesn’t matter unless black or cat or bard or *maybe* a new charachter introduced who follows along those lines wants to exploit it without setup via poorly defined means.
      ```

      - u/Mountebank:
        ```
        Exactly. The Dead King has been at this long enough that he knows exactly how hard to push before Good jumps in with a massive Deus Ex. It's how he became King in the flashbacks--he made very slow and subtle moves and played the long game until he was the only choice left rather than try to lead an uprising or to do some politicking to gain the position over his oppositions.

        That doesn't mean this latest invasion will be successful--they haven't been so far--but it does mean that he won't push hard enough for Good to somehow emerge stronger and better than before. He'll push until the State collapses and idiots like the Saint of Swords are left in charge, then probably retreat and let them turn to infighting and internal purges that, maybe, will lead to people like Cordelia switching Sides.
        ```

    - u/None:

      I see a way for her to work it out.  She can marry Cat.  Don't forget, she is a prince after all, and marriage has been brought up in the past.  It's worth pointing out that her armies have to be utterly destroyed and submission has to be the only option before that happens; at least, if the fae were any guideline.  I bet Salia is going to get it.
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I mean, they were already fucked way before this, but yeah. Theyre completely toothless and have enemies on all sides, and the four things they have going for them (Crusade, Auger, Klaus, and the northern principalities) vanish whenever its comvenient for the plot.

    In a sorta-not-really defense, william won quite a lot, and by the grace of his own skill to boot. Cat only managed to pull out her win there via a nonsensical story with no setup *and* accidental help from akua that somehow did exactly what cat needed it to. Honestly, the idea that heroes have this sort of “heaven guidance” rather than villains has been baffling to me.

    There was also that time William lopped Catherine's head off at the end of their pattern of three. The Pilgrim also had something of a victory when he destroyed Cat's portal and knocked her and Masego into a coma.
    ```

    - u/Agnoman:
      ```
      >There was also that time William lopped Catherine's head off at the end of their pattern of three

      In a fight he probably should have won anyway, judging by their past performances. But more to the point, it's hard to call that one a win for Heroic Stories when three seconds later when the Story help saved Cat with a last minute rescue:

      >“A force was helping me along,” the bespectacled mage said. “Your Name, and… something else. It was like Creation did not want you to be dead.”.

      Followed by Cat winning by tricking an angel into ressurecting her as she "couldn't be dead and win"... despite that fact that [plenty of winners in story die](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGoodWayToDie) and Will's own victory condition was death.

      >“You will die before the day is done,” I rasped.

      “And yet,” the Lone Swordsman smiled, “I win.”



      ***
      >The Pilgrim also had something of a victory when he destroyed Cat's portal and knocked her and Masego into a coma.

      Hard to say that that came from the Story though, when you figure that it should probably just be something that one of the oldest and most powerful Heroes on the continent is able to do.

      And even then it didn't mean anything anyway? Cat and Mastro where asleep, the Crusade outnumbered the Army of Callow two to one, they had the Saint, the Pilgrim, and ten other heroes besides to field against Archer, and they didn't really acheive anything of note.

      Then all the heroes went to fight Akua, and put up a pretty bad showing despite it being Akua's first time in a physical body in a long time, being almost completey unfamiliar with the specifics of her borrowed power, and just generally being the incarnation of the old-school villainy that the heroes are meant to obliterate, both in terms of her methods and her position as the Butcher of Liesse.

      Then Cat wakes up from her nap with no idea of what's happened in the past few days, and rather than the heroes capitalising on any sort of confusion or disorientation, she immediately takes control of the situation and disengages without difficulty.
      ```

      - u/Gr_Cheese:
        ```
        You seem to be expressing skepticism about the validity of heroic losses. I have some pretty major problems with the end of the whole Angel arc... The only contribution I have is that, in regards to William beheading Cat, the Wandering Bard explicitly stated:

        >She’d watched from a distance as William killed the Squire and known what it meant. That the Lone Swordsman had lost, that Liesse was lost, that the rebellion was over. - Book 2, Epilogue

        But The Battle of Camps ran on pure story: The heroes' victory could not be decided until Cat woke up, and the pseudo-heroic role Cat claimed as *Orphan Defending Home Country from Foreign Aggressors*  basically guaranteed her victory (extended to Akua, who even comments on the novelty of acting in a heroic role.)

        The meta-story here is villains flipping the story to eek out victory despite creational logic dictating Good will win in the end. The Battle of the Camps plays that tune well.
        ```

        - u/Agnoman:
          ```
          >You seem to be expressing skepticism about the validity of heroic losses

          Less that, more scepticism about how dangerous heroes and heroic stories are meant to be, when they've spent most of the story being soundly beaten. I feel like there's a big gap between their onformed abilities and the one's we've actually seen.

          Following on from this, I'm expressing doubt at the heroes ability to save the day here.

          >the Wandering Bard explicitly stated
          >>She’d watched from a distance as William killed the Squire and known what it meant. That the Lone Swordsman had lost, that Liesse was lost, that the rebellion was over. - Book 2, Epilogue

          Personally I don't think it's really a point in the heroes favour that apparently Will winning his last fight in the pattern of three apparently lead directly to his losing.

          And then there's the issue where Cat is benefiting from the story post beheading but before pulling the sword from the stone and exerting her claim in a way that puts the story behind her.(hell, she was both Dead and nameless between these two things). She got a last-minute rescue , explicitly story-given, a ressurection that the angels apparently had to give her for story reasons,  and a last-minute power up that let her win. Did the story just fiat say the villain wins, the hero loses?

          But even ignoring this. The issue is that I don't buy the threat level of the heiress, as they've not managed anything in the way of a meaningful victory. Will beheading Cat does not count as meaningful when all consequences of this are undone within three chapters and Cat is better of for it. 

          You get the same issue with the Battle of the Camps - the Pilgrim takes out Cat and Masgeo, but nothing happens due to this that really has any lasting impact.


          >the pseudo-heroic role Cat claimed as Orphan Defending Home Country from Foreign Aggressors basically guaranteed her victory (extended to Akua, who even comments on the novelty of acting in a heroic role.)

          There's a fair point you've made in this. But if it's that easy to co-opt narrative momentum.. it seems like less of a big deal to me. If a shiny coat of paint can make the ghost of *Akua* a heroic figure, then heroes don't have the monopoly that Black's so obsessed with. If setting yourself up as a hero means winning like a hero is meant to... then just always do that?

          If heiress are dangerous because they have the narrative on their side, but a savvy villain can steal that support.... and almost all remaining villains are that sort of savvy - what is it that makes heroes especially dangerous again?

          Maybe I'd buy it more if we'd seen the heroes actually succeeding in the way that everyone says they succeed... but the only time they've really won in the story itself, or had the narrative support which is meant to be their trump card actually work, is that one time with the Champion and the Captain.
          ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I’ll count the first one, but the second failed to impress, since apparently even when both cat and Masego are out of the picture, Saint + Pilgrim + 10 heroes can’t even get past archer to *reach* the army.
      ```
