## So who is going to take over Aeromancer?

### Post:

I would very much like to see this story continued, for those of you who may have missed the author released lots of information regarding the rest of the story [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/97cyvw/aeromancer_info_released/).

  I'd like to see it, but realistically speaking, probably nobody (and I don't mean the author of Mother of Learning).

  If someone does, I think they should depart from the author's plans. I think a lot of them weren't very good, to be frank.

    to be fair, it's the execution that matters the most. the magic itself was the most cliche you can have (element based system) but it was done in a way that got me liking it.

  It's *extremely* rare for anyone to pick up an orphaned work and finish it (or even continue it without finishing it). Most of the people who have the chops to do it have their own stuff they'd rather write, and there are all kinds of headaches that come from filling in for the other person, even if you do have a detailed plan in place.

    "Extremely rare" doesn't feel like it conveys how much that doesn't happen. It's theoretically possible, but I've never, ever, ever seen it happen or heard of it happening (except in traditional publishing after an author died).

      The only time I've seen it happen was with [Master of All](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/8220/mythrans-master-of-all-continued) where the original author posted about 70,000 words or 16 chapters and then someone else decided to continue it to completion for another 2 million words or 794 chapters.

      This was a bit of a hedge, in case someone was able to produce notable counter-examples that I hadn't heard about.
      ```

  There is another option.  Somehow convince the author to start writing again, and rescue(?) him from his cult.

    I laughed at that comment a bit more than I should have...

  Aeromancer's and The Game of Champion's authors will swap stories and actually come to their senses

  For anyone who wants to get an offline copy of Aeromancer, here's the files I [posted](http://www.mediafire.com/folder/dzhzeno44gr5n/Aeromancer) back when Aeromancer ended.

  I really liked the story, and the magic thingy.
  ```

- u/causalchain:
  ```
  A continuation would be more like a fanfiction... I would totally on board for a fanfic of Aeromancer
  ```

- u/libertarian_reddit:
  ```
  I agree
  ```

- u/TheIssac:
  ```
  To be honest its quite sad that the author stopped writing, but i think its not a good idea to have someone else continue ... its not going to be the same , the worldbuilding was still not really complete nor anything else , hoping for the original author to return is definitly the best bet even if its highly unlikely. 

  And to some extend the story is done ... Seti wanted to be a mancer and be part of their world and now he is ... everything else can stay open and unfinished ... but the story as such got at least a soft ending.
