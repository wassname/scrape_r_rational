  I rewatched Chronicle, one of my favorite movies last night. It's a film about three high school seniors who gain telekinesis. The powers are pretty OP as far as something that's not in an already established superpower franchise. 

  By the end of the film they can fairly easily lift tons, fly, create full body force field protections strong enough to crash straight through buildings unharmed. The control over the telekinesis is also granular enough to build Legos. The power works like a muscle where the boys had to train up to get to this level otherwise they'd "tear" the muscle if they went over their limit too fast resulting in a headache and nosebleed. 

  As I was watching I kept thinking that I would love to have these powers but I couldn't think of a way to make use of them in real life. I'm an accountant but I certainly would not be if I had the power to do what they could. 

  So, the munchkinry task is this: if you got these powers how would you have a normal life with them living undetected while still using the powers to their full extent in your day to day life? Bonus points for keeping everything you do legal and morally honest.

    Well, one thing is that having telekinesis that works on as fine a scale as described probably also means that you have an awareness of the area that you could affect. The question then is how far away your telekinesis can reach, then, because presumably you could use it as a sort of long-ranged proprioception that can reach around corners.

    Wanting to remain undetected limits things a bit, but there are theoretically come jobs you could do legally and very efficiently without people noticing you have powers. The first thought that came to my mind was actually cleaning, or exterminating - you could detect hidden dirt, kill bugs from range, move objects, sweep dust, clean surfaces, and so much more with much less effort and time expended than normal. The reason I mention these jobs specifically are that you can often find an excuse to complete the jobs outside the vision of the people that hire you. ("Let me handle this sir, wasps are dangerous bastards that might attack you, and I only have the one protective suit."; "You enjoy your day out sir, your mansion will be cleaned by the time you get back." )

    Little things, then. Cleaning, as mentioned. Any task that requires you to stand up can now be completed just by sitting down. I wonder if, given sufficient education about your own body and the trust of a medical practitioner, you could exercise yourself without actually doing exercise? Just using your telekinesis on yourself. Don't take my word on that one though, it's just idle musing.

    You could make yourself fly, though, and I'm under the impression that doing that would be very fun.

    Depending on how fine the telekinesis is, it might make artistic endeavours easier. Simply telekinetically move your ink/paint/drawing implement/digital input, and any limit on artistic ability due to technical aspects will be much lessened. This depends on exactly how it works, of course.

    Any aspect of a job that's reliant on random sampling let's you apply your powers, actually. Checking bags, for example, at airport security. Even if you still have to check bags normally to keep your cover, it would be awfully convenient if you were able to telekinetically detect any contraband that actually existed, and managed to check those bags by chance.

    Similarly, as a police officer, you could use your telekinetic sense to search for contraband passively as you drive, and exit your car to check with random passers by 'just to be sure'. What do you know, they have illegal substances or firearms on their person, hidden away! Could also sabotage mechanisms that could be plausibly sabotaged anyway. In the line of fire? Oh no, the guns pointed at you were jammed! Someone trying to run away, resist arrest? Seems they tripped and fell, how inconvenient for them! All by chance, of course, though you are somewhat lucky.

    Safety inspector or quality control is a good job as well. Detect internal faults in machinery without the need for expensive equipment.

    Perhaps being a doctor? On yourself, even if you don't do it for others. You can tell if a bone is bruised, broken, or unharmed. You could even set it, potentially, without having to stick your dirty mits in someone. When I put it like that, field medic might be more appropriate, given that people on the edge of death are less likely to notice that you didn't actually touch the needle you sewed up their wound with.

    I'll leave it there - I'm sure others could also contribute

      Wait a minute. We already have opposing muscles, constraints, etc. why aren't we doing this IRL??? Basically, you just have to repeatedly tense up and relax while laying in bed? I'd try it but I'm to lazy to exercise in the first place.

        I think this is called [isometric exercise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric\_exercise)
        ```

        - u/Stumpy_Bumpo:
          ```
          From the NASA study mentioned in the wikipedia article, that would result in loss of contractile proteins, yielding large but weak muscles.
          ```

      - u/Redditor76394:
        ```
        It works, but it's not very efficient. Forcing a muscle through a range of motion as you exert it tears the muscle fibers faster and more effectively than keeping the muscle static.

        Yes, you could tense say your arm and hold it for a while, but the maximum you can tense your arm doesn't compare to the stress inflicted by moving a heavy weight with your arm.

        Still, if you're too lazy to exercise traditionally, flexing all the muscles in your body while standing around or while in bed is certainly better than nothing.

      Really enjoy the thought of this. Very Skitter esque from Worm as far as the awareness of objects in your range goes. From what was displayed in the film, it did look like each of them needed direct line of sight for just about every instance of their powers that they used. But if they did in fact have any sort of awareness of the objects in that range they would jump several magnitudes on how effective the power could be.

        When Andrew puts some legos together he probably can’t see each individual piece at the same time, so there might be some feedback and some wiggle room? I can’t remember what he says about it though, he might just have to remember exactly how to do it.
        ```

        - u/Smartjedi:
          ```
          The biggest thing he says about it that I recall is that he refers to the fine tuned things like feeling it with your hands. 

          That said as another comment or pointed out Andrew also does the camera trick and he doesn't keep an eye on it all the time while moving it about so there might be something to the awareness angle here.

    For one thing, I would use the heck out of it in the kitchen. Imagine how much faster prepping a stir fry would be if I could chop all of the vegetables and aliums all at the same time! Imagine how much faster unloading the dishwasher would be!

    It would also make parenting much easier. When the baby goes to slam her head into the floor because she's mad, just gently lift her off the ground. If the baby's bored, flip her upside down for a bit or something. Dresser drawers have been emptied of clothes and the baby is mad because she wants to keep strewing? TK-restock, bam!

    If using the TK powers takes as much energy as lifting something manually, it could also be a weight loss regimen that can be done while gaming, which is pretty great.

    Having the power would make it much easier to do home improvement / repair kind of stuff, too.

    If we dropped the "living undetected" bit you could be the world's best trauma surgeon, but that wouldn't fly under the radar. And anyway, that sounds like way too much stress. Better to keep being a software developer and use the telekinesis for juggling upside-down babies and hearing them giggle while you play video games.

    any kind of personal craft or production could be made 1000% faster and more efficiently, and much more precisely.

    My favourite would be TK blacksmithing: using relentless TK pressure and blows to shape metal, increase pressure to harden it, and then quench in while crushed under pressure for extremely dense steel.

    Imagine a guy standing in the middle of a smithy, eyes closed, hands twitching as if orchestrating music. Hot chunks of metal flying around him in wisps of smoke and steam, reshaping as the go, and combine into a perfect suit of plate amour.
    ```

  - u/Izeinwinter:
    ```
    If you want to use the power without becoming famous for it, become a sculptor or toolmaker. You can shape molten metal into whatever shape you desire and just... let it solidify like that. And you can do this much, much faster than a conventional craftsman faffing about with vax and molds. A freefloating cloud of diamond dust should also let you do amazing things in stone, again, very quickly.
    ```

  - u/vakusdrake:
    ```
    Well this falls under the category of powers where the personal benefits it accrues are by mostly virtue of being famous as the only person with superpowers. Since you would pretty much automatically be one of the most famous people alive which is easily leveraged into wealth.       

    The one obvious thing you could do with these powers is make millions on by putting on a spacesuit and using your telekinesis to bring tons of stuff into orbit. That being said while you can make extra money from bringing things into orbit (and help to advance space industrialization) it wouldn't really make any difference to your QOL since you'd be filthy rich just from the fame anyway.
    ```

  - u/carturo222:
    ```
    With ultra-precise telekinesis, you're effectively omnipotent. You can keep germs out of your body and unclog your arteries every time you have too much pizza. You can conceive or not, at will. You can will oxygen to accompany you as you fly into orbit while keeping your body properly pressurized. Worried about detection? You can manipulate individual photons to vibrate at the wavelength you desire, making yourself indetectable.
    ```

    - u/Smartjedi:
      ```
      This is a good good good deal above the level of precision I was envisioning. More akin to some of the bullshit Magneto has pulled based on some comic scans I've seen. Super cool nonetheless.

      If we’re talking this level of precision I wonder if he could control fission, fusion, or even produce antimatter.

      > You can conceive or not, at will.

      Ok, I lol'd at thinking how this would work. But it probably would, as long as you can keep your, ah, focus at the crucial moment. If you're a man, at least; if you're a woman it may be considerably easier. And if it fails, very early abortion is a cinch.

      \> you're effectively omnipotent   


      Calling this version of telekinesis "effectively omnipotence" is like calling a particularly fast ant "effectively the [Heart of Gold](https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Infinite_Improbability_Drive)"!

  - u/plutonicHumanoid:

    Loved this movie. 

    Could use it similarly to Andrew and use it as the ultimate camera dolly, it’s unlikely that anyone will notice.

    Would also be good for personal yardwork.

    With a little practice, you could become very lucky at arcade games and eventually casino games or gambling (this can get dangerous though).

     - Dominate skee ball and other skill-based arcade games so bad untill the arcade/carnival bans you
     - Gently manipulate coins in coin-pusher games to get more coins or balls in pachinko machines 
     - Go to casinos and manipulate dice and roulette wheels so that you can win lots of money
     - Attend horse races or other betting sports and use the telekinesis to boost/brake horses/cars/baseballs/whatever so that you can win at sports

    Eventually, casinos might catch on you're cheating but they'll be scratching their heads as to how. Also, your TK should protect you from the people angry at your "luck"

      Wouldn't this end up like Henry Sugar? You just would get kicked out if you won too often, and you would have to change your name and appearance often so that the owners would not catch on.

  Say you're a superhero in a world of superheroes. Your power is to regulate the temperature of your skin. You can bring your body down to -253 degrees Celcius, or all the way up to 12,000 degrees celcius (when black body radiation is giving off bluish white glow). You can make your whole body that temperature in 1 millisecond, and bring it down to normal in another millisecond. This does not affect the air around you that was superheated to that temperature though. Or the heat flash that will radiate out.

  You can make a 1 cm^2 patch of your skin that temperature, or your whole body. You can control the shape and size of it. You can also control how long it takes to reach a certain temperature, from 1 ms to as long as you wish. You also get a standard brute package. You are tougher than normal. You can survive falling off a building, but getting hit by a train will probably kill you. 

  How do you use this power to emulate other superpowers?

    I like this, it's a cool twist on typical mnchkinry stuff. 

    ---

    Special goggles with lenses + superheating eyes -> laser eyes

    heating/cooling pneumatics controlling arms in suit -> super strength

    cooling down to very low temperatures -> fog/smoke creation

    Super cooling feet -> walk on water

    Hook up some magnets to a [Stirling engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling_engine) (or really, any compact heat-powered engine would do), superheat bottom, then generate a lot of electricity -> [electricity powers](https://youtu.be/_fTC_Ud_k3U?t=399) (much of the space in the backpack in the video is just cooling, which you could do automatically) also see [this](https://youtu.be/UNisqZOAaAs?t=498) for a possible result of using this technique). Similarly a technology-neutralizing effect could be mimicked via an EMP blast. Your gear could be protected via faraday cages. 

    Since you're in a world of superheros, and presuming there are also tinkers present, then there are certainly many advantages to having a large heat-sink and easy energy generation. Off the top of my head, if you find a way to get a whole lot of CPUs/GPUs packed onto your back in high transistor densities which would fry the components of a normal computer, then you may be able to replicate super-intelligence or contessa-like action sequence path by using a possibly computationally inefficient, but very accurate & fast (due to the transistors on your back) simple AI program (at the very simplest, a basic search algorithm or something, where all you need to do is define the puzzle properties, and let it find the optimal solution). Tinkers may not even be needed to be present for this to work. 

    By super heating metal balls with high melting points then throwing them at people you could mimic a hadouken.

      Some more ideas.
      By flash superheating your palms or the soles of your feet, you can pretty much fly like iron man. Except it would be more explosive, and probably concuss people near you.

      By controlling several points of superheated skin on your palm, turning them on or off at different frequencies, you could be a rudimentary speaker. It would be very rudimentary though, like only up to 500 Hz.

      By raising your skin temperature to max and down again quickly, you could be a continuous explosion. Would be hard to keep on your feet though.
      ```

    ```
    Well, you could use careful positioning of hot areas to generate a superheated jet of gas, particularly with some sorts of nozzles carefully positioned around your body. Or you could just play at being Iceman or the Human Torch.
    ```

  - u/DAL59:
    ```
    If you jump in a pool of water, you can catapult yourself in the air via steam explosion.
