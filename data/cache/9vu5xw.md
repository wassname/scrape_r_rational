## [Request]: Looking for stories involving meme's.

### Post:

I've recently gotten hyped about the idea of memes, in the sense of a parasitic reproducing thought.

Worth the Candle have some aspects with their >! info hazards but the ones that I remember seems mostly like anti-memes, the ones that'll try to kill you if you know them such as that guys name.!< 

I am imagining sentient thought-based entities that reproduce by manipulating the behaviour of their hosts to create offsprings, such as a species of memes that try to make two countries do horrible things to each other to promote outrage and retaliation that furthers that hate and horrible things. Or wars between species of sentient thought-based entities that compete for the limited memory space of their (human) hosts. Or ambiguous moral dilemmas about whether to kill off organisms that both are sentient but literally can't survive unless they feed of our processing power. Or memetic overlords blatantly screaming: "Spread me or you are a despicable piece of wasted oxygen." and both cultures that succumb or cultures that find ways to fight it.

  One of the better series involving memes and antimemes are the [Antimemetics Division stories](http://www.scp-wiki.net/antimemetics-division-hub), set in the [SCP universe](http://www.scp-wiki.net/) and written by ~~our god-king~~ [qntm](https://qntm.org/).
  ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    Wow, thanks for the reccomend!
    ```

  - u/Sonderjye:
    ```
    Those are mostly short stories right? Or is there a more coherent underlying story?
    ```

    - u/PresentCompanyExcl:
      ```
      An underlying story, just start with the antimimetic division link
      ```

      Although the SCP universe generally lends itself to the more short story format, in recent years there has been a drift towards the longer, more complex narratives. These stories are one example, and others include [Third Law](http://www.scp-wiki.net/third-law-hub) and [Those Twisted Pines](http://www.scp-wiki.net/those-twisted-pines-hub)
      ```

  Try **[Cordyceps](https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868)**.
  ```

    Just finished that, wow. >!Arc's ending was pretty awful (as in sad, not bad writing), but fitting. "Too clever for their own good" indeed. The story is tagged "irrationalfic", and that's a good name for it: Arc knew just enough about rationality to be dangerous to themself, as well as to others, and that ultimately cost them their life. It seems to be implied, though, that 3's reckless repeated wiping of Arc's memories may have contributed due to accumulated brain damage and poor impulse control.!<

  I'm assuming you already read [Sort by Controversial](http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/30/sort-by-controversial/) on SSC.

  * [*The Mind Parasites*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14495.The_Mind_Parasites) — a Lovecraftian horror novel, most relevant recommendation from this list, I think. Not giving a description to avoid possible spoilers.

  * [*Pontypool*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontypool_\(film\)) — a horror movie, certain words and concepts represented through English language become lethally viral.

  * [*the Resonance trilogy*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance) — a HP fanfic, Prophecies become reality warping and self-fulfilling memes when they are inappropriately handled and breach containment. The relevant plot arcs take place about halfway through the story (starting somewhere around ~1,200 out of ~2,000 pages written). The story itself has a somewhat slow-burn but realistic development (in character personalities, relationships, etc), with Harry eventually amassing enough power to start dimension-travelling.

  * [*Thursday Next series*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThursdayNext) — there’s an antagonist in the later books that is capable of turning representations of herself in other persons’ minds into self-aware (IIRC) sabotaging agents. The series itself has a kaleidoscope of other interesting and original ideas as well.

  * Weeping Angels from Doctor Who — see episodes [*Blink,*](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Blink_\(TV_story\)) [*The Time of Angels*,](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Time_of_Angels_\(TV_story\)) and [*Flesh and Stone.*](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Flesh_and_Stone_\(TV_story\)) 

   * see also [*That Which Holds The Image,*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7156582/1/That-Which-Holds-The-Image) a DW × HP cross-fic featuring them

  * [*Transdimensional Brain Chip*](http://brainchip.thecomicseries.com/) — a web original comic, by the end of the story two religious memeplexes infect a significant portion of the protagonist’s transdimensional network of selves into two separate and actively warring botnets.

  * and relevant SCPs of course: [1,](http://www.scp-wiki.net/system:page-tags/tag/memetic) [2,](https://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/7i4lli/best_memetic_scp/) etc.

  [The Daily Grind](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15925/the-daily-grind) has some memetic themes, although the meme "character" isn't introduced until relatively far into the story.
  ```

  - u/Sonderjye:
    ```
    I ended up ditching the daily grind a little after >! Secret were created and IIRC Secret didn't really do much. Do they put more focus on memetic warfare after that point? !<
    ```
