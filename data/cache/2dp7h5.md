## [Q][D] Would anyone be interested in a serial fiction platform?

### Post:

There's wordpress, and if that's good enough for everyone's purposes then I'll leave this project as-is, but I'm thinking features like:

* Version control

* Various pricing options (subscriptions, patreon-like systems, free samples + purchase, donations, etc.)

* Merchandising (i.e. quotes on mugs, t-shirts, posters, etc. Perhaps help connecting users with designers for other stuff like icons and logos?)

* PDF, epub, and mobi downloads

* Genre tags 

* Recommendation systems

* Updates via email (and other channels?)

* RSS feeds

* Custom CSS

* Custom domain names

* Author's notes

And anything else you can think of. It's just an idea at the moment, and mainly a way to see if there's demand. Cheers.

  A number of us have been demanding the creation of a LessWrongFiction site for a good while.  It would centralize our craving for stories about hyper-intellectual nerds like ourselves.

    That would be very practical.

  I would, as long as it was selective to high quality rational fiction. Like an online magazine of rationality. Eagle and Alexander, selected other high quality authors.
