## Munchkinry is headology of the self

> It’s been said that the difference between headology and psychiatry is that while a psychiatrist will try to convince you there’s no monster chasing you, a headologist will hand you a bat and a chair to stand up to it.

guys everyone listen i had an idea

it's a rephrasing of old ideas in maximally nerdish language

which is almost the same thing as novelty

So the basic concept of munchkinry is taking seriously ideas that obviously exist to not-be-taken seriously. Superman can fly and punch things real hard. Munchkinerery is thinking about that and realizing it would make a lot more sense for Superman to [turn a crank.](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2011-07-13)

Headology, meanwhile, is the idea that "[what people believe is what is real](https://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/Headology)." In the Discworld books, headology is explained in the context of a therapy session in which the patient's fears are taken as basically true, and the witches provide the logical solution.

Munchkinry is headology applied to stuff that *you* believe—it's the idea that what *you* believe is what is real. If you *actually think* that Superman can violate the laws of physics, have him *violate the laws of physics* and enjoy your perpetual motion machine. If you can *actually think* you can Obliviate and Polyjuice and Imperio to your heart's content, then *do that* and enjoy your Ministry of Magic. If you *actually think* that combining a few seemingly random low-level spells in DnD will let you destroy the gods, then *go full Pun-Pun* and enjoy your plane.

Taken into the realm of *actually real stuff*, self-headology says if you *actually think* you know better than the stock market, *bet against the stock market* and enjoy your millions. If you *actually think* something is the right/wrong thing to do, then *actually do or don't do it respectively* and enjoy your heavenly reward. On that note, if you *actually think* God is a nice person, then *expect him to live up to the most basic standards of decent behavior* and enjoy your lightning bolt to the face.

Munchkinery is *taking your beliefs seriously*. Or at least, it's the first step on the road. It's headology applied to *true beliefs about fictional things*. It's a realm where you can take ideas seriously without having to pay any costs, except getting disinvited to the next DnD meetup.

uhhh post your favorite examples of self-headology in the comments

because this is definitely a discussion thread and not me just treating reddit as my personal diary

  Headology seems to be a requirement of munchkinry, but fundamentally a different concept. For instance, in the first example you gave: if psychiatry is convincing someone a monster isn't following them, and headology is believing that there is one and giving them the tools to combat that monster, then munchkinry is believing there is one then saying, "Does this monster ever tire? What if we tie them to a millstone and derive production from their work?"

  Or, to put it another way, headology is "what you believe is true", while munchkinry is using that knowledge for maximum gain.

    A munchkin who's lived long enough to see why other munchkins *didn't* might follow up by asking, "Do monsters like it when you tie them to an electromagnet?"

  I'm not sure if you're definition of munchkinery is accurate. Taking poorly thought out ideas/rules seriously is definitely an important step for munchkining, but I don't think that's the core of what it is. I would say that munchkining is getting maximum value out of something regardless of whatever intent there might be. Munchkining definitely requires taking ideas seriously, but I don't think you need to believe something is real to be serious about it, I would say that being serious just involves putting maximum effort into something.

  Or do as CS Lewis did with Narnia and expect free-willed finite beings to always find a way to screw up the nice things God gave us, eventually resulting in the willing sacrifice of the Logos’ incarnation for that universe, whether Jesus the human or Aslan The Lion.

  Rational fiction is not by default atheist fiction. It’s *taking what is* and exploring the consequences. If “what is” includes “I Am,” explore it, like Heinlein in *Job*.
