## [D]A correction [Worm spoilers]

### Post:

I posted a few days ago about how I couldn't stand Worm.

I would like to retract most of that.

Having read to the point where Taylor is writing a note to her dad on her mother's grave, I can now say that I am hooked into this setting. Lisa's apparent refusal to break science with her *clearly* overpowered ability now makes sense, as she was using all of her resources breaking Coil and the universe instead. The imminent disintegration of the PRT makes me happy, and beating Dragon and Assmaster using just a crowd of teenagers was a stroke of brilliance. I was honestly thinking "Welp, Skitter's going to the birdcage. I wonder if she can convince Amy to make her some bugs just for self protection?" when they showed up, but Wildbow saw a way out of there I did *not* see coming. I really like how Skitter is growing into what she was always meant to be: the super-terrifying Queen of Brockton Bay.

    I only mildly disliked it. I assumed she was doing stuff like what she had done before the timeskip throughout that period, so once i got past the brief, "wait, what just happened?", i didn't mind it too much.

    [spoiler elaborations](#s "unlike as a villian, taylor has resources and more allies than before, and she can now keep up in an escaltion game- if it comes to that, she has backup all the way up the heirarchy,") So it would be hard to write most of it convincingly dangerous at the previous levels. The only exceptions would be class-A and higher threats.

      Ehhhhh....

      I really liked worm. And I also sorta disliked the timeskip. Your mileage may vary.

      Since you are enjoying worm, I'd really like to link you to a wallpaper I made for it, but its super spoilery. Ping me when you've finished it and I'll link you!

      Edit: Link to spoilery wallpaper incoming. ([Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/2gzqwf/spoilers_dual_monitor_wallpaper_taylor/)) You have been warned.

        Personally, I thought the signs were always there- Riddle tries to be sane, but is neurotic and misses obvious stuff at times. He's mostly sane, but little bits have been lost to rituals, not to mention the bhals supification on the mirror, so he's simultaniously more and less rational than an average irrationalist.

            Fair enough, though i assumed it was an example of sanity has it's advantages. riddle isn't stupid enough to sacrifice his sanity completely, but i can see mental disorders from the incest, and riddle's operation seems to always be move fast and break things.

      too much wasted potential. it could have been so great! but ey is content to wallow around for god-only-knows how many chapters, waffling about irrelevant shit. i despise it because of what it could have been, not what it is.

        The problem is that for EY the irrelevant shit is the point of writing HPMOR.
