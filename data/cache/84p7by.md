## [RT][DC][WIP] Forty Millenniums of Cultivation - Chapter 336

### Post:

FMoC has been mentioned a few times on this subreddit; translation continues at a steady rate. I felt the need to bring it up at this time, because [the most recently translated chapter](https://www.webnovel.com/book/6838665402001705/26656437597961422/Forty-Millenniums-of-Cultivation/Children-of-Occult-Orbs) is getting into Prisoner's Dilemma issues.

  Many people in the chinese webnovel community (translators and readers) have boycotted Qidian, the owner of the webnovel site you linked to, for scummy and underhanded business practices, including but not limited to lying and massively unfair contracts.

  [Example 1](https://weitranslations.wordpress.com/2017/10/21/qis-poaching-of-ccg-and-what-happened-between-me-qi-and-gts-slave-contract/comment-page-1/)

    That's not an unreasonable point to make, but Qidian are the publishers of FMoC, and the only ones translating it. If you want to read this particular story, they're the only game in town (barring the various leech sites that are literally just stealing their content to put their own ads on it; those are arguably worse).

    Also, as megazver noted; I'm not giving them any money, nor seeing any of their ads.

      Sounds like a Prisoner's Dilemma in real life!

      Do you cooperate with the translators by boycotting Qidian, or do you defect and get to read FMoC?

          That script still works fyi.

    They sound scummy but I'm not giving them any money, so ultimately I don't feel bad for reading the free stuff there.

  I've found it difficult to continue this. I am at chapter 42, and I recently realized what I didn't like: everything is huge. There has not been an event or fight or accomplishment that didn't have a corresponding description like: "his heart burst with such great joy it couldn't be contained."

  I was wondering if this type of "everything is the coolest thing" sticks around or if it gets better? 

  Or if anyone has a recommendation of a more down to earth example of xianxia. 

  Thanks!

    The mental processes and emotional reactions that are quite different from how a westerner would respond to things are a part of the charm of the genre. 40KoC is actually, like, a 6 out of 10 of the Chineseness scale, you should go [full Chinese](https://i.imgur.com/TAFYOEa.png) and read something where 'coughing up blood in astonishment' and 'involuntary kowtowing' are on the standard physical emotional reaction list.
    ```

      I mean, I get that it is its own genre, and it has its own ways. And I also get that many people greatly enjoy that.

      What I am saying, is that I have a hard time enjoying that. So I would love recommendations of the same genre, xianxia, but more "down to earth", as I described it.

      Thanks for the info though.

        I think that your problem is more with the Chinese writing style than anything else. FMoC already defies the genre conventions by quite a bit, so it does what you describe less than most... but it's still part of the accepted writing style, so it still comes up. In terms of a story that defies convention *even more*... Cultivation Chat Group comes to mind (read it on the site-of-your-choice, as there is some controversy over the translation host). That said, I don't think you'll entirely get away from that sort of reaction so long as you're reading stories by Chinese authors; that's just how they write.
        ```

        - u/ianstlawrence:
          ```
          Yes. What you said is true.

          Maybe I should be more direct. I am looking for anyone to recommend something *different* than the normal way of writing xianxia, a way that I find to be difficult to enjoy.

          Thank you for the recommendation of "Cultivation Chat Group". I'll check it out!

            Savage Divinity is also pretty decent, more westernized wuxia than xianxia, written natively in english.

              ```
              So far I like it very, very much. Thank you for the recommendation!

      I recently binged Tales of Demons and Gods and now I'm reading Emperor's Domination. This image is so accurate.

      Bollywood has the same thing of everything emotionally being amplified 10x vs what a given situation would be in western media. I think it just might be a non western culture thing haha

  Project Mystic Skeleton, man. Gotta build that Mystic Skeleton.

  ```
  Story follows the format: MC faces overwhelming challenge and everyone doubts him -> MC exceed expectations, doubters red-faced -> repeat. Often the reward for the reader is the humiliation of the MC doubters.  

  Character development is very slow and many opportunities frustratingly skipped by the author. I still find the plot enjoyable enough and it's the only xianxia I read.
  ```

  - u/abcd_z:
    ```
    Yup, that's xianxia for you.  Could be worse, of course.  In most other xianxia novels those attributes are cranked up to eleven.  The opponents will usually look down on the MC because of his apparently low level of cultivation and attempt to kill him, which allows him to justifiably fight back and often kill the aggressor, showcasing how much more powerful he is than everybody expected.  Lather, rinse, repeat.

    You notice how every now and then the author of 40K Cultivation references the way things used to be thousands of years ago, with a prevalent "might makes right" mentality?  That's the author referencing the xianxia genre as a whole.  Far in the past of 40K Cultivation it was just a standard xianxia novel, but their society has grown since that point.

  Still loving it, I'm always cheered up after a new chapter
