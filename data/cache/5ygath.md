  Something notable: the gods went silent at the opposite point of the 400 year cycle the sovereign gate and Primordial summoning operate on. Maybe the a ritual was done to cut the gods off from the world when their connection was weakest, and the Cataclysm was kicked off at the same point, at an accelerating pace that started off minor and unnoticeable.

    This could also explain why removing the divine bonds placed upon the Primordials is possible for humans to do. The gods could have been powering the prisons, and with them gone the prisons are weakening.

    Hmm, could it be that there is another, higher-level meta-simulation containing Sovereign Gate simulation as subsimulation, which started with Silence of Gods? First-order simulation is unable simulate Gods but able simulate spiritual planes, second-order simulation already unable simulate spiritual planes. Bu this logic there could be third-order simulation inside  Sovereign Gates which will be unable to simulate magic at all. From the other side there could be zero-order simulation, simulating Gods, and zero-order simulation could be far future of our timeline...

  So, the disappearance of the gods was brought up again.

  Didn't the time loop cut off all interplanar communications? Perhaps something similar happened there. It's also somewhat coincidental that such unnatural desertification would happen around the same time.

    The Ghost Serpent said that this was a regular occurrence, every 400 years (until it was interrupted, only to start this time round). If so, Shutur-Tarana came into power 1500 BC so that wouldn't tie well with it. And the gods fell silent a 100 years before the Cataclysm, so it'd be off again. 

    Of course, we do have precedent that the time loop can run before it's time, but it'll have less power (Ch 54/55 when the Guardian tells ZZ that it started a month ahead of regular schedule)

      Actually, it ties in perfectly. Check the comments; the author definitely intended the 400-year intervals to line up. Anything to the contrary was a typo.

        Maybe I'm misunderstanding.

        We know that the the gate was used around 1500 BC, and that planar alignments happen every 400 years. Thus, the gate could have been used at 1100 BC, 700 BC, 300 BC, and then 100 years after the Cataclysm.

        Thus, the gods fell silent right between two gate openings.

        **Edit:** The [author says that it's 500 years post-Cataclysm](https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2017/03/09/a-brief-history-of-ikosian-civilization/#comment-313). The Ghost Serpent says that the gate has dormant for the last few cycles, thus it wasn't used in 300 BC or 100 AC, at least.

        Not that it makes difference in regard to your point; I just put those things together and thought it was interesting.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          Ah, yes, I'd agree that the silence of the gods doesn't correspond to the planar alignment.

  Reading this I was fairly certain Shutur-Tarana was the first looper. Though I'd forgotten the passage, the story itself more or less confirms it.

  From chapter 33:

  > "Sovereign Gate?" asked Zorian.

  > "Never heard of that story?" Alanic asked. Zorian shook his head in negative. "Well, do you at least know who Shutur-Tarana Ihilkush was?"

  > "How could I not?" Zorian scowled. "My history teacher made us all memorize the first three chapters of 'The 13 Cities of Salaw' by heart. That would be the last king of Ikos, yes? The man who conquered all of the city states around the Umani-Re river and created the Ikosian Empire. What does he have to do with anything?"

  > "The Sovereign Gate is an artifact supposedly dating back from his time," Alanic said. "Like many great rulers, Shutur-Tarana has a great many fanciful stories and grandiose claims associated with him, and this particular one claims he either made or found a doorway into another world. Having found he did not age at all while on the other side, he spent '11 lifetimes' there, learning their secrets and honing his skills. Eventually, he grew homesick and decided to go back home. Once he was back in his own world, however, he found the doors forever barred to him. He stored the Sovereign Gate in his royal vault, there to wait for a worthy successor who would repeat his feat and usher the empire in a new age with the wisdom gained from the other side. Or, well, resurrect it… since it is thoroughly dead at this point."

  I suspect Zuwa might have been attempting to use it to prevent the Cataclysm, but it failed (or succeeded, but the subject killed them all after going mad in the loop and escaping).

  **EDIT:** It occurs to me that if the latter occurred (the person in the loop became evil during their experience) it could potentially be Quatach-Ichl, although I don't know if the timeline matches up and I think he'd be better informed about Zach/Zorian if he had been in their situation himself.

    He was definitely not the first looper, although he was probably the one of greatest historical significance in the last several thousand years.

    >"That is the only reason I’m talking to you. I know the Brand and I know what it means. Most have forgotten it, dormant as it has been in the **past few Cycles**, but I am older than the mountains and rivers, and I remember. I remember the crimes they did – the way they made me fall..." "They were regular like the progression between night and day," Ghost Serpent replied. "Every four hundred years, whenever the planets aligned. But the Gate has been lost for some time now, or perhaps the Key. Alas, it seems someone has finally enacted this wretched thing again. May he burn in the molten heart of the world forever, ever, ever!"

    It's notable that based on the Ghost Serpent's words, the Ikosian Emperor might very well have been the last person to use the Gate.  You could even argue that there's a chance that QI was the Emperor. But if had ever used the Gate himself he would probably figure out Zach and Zorian with much greater ease. I think he only has the crown because he's aware of its history, not its function.

  Having the [world map](http://dodo-ptica.deviantart.com/art/MoL-verse-World-Map-Huge-657220714) open to look at while reading this might help.

  Man, but each time I read 'Mother of Learning' posts I get an urge for a re-read and it's been 2 times already :P
