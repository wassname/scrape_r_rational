    Seconded.

    This story also suffers from a real lack of good villains. [spoilers](#s "The main villains are literally called Defiled, and there isn't much to them other than 'I want to rape and pillage.' Any other villains are similarly neutered, with their end goals boiling down to 'I'm better than you and you aren't licking my boots yet, so die.' Like, the current crop of villains had legitimate goals in that they wanted to stop the defiled at all costs, even if they needed to kill thousands to do so. Before they could directly come into contact with the mc, they've all turned defiled for very little reason. It's fucking bananas.")

    Also, just look at this chapter. I know for a fact that no one is gonna tell this concubine goddamn anything. This whole "teacher" thing is gonna last a really long time, and no one is going to fill in this lady in on the culture of Bekhai. She's a professional political concubine, shouldn't adapting to different cultures be something she's trained in? Instead she just assumes the worst out of the mc because he, a young adult who they know is new to the city from an isolated mountain culture, isn't perfectly fulfilling a role in their culture.

  It seems like you’re posting a lot of different stories here — maybe it’s worth indicating why you feel each fits in this sub?  (I’m not necessarily skeptical, since I haven’t read any.  It might help orient prospective readers though.)

    I have actually submitted this story before about two years ago. I thought it was worth resubmitting, especially since the author has been very productive in that time.

    The reason that I submitted a bunch today was because I just got the end of Joie de Vivre and Far Strider by Raga which are both more traditional Rationalist Fiction.  Basically self-insert fanfics where the MC munchkins the magic the industrialize the settings.

      The timing here is a little weird, though, considering that it still seems to be on hiatus.

  What is this and why should I read it?

    Its not really rational its more wish fulfillment with a flare of modern rational thinking than anything.

    If you like rational fiction, then you can read Savage Divinity as 'rational protagonist against an irrational world', with some mental trauma thrown in as spice.

    If you like rebirth / transported, then this is one of the better selections available in that genre.

    If you like Wuxia, then Savage Divinity can scratch that itch without the broken English and bad grammar you would be subjected to while reading most of the other content in the genre.

    If you don't like Wuxia... well, give it a try and it might change your mind.

  Here is the story description 

  A modern man finds himself reincarnated in the body of a young slave with no skills and quickly fading memories. Follow his journey to find normalcy while living in a savage world, filled with myth and legends, monsters and Demons. In a land where the strong rule, the weak serve, and bloodshed is a way of life, peace is a luxury few can afford.


  This is a cultivation style story and in my personal opinion one of the best. The author dispenses some of the worst traits of these types of story’s. Arbitrary levels and non sensical exponential economies. The MC slowly gains power and tries (most often failing) to use science to revolutionize the world. Another it is really only after ~300 chapters that you start to see this. The reasons that he fails so often is because this is a different world then ours and the author has well reasoned world building to explain why gun for example would not work. 

  I also find the characters well rounding and the story over has made me laugh out load a lot and nearly cry serval times.

    Thanks for the description!

    Are there any things you think the story does especially well? What do you like about it? Do you think it's especially rational/rationalist?

      The last couple arcs seem to be creeping in that direction, but at the moment I definitely would not say that it is.

  I have dropped it for one reason- the number of POVs, every single charcter get one.
  ```

    ```
    Dude me too. I couldn't handle it anymore. I liked the MC enough to keep reading it, but not even 25% of the time did the story focus on him (not the whole story, but for a good chunk of chapters). Too many POVs.
