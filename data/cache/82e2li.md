## Idea: Rational The Good Place

### Post:

Eleanor gets a super-rationalist upgrade, without getting an intelligence upgrade.

  [Season One spoilers](#s "The Good Place would need an upgrade too. Give Sauron the Death Star. Could explore fun UFAI themes, matrixes within matrixes such that she could never be sure she’s not being tortured, the architects reading her mind and continually throwing her off certain areas of inquiry with contradictory false evidence or partial brain wipes. Marginally rational god-like beings would be terrifying to fight and nigh-impossible to defeat. I can’t imagine a story that builds satisfactorily from first principles into characters-are-not-going-to-end-up-tortured-forever. Rewriting it as a quick Crack Fic in which everything else is the same and Eleanor kicks ass could be entertaining.")

  That said, like a previous redditor once commented: ideas are cheap. I would love to see this attempted but lack the time and talent to see a project like this into fruition. 

  Edit: spoiler tags failure

    SPOILER

    Eleanor is already fairly rational (or at least becomes so over the course of the series). The main difference would be making her more curious so she actually investigates the history of the system, what exactly Janets are, the arbitrary bureaucracy, metaphysics and control systems (stuff like Janet's button). At some point she may well suspect she is in a nested simulation and then you could make it a crossover with the matrix or something.

    Re: spoiler tags, you have to keep the part after the "#s" between quotes, else it just registers as a link (I'm guessing that was your problem)

      Thanks for the help. I appreciate it

        Your spoiler tags still aren't working, you need to use regular double quotes (") specifically, not tilted quotes (“).

          Yeah, I was wondering about that.

    If we're still in the "comedy" genre we don't necessarily need to upgrade the enemies (and besides, the enemies are already way more powerful as it is)

  Counter-argument: The Good Place is already a rational work.

    ```
    This. The characters aren't rationalists, but the world and story clearly are

    I think you've got a point. I think part of the reason I watch is to see if they will measure up to my expectations. :D

      The Good Place feels like what a rationalist fiction author would write if she had to write an NBC prime time comedy that would appeal to a mainstream audience. [Major Season 1 Spoiler](#s " There's even a scene where a character who we later find out is basically an Unfriendly AI talks about how awesome paperclips are.")
      ```

      - u/LiteralHeadCannon:
        ```
        I'm not sure if [Major Season 2 Spoiler](#s "he really qualifies as an Unfriendly AI given the events of Season 2.  More like a culturally alien human with a significant amount of power.")
        ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Eleanor is already amazing and needs no upgrade. She's basically done the equivalent of beating a dictionary attack already.
  ```

- u/akaltyn:
  ```
  One limitation is that we don't really know how the system works overall. Given the massive twists that have happened so far I wouldn't be surprised if we get more that completely rearrange the setting
  ```

    I think that's a scaled-up version of the problem with any fanfic of an ongoing work. The only way around it is probably to pick an episode as a point-of-departure for the AU, and then ignore canon developments after that point. We'd probably want to start writing in the gap between seasons to give the fic time to develop its own story before it starts coming out in parallel with new episodes.

    For example, [Major Season 1 Spoilers](#s " When they first Janet play the audio clip from The Bad Place, I was hoping they would realize they had to do something, and start working on how to create a Medium Place. A rational fic could either Word of God that they actually are in The Good Place, or at least leave the question open, and focus on their efforts to figure out the exact rules of the scoring system, who set it all up, how neighborhoods get created, what exactly the Janets are, etc.")
    ```

- u/dankuck:
  ```
  I'd like to believe that a rationalist in the [real] Good Place would tear the whole thing to pieces with his inquisitions.

  I'll bet everyone here suspected from the beginning that they were not in the Good Place because that would generally be a boring story.

  But there's also a hard problem because Good Places should be full of people trying to fix the system. Any story teller in this universe is probably painted into a corner so that they cannot actually depict the Good Place. Or else The Good Place isn't actually that good because it somehow restricts people from being able to fix the system.

  Maybe the only one who can fix it is a person from the Bad Place.

  Hmm...

    > I'll bet everyone here suspected from the beginning that they were not in the Good Place because that would generally be a boring story.

    I actually thought this was handled pretty nicely by depicting the Architects et all as having basically human motivations and flaws. Things like Michael talking about his bosses, how it was his first time designing a neighborhood, plus the fact that they made a mistake with Eleanor did a good job of setting up potential conflict even if they had been in the real Good Place. I think it's possible to do a r! AU fic where they actually are in the Good Place, but unlike most rationalist visions of immortality they don't have any way to modify the residents' minds, so they can't use transhumanist hand-waving to make them immune to boredom and ennui.
    ```

      Yeah, they did a good job. I was never quite sure until the reveal.

    The whole point of S1 was to make everyone suspect that from the start, and then slowly lull you to sleep and convince you that you were overthinking the show before asspulling you with the big reveal. It was a masterpiece of engineering audience expectations.
