## [Biweekly Challenge] Reverse Portal Fantasy

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4oa5ti/biweekly_challenge_space_battles/?sort=confidence) the prompt was "Space Battles". The winner was /u/kishoto with their story, [Hammer in Space](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4oa5ti/biweekly_challenge_space_battles/d4aw9ue). Go read it now! Congratulations to /u/kishoto!

##### This Time

It's been one year since the first /r/rational challenge, discounting a few earlier proto-challenges. I think it's appropriate for us to go back and do a twist on [that first challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3a7ypf/weekly_challenge_portal_fantasy/); the theme will be "Reverse Portal Fantasy". If a portal fantasy is where someone from our world steps into another, then a reverse portal fantasy is where someone from another world steps into ours. Of course, this is entirely a matter of perspective, since one character's portal fantasy is another's reverse portal fantasy, but the intent here is to get stories about fantastical people stepping into the mundane world. Feel free to try out whatever variations you'd like though. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, July 13th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Next time, we'll be doing "Happy Stories". Any genre, any subject, so long as it's happy (and, obviously, rational). I'm issuing this challenge partly because a lot of rational fiction deals with darker themes and subjects, and partly because I'm personally incapable of writing anything optimistic or light. (I try my best to make sure that multiple ideas can be easily generated for these challenges, and my immediate thought for this one was the existential horror of wireheading. Please don't write something like that.)

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 7/13.** Please private message me with any questions or comments, as the beloved meta thread is now archived. The companion thread [is available here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4qikz5/challenge_companion_reverse_portal_fantasy/).

### Comments:

- u/Sailor_Vulcan:
  ```
  This is a Mage Wars fanfiction I started writing a couple days ago. Not entirely certain whether it counts as a reverse portal fantasy, since in the story our world is a magical simulation within the world of Etheria. The story is tentatively titled "5000 PE" where PE means Pax Etheria, and 5000 PE refers to the year.
