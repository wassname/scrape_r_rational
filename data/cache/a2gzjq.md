  Man, something about straight out posting Amazon links feels wrong to me. Feels like there should be a rule where there needs to exist some content available for free before you can share it as a full submission.
  ```

    I think it should be OK, but I could use a little more description of the book and whether it's worth anything. If I can't read part of it and make a judgment myself, the rec needs to be a lot more significant. Like, paragraphs, not sentences.
    ```

      There's no rule against posting Amazon links, and probably never will be (same for any other commercial site).

      That said, I do think that submission statements are more important if there's no way to judge quality without spending money, and to reduce the appearance/presumption that it's just being posted here because this is a place where people read fiction, rather than because it's actually a good fit.
      ```

        I agree. More justification if we can't decide for ourselves.

      I posted after seeing the Thrall link (which I bough btw).

      Let me see if I can write a good intro.

  Pitch:  


  The world is a classic RPG game. Adventurers come in kill liches and go back to their boring lives. Our protagonist is an NPC that switched souls with such an adventurer. So we see his interactions with the same world from a PC point of view, his fight with game mechanics and his tries to find game developers and eat their faces.

    What parts of it fit in the rational genre?
    ```

    - u/hoja_nasredin:
      ```
      The fact that it is a deconstruction of the genre with a rational protagonist that tries to understand how the world around him work. 90% of deconstruction if not overflowing bwith drama are rationalist.
      ```

- u/dalitt:
  ```
  FWIW, I’ve read the first few chapters and I think that this broadly fits r/rational — the writing is fairly good and the protagonist is certainly attempting to understand the game world in a reasonably rational way.
  ```

  - u/dalitt:
    ```
    About halfway through now. The writing remains solid, but in my view the story has become rather far from rational. (Several decisions made by the protagonist rely largely on luck and intuition, in a way which seems to me to be unjustifiable.)
    ```

  - u/hh26:
    ```
    I just got it also have read the first few chapters, and I sort of agree.  The main character is attempting rationality, but with a whole bunch of weird cultural biases and assumptions that are different than the biases and assumptions of a modern day human.

    He doesn't understand game mechanics, his dismissal of the boxes advice and not reading every single line of text explanation is by far the biggest mistake he keeps making, but he's not used to playing games where you have to read the instructions to learn all of the mechanics.

    He's spent his whole life being rational by his own perception of such a thing.  Might makes right, magic is awesome, emotions and bodily functions are unneccesary distractions.  And he munchkined to some degree by becoming undead and having his followers be undead so they no longer have to put up with these distractions.  He's used to exploiting his universe one way, and now these game mechanics are a complete paradigm shift that need to be exploited in a different way, and he's only partially sucessful at realizing this.
    ```

    - u/FordEngineerman:
      ```
      I'm actually super down for a character who attempts to be rational but has different assumptions and biases due to culture. I would be very frustrated though by a character that refuses to gather as much information as possible to help in decision making. That seems anti-rational regardless of baseline assumptions. (Unless your base assumptions are from some kind of horror world where knowledge leads to death or consequences due to some inherent rules of the universe or something.)
      ```

      - u/hh26:
        ```
        Yeah.  Though I should note that as I continue reading, he seems to be doing more reading and information gathering so that he can exploit the system than he did at the beginning.  His dismissing them seems to have been an initial reaction to them suddenly showing up and constantly spamming him with mostly redundant information about rocks and trees and stuff, with the relevant information buried in all of the noise.  He still should have paid more attention at the beginning, but he seems to be adapting more as the story progresses and he gets used to it.
        ```
