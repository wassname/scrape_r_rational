## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

- u/Makin-:
  ```
  It was already recommended, but I only now finished it: *Project Hail Mary* is an excellent novel that this subreddit will enjoy, featuring all the cool scenes sci-fi should have but rarely does. It's *The Martian* with better everything, except the science, which falls short of realism sometimes.
  ```

    +1 for PHM, it's one of the best books I've read in the past 5 years.

  I recently finished Piranesi by Susanna Clarke. It's a magnificent, meditative, sensory book that was a total delight to read. The protag is a talented rationalist operating under some extremely difficult conditions, including bad-faith agents actively trying to stymie him, and who still manages to infer a lot about the nature of his reality. Highly recommended.

    I'm still working through *JS&M.N*, but that sounds really promising.

      I rented JS&MN via Libby after finishing Piranesi! I can tell you that the latter is a huge change of pace & will likely be very refreshing after finishing the former.

  For those that enjoy Elden Ring lore, I heartily recommend [A Brocktonite Yankee in Queen Marika's Court (Worm/Elden Ring)](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-brocktonite-yankee-in-queen-marikas-court-worm-elden-ring.1072361/reader/) . The author does an incredible job of fleshing out the world without breaking the reality of it.

  I'll recommend [The Game at Carousel ](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/65629/the-game-at-carousel-a-horror-movie-litrpg), it was a pretty different litrpg than the standard fare and so far a fun read.  

  I've also been catching up on The Hitting Zone but I was wondering if anyone had come across similar fics?

    *[Terror Inifinity](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33869182-terror-infinity-volume-1)* by Zhttty — a 23-volume web-original that's technically a crossfic of several different horror / action settings.  With these 23 volumes it's apparently only the first "part" of the story that's complete. AFAIK, there's supposed to be a 2nd part that's either WiP or abandoned.

    From the good things: 

    • (IIRC) the story's more often rational than not 

    •• there are a few places and things that count as penalty points against this — like incongruent developments within the setting or stupid / inefficient prot decisions, but mostly the story manages to hold its quality mark (at the very least, for the first 50%+ of the story)

    • character designs 

    •• character interactions, dialogues, dilemmas

    • setting designs 

    •• as with some other Asian webnovels, has a much more thorough world-building than what's featured in an average Western web-original

    •• setting interactions — i.e. elements from one setting interacting with el. from others

    •• deconstruction and reconstruction of featured settings 

    •• evolving settings — i.e. permanent changes happening to the setting environment due to characters' actions, >!ability to re-visit the same setting later on!<

    • fight scenes

    • has a few recursive fanfics by now (although I haven't read anything of good quality yet)

    From the drawbacks: 

    • the initial publication was an asian web-original that (AFAIK) worked through the pay-to-unlock-chapters principle 

    •• the translation version that's being hosted by the copyright-holder works in a similar manner; although freely available versions can be found out there as well 

    • the evolution-related pseudo-philosophy used as [excuse plot](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot) felt wacky to me 

    • (IIRC) some pro-China jingoism was present, but this may be incorrect

    ---

    It should be possible to find some other similar works [here,](https://forum.novelupdates.com/threads/and-decent-terror-infinity-style-novels-recently.126144/) but I haven't checked them out myself yet.

  So, I've just begun a rather interesting journey with my writing. I only have one chapter for it, but I'm proud to introduce

  ```

- u/andor3333:
  ```
  I recommend the [Ultimate Rock Paper Scissors](https://m.manganelo.com/manga-eh118875) Tournament, the most rational manga about a rock paper scissors tournament between people with superpowers ever written.

  Another fun novel with a tournament style competition with superpowers is the Naruto fic “[The Waves Arisen](https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/chapter-1/)”. It only has this in one or two story arcs, not as the entire focus. 



  I would be interested in recommendations of other tournament style fics where people use their skills or powers rationally.
  ```

  - u/DomesticatedDungeon:
    ```
    * [*Hunter x Hunter*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2098220/ ) has a tournment arc — maybe even two, if you also count the Greed Island arc. It's locally (scene-to-scene) rational, but globally (global plot railroading) irrational, esp. when it comes to prot's plot armor. It also has excellent fight scenes and OST.

    ---

    * [*Tower of God*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12057106/) — has good (and high production value) fight scenes / drawing, but isn't that rational.
    ```

    - u/andor3333:
      ```
      I also enjoyed Tower of God, particularly the strategies used by Koon.
      ```

  - u/vorpal_potato:
    ```
    I just finished re-reading Ultimate Rock Paper Scissors, and it was an absolute blast. In addition to being clever and hilariously over-the-top, it somehow managed to have a world with enough internal consistency that you can follow along with the tactics in each match *even when those tactics involve a ninja being suddenly attacked by a subterranean army of mole-men.* Or other, even stranger things. (And the ending is very satisfying.)
    ```

  - u/GrizzlyTrees:
    ```
    Cradle is a cutivation/progressionFantasy/Xianxia novel series, and there are at least two "tournament" arcs, including in the first book. The series is pretty rational compared to most stories of the genre, with consistent powers and relatively rational actors, though more at the level of a Sanderson book than the usual standards of this community. It's also really fun, and the twelfth and last book is coming out in a few months.

    Due to some plot twists, giving too much description will be very spoilery, but the MC, Lindon, has a very underdog-ish start where he has to "really try" in order to get any kind of success, and is therefore the kind of resourceful protagonist that people in this sub tend to like. Other than that, I'll say the series has a feel of a shonen anime, but is also generally well written with fast pacing and good plot structure (so like the early arcs of Bleach, for example). 

    The first half of the first book (which is pretty short) has a certain feel to it (and sets certain expectations about the rest of the series) that are not exactly maintained, so if the early parts don't quite capture your interest, I recommend pushing through. I started to read it, abandoned near that point, then came back and read through 10 books in 2 months, it gets really good.
    ```

    - u/ThePhrastusBombastus:
      ```
      I *adore* Cradle, but saying it has a tournament arc in the first book is pretty misleading. There's a proper (lengthy) tournament arc seven or so books in, but it takes a pretty good wordcount to get there.
      ```

      - u/lo4952:
        ```
        If you want xianxia Tournament Arcs, my go-to is always *Douluo Dalu / Soul Land*, which is like 80% tournament by volume. The downside, of course, is that it's xianxia, and therefore about the furthest thing you can physically get from rational.
        ```

      - u/GrizzlyTrees:
        ```
        I disagree. The seven year festival is a tournament arc, a not insignificant part of the first book's plot revolves around it. That there is a better arc later doesn't mean this one wouldn't scratch his itch.
        ```

        - u/1900U:
          ```
          Calling the seven year tournament a tournament arc is super disengious. It lasts for around 50 pages, none of the participants were introduced prior or really fleshed out, and the protagonist only really has one challenging fight. De-rec to Cradle in general though, one dimensional characters, poor prose, and inconsistent world building. Bastion, Forge of Destiny, and Memories of the fall are all much better Xiania imo, and all of them have tournaments too if I'm remembering correctly.
          ```

          - u/sephirothrr:
            ```
            > poor prose

            > disengious

            really, the jokes write themselves 

            I agree that the tournament in Unsouled isn't, really, but calling it *disingenuous* is a touch too far - it does at least present as one, even though the one in Uncrowned is much more so.

            That said, I'm not sure about your other criticisms - the prose isn't Hemingway but it's appropriately solid for the audience, and I have no idea what you mean by the dig of the characters or the world building. 

            Like, the latter, sure, there's one or two notable plot beats that have reached meme status in the community for their apparent nonsensicality, but currently at book 11 all those seem to have been resolved.

            The same for characters - they take a while to grow, perhaps, but I think the character evolution is a strength of Cradle as opposed to other works in the genre.

            It seems like you haven't read many of the books before making your complaints, which isn't completely invalid - the books should in theory be able to stand on their own, but I think it is a bit shortsighted.

            For others reading this, if you can't tell, I highly recommend Cradle - it's not perfect but it's the best xianxia available in the west, and surprisingly rational to boot.

  Curveball (https://www.eviscerati.org/fiction/cb/introduction) is an excellent superpower story where the main characters power is more or less directed luck and he's trying to figure out a giant conspiracy. It's extremely well written and has multiple arcs completed.
  ```

  - u/Makin-:
    ```
    I think it's worth mentioning that it essentially stopped in 2018, with a single update in 2021. Do you think this is going to ever finish?

      ```
      It seems to be his passion project and he doesn't release single chapters, he'll release a whole arc when it is finished which has anywhere between 10-35 chapters. I doubt it'll ever get fully finished but I wouldn't be surprised if another arc comes out at some point in the future.

  I personally found [Ajin: Demi Human](https://myanimelist.net/manga/49865/Ajin) to be *fantastic*. The characters have identical powers and do their best to understand and exploit them.

    ```
    One of the best action thriller stories out there. The art and scheming is top notch from start to finish. 

    Edit: I just realized you linked to the anime. If you haven't yet, highly highly recommend reading the manga. I liked the anime well enough but the manga is where everything really shines here.
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:

      whoops, yeah, meant to link to the manga. Thanks for telling me. Zero interest in watching the anime; there's no way it can match up to the manga.

- u/meangreenking:

  Looking for recs for foreign works. For me at least the draw of them is that even if the work is cookie cutter and generally terrible (*cough* xianxia *cough*) it comes with loads of new tropes and cultural expectations that make it feel fresh and unique.

  I've already read a lot of Japanese/Chinese/Korean, so I'm not looking for any more of those.

  Requested genre is just good fantasy/sci-fi in general.

  E: Thanks for all the recs guys, will check them out.

  - u/Dragongeek:
    ```
    Not really rational or particularly long, but if you're looking for cultural experience, I'd recommend reading the original German Grimm fairy tales. 

    Very different from today's "mainstream" American fiction, and a window into culture and history.
    ```

  - u/TREB0R:
    ```
    Raybearer by Jordan Ifueko and The Rage of Dragons by Evan Winter were fun in that they are fantasy books with African cultural elements. Raybearer was pretty cool in that it had the tone of an oral telling of a story.

    It's a book that might be hard to find, but this series: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simoqin_Prophecies always stood out to me as a huge predecessor of a lot of deconstructionist stuff you see in /r/rational. 

    The best part about it, is that it's entirely centered on Indian mythology, you get snide references to the famous tales, while you have elf like creatures from western fantasy. I think if /r/rational had any familiarity with Indian myths, it'd be an instant success. 

    I got it for free when I bought some books in India as a kid, and was absolutely hooked. Been almost 20 years since I first read it (damn, time flies) and I still remember it fondly.

  I know it's been recommended before, but people, for real, if you aren't reading Planecrash yet, you are missing out! It's written (in part) by Eliezer himself (posting as "Iarwain"), and I'd say is actually a lot better than most of his previous works, and seems to be nearing completion. It's got some crazy hype moments- almost brought me to tears once or twice.

  I love HPMOR of course, but there's reasons why it scared so many people off. Planecrash does a much better job of presenting alternate viewpoints, not taking *every* opportunity to lecture the reader (though there's still plenty of that, there are even some literal math lessons in here, but they're sort of fun, and kinda skippable, so it's not so bad), pointing out when it's protagonist is actually wrong about something, and overall just comes across as a lot more reasonable and mature (in my opinion). 

  [Here's](https://glowfic.com/posts/6322) a link to an explanation of how to read it all and use the site. It contains a link to the story proper. 

  I should also mention that its a crossover of Pathfinder and Dath Ilan, but as someone with little knowledge of either, I was able to follow along just fine anyway.

  -----------------------
  While I'm here, I should also mention that gazemaize, author of the much beloved yet forever underrated "[Chili and the Chocolate Factory](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13451176/1/Chili-and-the-Chocolate-Factory-Fudge-Revelation)", actually posted a link to a new story three months back. 

  https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/zsxgik/sing_you_only_try_rt_ff_wip/

  It seems like people were confused, so didn't participate much. I worry that some people might not have seen it. There's only one chapter out (if you can even call it a chapter...) as of now, and it seems to be requesting Hunger Games OC's to be anonymously submitted in the comments. At only five responses so far, I worry that they aren't getting enough. As someone who is desperate for more from this author, I'd implore you all to consider sending in characters.

  Are there any Star Wars fanfics which try to explain even some of the technology?

  Like, why do lightsabers not pass through each other? Why do they behave as if they had a solid core? And why can they block whatever projectiles blasters are shooting?

  Or, why do people use holograms to communicate, which are monochromatic and flickery instead of just using screens?

  I wonder whether one can come up with clever explanations for these things.

    A few real-life physicists actually suggested a design for a lightsaber which answers those questions. Although it clearly requires more advanced tech than currently available.

  so, I've been looking for some MHA fanfiction but all the good ones seem to be:

  a) Short (<150k).

  b) Dead.

  c) Updating so slowly they might as well be dead.

    Walk a mile in another's shoes is my favourite, and the one that will appeal the most to this subreddit (https://archiveofourown.org/works/43409856/chapters/109126278) at around 100 K  words right now. Give it a couple months/years before you start reading and hopefully it'll reach 150k! It updates slowly, but I'm including it anyway bc the wait is worth it.

  Recently binged a manhwa called "The Ember Knight": https://m.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/the-ember-knight/list?title_no=2886&page=1&webtoon-platform-redirect=true

  It's set in the same world as the author's previous work, "Gilgamesh," which I haven't read.

  The protagonist is seeking revenge for the death of his twin brother, who was killed by a mysterious masked group for unknown reasons. To that end, he takes his brother's name and place as an apprentice knight.
  The problem is, he's nowhere as strong as his brother, who was known as a prodigy in a world of shonen manga characters, and he has to trick and scheme his way to his goals while being as weak and fragile as a regular person.

  It's a lot of fun watching the protagonist BS his way through situations he had no right living through.

  ```
  I'm looking for a story that I'm pretty sure was posted here a few years ago. The premise is that Christianity (or maybe Judaism?) is known to be true. Hell can be observed, and it's the "separation from God" kind of interpretation, where it seems like a kind of non-torturous purgatory. From what I remember, the story follows a main character who is distraught because his wife, who was killed when an angel descended from heaven near them, made it to heaven, and the MC is certain that he will go to hell. Spoilers for the ending: >!It's revealed that there are people who have witnessed God (not sure if this is the actual terminology used) who come off as brainwashed, but are guaranteed a place in heaven. This can happen to any random person, regardeless of their faith or sins. The MC actively tries to become one of those people, and he succeeds, but is sent to hell anyway. This makes him the only person in hell who is tormented, due to his witnessing and separation from God.!<
