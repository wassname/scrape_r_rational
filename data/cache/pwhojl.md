## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

    Does dragoneye get substantially better than it is at around the end of book 1? Because I read it and the impression was very meh. The hundreds of thousands of packed flying dinos make no sense. The distances and travel times also are basically meaningless. He alluded to the future enemies being this ant empire and that doesn't interest me much. 

    &#x200B;

    As far as litrpgs go it's fine, the system is serviceable, but not particularly interesting either.  It's ok to pass time but that's about it.

    &#x200B;

    Been trying to get through kingside, but damn that start is boring, he could have skipped all that crap that's meaningless to the overhaul story and just started with him as a leader and tell us about his rise to power through flashbacks if it ever came up or was significant. 

    &#x200B;

    It baffles me how some writers still do this, the story he wants to tell is kingdom building uplift, why do you feel the need to start the story off before that is happening? Skip that stuff, I don't need to follow along with your character from the time he's isekaied to the time he becomes a ruler, the same way I don't need to see a character be born or grow up to read normal fiction. If his rise to power is not particularly interesting or relevant to the story just skip it.

      No. if anything it's becoming slightly worse. But I liked it anyway and planning to catch up to it sometime later.

      It's kind of necessary evil. Writer want to write, especially non-profit writer. Reader should give them some slack and encourage them, otherwise they will not write at all. Castle Kingside still boring though, dropped it before actual kingdom building started.

        Its not necessary. Its a fairly common writing recommendation that if you are not interested in writing a sub-arc of a story, you should just not write it, because readers wont be interested in reading what you force yourself to put on the page either.

    I read this on your recommendation and it's not bad per-se, but it seems a little confused and I hesitate to give it a rec. The story has a strong genre shift 40 chapters in which I'm surprised survived a rewrite.  

    The main character is almost rational, in that he loves science.  But he doesn't really seem rational. He gets new magic that he doesn't explore until it's plot time.  He finds some fairly low hanging fruit from other people's magic (idk how they never discovered it before) but doesn't explore further. And he personally takes actions to drive the plot rather than them being the logical thing to do.

    I don't hate it. It's a decent member of the fantasy uplift genre, which is frequently bad. 3.5 stars maybe.

  Just going to echo some recommendations other people have made in previous weeks:

  * [This Used to Be About Dungeons](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/45534/this-used-to-be-about-dungeons) is really great, though I am so used to Alexander Wales' previous novel, [Worth the Candle](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25137/worth-the-candle), and its fairly dark and meta world that I keep expecting things to go sideways in the worst kind of way. So far though it's been pretty much exactly as presented, which is an almost cozy story of five people forming a dungeoneering team in a fantasy world. I think my favorite part is how each character is so unique and well-written that they are easy to tell apart; there's no blending of character voices like with some other novels. Really looking forward to seeing where this goes.
  * [12 Miles Below](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/42367/12-miles-below) is a really interesting story so far as well; I just finished the first book (so about 48ish chapters of the 55 or so out right now). I was a bit surprised about halfway through when some information was revealed that seemed like it may be a "NPC in an MMO world deals with players" scene change, but luckily it doesn't look like it's going in that direction by the end of the first book, at least. It's an interesting blend of genres right now, but I like the main character and there are a lot of hooks from the first book to make book 2's plot beefy.
  * Finally, [Beware of Chicken](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/39408/beware-of-chicken) is just a pleasure to come back to. It's set in a xanxia world, and I've read a fair number of xanxia and... not been impressed. This is more of a western deconstruction of the genre and instead becomes a slice-of-life story of an isekai'd protagonist who bows out of being a cultivator and instead goes to start a simple farm life in the boondocks of an empire. The supporting cast is really enjoyable, especially the spirit beasts. The story is leaning more toward traditional xanxia now (they just began a tournament arc), so we'll see if it remains good... but so far, it's just a feel-good story that updates several times a week, keeping the plot moving along pleasantly.
  ```

  - u/gramineous:
    ```
    Beware of Chicken is great, although the "tournament arc" is (so far) closer to a tourism arc, when one side character basically taking three other side characters along to the tournament and city as a sightseeing trip, and the two side characters who actually enter the tournament being far and away the most powerful cultivators there that the tournament is just a Xianxia-themed backdrop to flesh out the world rather than major struggle or conflict
    ```

      ```

      ```
      Though there is a bad guy in the crowd, who will inevitably bump into (or actively seek out) at least one of the competitors.  I'm not expecting a full-on tragedy, but there is at least some unpleasantness ahead.

      In general, I quite enjoy Beware of Chicken.  Most of the the time, it is simply delightful.

  /u/Jose1561 posted their [lists of fiction they'd consumed](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/prvhgw/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/hdo3hgs/), and from that list I'd like to re-rec [Solanin](https://myanimelist.net/manga/3731/Solanin) and [The Gods Lie](https://myanimelist.net/manga/50217/Kamisama_ga_Uso_wo_Tsuku).

  Also, does anyone have any recommendations for Reversed Gender Roles World stuff? I enjoy the trashy stuff (ex.

  I played [The Forgotten City](https://store.steampowered.com/app/874260/The_Forgotten_City/) this week and thought it was great. It is a timeloop whodunit game set in an isolated ancient roman city.

  Since I assume we all love time loop whodunits I won't spoil anything other than say the story overall met up to my standards, though as usual the best part is before the mystery is revealed.

  As for the game part it is extremely similar to Skyrim, which makes sense since it used to be a Skyrim mod. Since I have played Skyrim I felt right at home. Most of the game is dialogue, which I prefer, though there were some points were you got to be a stealth archer.

  A bit on the short side, so maybe wait for a sale, but I liked what was there.

  I just discovered a really good DC comics fic called [But Doctor, I am Pagliacci](https://archiveofourown.org/works/21716713/chapters/51801295). I don't know if it's "rational" as such but it works as competence porn - characters that are supposed to be "smart" manage to deal with enemies that would normally be outside their "weight class" by exploiting the super-tech and other various ways of empowering "ordinary" humans in the DC Universe and by getting powerful allies to help them.

  Special kudos goes to Dr. Thaddeus Sivana, normally a Captain Marvel ("Shazam!") villain who seems like the kind of character that is usually a "genius" in name only but in this story puts him in the same kind of class as Batman and Lex Luthor.

  The only problem is that the author announced a "temporary" hiatus at the beginning of the COVID pandemic and hasn't written any more since. :(

  It's got a skip-the-start *in medias res* opener, and it doesn't stop to fill you in on what happened for quite a while.

        It is one of my favorite books, *ever*.  Perhaps because I read it when it first was published. My username is 'ansible' in reference to the sort-of-precursor short story "The Blabber" by Vinge.

        The prologue of AFUtD is jam-packed with leading-edge thinking about what future computing might look like.  Vinge throws off phrases like (approximately) "... the dust at their feet tattling back to the overmind...' (I don't have the book in front of me), which is implying nanomachines and advanced molecular nanotechnology.  K. Eric Drexler's "Engines of Creation" had come out five years previously, but hardly anyone in the SF community paid it much attention... except Vinge.  *No one else* was writing about stuff like that in a realistic manner at that time.  A typically SF novel had their advanced technology work more akin to magic than what was actually possible.

        The prequel A Deepness in the Sky is also highly regarded, with many regarding that one as Vinge's best work.  The actual sequel, Children of the Sky, was not as well regarded in general.

          We don’t get much that’s too exotic as far as alien viewpoints, not like Crystal Society or a Wildbow interlude or something.

          But there are a bunch of intelligence *substrates* that are really out there. Spoilers, obviously:

          * everything about the Tines, which distribute processing and memories between members of a pack. This informs their warfare, their population density, their ideas about mortality...it also allows for some personality engineering and the application of value drift to organic intelligences.

          * the skroderiders, plants who were uplifted by the addition of external memory banks

          * the super intelligences we see aren’t that strange, except maybe the Blight, but it’s made very clear that their architecture is reliant on the altered physics of higher Zones. In particular, the idea that the Blight can kickstart itself from an archive.

          * the underlying concept is that *intelligence derived from networking speed* is handled in a way I rarely see addressed in sci-fi.

  I’ve found sometimes discussion of fringe cases, rationalish fiction, fizzles on here because it is not “what this sub is about”. A lot of those fictions, however, don’t have anywhere else to go, being too irrational to stay here and too niche to find success elsewhere. Some popular and good stories get an honorary Rational badge (neither Worm or Unsong is really rational, I don’t think) but for many stories, exclusion here means oblivion. I’m curious if y’all know any of these edge cases. If you do, please rec them below. I’m building a little island of misfit toys.

    *Worm* is totally rational, fight me.
    ```

    - u/wertion:
      ```
      I don't want to fight you! And I doubt we even disagree. Worm meets most of rational fiction's criteria: it focuses on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources; characters' motives are examined; the pay-off at the end is indisputably satisfying; and so so much of Taylor's thinking is made known to us. For you, that may be enough to make it rational fiction.  


      Before I say my side, I do want to say I like worm and don't count it's not meeting my personal criteria for being ratfic against it--my original comment was a request for more rec's more like worm than like other ratfic. Worm is two thumbs up.   


      But where it fails to be ratfic for me is in its character-building and world-building. (I'm going to discuss spoilers and so will grey out the rest of this paragraph.) >!On the character level, I did not find Taylor's motivations and goals to feel either realistic or rational: the rage against her bullies was so long-lived, so one-note (complicated feelings about SS come only much, much later) and so central to her characterization I found it unbelievable (I know wilbow's mentioned he drew a lot of the bullying stuff from real life, and so to some extent I'm willing to cede this point to Worm on good faith, but I was bullied myself plenty and it never preoccupied me in the way it did Taylor) and yet while she is willing to compromise her morality in other places, she never permits herself to seriously countenance revenging herself on Emma, Sophia or Madison--I can believe somebody could become as preoccupied with their bullies as Taylor is, and I can believe somebody with powers could refrain from planning revenge against their bullies, but I struggled to believe somebody with powers who was as preoccupied with their bullies as Taylor was could refrain from seriously considering revenge. But believability aside, the point is rationality and the importance granted by Taylor to her bullies was, I think, pretty obviously irrational.  Bullying aside, I sometimes found Taylor's other priorities to be irrational: mostly here I'm talking about the ten or so arcs she is completely Dinah-lusted. Could somebody become narrow-mindedly focused on freeing their mafioso's child slave, absolutely. We can imagine somebody who never wanted a life of crime hoping to redeem themselves, if only in their own eyes, by freeing Dinah, becoming so focused on this small, inconsequential redemption that they take huge risks to accomplish it--but the attraction of that story would be seeing somebody driven by their emotions to act IRrationally. Now, maybe you feel I'm wrong, that Taylor's perspective on her bullies and her commitment to Dinah are not irrational. Before you say so, though, here's a thought experiment. Imagine a rational fanfiction of worm, where Taylor Herbert is replaced by a Taylor Herbert-Verres, who is like our heroine but is a science-lusted wellbeing maximizer. What would change? Well, I think that Taylor would not care so much about her bullies, and not care so much about Dinah. And if having a more rational Taylor changes aspects of the story, then I would say that is evidence those parts of the story are irrational. !<  


      There's an objection you could pose, however, to what I just said.>! The shards trap everyone in their worst, most traumatized moment, and incline them toward conflict, so of course Taylor has this preoccupation with her bullies, and of course she wants to fight Coil, there is an alien presence in her head driving her towards it. I have two responses to this. First, if your story features a significant world-building element that alters the psychology of your characters specifically to be less rational, then your story is not rational fiction. Is there a difference between alien-entity-shard induced rationality and grief induced irrationality? I don't think so. But we wouldn't call Medea murdering her children rational fiction even though perhaps she was acting as rationally as she could given her emotional state. So, if stories about characters whose rationality has been inhibited by extreme emotions are not rational fiction, then I would argue that stories about characters whose rationality is inhibited by any force are not rational fiction, and therefore the shards psychological effects preclude worm from being rational fiction. Here's another way of looking at it. If we DON'T say that stories about characters forced into irrationality by circumstance are NOT rational fiction, then conceivably most fiction could be counted as rational. This doesn't seem like a good state of affairs. !<  


      But >!the shards aren't the only element of worm's worldbuilding worth discussing, when we're talking about whether to count it as a rational story. A central component of many rational fiction stories is intelligent villains. Worm has an intelligent rational villain, first in Coil, then in Cauldron. But it also has frustratingly irrational ones as well. Part of the pleasure of reading a ratfic story, for me, is the game of wits between the protags and antags, and the sense that the forces of "evil" are, contrary to most mainstream fiction, really !<*trying to win*.>! But in worm, Jack Slash is deliberately sandbagging for most of the story and Scion, a being who can destroy Britain with a snap of his fingers, does not even bother to run while pursuing our guys through cauldron's base. Again, the thought experiment we used before is useful here. Can we imagine a more rational version of worm, where Scion and Jack actually try to accomplish their goals with everything in their power? Yes, we can. So, if in the more rational version, Jack and Scion behave differently, then we can say the way they behave in the current story is irrational. !<  


      The final element of worldbuilding in worm that feels irrational is >!the extent to which so much of it is an a posteriori justification of a state of affairs wb wanted. Wb wanted spandexed heroes and villains fighting, and set up a world to justify it. Most of his worldbuilding is dedicated to essentially steelmanning superhero conventions. I feel that rational worldbuilding should, if fanfiction, attempt to punch holes in or exploit the oddities of its source's world and if fiction, should attempt to set-up principles before hand and follow them through, come what may, as opposed to cooking the books to achieved a result to which the author is already attached. That's me making a descriptive claim, about what should count as rational worldbuilding, not me making a normative claim: worm's worldbuilding isn't bad because its basically a series of elaborate excuses to justify a familiar status quo, but it isn't rational. This book-cooking happens on the macro-level (totally alien shard entities happen to create recognizable, conventional superhero world) and the micro-level (true psychics can't exist because too much information would overload a human brain but clairvoyant and PtV can; Dinah can't talk to Taylor after she frees her, because conveniently that "makes the numbers go bad"). Our thought experiment is useful here: in ratcore crackfic worm, all of these inconsistencies would be called out and Taylor would milk Dinah till the cows came home. If it would be different in rational!worm, then it isn't rational in real worm, and therefore worm is not rational. !<

      &#x200B;

      My last argument, and the one I find most convincing, doesn't depend at all on the text of worm. The rational fiction genre is in large part a response to HPMOR: almost every fic that gets call rational fiction is in some way responding to or in conversation with that original text. Many definitions of genre require included works to be historically situated. If you want to adopt a definition that is not, that's fine, but then you must also count the Bhagavad Gita as fantasy, Tristram Shandy as postmodernism, and Pamela as rational fiction. I think the historicized definition of genre is the most useful, and because worm was not influenced by the rational fiction genre, coming from before the release of its seminal work--and because worm's  influence on the genre is relatively small (how many ratfic stories are more worm-like than HPMOR-like?)--it should be counted as related to rational fiction, but not as itself rational fiction.   


      TL;DR: Yeah, you're basically right.

        >!The alien parasites rewrite their victims' personalities!< , which greatly affects their agency, not to mention rationality.

        That being said, I find that *Worm*'s attempt to recreate the "default superhero universe" in an internally consistent, [monistic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/monism) way was laudable. If it didn't work 100% of the time, well, it was an inherently challenging task. The fact that the author was, as he later admitted, ["bad at numbers"](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/worm-web-serial-discussion-iii-after-the-end.274031/page-69?post=12857031#post-12857031) probably didn't help either.

    [Chili and the Chocolate Factory](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13451176/1/Chili-and-the-Chocolate-Factory-Fudge-Revelation) is a good choice; it's set up completely differently than Unsong, but feels similar in that the world runs on jokes and references (in this case, to the Roald Dahl universe of stories). It is very much not rational, but like Unsong, learning the rules of how the world operates lets readers try to guess where the plot is going. It's also pretty short and quick to read. 

    [A Practical Guide to Evil](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/) is somewhat rational, but dives into the meta as the world runs on stories and tropes. Not sure if that's along the lines of what you're looking for, as it's pretty mainstream and popular here.

Chili himself is a thoroughly unlikable protagonist (though later on the character perspective changes so you don't always need to deal with him), and several plot threads seem to be dropped for no reason. And the ending involved a reference I didn't get until I looked it up, and I'm still not sure it was a good way to end the story (though it did get a shocked gasp of laughter out of me). But it's a quick read and if you've read Dahl's works you'll love all the references to them. If you haven't it just means some background information will go over your head. 

        APGTE is great. It's also VERY long by now, and has felt like it dragged a bit at times; but it has a lot of good politicking and victory often comes from exploiting meta-knowledge about narrative tropes and themes. It gets dark and brutal at times, but I felt like the worlds of Worth the Candle and Worm were a lot darker and more hopeless. The banter and epic moments of awesome make it feel more hopeful overall.

  Any stories with a protagonist that is a stoic? As in a follower of stoicism, rather than the more colloquial meaning of someone who doesn't emote as much.

    [Wizard's Tower](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41881/wizards-tower) maybe? I'd say it's a fit. The MC is a 200 year old half-elf wizard and has seen everything and is older than everyone around him. He values logic and reason over emotional responses to problems.

    The protagonist of [Polyhistor Academy]( https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/polyhistor-academy-original-setting-survival-quest.614/) follows the stoicism philosophy. It's part of the culture he grew up in, which adopted stoicism partially as a response to the previous tendancy towards hedonism.

    I've only seen like three MCU movies (The first Ironman, Thor, and Avengers. Maybe something else I forgot too), and the rest of my knowledge is from spending an unhealthy amount of time online, but:

    [Hail Hydra](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/hail-hydra-mcu-villain-si-complete.851572/reader/) got recommended here a month or two back. Pretty decent overall, I read through the 210k words in 3 days or however long it took because I was in a reading mood? The plot was interesting enough, as was the whole timeline divergence from canon handling, but the characters didn't entirely jive with me. Not going to give it a specific rating personally because I think my mileage varied too much here to be accurate.

    [A Young Woman's Marvelous Adventure](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-marvelous-adventure-youjo-senki-mcu.944975/) is a Youjo Senki/MCU crossover, by the guy who wrote "A Young Woman's Political Record" (a post-canon Youjo Senki semi-frequently recommend here where Tanya goes into politics after the war, that is both well-written and actually complete). Only the first "arc" (34k words) is done, the author's aborted plenty of other works over the years, this one at least ended at an actual decent stopping point. Every thing in there seems good so far, but there's not that much and who knows if the author will come back to it, even if its only been a month the author opened the first chapter saying he had no idea how long he'd keep it up.

    [Memories of Iron](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/memories-of-iron-worm-iron-man-cross.301279/) I read a week or two back after a previous recommendation thread had someone post their massive catalogue of Worm fics read with ratings for all of them. Taylor gets the memories from a Marvel (but not MCU, some sort of comic canon hodgepodge) Ironman who basically got the the "endgame" of his timeline only to see his entire Earth destroyed around him as he died full of regret and bitterness. I read it mostly because I was on a Wormfic kick, it hands too much power to Taylor for my liking to enjoy beyond popcorn levels, but some people prefer that. 300k words long, technically "unfinished" but stopped at a reasonable point to cap off plot events that it doesn't feel like an awkward stop, but the author died before being able to finish it.

      The biggest problem with Hail Hydra is that there is basically no inciting event. The MCU is basically the most anemic, kids glove settings one can imagine. Just as an example, the death count for the aborted planetary alien invasion in avengers 1 was... 174. That's like 5% of 9/11. I'd bet covid kills more people every day than died from aliens or villains in every single MCU movie put together before Infinity War. Pathetic. 

      So the SI gets plopped into this kindergarten setting with full knowledge of canon... and for some reason feels the need to change things? Why?! And he doesn't just try to change things, *he joins hydra.* Literal. Fucking. Nazis. There's a whole song and dance about him being shanghai'd into it, but at some point one has to wonder whether the SI has some... pre-existing notions. 

      tl;dr: The good ending for the MCU is already canon. If you get SI'd there, don't do shit!

        I dropped the story after getting distinct (probably unintended by author) impression that protagonist was looking for excuses to kill defenseless people and join nazi.

        I think the justification was that undoing the snap was Dr. Strange charting a path like sticking a microscopic thread through a microscopic needle's eye with the naked eye, so by simply existing he threw that off enough that taking his own actions to stop Thanos was the goal. That said, the SI was also a firmly self-centred and selfish character unwilling to even vaguely risk sacrificing himself, even if the alternative meant joining up with Nazis in a fresh coat of paint (although maybe there's a few extra coats of paint on top some of them? I'm not too sure how the writing stacked up to canon presentations). That was kind of my sticking point of why the characters didn't jive with me, since I'm the type of person the Nazis call for the genocide of, so I don't know how clouded my judgement of all that stuff was.

    Disco Elysium is an excellent cop/detective roleplaying game, though it's not a fair-play whodunnit. A game where you, the player, do the research would be Return of the Obra Dinn.

    Unmade by Soubu is part detective-ish. I don't have the cultural background to say that it is or isn't authentically Japanese, but from my lack of understanding it's not exactly a Fair-play Whodunnit. I kind of imagine it like watching say the Bones tv show or another American based cop show and not having the same cultural touch stones if you weren't aware of USA culture.

  - u/AurelianoTampa:
    ```
    They're probably not super popular among this sub's readers, but *The Dresden Files* series follows a wizard-for-hire PI in Chicago. There is a long-running overall arc that winds through the books, but each book usually has some detective work as the titular wizard, Harry Dresden, uses his magic and connections to solve cases.

    Fair warning, the first three books are considered the weakest of the series, but they aren't terrible and introduce key recurring characters. Worth reading them, but I'd you're only on the fence after doing so, keep in mind the series picks up after them. Also, the audiobooks are voiced by James Marsters and are pretty well done.
