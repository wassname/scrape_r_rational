## Sword Art Online Abridged and Deconstructing Harry Potter and The Methods Of Rationality

### Post:

Harry Potter and the Methods Of Rationality can perhaps be considered the first piece of Rational fan-fiction to gain mass popularity. Rational fiction is a variant of the traditional mary sue type fan-fic where instead of the setting moulding itself to fit the character and ensure his/her success, the character gains increased intelligence and scientific knowledge allowing them to predict and even counteract the course of the plot. HPMOR as its traditionally shortens is both incredibly popular and divisive with critics pointing to its bloat, ridiculous time-frame and alien behaviour as flaws while proponents arguing for its world building and expression

Sword Art Online Abridged or SAO:A as its commonly shortened is as you would expect a parody of the original Sword Art Online, An anime that can be accurately summed up as “Good Premise, Horrible Execution”. The premise is that a diabolical game developed has trapped 10,000 people inside a VR Demo(He claims to have forgotten his reason for doing so in the ending). SAO:A is attempts to salvage this premise using a mixture of explaining WTF is going on, editing out the filler and giving its main character real personality albeit one of “of the most unbearable assshole I have ever met” in the words of the first character interacting with him.

Outside of existing in the general sphere of “Nerd”(A category I would argue has long outlived its usefulness as should be discarded but that’s an argument for another time)

Media, they might seem to have nothing do with each other but look deeper we can find some interesting parallels. A common thread found in criticism of HUMOR is that the Main character Harry(His Last name has been lengthened in the fanfic to the point that I’m just going to refer to him on a first name basis) is an egotistical narcissistic douche who uses his limited scientific knowledge to fuel an unjustified superiority complex and is never called out on his bullshit. SAO:A on the other hand explicitly gives its main characters the listed qualities and has its central arc be about the root causes of such an attitude and his corresponding shift away from them.

The trajectory of both this character over are eerily similar and parallels can be drawn, both are nerdy teenage social outcasts that posses extreme talent which they use to fuel a superiority complex. They both possess a misanthropic attitude towards others showing great resentment towards those that they perceive to be less intelligent than them him and they seek out friendships with other character possessing similar superiority complexes no matter their morality with one of Kirito few initial friends being Tiffany a scammer who exploits the nativity of new players to scam them of their money while Harry's first wizarding ally is an aristocratic pre-teen who makes rape threats against those who defame him.

Anime is an inherently explorative medium meaning that it forces us to see a character through the lenses of somebody else while Literature is a descriptive medium forcing us to view a situation through somebody's eyes. HPMOR is shown through the eyes of Harry and being a philosophical thesis mixed into a novel has its character behave in nonsensical ways to push the author's pet ideology(Nothing wrong with adding philosophy to media, hell most classical literature is classical because of that fact but it does get in the way of sensible story telling). “Machiavellian Schemers” like Dumbledore and Voldemort under a paper-thin disguise entangle “him in their web of lies”, SAO:A, however, has to give us the reason behind our character becoming involved in the events that unfold often mocking the stranger aspects of the original as shown by the original quote. We see Kirito being clearly manipulated by others rather than having to infer it from isolated events hidden among a dozen chapters of bloat. The shift in this perspective is key reason that SAO:A can be viewed as a deconstruction of the rational genre as it shows us just how the character archetypes would fare outside their purpose built worlds.

Secondary characters are also parallel and deconstructed, Asuna who shift into the main character towards the end of SAO:A is a more functional sociopath who hides her inner personality with an outwardly friendly charm. She is initially presented like Hermione Granger in HPMOR as a genius who lacks knowledge of how things really work, Hermione lacks knowledge of the real world as is overly book smart while Asuna poses natural instinct for the game. Their arcs progress in a similar pattern as both characters are infuriated with the main character who comes to realize their brilliance and worthiness. Harry comes to see Hermione as representative of hope and optimism given her uncompromising stand as he is manipulated by Voldemort with a wig. Asuna takes a similar place in Kiriots life through manipulation deconstructing the idea of an intelligent female love interest for our protagonist to charm using his intellect

Aincrad and Hogwarts are urban fantasy settings ie setting with fantastical elements located in a world very similar to our own. Hogwarts in HPMOR is a secret society HQ masquerading as a school filled with cunning intrigue between Dumbledore and Voldemort wearing a nanometer-thin disguise and primary conflicts arise from there game of cat and mouse as they attempt to convert students to their own cause. Aincrad is a buggy game world created by a sleep-deprived maniac who think the government is run by “Flubar, King of the Mole People” who traps 10,000 people in the game to avoid getting bad reviews due to his game being a bug-ridden mess. The idea that conflict springs out of pure stupidity and hubris of a singular individual is quite antithetical to the central theme of HPMOR which is that “Great People” must move society forwards by whatever means possible so that they may bring upon techno-rapture to end all suffering

In summary, Sword Art Online Abridged may have set out to parody and fix Sword art online but in the processes most likely without even intending it, Something Witty Entertainment has managed to create the perfect deconstruction of so-called Rational Fiction by exposing how the characters act outside the confines of a world tailored towards their every quirk. This essay might seem like the fever dream of somebody who is sick and tired of writing essays about “A Doll’s House” and overanalyzing every single plot element but I hope you at least see the outline of my argument here.

  I think [we read two different fanfics](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/7do4y7/hjpev_successfailure_reread_chapters_100end/). Harry's mistakes are constantly pointed out by the narrative and other characters, and (imperfectly) struggling with his arrogance is a major part of his character arc that has real consequences.

  The parallels to HPMOR outlined here don't really match up with my experience of the story, to be honest, and I think they're tenuous at best.  That said SAO:A is a fantastic Abridged series that does a great job of deconstructing the original by making it more clever and the characters more nuanced (much the same way HPMOR does) and I encourage everyone who hasn't seen it to check it out, even if you never watched the original SAO show.

  Considering that the premise was already rather well-tread by such things as .hack// far before SAO started, i think it's reasonable to say that it's just got bad execution; giving credit to the premise of SAO is kind of akin to giving credit to a premise of "orcs are fighting humans"
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    I haven't seen .hack but I think SAO's premise was good, while not extremely original, also in some of its setting elements, the way Aincrad is set up.

    I'd say that Accel World, by the same author, is the superior work both in execution AND premise (in AW, the premise is there's a virtual/augmented reality game that runs off some sort of internet neural link everyone has and allows you to win points that you can spend to run your brain's cognitive abilities at incredible speed, thus living hours in the span of a second), but for some reason that never become nearly as popular. Probably because of the chubby main character.

  The main problem here is, of course, that rational fiction isn't "a variant of the traditional mary sue type fan-fic..." et cetera. There isn't a single agreed-upon definition, but I favour [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6gd97l/meta_the_definition_of_rt/dippn6n/). In short, rational fiction is fiction featuring characters who rigorously pursue their goals — as opposed to most "normal" fiction, in which intelligence, motives, and character personalities could all be overridden in favour of whatever plot the author wants to enforce or whatever theme they want to explore.

  As such, SAO:A isn't a deconstruction of rational fiction, neither it is a deconstruction of ratinal*ist* fiction (it would be something closer to [*Cordyceps*](https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868), except not really). It is arguably an example of rational fiction. Is it a deconstruction of rationalist fix-fics? I... don't think so either, SAO:A!Kirito isn't really a rationalist or a fixer.

  If you define "a rationalist" as "an egotistical narcissistic douche who uses his limited scientific knowledge to fuel an unjustified superiority complex", then sure you're right, but, well, it doesn't *really* have anything to do with rational fiction as we define it or even HPMoR.

  **tl;dr:** I think your thesis, as it is, rests on a fundamentally flawed assumption.

    I would say there's a thin line that is basically one of suspension of disbelief, because since people in real life *aren't* 100% rational, stupid or counterproductive decisions in a story can be justified, even when they're convenient for the plot, as somewhat realistic, but only if they don't push it too far. For example something that I feel could well fall under the name of rational fiction is Fullmetal Alchemist: no one's some bastion of rationality like Rational!Harry is, even Edward Elric, for all his cleverness, is stubborn, hot headed and impulsive, but overall it's all always consistent with established traits, and the plot and the actions of the characters click together like a puzzle, leaving a very satisfying picture of something that feels believable and makes sense within its own rules, without renouncing being emotional or having strong themes.
    ```

    - u/Noumero:
      ```
      Of course. Rationality of humans is bounded by their own cognitive abilities — without some correspondingly extreme explanations, existence of a completely rational human would, in fact, be an inconsistency in the setting. Their irrational actions could be made in favour of the plot, but yes, suspension of disbelief would be in effect.
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        Yeah, basically you have a little bit of wiggling room in chance or human error to make the plot roll the way you want to, but if you abuse it it'll become apparent and look implausible.

  As it has been said already, the idea that the story never calls out Harry on his flaws is bullshit and a belief that always seems to persist no matter how many direct quotes are used to refute it. Harry has a distinct character arc from start to finish, a lot of the final arc is Harry wondering how the fuck he could've be so blind and stupid this whole time, and the final chapter has even more of that when Harry has to be magically prevented from making a mistake that probably would've ended the world because he didn't want to think about the reasons he couldn't save as many lives as possible. Almost the entire story is from Harry's perspective, and he obviously does not have a clear view on his personality flaws, is quite good at rationalizing afterwards, and is more controlled by his biases than he thinks. 

  Both of these are stories I really like and have gone through several times, and only a few parts of this post ring true to me. They possess more structural/characterization differences than your central premise can really handle before it starts to break apart. I had a lot more written about the specifics of this, but in summary, several of the connections are thin, or in some cases just wrong, and a fair bit of its persuasiveness is dependent on whether the reader also has the same deeply uncharitable view of both Methods and rational fiction as a whole. Also, tread carefully when using the lens of "deconstruction", it is a word that has a tendency to get whipped out whenever any story deviates from standard genre story beats.

  Is it bad that I really enjoy Abridged Asuna

  I think their romance is one of the high points of the story, no matter the version.

  >(He claims to have forgotten his reason for doing so in the ending)

  No he doesn't. He states quite clearly that he wanted the world he imagined to be real so that he forced people to act like it was. 

  I suspect this is one of those random fandom memes that people come up with and spread around so much that the original gets buried. Picking this as the final potshot of the abridged series was always a downer for me (the original webnovel introduces characters based on fantasy archetyps, Asuna is literally introduced as being like an elf, there is no shortage of worthy material but in the end they went with a line that translates poorly and that just means "I no longer feel as driven").
