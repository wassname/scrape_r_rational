  Alexandria's a thinker. Why isn't Jack more scared of her, knowing that?

  Hmm. I'm confused. I thought that [](#s "Director Costa-Brown is Alexandria") but here they are in the same spot.

    I'm guessing some form of body double, or clone. I mean, they surely need to have addressed the whole [](#s "I've never seen Alexandra and Director Costa-Brown in the room at the same time") issue in some way, and we do know of capes who can change their appearance or make clones. It could also just be an actor I guess, but that seems to risk the secret coming out a lot more

  Hopefully this means we'll be seeing more soon, because I definitely haven't been enjoying these several-month breaks.

  Bit weird that Danny was just standing by with the two of them swearing like sailors, maybe it's just me though.
