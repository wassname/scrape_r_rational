## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  TLDR: I've been reading too much Practical Guide to Evil. Politics is undead, blue-eyed spiders.

  I had a conversation with my father about gerrymandering, specifically the lately topical [efficiency gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasted_vote#Efficiency_gap), and he expressed the opinion that the ideal vote percentage is 100%. In other words, the best possible candidate would be a perfect representative respected by all and thus receive the whole of the vote.

  Indeed, he was of the opinion that the larger the percentage of the vote a candidate receives, the more effective they have campaigned or (indeed) the more effective their district has been shaped to allow that their political views should match those of the overwhelming majority.

  To me that seemed vaguely horrifying. Every complex (broadly) political situation I've been in where everybody agrees has made me a little nervous. I've always gotten a sinking feeling that there hasn't been enough discussion, argument even, to justify whatever it is we're doing. So I'd rather prefer an unstable candidate with 30% of the vote in a field of five or six, forming local coalitions and thinking carefully about every decisions and how it might look to everybody who might elect somebody else next time around. 

  At the same time, I don't think my father is *wrong* even if I doubt there are many who could truly represent so large a coalition as any  district in a nation of millions. Except in times of crisis, of course, when a common concern is at the front of every mind as they listen to campaign speeches and assess ballot options. Things get simpler then.

  Nor am I *right* to prefer things complicated, especially when there are decisions that need to be made and acts to be performed instead of analyzed or inspected or discussed. When times are hard, it's frequently more profitable to be fast than to be careful. They who act first *act*, and as much as I might argue with their results at least they've got them. Right out there in the open. Results.

  Makes me feel like my opinion is in the minority rather than the plurality.

  Authoritarians are loyal to a fault, naturally arrange into hierarchies, and can be convinced of just about anything that the ends justify. States like we have today never could have formed without them, and the whole of the modern world depends on their foot soldiers. In fat times of peace and safety things can get multi-polar for a while, but if there's winning to be had then some authoritarian faction or other always wins... until the next one shows up.

    Hmmmm. There are two ways to think about this discussion here.

    The first way, and the way that I suspect that you are thinking about it: *First* the districts are divided up by some or other method; and *then* the voters select their chosen candidate. In this circumstance, I do agree with you, a 100% vote percentage would be a cause for nonspecific existential horror.

    The *second* way to look at it is to invert that; *first* have the citizens vote, and *then* split them into districts depending (more or less) on that vote. With this ordering, it is no longer horrifying to suggest that district 1 had close to 100% votes for party A or that district 2 had close to 100% votes for party B - because the *districts* were specifically chosen in such a way as to make that happen, and pretty near everyone gets the candidate for which they voted to be in charge of them. So, in this ordering, it's not that people have failed to discuss, or have been forced into agreement; on the contrary, they have picked their sides and *then* those sides have been segregated and each given their chosen leader.

    Now, I can't say for sure, especially since I'm only hearing your report on the original discussion, but is it possible that your father was thinking in terms of the second option, instead of the first?

  A friend of mine has to write his bachelorâ€™s thesis.

  He has to compare two countries education system using the [hermeneutic circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutic_circle)

  Now the philosophy behind the idea when it was developed, seems kind of pseudoscience-y. I know, just because the explanation is allegedly BS, doesn't mean the method is wrong. And the method got changed since it's beginning. It claims to help interpret textes.

  But still, it looks wrong. And I don't know if it has any advantages over just trying to interpret the school system.


  So my question:

  Does anyone know that methodic? Anything someone used it for? Is it useful in general? Is it useful for my friend?

  (btw The countries are very similar. Both in the EU.)

    Hermeneutics is a thing, but not really a methodology per se. I sort of think of it as using brute force g (the general intelligence factor) on an object of study. That's not entirely true though, because it's also a discipline that can be trained. It's trained more by repeated applications of g to similar subjects, though, rather than by learning specific methodologies, as in science.

    A problem with hermeneutics is that it's tied to rhetoric, because you need to be a decent rhetorician to get across any ideas you arrive at through hermeneutics. Though hermaneutics is probably the most powerful single way to draw insights about the world, and is kind of the only way to draw insights about the epistomological hall of mirrors that is individual human psychology and the products of individual human minds, the difficulty of transferring conclusions to others means that it doesn't leave us with the same kind of dramatic generational accretion as in science. However, it's applicable to every field of human endeavor, rather than the limited fields of endeavor to which science can reasonably be applied.
