  This chapter chillingly and excellently portrays one of my favorite sci-fi horror concepts.

  Memetic hazards have been a favorite topic of mine since hearing They Might Be Giants' [The Bells Are Ringing](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cSEQ0kMt-0k) as a child. (I couldn't read this chapter without hearing it and in the Netflix adaptation I motion that an instrumental cover be used for this scene's soundtrack.) 


  Speculation and possible spoiler for future chapter: I fully expected someone to conduct the ol' Oedipus protocol to avoid reception of The Concept. (No, not when he banged his mom, what he did when he realized he banged his mom and saw her dead body.)

  Oh my. Ouch. That's not good.  4 narrators at least, and of such caliber.

  Great writing, keep 'em coming!

  I just realized that this is the greatest (only?) piece of metafanfiction ever written. Bravo.

  And now our intrepid heroes have to face Merlin, Sherlock Holmes, Lord Asriel, and a Harry Potter witch who has *already read the Harry Potter books*. God forbid she's actually incarnating HPMOR instead of the original canon. 

  I can't frickin' wait.

    Well, it's certainly giving [The Finale Of The Ultimate Meta Mega Crossover](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5389450/1/The-Finale-of-the-Ultimate-Meta-Mega-Crossover) a run for its money-- TFOTUMMC is extremely good as Rational-Ultimate-Showdown-Of-Ultimate-Destiny but it's only three chapters, whereas Eschatological Romance is at 27 chapters and continuing at a brisk clip with way more character development and tension.

  What if someone decides to strap a smartphone to their head to a) falsify colours (invert them, make everything black and white, etc.) b) reduce resolution c) train a neural network to recognize and blot out the meme signature? One of those must be effective at blocking it , otherwise the concept is not believable. Best case, coloured contact lenses/colour blindness fucks it up enough, worst case you always need a digital filter. 

  Or say you look at everything through a grating, there is probably grating that fucks the image up enough at the right distance to render it harmless.

  To be fair though, everyone downloading an anti meme app and using a VR headset for protection does seem like it'd be kind of funny-looking.

  If you bring computer vision into the picture, a sight-based meme is not nearly as dangerous as it could have been before modern technology.
  Chances are our wish engine could probably churn out the required program almost immediately.

  Also Holmes should have come up with the idea of trying to make himself the narrator.

  Also, if wishes can exploit the limits of modern technology, I'd try replacing my eyes entirely or develop contact lenses that fo the same thing.

    If the Concept were limited to the description of the basilisk from its origin story BLIT, you would be precisely correct. However, the Concept is shown to evolve and plan via its thralls, so I wouldn't be surprised if it managed to "out-think" or otherwise circumvent algorithm-based filters. For one thing, it could discover the audio analog of its visual pattern, thereby opening a second sensory front on the memetic battlefield. For another, it's currently capable of spreading incredibly fast, and they have something of a counter to Haley's time dilation via Merlin's mulligan spell. Not to mention that it's going to get very good at infiltration very very fast.

    The old ratfic saying "If you give Frodo a lightsaber you have to give Sauron the Death Star" appears to have been honored carefully here. Haley is super powerful but the Concept makes the Borg look like door-to-door missionaries.

      You don't need an algorithm-based filter.

      You just need glasses that aren't in your prescription.  Or goggles with a bit of paint sprayed on at a distance.

      You have to have enough visual resolution for the image to actual transfer over.  Reduce your resolution, and it simply can't form, and thus can't infect you.  And you don't need screens with pixels to do it.  

      Similarly, teaching a person to keep their gaze moving and not focus on patterns so hard breaks the 'cumulative' effect.

      The same is true of the audio, should it evolve that far.  Distort it, alter it, drown it out, whatever.

        I don't think sunglasses are going to cut it. There are seven billion innocents with zero defenses. The Concept has an unknown number of magic users and narrators. Haley herself might be safe for a time, but she only has to drop her guard for a moment for the Concept to take her. Yes, draconic form will probably shield her-- at least at first. But her enemy has *time travel.*

        >Similarly, teaching a person to keep their gaze moving and not focus on patterns so hard breaks the 'cumulative' effect.

        Juggling knives and loaded guns would be safer. *There are no second chances with the Concept.*

  I am really enjoying this absurd writing rate, but it almost makes me worried for Sarsapariller's wellbeing.
  ```

  - u/Kuratius:
    ```
    I think they mentioned they had a backlog of like 20 chapters written. They just decided not to post everything all at once. So they're probably just doing some editing before posting.
    ```

    - u/Hust91:
      ```
      Ah, that's a relief.
