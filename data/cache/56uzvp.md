## [BST] [Q] Request: ITT post reactions to latest r!Animorphs chapter as if it happened IRL and you're here on Reddit discussing breaking news.

### Post:

Meta commentary is also welcome, but tag it with [META] so that we can tell which posts are meant to be "in character" and which contain omniscience, without having to squint.

(e.g. if someone posts about genre savviness, they could very easily be doing so "in character" as a real human noting things about the world, or they could simply be offering literary commentary.)

  They can plainly see our use of technology. The effects of our intelligence are visible from space. They understood us well enough to emote at us with a humanoid figure giving human gestures. After all this they *still* did not consider us sentient. Even if they truly made a mistake, they do not share our values - whatever moral reasoning they claim to have is clearly not analogous to human moral reasoning.

  We need every public official to submit to a mandatory MRI.

  We need every employer to require mandatory yeerk screenings.

  We need to offer free screenings so that every family can make sure there is no yeerk possession among their numbers. 

  We need every private citizen to submit to the screening before being trusted with absolutely anything.

      More seriously, though, I think that we need to talk more about how they define sentience, etc. We don't do a great job of treating chimpanzees well, after all. That thing that Esplin is wearing might not be smarter than a cow, but how smart do their hosts usually get?

              I would, but I would feel awful about it, and would want a good amount of resources be devoted to research to allow me to use a robot body or at the very least breed a blue space centaur that's about as smart as a flea or oyster. 

              These guys have friggin spaceships. I think they can handle a little robot. I would sure as hell take something with 10% the  quality of a cow's senses so I wouldn't have to hurt another sentient being. (yeah, that's right, look up the difference between sentient and sapient sometime)

            ```
            How do you know the animal isn't consenting, though?  For all we know, Esplin's host might be having a very enjoyable time.  (If nothing else, given that yeerks can activate the brain's motor center, I'd guess they could activate its pleasure center?)  Even if human hosts - if any survived the Ventura strike - say otherwise, things could easily be different for a nonsapient host whose physiology is better-known by yeerks.
            ```

  - u/philophile:

    Who told you how to do a yeerk screening? How do you know *they* weren't a yeerk? How do I know *you're* not a yeerk? Kinda sounds like something a yeerk would say. Wait... how do I know *I'm* not a yeerk?
    ```

    - u/MugaSofer:

      If an MRI can't pick it up, then yeah, it would need to be so close to undetectable that you wouldn't notice yourself. They would have to make you *believe* you're doing what you want, for logical reasons.

      There's no logical reason a cow would start talking, so that at least would show up on an MRI.

      Plus, they claim to be physically inside the host, unless I misunderstood that speech. That would be pretty obvious unless they're energy beings.

        <meta> How on earth would a government or military actually fight the Yeerks? Any scientific test for them, *anything anyone does* is automatically suspect, how do you they're not a controller?

        Coming from someone who enjoys idly fantasising about how well I'd deal with a zombie apocalypse or whatever, I can't imagine how crushingly demoralising that would be. I can imagine fatalism a la the French command in WWII being a common response. Why bother trying when you're so obviously fucked?
        ```

        - u/creatureofthewood:
          ```
          There are ways, you would just have to spend some time thinking about them. For example, you could broadcast the MRI results live to a crowd of people which is statistically unlikely to be *entirely* controllers. The important thing is to make sure large crowds are monitoring the "choke points" of information flow - you don't want any single area entirely made by controllers. You could also just have a live three day quarantine to be safe.

          Come to think of it, this is a war that must be fought with very *rigorously*  public access to all important information. Because the single worst thing that can happen is if you have a tightly knit group operating in secret (say, the CIA) and every single one gets taken by yeerks and controls the entire public.

          We can still have war secrets, but they can only be kept by a publicly verifiable uninfected cohort.

          (I say "rigorous" because it must not be fake-able - for instance, having a media outlet disseminating information doesn't work if yeerks infest the whole outlet. No information is trustworthy unless a large mass of the public can verify how information flow happened)

            But who told us they die after 3 days? If we can't trust a yeerk it would seem foolish to rely so absolutely on a "weakness" that they revealed so willingly. 

            Even if we capture yeerks and watch them die 3 days later... for all we know they're able to voluntarily suicide, and are under instructions to drop dead after 3 days when captured so as not to give the game away for the undetected yeerks.

      This time, the zombie apocalypse is actually happening and there is an actual *reason* to turn our societal immune system up to eleven.

            You gotta go through a tube and stuff, and the machines are rare and expensive. You need a qualified uninfested person to interpret the results. The subject needs to lie PERFECTLY still, good luck getting children to do it. Do you need a contrast for an MRI? If so, you need people to administer that and monitor for adverse reactions. You can't use one if you've got metal in your body. etc.

            A single vaccine you can train someone to do well enough in an hour, I'm guessing. You can go to schools, offices, etc and vaccinate one person a minute every minute.

  I hope all you unbelievers have opened your eyes. The reckoning is come and the apocalypse is upon us. 

  >Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.

  > But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.

  That hour is before us. Great is the Almighty God,  He warned us but we refused to heed. 

  >10 By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee: *thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen*, and of the wheels, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into thy gates, as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach.

  >11 *With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets*: he shall slay thy people by the sword, and thy strong garrisons shall go down to the ground.

  >12 *And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise: and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy pleasant houses*: and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water.

  >13 And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard.

  There is nothing richer that God has given us but our brain that we might think praise and our voice that we might sing it. Our song will cease because it has been *stolen* by these monsters. 

  >8 Therefore shall *her plagues come in one day*, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be *utterly burned with fire*: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.

  >9 And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,

  >10 Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, *that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come*.

  >2 And *the beast* which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.

  >3 And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.

  >4 And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, *Who is like unto the beast*? who is able to make war with him?

  >5 And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months.

  >6 And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.

  >7 And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and *power* was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.

  >8 And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

  >9 If any man have an ear, let him hear.

  >13 And he doeth great wonders, so that *he maketh fire come down from heaven* on the earth in the sight of men,

  >... 

  >16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or *in their foreheads*:

  >17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.

  He laid it all in plain speech to warn us, and here it has come to pass! The horsemen were foretold, and lo and behold who is responsible for "making fire come down from heaven"  and destroying a city "in a single hour"? A *horse man*. "By the hoofs of his horses" indeed. 

  And a "mark in their foreheads"? A mark *inside* their heads? These yearks are plainly foretold two *thousand* years before their coming. 

  I hope you all can see the plain message of Scripture. Repent or worse than this is still to come!

    You are really stretching it to make it fit... With the implausibility of recent events from a scientific perspective, I am willing to consider such alternatives as biblical prophecies.  That said, the majority of eschatological scholars who took a strongly literal, future, and apocalyptic interpretation of Revelations also believed in a pre-tribulation rapture.  One of the requirements of a scientific theory is that it can make predictions and that it doesn't require post-ad-hoc fitting.  Naturally, there hasn't been any mass disappearances that fit with the rapture.  I'll definitely keep Revelations in mind, but if all the events require this much stretching and cherry picking to make fit, I am not buying it.

    That said, messages from the future in the form of prophecy are about as plausible as FTL+telepathy so I think taking a second look various prophetic traditions might be useful.  Anyone familiar with  Nostradamus?

      If so I'll take that bet.  I bet their is some truth behind the incidents.  I can't think of any logical motive for aliens to carry them out, but their capabilities are so weird that I wouldn't rule anything out.  And I can think of some fairly plausible (relatively speaking) motives demons might have to carry out these kind of actions.
      ```

      - u/callmebrotherg:
        ```
        I'd like to hear you out on their possible motives, but even if I'm convinced I'll still go up to $2,000 on my end (I don't want to disincentivize people against telling me their interesting ideas, after all).
        ```

        - u/scruiser:
          ```
          For demonic motives on classical alien and UFO activity:

          * Not sure why they would abduct cattle, but that is an activity trickster spirits in folklore would engage in, so assuming the folk stories have any grain of truth, they are presumably continuing their old activities in a more modern guise.

          * A lot of the "alien" experimentation has a weird focus on human genitals.  In many mythological traditions there is interbreeding between humans and the supernatural: nephilim in the bible, demigods in Greek myth, Kitsune marrying humans in some of the stories from Japan, fairies switching human and fairy offspring and leaving changelings, etc.  Whatever motive existed for these entities to create part human hybrids (better adaption to our physical world?  some abstract metaphysical purpose?) might still exist in modern times, they are just continuing their old methods.

          * Crop circles seem pretty obvious.  A lot of mythological traditions put a great magical importance on symbols.  Crop circles are just a convenient way to make large scale symbols quickly with minimal physical intervention in the material world.

          As for alien motivations, I think I thought of a few:

          If the Yeerks story isn't BS, then genetically engineering a lifeform or even just a body from scratch is a lot harder than we guessed, at least compared to interstellar travel and outright interstellar warfare (or else why not engineer bodies from scratch).  Likewise, the alien "Esplin" acted like it was dying, so they also presumably don't have mind uploads?  If that is the case, experimenting on intelligent lifeforms is a lot more valuable than we would otherwise guess:

          * The alien abductions are exactly what many UFO fanatics would claim: the aliens are experimenting on humans.  Prior to the recent absurd events, I would point out obtaining a few genetic samples and then brute force simulating humans would be easier than interstellar travel, but apparently this is incorrect.

          * Crop circles could have been attempts to study the mimetic spread of symbols by artificially introducing symbols.  If humans are one of the few "sapient" species and engineering a species from scratch is harder than interstellar travel, then humans could make a valuable test population.

          * Cattle abduction: the aliens might have abducted and studied any number of species, we just notice cattle because we keep track of their number.  Alternatively, if intelligence and tool use is rare, studying a domesticated animal might be interesting from to an alien.

          * Roswell incident: exactly what conspiracy theorists think.  If so, I really hope the US government shares that info.  Still, even if it just weather balloons or whatever, just because this isn't real doesn't mean that UFO/alien abductions haven't been.

          So yeah... I think there might be something to all the UFO folklore, a year is a little tight on time though.  Assuming Esplin isn't a human made hoax in the first place I think I would take that bet.  If the planet gets glassed or society collapses I wouldn't have to pay out, right?  And wow I intended that as a joke but now it seems too dark.

  One of the more striking photos of Esplin would also be posted over 9000 times with various captions, such as "I'M JUST A SPACE SLUG, I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR STRANGE WAYS" and "I, FOR ONE, WELCOME OUR NEW MOLLUSC OVERLORDS".

  Okay, there's a ton of heavy stuff here... but can we talk about the random MIB dude?

  Esplin had barely gotten out two sentences when this guy showed up, and a few angles show that the police just let him through. So this one, single guy, with no backup and no weapon I could see, he just confidently walks up to the self-professed alien war criminal with a sword for an ass.

  *Then Esplin stuns the MIB dude!* Right in the middle of talking about how he's learned to treat humans with dignity and respect! Then, only after Esplin has finished talking, MIB guy gets up and demonstrates that he apparently has the training and equipment to restrain a Yeerk space-cow, and he's still totally calm and collected despite having just been attacked. 

  So the police apparently finally get the memo to help MIB guy, and together, they stuff Esplin in the back of a black van and take off.

  I don't want to be a conspiracy nutter here, and I don't know what any of this means, but... it's not just me, right? That's all *really fucking weird?*

    The part that weirded me out the most was the thing with the resisting teenagers. I mean, maybe there were kids fighting in secret at first, but, get real. If *you* heard about an alien invasion, what's the first thing you would do? Assemble your friends in your garage and start a resistance movement Captain Planet-style? Or go warn the military?

    If there's anyone who was already aware of this, it had to be the USA government.
    ```

    - u/Anakiri:
      ```
      Well, yeah, if we start looking for weird stuff in the story Esplin told, we'll be here all night. I'm working on the assumption that it's all bullshit until proven otherwise. No meteor, no meddling kids, no body-snatchers, maybe no aliens at all. The whole thing stinks.

      I'm hung up on the secret agent thing because we can actually see it in the videos, and it doesn't make any sense. It's like he expected Esplin's appearance, and was prepared, and he knew somehow that he wasn't in real danger, other than being made to fall over. MIB guy didn't treat Esplin like an unknown alien, or like an ambassador, or like an unpredictable prisoner - he treated him like an escaped pet.

  ```

- u/CCC_037:
  ```
  Okay, no. This is - these aliens are nowhere *near* advanced enough.

  Look. Earth took billions of years to form, right? Then life formed. Some couple of billion years later, we get multicellular life. Then, nother billion years, intelligent life. Then a few million years before we settled down enough to start recording history. Then we're talking a few *thousand* years to go from small villages with basic farming and ploughs to, well, internet and virutal reality and skyscrapers and everything. Each step takes less time than the previous step, right?

  So, two intelligent species evolve. Fair enough. But each step in that process - there's no fixed length to them. Fraction of a percent difference one way or the other in the time it takes for intelligent life to turn up, and one life forms got a good couple of million years technology on the other.

  Which means that there are only two reasonable ways we can expect to meet our first aliens. Either we go to their planet, and if we're *really* lucky, and they're *really* advanced, they've just discovered fire. Or, they come to our planet, and their technology's so far beyond ours that it might as well be magic, and will be completely incomprehensible; in short, they're wizards.

  The idea that their technology is only a *little bit* ahead of ours, to the point where we can usefully study it and learn from it, is laughable. Odds are this whole business was deliberately staged, start to end, with some unknown and possibly unknowable end goal.

  (Mind you, I'm not entirely sure this "Esplin" was the one doing the staging. He might be a vat-grown creature with implanted memories. In fact, he probably is; he wants to die to sell his story, because that resonates with us, but he doesn't even know it's fake...)

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    [META] Canon Animorphs had a pretty good explanation for this: The Ellimist did it. More specifically, he seeded life on many, many, many different planets as part of his war for life against Crayak. Which is why most species in the story are compatible with morph tech and susceptible to yeerk infestation.

    It might explain the closeness too: if he could have optimized the DNA seeds to create a fauna evolving into sentient species as fast as possible, reducing the variance in evolutional "distance".
    ```

    - u/CCC_037:
      ```
      [META] Yeah - Ellimist and Crayak are the 'wizards', in this universe, and they're messing with the odds and basically putting everyone else on an approximately equal footing. But, had this happened IRL, I wouldn't have seen any direct evidence of their existence yet...

- u/philophile:
  ```
  Puh-lease, this is the fakest shit I've ever seen. First an asteroid and now aliens? This is how America is trying to cover up what happened in Ventura? The asteroid story was as good as debunked as soon as the satellite images got out- the destruction was centered right on the town, it was obviously a target. We need to be figuring out who did it, and why they're trying to cover it up. An attack? Or did the US nuke itself to... contain something? Are they lying so they don't look vulnerable? And don't give me this aliens shite when there are NO scientific organizations reporting anything out of the ordinary in the past 3 months (oh but of course, they were all body-snatched, that's why no one who watches the skies saw anything, anywhere, in the whole world, right. I swear, this body-snatched thing is going to become the new "lizard people," it's so *convenient*). I'll take this "alien" and anything he says seriously if and only if someone can tell me where I can point MY OWN telescope to see this guy's fleet or whatever. How much does anyone want to bet they'll be "cloaked?" 

  I don't get the people who take this thing seriously at all- if you actually believe in alien bodysnatchers, then how can you trust anything anyone tells you, even if (especially if) it's about alien bodysnatchers? Like, say somebody comes up with a way of detecting who's been bodysnatched- how can you be sure that *they* haven't just been bodysnatched?? Mind-boggling, they just pick who to believe based on what they already want to believe.

  So, there are not only aliens, but there are multiple kinds of alien who are at war with each other and until recently thought of us as, basically, livestock. Probably one of the worst ways to find life in the universe.

  Notable aliens:

  Yeerks: What their envoy claims to be. A slug that can crawl into things' ears and 'share its thoughts'. Presumably it has to be somewhere near your brain to do that, otherwise the ear thing would probably not be necessary. Starves after three days of continuous possession. Currently stationed on ~~Europa~~ Europa's moon (thanks Jasmume16 for the correction).

  Andalites: At war with Yeerks. Not clear what exactly they are. Apparently had better technology than the Yeerks do, which is saying a lot by the looks of those spaceships (_link to photos_). Sound pretty awful, but there's almost certainly at least a little bias.

  Unnamed Blue Centaur: What their envoy is currently possessing. Don't think he said much about what this is.

  Other notables:

  Esplin: The Yeerk who gave the speech. Attempted to invade Ventura, realized midway that humans are people, and then accidentally destroyed Ventura once his 'stronghold' got destroyed. Absolutely horrifying; I'd hate to be the guy responsible for *that*. Willing to die for crimes committed, giving us their space ships to open up diplomatic options.

  Unnamed Freedom Fighters: High schoolers (what the fuck?) who *somehow* were going toe to toe with Esplin's forces, eventually blowing up their stronghold and triggering the dead man's switch. Again, absolutely awful to find yourself responsible for something like that. Even worse since they were trying to help humanity from the get go.

  Unnamed Psychic Voice: Unconfirmed, but some people at the speech are saying they had a message placed in their mind. Message is consistent between multiple people (*transcript link*), hard to arrange this fast if hoax. Apparently not fond of Esplin. Andalite, maybe? Hard to guess with limited information.

  It should go without saying, but take all this with a grain or a heaping tablespoon of salt. There's a lot we don't know, and only one source so far. If we can locate these freedom fighters, we might be able to get a clearer picture.

    > High schoolers (what the fuck?) who somehow were going toe to toe with Esplin's forces

    I notice I am confused.  Parsimonious explanation: the entire story is BS.  Reevaluating it in that light, maybe the entire story sounds like something out of a cheesy sci-fi movie because that is exactly what the aliens did: copy a bunch of generic sci-fi movie tropes to make a story they thought would be compelling in order to manipulate us.

    > If we can locate these freedom fighters, we might be able to get a clearer picture.

      Assuming that they're competent invaders (and I am assuming that, since we didn't know until today that they were here), it would be really weird to pick a narrative that paints their initial actions so poorly. No matter how well it matches a B movie, destroying Ventura can't have done them any favors diplomatically.

      On a more personal note, which I tried to keep away from the summary post, I've always admired generals who are willing to put their own lives on the line when a mistake is made. Maybe I'll be proven wrong here, but I like that Esplin seems to have that same moral fiber.
      ```

      - u/Evan_Th:
        ```
        ... which makes me wonder, is Esplin really doing this voluntarily, or did his superiors hang him out to dry for (destroying Ventura) (letting the spaceship crash) (not noticing humans were sapient in the first place) (something else we haven't heard of)?
        ```

        - u/callmebrotherg:
          ```
          He might not actually starve, either. What if he's like e.g. a tardigrade and he'll just shrivel up and go into hibernation. We'll think he actually died and (hopefully) bury him, such that he can be retrieved later, and in the meantime he and his people win brownie points with us for his selfless "sacrifice."

          - u/Evan_Th:

            ```

          - u/scruiser:
            ```
            Or with their capabilities (psychic powers, direct interfacing with brain on a biological level, the computational power to do the engineering for interstellar travel), we can presume they have at the very least a limited form of mind upload.  Esplin might be backed up... or this might not even be the 'original' Esplin.

            Or even more extreme, 'Esplin' might be a mind artificially fabricated to perfectly appeal to our sensibilities in order to ensure the diplomatic approach (or whatever their real aim is) is successful.

        Or the people making the MRI machines, if they can slip some sort of software bug in there that detects when it's scanning a Yeerk and then gives a picture that looks like not-a-Yeerk (maybe under the guise of being a free upgrade?)

        If they've infested the people running the MRI scan, then they can pull aside everyone *without* a Yeerk for three days - to "make the Yeerk starve" - only everyone who comes *out* of isolation is infested instead. (And we have no proof of that three-day thing, either).

            The government should also try various solutions and techniques from mythology and folklore.  Visual exposure to grains of rice, needles, ofuda, crosses, pinches of salt, inside out clothes etc.

Maybe they have some moral block against fighting for themselves.  Maybe they don't want to be conspicuous.  Maybe Earth's atmosphere is poisonous to them.  I don't know.

            What I do know is that some human teenagers have ostensibly destroyed an alien invasion... which means that unless the yeerks are really stupid or horrendously unlucky, the teens had some help from somewhere.  I hope at least one of them somehow survived the asteroid - I'd love to hear their side of the story.

                Are you sure? We might be assuming that the way our technology progressed is the only way for it to happen, but it's just as possible that the aliens completely missed things that were obvious to us. It's even possible that FTL was something "obvious" that *we* missed - meaning we'd have better all-around technology. (This was suggested in a sci-fi story I read a while back, forget the name.)

                Consider: the Aztecs discovered the wheel ... but never thought to use it to make vehicles, only kid's toys! Meanwhile, they had those obsidian-glass swords, but those never occurred to anyone in the Old World - even though we had obsidian and glass over here too. (Sure, they're worse than steel, but I assume they were better than bronze weapons since the Aztecs had bronze.) The ancient Greeks has steam engines thousands of years ago, but considered them a curiosity and never did anything useful with them. Why are we assuming that technology progresses on a fixed timeline, as opposed to random technologies being invented at random points in their history?

                Consider: the aliens have shown two great technological feats; the spaceship, and the asteroid. Maybe throw in the fact they got here at all as a third "feat". But all of those are doable with just one technology - the FTL drive! 

                Who knows what their guns or computers are like. If they even have guns or computers! We haven't *seen* any.

                In fact, thinking about it, this Esplin announced himself by flying to the crash site in person - no radio message, nothing on TV. They supposedly didn't notice we were intelligent - but radio messages are the first thing our SETI program looks for. Do the aliens even *have* radio?
                ```

                  Had someone pointed out the basic idea of a wheeled vehicle to the Aztecs, they'd have been able to make them easily enough. (Not sure they'd have been practical, given the steep mountains and lack of horses).

                  Technology doesn't have to move along a fixed timeline. But, in general, *more* complicated items come later than *less* complicated items. And I find it highly unlikely that it's anything other than *significantly* simpler than an FTL drive. (Seriously, you can make a basic camera from a lens and a box - the film is trickier, but there are lots of chemicals that react in some or other way to light).
                  ```

              - u/Evan_Th:

                Point; I suppose we don't really know anyone's fighting the Yeerks.  For all we know, they could've dropped the asteroid on Ventura for some reason of their own (accidentally or on purpose) and decided to reveal themselves intentionally (for whatever reason).

                However, I think it's most likely at least part of the story's right; why would they destroy Ventura for no reason?  And if Esplin's telling the truth about the base being seriously harmed, I don't see how human teens could do it on their own - so we've got some aliens involved somehow.  We might as well call them Andalites.  And again, we know nothing about them except that they're fighting the Yeerks, and they're just as invisible to human sensors.

                And... sure, the human teenagers might not be real, but again they might be.  I can imagine some reasons why the Andalites would want less-conspicuous local help.  I think we should tentatively take Esplin at his word, try to locate any of these teens who survived, and be on the alert for Andalites trying to recruit other human teens for their inscrutable ends.

            Yeerks seem to have telepathy and telekinesis - presumably either technological or part of their control mechanism (scary thought - what if everyone who was there is already infected? Their minds and personality subtly altered?) 

            If andalites are very similar, they might "team up" with humans, giving them the same abilities.

And we evolved in a *completely different biosphere* to these things, there should be *no way* that any sort of mind control they have isn't the result of deliberate genetic engineering.

              > If andalites are very similar, they might "team up" with humans, giving them the same abilities.

              And *two* *independent* alien species biochemically compatible with humans stretches credulity well beyond the breaking point. Mind you, I'm not saying the Andalites (if they exist) can't be parasites - I just don't believe the part about them (or the Yeerks) being able to take human hosts.

                I posted about this upthread - I think they probably control bodies using that same telekinesis/body control effect we saw him use on the guard. They have some kind of "telepathy" that works at range to communicate, too (probably the equivalent of an Effector from the Culture novels.) No need for them to be doing messy things like hooking into the bloodstream and nervous system; just move the body like a puppet and take your time decoding the brain with your MRI-like senses. (EDIT: which also explains why they took so long to notice we're sapient, even though they can communicate on a mental level.)

                It's probably more of a way to get *hands* and a body (and senses?) than a way to get *nutrients*, the way Earth parasites work - he mentioned they have to leave the body to feed, remember? They're probably not biocompatible with humans at all.

- u/scruiser:

  So... the fact that these aliens are able to have a war (i.e. the timescales and distances aren't too far apart for them), and the fact that we didn't see a near C ship enter our solar system (some with more astronomy check me on this, but I think decelerating after interstellar travel would leave very visible exhaust, as in you could see it with a telescope in your backyard) means that either these alien races are super long lived and/or have a very long-term oriented culture (and thus can fight wars on century long timescales and are willing to travel interstellar distances at timescales slow enough that they didn't have visible deceleration) or they have some form of FTL travel.  Anyone back me up on this with more precise calculations?

  So on one hand, from our current knowledge of physics, near immortal, super long-term planning aliens is more plausible than FTL.  But that would mean that they have all that advanced tech (I think immortality is not very well selected for evolutionary so it would have to be artificial)... but they can't just genetically engineer bodies?

  Also, they didn't recognize humans as sentient, but they are able to put on a near perfect performance (don't tell me the landing scene didn't look just too perfect)?

  And then there is the mysterious psychic voice talking into people's heads... Direct mind to mind communication sounds really implausible from our current understanding of physics... it would take some type of media to transmit it.  Say like nanobot released into the air.  But if they have tech capable of manipulating minds like that, why stop at just communication?  They alien claim to be symbiotic brain slugs (anyone reminded of Stargate?) but didn't recognize we were sapient?  They decide to resort to diplomacy after a brutal massacre?

  Anyway, something is off about all of this... the alien's tech capabilities don't make sense (I guess we'll find out when we try reverse engineering them) and/or our understanding of physics is very limited/wrong (FTL possible, true telepathy possible, etc.)...  The alien motivations don't make too much sense either (not recognizing sapience, but perfectly able to communicate when it comes down to it).  

  On the plus side, with their capabilities, even if they have some easy FTL that doesn't require absurd energies (i.e. they don't have the energy to just blow up the planet and/or launch interstellar kinetic kill vehicles), they could still drop rocks on us till we all die, so whatever their goals/intentions, they don't want to just kill all of us.

  **Crazy wild guess**:  The aliens are actually demons (in the mythological sense): they possess people and their technological capabilities don't make sense.  The asteroid was God/Angels/Gods smiting one of their initial footholds.  The alien story is just to mislead us and distract us from how BS their tech is (FTL, psychic powers, interfacing with alien brains without bio compatibility issues, interstellar warfare being practical or possible, etc.)

  [META: without outside knowledge, The events make no sense from someone that takes our current understanding of the universe seriously.  Hence the bizarre conclusion.]

                    - Earthly and Yeerk-ly life may have a common origin.  This is speculative, but possible given that (a) interstellar travel is clearly possible, and (b) biocompatibility is *very* hard to explain otherwise.

                    - Alternatively, biocompatibility could be explained by engineering.  Which means our "friends" have some 'utter bullshit' grade bioengineers backing them, and we're probably doomed.  Compared to creating a sapient things which can take over a human brain, something like Bonesaw's prion plague from *Worm* would be pretty easy.  Or more insidious threats...

  So he's giving us two small alien ships - one of them destroyed - and saying that if we want to keep negotiating, meet his friends at Europa in five months.  I assume he knows that we can't get to Europa in five months with current technology.  So, that means we'll be going there either in his ship, or (possibly, if our factories are up to it) ships built from his plans.

  What secrets has he built into this ship?  Audiovisual bugs?  Remote controls?  Remote yeerk infestation units?  Can't he have his friends meet us someplace closer instead - maybe our own Moon?
  ```

  - u/scruiser:
    ```
    > What secrets has he built into this ship?

    This is going to sound crazy... what if the ships are literal magic?  As in entities primarily  composed of mental phenomena are seeking a foothold in our reality and are posing as aliens to manipulate us.  Building the ships gives them vessels to channel their power through.

    It would explain the psychic powers and a lot of other implausibilities about their technology (see my comment for details).
    ```

    - u/callmebrotherg:
      ```
      How is magic the more plausible option? You aren't choosing between [some stuff that contradicts what we know about physics] and magic, you're choosing between [some stuff that contradicts what we know about physics] and [even more stuff that contradicts what we know about physics].

        Exactly what /u/Evan_Th said.  With science (as a body of knowledge) completely failing to predict what we have observed, I am looking to other cultural sources of knowledge.  In this case, the aliens are a decent fit to various myths about demon possession.

        I still believe in the scientific method, so I'll make some advanced predictions for you:  The "aliens" "tech" is going to have even more BS capabilities that make no sense given their overall apparent technological capabilities.  These capabilities will make more sense when considered literal magic.

        So some examples of stuff from various mythology that they could try passing off as BS tech or limitations to their tech:

        * Being limited to acting under various astrological conditions.  They will probably try to explain this with some babble about the quantum state of the universe [META: apparently they are dependent on z-space configuration which can vary over time naturally?]

        * Shapeshifting ability that ignores mass limitations.  If they had this capability, why can't they instantly create spaceships or materials/supplies?  Why couldn't they instantly make host bodies for themselves/parasite race? [META: yeah I went there]

        * Weird and arbitrary weaknesses. I.e. cold iron, salt, silver, their reflections.  If they have some particular weakness to say, an Earth food, that they don't have to other Earth foods, I am going to call it as a rough match to this.  [META: the oatmeal isn't a perfect fit, but if you are already starting to buy this story...]

        * Psychic Powers, especially if they fit under conceptual/metaphysical categories: I.e. control the weather, control war, control love, control the sea, etc.

          You mean like telepathy?

          Weather control is fairly scientific, though. There are some speculative designs for weather-control sattelites out there.

          Something else to watch out for: if the technology has really arbitrary *requirements* to function, like human or animal blood, trust/worship, or sex.

  Okay, hold on... he said Ventura was executed on his "orders" and carried out by his "subordinates." So what's with this "dead-man switch" bullshit?  Anyone else catch that?  Doesn't add up. Aliens this technologically advanced, and that's his excuse for half a million people dead? "Oops, we didn't put in an off switch?"

  Also, fuck this guy with his two ships. That's supposed to make us feel better? We have no idea how many of them there are, or how powerful their technology is. These could be their equivalent of slingshots.

  Unless one of these teenage resistance fighters (I don't even know where to begin on that) shows up soon and corroborates, it would be absolutely stupid of us to take his word for anything. And when that teenager shows up, they'd better be willing to submit to whatever test is needed to make sure there's nothing in their head that shouldn't be.

  Anyone here had friends or family in Ventura? Were they acting weird at all before it got hit? I know it's insensitive to ask, but we need to know what actually happened there, and we need to know sooner rather than later.

  Also, should we be worried about these "andalites?" (sp?) If they don't like these guys (and its not hard to see why) they might not take it kindly if we do end up in some kind of federation with them. Sounds like they're much more technologically advanced, and it could be a huge mistake to end up on their bad side by allying with the body-snatchers.

    Yeah... this is starting to remind me of Starcraft II. We're in the fun-filled position of people fighting off the Zergs when the Protoss arrive and start cleansing everything. That's... fuck. fuck fuck.

    Re - The deadman's switch: They might be telling the truth. Like, if you put a giant "if we lose we destroy everything" deadman's switch in place, you're not going to put any way to deactivate it in place. If you do, you're just begging for someone to hack them. And I guess his comment on "orders" and "subordinates" meant when they put the deadman's switch in place, not when it triggered? Or maybe they saw their fortress in Ventura explode and jumped to conclusions? I'm not trying to make excuses, mind you. Millions of people died in that explosion.

    Re-Ventura: The most suspicious thing I heard of is there was a complete blackout in the city, and everything including internet and phone lines and traffic lights lost power at the same time, half-an hour before the meteor struck. At the time, the official explanation was "It's either because part of the meteor struck early and hit the power grid, or it's a coincidence, or it's not. We don't know". Maybe they were trying to cut communications to cover up their fortress exploding.

      If the stock market's any indication, a sizable amount of people seem to be expecting the planet to be glassed or equivalent soon.  I know *I'm* certainly not going to work this week.

      As for the meteor, the risk seems too big. Remember that this is ostensibly where their base was in the first place: any enemy that knows from experience that they have kill-switches like that in place should just devote their efforts to getting it to trigger themselves, after which there would be nothing they could do to stop it.

      Huh, didn't know about the blackout, but that's pretty telling. The timing of them realizing their "mistake" about enslaving humans and yet still having their plans so badly screwed up makes me all the more leery.

The planet is now a lot likelier to be glassed or humanity enslaved... mind as well enjoy things?  Unless my demon theory is true, in which case I should keep a clear, sober mind in case the mechanic of alien control is actually possession.

        The aliens have the technology to automatically blackout media in a given area?  Anything else would be through the whole "mistake" story into suspicion.

      I kind of expected galaxy-travelling-aliens to be so much smarter than us that we would either barely be able to follow along with their reasons for things, or they'd just be so rational that their actions were self-evidently true. But this guy sounds like a human trying to throw shit at the wall and see what sticks. It's comforting, in a way, and also kind of terrifying, given how much harder to parse it makes all this.

                  I'm just speculating - but now that we know invisibility cloaks exist, we need to reevaluate a whole lot of our tactical assumptions.  For all we know, /u/CCC_037, the Yeerks effectively might not have reliable security cameras.

                            And any system that includes a human is *going* to be putting out waste heat or will cook the human in fairly short order. So, I mean, I can get that they can make some sort of invisibility cloak that'll work when it's a kilometre away; but not that they can't detect one when it's actually *inside their ship*.

          Like /u/TK17Studios says, maybe they split the party.  If I was fighting aliens who had the power of mind control, splitting the party would be about the first thing I'd do, just in case one of us got controlled, so they wouldn't be able to get the rest of us.

          Alternatively, maybe they did some slow-acting sabotage to the ship.

  [Different poster] I think this confirms the theory we were discussing last week that the 'accident' in Ventura was no accident. The authorities are clearly trying to cover their asses after an accidental nuclear weapon explosion . There was some good discussion on /r/uncensorednews about how the explosion couldn't have been a meteorite because it didn't have any debris cloud impacting around the rest of the planet [link]. There were rumors of weird goings on in Ventura beforehand, so I guess it was a CIA or army site transporting nuclear weapons, and they don't want to admit they fucked up and detonated one in a civilian area, so are concocting this "aliens" story as a distraction. Who wants to bet that this alien mysteriously dies or teleports away, and the spaceships turn out, by huge coincidence, to be too damaged to use? Guess we'd better put even more money into the military industrial complex to fight off these evul sppaaahhs invaders!

  While given the circumstances I can understand people's mistrust, this really does represent a tremendous opportunity for us. Until now, I would have said humanity was destined to die quietly without ever leaving this one, admittedly nice, little rock. We shouldn't trust the aliens blindly, and anger over Ventura's bombing is definitely justified, but even a small chance this is legit makes the cost vs benefit of going along with the possibility of peace worth it. 

  Also, the rush to hostility here is hardly going to be conducive to good strategizing. Anger makes for poor planning. If nothing else, we should pretend to believe the Esplin, then take it somewhere quiet and pump it for information on its home planet, making our move only when the time is right.

This thread is not really properly showing the emotional impact of having Vermont flattened by an asteroid impact. People would have relatives there - people would be angry - people would be upset. That level of sheer *hurt* is not being reflected. We're - most of us - discussing the situation as though it were something that never really happened. We're analysing it, we're not emoting about it. Our parents, aunts, uncles, cousins are okay, none of them were really killed.

    I think the person who shared the 911 thread on slashdot had the best idea. That's the tone that's probably most suitable now.

  And now they're saying they come in peace, so it's probably *Mars Attacks!* or something.

  God you guys are so fucking credulous. You see a bad CGI alien on some shaky phone camera and suddenly you lose all sense? 

  Lets ignore everything about the Fermi paradox, the impossibility of faster than light trevel, etc.  Its a blue alien centaur, with a human face that speaks perfect English. I've seen more convincing aliens in Star Trek. 

  My bet is that its viral marketing for a tv show or game. MAybe a new VR one where you get to play as one of these slug aliens and control different animals, fighting against the nasty andalites. The line about teenage resistance fighters is a very obvious plot hook.

    Anyone stupid enough to use Ventura to promote their new movie would be lynched, along with everyone involved.  I can maybe buy someone in Hollywood being that disconnected.  But not the journalists, every news network, the whole crowd...

  No way. This can't be real. I don't know how this could have been faked, but...aliens? Honest to god, legitimate aliens? No fucking way.

  Hey, do I need to have read the original story to understand this fic?

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    Author: No.  It helps, but the story is meant to stand on its own.  Just be willing to roll with your confusion for the first chapter or so, and things will settle down into self-consistency by chapter three.  Think of it like a movie that's starting in the middle of the action, and will explain itself as it goes along.

  I don't buy it. That 'asteroid' was probably a government weapons system, like the tungsten rod satellite things, and it either malfunctioned or was intentionally fired on the town (crater photos with map overlay HERE). Plus it's too convenient that aliens would just so happen to land in Washington DC, speak our language, breathe our air, and feel sorry for us. And the thing with the kids fighting them off is taken straight from a fucking movie. 

  I don't know what people are trying to get past us but aliens and a teenage resistance movement? Gimme a break.
