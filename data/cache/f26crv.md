  Greatly enjoyed this back when it was [previously posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4c24f8/hsfc_cordyceps_too_clever_for_their_own_good/). It's a wild ride and a great [ir]rational horror story.

  This story has the most nightmare fuel of any story I've ever read. I refuse to reread it, or even think about, because it's so terrifying.

  If you like horror, rational horror, go and read it. Because it's goddamn scary, and well written.

  The thing that bugs me with this story is the disregard for safety by the doctors.

  As I understand it there's no reason they couldn't be comatose after the initial locking of the virus and their personality.

  Why not have a video of you talking with the doctor with certain parts censored and then you tell the camera, hey this video might be faked but it's gonna convince way more people. 

  Also think about how much abuse this system will have.

  A test for paranoia should be administered immediately and they should be put in a secure room

  Also anyone not wearing their mask at all times is crazy too

  Edit: also I hope that we can all acknowledge while totally a possible character the assumption of malevolence is not remotely rational and I can think of very few situations where even Bayesian logic would have you assuming so.

    Muscle atrophy? I agree, though. Surely 6 months is recoverable? It might be simply because the facility does not have the resources to handle that process.

    > Why not have a video of you talking with the doctor with certain parts censored and then you tell the camera, hey this video might be faked but it's gonna convince way more people.

    Might make some people *worse*. Might help though, yeah.

    > Also think about how much abuse this system will have.

    From the Doctors?

    > A test for paranoia should be administered immediately and they should be put in a secure room

    That seems dubiously humane...

    > Also anyone not wearing their mask at all times is crazy too

    Agreed, but remember that the strategy was *apparently* to have the doctors do a face to face and calm the patients down or something. I don't know what their exact strategy was, to be honest.

    > Edit: also I hope that we can all acknowledge while totally a possible character the assumption of malevolence is not remotely rational and I can think of very few situations where even Bayesian logic would have you assuming so.

    No, and I think that's the point - Archive *isn't* rational. They try to use rational tools, but they don't succeed. Most people don't overthink shit as much as they do either - I think Arc has a lot of problems going on beyond the surface, and frankly, it just makes the character more believable.
    ```

    - u/RMcD94:
      ```
      Yes, from the doctors. There's already a lot of malpractice going on and here a doctor can molest someone and wipe their memory afterwards.

      To be honest the face to face is much worse. If the doctor is wearing a mask you're far more likely to believe you have an infectious disease.

      Regardless I was referring to the lax guard, but I guess like any apocalypse you get used to it.

      I don't agree that that's the point. I think it's simply required for the story. We're not meant to learn from his paranoia because you might as well write a story where it saves him. I do think the character is very believable whereas HPJEV isn't for example. Even his choice at the end while sympathetic is silly when you can read about yourself afterwards. Just write down some goals or motives and hope future you will carry them out. Better odds than death. Your brain is surely likely to be close to your utility function. Of course if you care about nothing but your ego then it's irrelevant but Arc professed to caring about Gavin and why wouldn't Arc2.0 also do so? 

      A rational actor would probably just listen to the doctor, think about what's most likely, and then obey the doctor.

        Really? I didn't think it was very subtle, it seems pretty blatantly to be the central theme of the work IMO. Not necessarily to teach us not to be like them, though. I think this whole work can be seen sort of as a tragedy, in that it relies a lot on dramatic irony and the knowledge that things will not go well for our protagonists. But getting back to the point, it's the subtitle of the whole work: "*Too clever for their own good*".

      I think a month is the longest you can be in a coma without significant permanent damage.
      ```

      - u/Argenteus_CG:
        ```
        Permanent damage is a given here. It's just a matter of how much and which option does the least damage.

  Does anyone have the excised chapter P laying around? And yes, I'm amused at the irony of reading that type of story and instantly asking to read something I was told I wouldn't want to.
  ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    Most of the chapters are from different viewpoints of various iterations of the same three individuals where the chapter title changes/updates when they lose their memories to the pink elephant amnesia.

    The chapter names with numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 is all from one person, Gavin Batra. Yes, this means that chapter 2 (#24) chronologically occurs before the first chapter 3 (#1).

    The chapter names with the elements H and He is another individual, Dr. Orchard.

    The chapter names with letters N, O, and P is from a third individual, Arc. But there is nothing in chapter P because Arc decided losing the memories was worse than dying. In chapters #22 to 23, we see Arc (as O) dying for his convictions. How can there be a chapter P with Arc dead?

    It wasn't obvious because the chapter titles are based on the doctors' names for the patient which isn't consistent with the names the viewpoint characters are choosing to go by.

    It's why Benedict\_SC is apologizing in the final author's notes for "this pointlessly mean final 'chapter' included". It's not for having nothing in the final chapter, but rather for getting our hopes up that Arc somehow survived.

      ooooh, ok.

      I was thinking it was "P" for "Pink Elephant", and the chapter had been forgotten by the reader.

    I... Don't think there is one?

    The Internet Archive has the same Chapter 26 (slightly different notes) [a week after the story was completed](http://web.archive.org/web/20160402082042/http://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14574775).

  If anyone is wondering, the game that was played in the story is [Zendo](http://www.koryheath.com/zendo/), which I think is a beautiful game that would be enjoyed by people interested in rational fiction. I looked it up a few years ago when this story was posted one of the other times and have played it a bunch since.

  It's reminiscent of the 4-5-6 task HPMOR!Harry gives Hermioneâ€”you're basically doing science to find out the laws of the universe. It also uses pretty triangular pieces you can kinda buy on Amazon (for twice what they should cost) but are out of print. I emailed with the company that makes them, though, and they said they'd be making more available again in the form of a Kickstarter. There's a new version, but I prefer the simple pyramidal version where you make your own rules.

- u/LeifCarrotson:

  Ooooh. Thanks for reposting this, I hadn't seen it before. It's really good! 

  It's always good to think about what you know and how you know what you know.  The possibility that thinking would be bad...is scary.  I'd be dead if I was in this story; please give me some heavy sedatives instead so I do not wake and do not dream.

  I'd encourage everyone to read it, and also to remember (when you're lying awake at night trying not to think about pink elephants) that selective amnesia and alien tech as described in the story do not exist.

  Just finished it. Honestly...I am not that impressed. I was waiting for a mind blowing twist based on the comments here, but the big reveal has ended up being bland and contrived.

  Edit: Also, can someone explain the point of the gender neutral pronouns?
  ```

  - u/nicholaslaux:
    ```
    Both of the characters who used gender neutral pronouns presumably identified as non-binary and used they/them as their preferred pronouns.
    ```

  - u/darkardengeno:
    ```
    On the mind blowing twist, I actually think the 'twist' of the story is a sufficiently scary and neat idea that it suffices, but I experienced the same sort of mild disappointment towards the end and I think the reason is that it was pretty easy to call the 'twist' by at least the halfway point (if not earlier) and there was nothing else past that. I think the climax with Arc's death was quite strong but we never got payoff for it at the end with 6 learning about a friend that died in the hospital.

    For the gender-neutral pronouns, my reading is that for some people gender is one of the 'core identity' details that got censored by the antibody. That said, it's not clear why this extends to _other_ people interacting with the infected person (like Gavin referring to Arc as 'they' even when Gavin remembered Arc).

    I think with a rewrite to clear up the confusing details and either make the 'Pink Elephant' harder to figure out from the reader's perspective until the climax _or_ abandon any attempt at twist or mystery by making the 'Pink Elephant' known to the reader from the onset and instead building suspense through dramatic irony would make the story much stronger. That said, I found it a pretty engaging read and it gave me plenty of fun memetics ideas ~~(which is maybe a very bad thing)~~.
