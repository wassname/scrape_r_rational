  Since dietrich is a merchant, I'm assuming his command does something along the lines of "people can't break deals they make with me". It might also compel him to make fair deals, since that would explain his positive reputation, but that's a bit of a crapshoot. 

  Overall I don't mind these chapters, but I wish this one had ended at the academy gates rather than with random dialogue. 

  Gj author!!
