## [D] Radiolab: You Will Have Ideas

### Post:

http://www.radiolab.org/

Listening to these podcasts, any worries about "I don't know what to write" go out the window. Ideas fill your head. If you've heard of a concept before, this puts it in a new context. It questions the implications, and frames it in the story of how it happened that challenges you to reinvent what that story means.

I don't know if this is precisely the place for it, but I recommend it for anyone with a plot of rich land, needing seeds to scatter and an image of the golden waves to come. The content lends itself to science fiction, but the journalism introduces ideas that fit anywhere.

  [Freakonomics](http://freakonomics.com/radio/) works quite well as a sister podcast in terms of sprouting interesting ideas and links between disparate fields of study, but it's noticeably less rigorous than RadioLab on the specifics.

    Same goes for [99% Invisible](http://99percentinvisible.org/), though they don't really pretend at rigor. The [episode on cow tunnels beneath New York City](http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/cow-tunnels/) was one of my favorites.

  I just listened to one of the podcasts and it talked about a gameshow called "Golden Balls" and how one guy cleverly tricked his opponent into splitting the money with him instead of stealing. It was epic and inspiring.

  Btw it might be a bit off topic of this thread, but that podcast made me think of the idea of rational yugioh again. It's been a while since "License to Duel" has updated. I'm wondering if there's anyway to make a rational rewrite of the yugioh game that involves game theory. In real life, a strategy a person takes in the prisoner's dillema seems to say more about who they are than a game of duel monsters. I'm thinking the whole "game of the gods" thing could be played up a bit. Maybe the Egyptian Gods were expert game theorists or something (maybe they even invented decision theory or something before humanity thought of it for themselves). This would also explain why in the last season they switch from regular duel monsters to a magical roleplaying game that overwrites the past in a weird indirect time loop, that has the real-time precursor to duel monsters included in it.

  But now I'm thinking that for this story, Duel Monsters needs to be replaced with something slightly different that involves a bit more game theory and where the choices we make in the game say more about who we are, rather than just the cards we play.

  In fact, it would be a good idea if the game pieces (cards or whatever) in the story were designed so that their flavor matches how they are played strategically.
