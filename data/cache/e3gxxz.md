  From the AO3 Fiction Page:  


  >Galbatorix defeated the entire ancient order of Dragon Riders with only a few allies he himself raised. And then he ruled with what could only be called negligence. What could bring a man to do such a thing? And how does Eragon, ordinary farm boy, fit in with Galbatorix's plans? If Eragon wants to return the days of the Dragon Riders, he must find within himself the power to overcome even evil King Galbatorix, who has had hundreds of years to consolidate his power.  
  >  
  >A rationalist short story illustrating the power of cooperation and training to overcome even those enemies solely motivated by accumulating as much power as possible.

    Apologies, I had forgotten about that rule.

      They can be descriptions in your own words. You can even decide to make it more of a recommendation than a description if you think that anything else would be spoiling too much. But in any case you should give something that makes people have a reason to click on the link that goes beyond just the title of the story.

  A pretty interesting read. I certainly appreciate the attempt to salvage the plot of Eragon.

    I’ve always thought the ending was fairly well thought out, if not the rest of it — after all, consider: what kind of man would slaughter his own people in wholesale genocide? And how would you defeat such a man who has had almost a century to accumulate power? The only way I can see is by healing the sickness which caused him to be so depraved in the first place.

    His characterization is terrible, of course, in the first place, but I suspect that Pasolini didn’t really think his series would ever actually get around to seeing the Big Bad.

  I would love to read a chapter 2, just to see how rational!Eragon makes his case to Arya and the Garden, and to see how (or if) Galbatorix will try to gain an advantage in this oath

    Unfortunately, it's too much effort for me to continue this particular story as I find I've moved on. I *am* still writing and the next story I write I hope will be even better. My aim is to surpass HPMoR, and I realise that makes me sound arrogant, haha.

      Better to aim high than just settle. More awesome stuff will be created by people trying to be awesome than otherwise.

    The pool is imperfect and has presumably misled him before. That's the assumption that Eragon arrives at based on the same confusion you noted, and it's assumed to be true. Galbatorix is willing to discuss possible terms with Eragon under the belief that this will result in a superior future than whatever the pool showed.

    I think.

    Note: Edited for clarity. The previous explanation was rambling and long-winded and will not be retained.

    You have to think about why he would decide to depose the original order of dragon riders. They were, in his time, ruled by the elves - who are practically immortal compared to humans and so could not be conventionally deposed (although humans bred faster.)

    A possible motivation I can see for Galbatorix was that he was a human and thought, "Well shit, we have no negotiating power with these pricks. Better do something about that." And so obtaining as much power as possible in the most effective and efficient way possible. He could not afford to care about anything else since it was him alone against the entire preexisting order. So in a sense you could ask, is he really a villain? Obviously he is, because he doesn't care at all about the people he rules and enjoys killing people, and so that's why the story ends on a questioning note but you get the feeling Eragon's side is the one you would *want* to win, or at least that's the intention.

    The start of *Eragon's* story I had in mind is when he finds Saphira's egg. Suspiciously, it was teleported *conveniently* within range of him discovering it in The Spine, his favourite playground growing up, which everyone else in the village superstitiously hated, by a conspiracy of elves, dwarves, humans, and Brom, who turned out in canon to be his actual father while he was raised by Garrow. I made the change in the fic that he was raised by both Brom and Garrow in different ways - he was still a farm boy but Brom took care of his academic education too.

    To explain the conversation - the vulnerability that Eragon exploited was Galbatorix's implicit trust in Shruikan. Shruikan and Galbatorix both know they are completely loyal to each other, but Shruikan is more powerful than Galbatorix magically and physically because he's a dragon. Implied in canon (and in my text in Eragon's musings) dragons are "born wise," and in canon Saphira does learn to mindspeak incredibly quickly.

    As to the vulnerability, note the difference in particular in trust. Eragon does not even trust *his own thought process*, maybe taking seriously the common adage "trust but verify." Almost certainly he would trust Saphira over himself in the same way as Galbatorix does with Shruikan, but I imply that Galbatorix *deliberately* cut off Eragon's access to her in setting up the confrontation we see. So it was, in the end, a mistake by Galbatorix which led to Eragon's path to the deal that he eventually got to, and the slight common factor that they both began as humans.

    At the end then, Galbatorix realises he made a mistake (which he can learn from, thus increasing his power - which is what he cares about most), and therefore since Eragon specifically proposed a deal which took away absolutely nothing from Galbatorix except time (and he is immortal), Galbatorix ought to be happy enough with the current situation to actually take the deal, which he does. If he wasn't, he would be behaving irrationally, and this is intended to be a rationalist fiction.

  I would very much like to see more like this, or more of it.

- u/Makin-:
  ```
  This was pretty good. I definitely expected a darker ending where this was exactly what Galbatorix wanted - >!being able to kill Eragon as many times as he wanted, as painfully as he wanted, forever!<, but this is surprisingly satisfying too.
  ```

  - u/GeneralExtension:
    ```
    A slightly less dark ending would be funny - Galbatorix wants to rule, but, like Eragon, he hates giving speeches.
    ```
