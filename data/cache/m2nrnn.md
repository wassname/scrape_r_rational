  Isn't this already well known in this group? Also, I prefer this link for this sort of content:

  https://www.fimfiction.net/group/1857/folder/4096/canon-compatible-optimalverse?order=rating

  And I would like to suggest this as being thematically similar (and actually quite inspired by FiO!) but less apocalyptic and where the AI is a bit less overpowered:

    Yeah it's a bit of a repost, but it's a good story. If any newer users see this for the first time, I strongly recommend FIO. If you like ponies, it's about ponies! If you hate ponies, it's about how ponies are a horrifying existential threat! Win-win!
    ```

    If we never repost old classics then new members will never see them. I don't think there's anything wrong with posting a link to something like _FiO_ or _Worm_ or even _HPMoR_ once a year or so; it's not like the sub has a problem with too much activity.

    Yes this is well known here, for example I have a 5+ year old build a bear CelestAI valentine's gift that says "Would you like to emigrate to Equestria?"

    I mean the AI being realistically overpowered is kind of the point of these kinds of tales of caution.

    Giving the mortals a fighting chance through sone artificial stupidity kind of misses the point that there really isn't anything we can do after the AGI has been turned on and communicated with for the first time.

      It's more along the lines of the productive capability of doing stuff like immediately developing nanotech when our combined science and engineering doesn't have a mechanism for doing even simple versions of the stuff.  The AI in Thousand Tales is plenty smart and does outthink humans all the time, but just because it has access to massive amounts of processing and the sum total of human knowledge does not let it immediately bypass a ton of R&D and lab-based prototyping and factory construction that must take place in the macro scale.
      ```

        Fair enough.
        ```

  - u/Paimon:
    ```
    I've read it. It's good.
    ```

    - u/Gavinfoxx:
      ```
      FiO itself, the best of the canon-compatible Optimalverse stories, Thousand Tales (distinctly FiO-ispired!), or some mix of the above? Please clarify!
      ```

      - u/Paimon:
        ```
        Oh, just Friendship is Optimal.

    ~~In a sense, it could be relinked, since it's so old there might be already kids in this group born after it was written.~~

    (Edit: Ok, probably not.)

      ```
      There are pony fans alive now who were born after the Changeling Invasion of Canterlot and only know it from the recordings. I watched it happen live. Feel old yet?
      ```

        ðŸŽµ But I wasn't prepared for *this* ðŸŽµ

      8 year olds? Probably not yet.
      ```

        Good point (even though I wouldn't trust their willingness to avoid reddit simply because it's prohibited).

        Edit: On the other hand, they probably wouldn't have the mindset to stick around.
        ```

      ```
      There could be a three-month-old self-improving AI that was born after it was written...
      ```

- u/RandomChance:
  ```
  Totally worthy of reposts. Would not object if were on monthly automated repost cycle.
  ```

  - u/Uristqwerty:
    ```
    It's listed on [the subreddit wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index), though only as a title/hyperlink. No categorization, sentence-or-two marketing pitch/summary, or even links to substantial threads discussing it.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  If you like ponies and transhumanism, you'll find this to be an absolutely great story.
  ```
