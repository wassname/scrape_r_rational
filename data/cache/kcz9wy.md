## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  These threads have given me so many fun recommendations during this slow lockdown year, I figure it's time to throw some recc's back.

  Shadow of Angmar, a Harry Potter - Lord of the Rings crossover.

  [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/The-Shadow-of-Angmar](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/The-Shadow-of-Angmar)

  Rather than returning from King's Cross to the final battle with Voldemort, Harry is summoned across the worlds by the Witch-King of Angmar during the fall of Fornost, a little over a thousand years before the War of the Ring. The Witch-King thought he was summoning Morgoth. He is... displeased.

  After being freed following the fall of Angmar, Harry travels across Middle-Earth, trying to understand this strange world he's wound up in, adjust to using his magic without a wand, and above all, find somebody who can help him find his way home.

  *The Beast of Beacon* , a RWBY fanfiction.

  [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13504249/1/The-Beast-of-Beacon](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13504249/1/The-Beast-of-Beacon)

   It is set in an alternate timeline in which Adam Taurus decided to follow Blake after her departure from the White Fang and join Beacon Academy himself. Throughout the story he attempts to fit into an unfamiliar environment in hopes of reconciling with his former partner. 

    I think the character of Adam , the abusive undertones of his relationship with Blake, and the portrayal of Faunus and racism are better presented here than in the show. And don't worry, this is not an Adam/Blake story.
  ```

  - u/kraryal:
    ```
    I want to second the Shadow of Angmar; Harry makes pretty good choices, works with limited information, experiments with the environment he's in, and so on. 

    On top of that, the world building works well with what Tolkien had and the quality is good. It really feels epic, in that slow, wondrous way that the original LOTR had.
    ```

  - u/somnolentSlumber:
    ```
    Seconding Beast of Beacon, I usually don't like reading too much RWBY fiction because canon is so dumb but this one hit the mark for me, especially in how it depicts Ozpin and the people actually in charge at a school.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  This is gonna be a very niche request, but is there a xianxia where the protagonist actually acts as if he's in a world where offending/fighting the wrong person means death?

  Meaning they avoid confrontation, try their hardest to fly under everyone's radar, obsessively take precautions, only take fights when they are almost certain that nothing can go wrong, run from wars and mainly build their power through safe methods and by outlasting reckless cultivators.

  So far the closest I've gotten are protagonists that nominally admit how stupid drawing attention is, and then end up being the center of attention anyways. So, are there any stories where the MC is actually averse to risk?
  ```

  - u/Charlie___:
    ```
    Heart of Cultivation fits your criteria, though not only is it still quite short and in progress, most of the chapters have been bundled into an e-book. The MC is quite weak, and is constantly flattering  cultivators, "giving them face," etc. There's lots of danger still, but the author tries very hard to justify it as "sane person put through trying events."

      I tried Senior Brother, but it's way too heteronormative, explicit in its gender roles, and the comments about the little sister character were kinda blergh. I only tried it for a short while, maybe it gets better or backflips, but I've tried too many stories that play that bullshit straight to various degrees that I didn't think it worth the time to test.

        - u/gramineous:
          ```
          Expectations placed on people follow typical gender roles about women doing more non-combat stuff than men, adjectives for female characters feminine-coded and overly focused on physical appearance rather than presentation (ie. talking about body shape rather than body language for example), role of characters in the story (and importance, and proportion) based on gender (generally disproportionately focused on men in positions of power/influence, oftentimes the disparity is between the two only gets made up if you're in a harem-esque story)

    Warlock of the Magus World does this, though it has some other fairly serious issues (evil protagonist, some really messed up stuff far into it) that make it a shakier recommendation. My Senior Brother is Too Steady is supposed to be premised on this, but I found it uninteresting for other reasons. The protagonist of Lord of the Mysteries does a moderately decent job at this, doing things like maintaining multiple identities and doing divinations every time he takes a serious action.

    If you're okay with not too rational guns blazing action fanfiction, [Man off the Moon](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12904733/1/Man-off-the-Moon) has Nameless (basically Shirou) from fate grand order getting up to shenanigans in Mass Effect.

    Have you read The Illuminatus! Trilogy by Shea and Wilson? 

    It's a great novel but is extremely unique in style and presentation; the book jumps from character to character and across years *in the middle of paragraphs*, and the story is told in a highly disjointed, nonlinear way. It's very enmeshed in 60's/70's counterculture.

      ```
      I think the characters mostly make internal sense. They're not rational *people* - Eren in particular is a fucking walking ball of trauma and anger issues - but then again, they're orphaned refugees turned child soldiers in a world in which the enemy is basically giant zombies. I think we can excuse their mental health not being top notch.
      ```

      - u/Smartjedi:

        Oh yea, I agree with that. I don't particularly take issue with the characterization, just that given how most of this sub oftentimes prefers straight logical thinking in characters that not many characters in AoT fit.

        - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
          ```
          Hey, there's always Armin!

          I wouldn't call Attack on Titan rational, but mostly for other reasons, mainly:  
          - the 3DMG is cool and all, but there's no fucking way it's the most practical or feasible way to fight Titans, especially for a society that seems otherwise stuck somewhere around the Renaissance, technology wise;  
          - also, while the Titan shifters are certainly a huge threat, it's hard to believe that giant, slow, lumbering idiot Titans, stupider than most animals, could be that much trouble for humans with weapons and horses, even if they're hard to kill;  
          - lots of informed ability, very little shown in the way of it. No, you will not convince me that Erwin casualty-rates-of-90% Smith is a "good commander" just by having multiple characters saying so;  
          - way too many rules about how Titans work (especially in the last arc of the manga) that seem contrived and are suspiciously plot convenient, being revealed just at the right time.

          It's still a really good manga, but it's not perfect writing and works more at a level of political/philosophical themes than as a fully believable fictional world with a unique magic phenomenon.

    [*The Masquerade* series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/199001-the-masquerade) by Seth Dickinson (fantasy, sort of) and [the *Terra Ignota* series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/166200-terra-ignota) by Ada Palmer (sci-fi). Both have exactly what you're asking for, and focus on it front and centre. They're also very well-written, clever, and original.

    [*Gnomon*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33852053-gnomon) by Nick Harkaway, a sci-fi novel, also fits, and is, too, excellent. Be warned, though, it's also a metafictional mind-screw.

    **Edit:** I also recommend [*Ra*](https://qntm.org/ra), a hard sci-fi urban fantasy, and [*El-Ahrairah*](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/el-ahrairah-worm.372987/#post-20503664), a *Worm* AU fanfiction that focuses on Cauldron (note: *El-Ahrairah* is unfinished).

  People here seem to quite like progression fantasy.

  Watching the protagonist grow in power, acquire ever new abilities and come to gradually dominate every new environment they find themselves in seems to be satisfying.

  Is there any satisfying *regression* fantasy? Could it be done?

  *Pact* could be classified as a regression fantasy and what I read of it I found distinctly unsatisfying. The protagonist keeps (unrealistically) surviving, while losing parts of himself and failing to achieve his goals.

  Maybe, if instead the protagonist willingly spent their body or potential (like a spacecraft spends delta-v) to achieve changes in the world, the enjoyability could be improved.

  Does anything like that exist?
  ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    Twig is sort of like that, although to be fair the protagonist retains a similar level of competence as he goes on through the story. A large part of the regression is due to being a teen kid against some real powerful people (not really spoilers), and losing resources he used to have for granted. The other part is due to some major spoilery reason. I don't know if I'd call it satisfying, since I stopped reading before the story ended, but I have heard that it has one of wildbow's more positive endings.

    Michael Moorcock's Eternal Champion could be classed as regression fantasy, even if it predates the genre, really. 

    That said, it's hardly *willing* regression. Elric of Melniboné just keeps finding that victory has costs, over and over.
    ```

  - u/BavarianBarbarian_:
    ```
    I think it would have to be a balance between a regression in most sectors, for a progression in some others. Tuesdays With Morrie maybe? As the story progresses, Morrie's physical and finally, mental state regresses visibly. This is offset by the lessons he continues to teach to Albom up until the end.

    Though it's not really a *fantasy*.

  This is going to be controversial, but I'm going to recommend Cyberpunk 2077.

  Yes, the game is buggy as hell. Yes, there are legitimate complaints about game systems and questlines. But it's absolutely gorgeous (even on my decrepit gaming laptop (GTX970M/intel i7 4720HQ)), has engaging characters, has phenomenal music, and touches and (and to a limited extent, explores) transhumanist concepts of interest to the /r/rational community (though I was a little confused by their >!indirect anti-immortality stance, even though so much of the game is about fighting death.!<)

  I had a solid 30 hrs of fun getting through the main story and a number of the sidequests, and expect at least another 5-10 even before any DLC/updates come out. Well worth it for my money, and once they start issuing discounts the deal will get even better.

    The things that make that recommendation controversial (at least that I was aware of) were more, uh, ethical/moral. Mostly that CDPR crunched the hell out of their employees, and also that it fucked up anything gender-related in the fetishistic directions in both their marketing and their actual in-game implementations/representation. Neither of which ought to be encouraged with wallet-voting. 

    Fair warning that I've not personally extensively researched either of those claims myself, but what I saw seemed pretty convincing, especially on the crunch front.
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      For the crunch thing, as it's external to the work, I wouldn't consider it's impact on whether or not to recommend the game. If you feel like you can't financially support cd projeckt red due to it, I would suggest just pirating the game. It's DRM free, after all.

      As for the sex/gender stuff, I essentially ignored all the marketing and went in blind (and not specifically looking for it.) I wouldn't say there are no problems to be found with their representation, but I would say that I personally did not find any problems: the treatment of sex and gender in cyberpunk seemed relatively in line with what I'd expect from a cyberpunk dystopia with omnipresent body modification; it didn't take me out of the world, at least. In fact, the deliberate hypersexualization of literally everything played firectly into the game's lore pretty well.

        > For the crunch thing, as it's external to the work, I wouldn't consider it's impact on whether or not to recommend the game.

        Well, from a purely utilitarian perspective, that is *exactly* the kind of thing you consider. By buying the product you encourage the practice, because you help make it pay off. If you universalise your behaviour, "everyone refuses to buy games produced with crunch" would be a surefire way to end crunch forever. It only exists because many either don't care, or can't resist the temptation of the pleasure the game gives to them for the sake of a greater collective utility.
        ```

        - u/GaBeRockKing:
          ```
          The company being scumbags would determine whether or not I *buy* the game, but I recommend entertainment based only on the qualities of the media itself. After all, anyone who feels like they can't financially compensate CD project red for ethical reasons can just sail the friendly seas.

          - u/SimoneNonvelodico:

        This is third-hand, but from what I've seen/heard they approach gender from a "what's in your pants" perspective, rather than the more complicated social construction thing that it is. (And even that they did poorly, since apparently the character creator is impressively unimaginative)
        ```

        - u/TacticalTable:
          ```
          Late reply on this, but Cyberpunk gender is decided by the voice you pick. I believe this is for voice acting timing reasons, given that >90% of players would be aligning the two, and not having that would require yet more work, which CDPR doesn't exactly have time for.

          A lot of the controversy on gender issues in the game seems to be stemming from ignorance of the game and knee-jerk reactions, rather than legitimate criticisms, imo.

      We've had tens of thousands of games over the years (hundreds of thousands, if you include mobile stuff). It's statistically highly unlikely that it's "the best" in any objective non-contrived sense.

        >It's statistically highly unlikely that it's "the best" in any objective non-contrived sense.

        That kind of ignores that hardware and software has advanced over time. I don't think you can say, at least, that on high end hardware and the highest graphical settings, that it isn't among the top games out there for graphical quality. From what I've seen, it is indeed the best for graphics, though I haven't seen every game out there.

        The other elements individually don't stand out, but as a whole package the sheer amount of stuff and quality of it as a whole does put it as the best RPG for me.

        The thing it does very well that other games don't is that it is set up to be very immersive. The ray traced lighting helps A LOT with the feel of the environment, the character animations are all very high quality. But there's also another angle - the cyberpunk aesthetic aligns incredibly well with typical "videogamey" elements like UI overlays, crosshairs, scanning things for info, even upgrading items (mods/cyberware). Things like calling your vehicle, fast travel points, even down to enemies mostly becoming aware of you at the same time if one detects you (or a camera does), all the elements make sense diegetically. So a combination of very well done environments, lighting, and characters as well as thematically well integrated gameplay elements does a great job of pulling you in to engage with the story - arguably the best part of the game.

  * [RE: Monarch](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37951/re-monarch)
   \- A time-loop story in the vein of re:zero/MoL. It's not very far in so far, but it's decently written with a character who has to struggle through his problems. An aspect I liked about the story is that the main character is reflective on how he approached life and learning. MC also isn't the smartest/strongest character in the series, with the author stating that "a theme of this story is that power comes slowly and often at great cost" . Definitely seems like it will go more towards the tragedy side of a time-loop with a moving save-point he has no control over. I'm really enjoying it so far and would recommend it.

  * [The Perfect Run](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36735/the-perfect-run) \- Another time-loop story, almost completely the opposite of the first. By the same author as "Never Die Twice" and "Vainqueur the Dragon", and definitely not rational. It's a bit quirky/zany in the beginning, but I found it easier to stomach once you realize the character has gone insane from the time-loop, and has regards for consequences of his actions. It's a more fun story, with an interesting world and powers, definitely not for everyone. The author is 3/3 for completing his last books, so you can have some faith it will be finished.
  * [Sexy Space Babes] (https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37934/sexy-space-babes) \- This is erotica. With such a ridiculous name, yet still good reviews, I decided to actually read it. I'm not sure of its literary merit, but I thought it worth mentioning as it has gender-stereotypes reversed for aliens, and starts with a male protagonist that thinks of this as a "good thing". It starts to slowly slide off into sexual harassment, concern about sexual assault, and a shift in attitude to how the main-character approaches sex (kinda). I guess if you're going to read erotica at least it has some social commentary in it, light as it is.

    Zachtronics Games are about as rational as you can get before you start programming in python.

    Factorio too.

    Disco Elysium might be right up your alley. You can be as rational or irrational as you choose, with benefits and drawbacks to both. It's part arthouse, part detective mystery, part existential philosophy, and part a critique of modern society... depending on your build. Yeah it's some wild stuff.

    Outer Wilds maybe.

    Noita is another roguelike with a big focus on learning the lore and interactions of elements within the game. If you've ever played powder game, a flash particle simulator from the days of miniclip, it's like that but with procedurally generated worlds and much more interaction and explosions.

    Everyone has already mentioned some of the best puzzles or sandboxes out there, so I’ll go for more story based stuff. I’m currently playing Crying Suns, a space rogue like about an admiral who keeps being revived by an AI from a memory backup trying to restore a fallen stellar empire. Feels very Dune in setting, with some Warhammer 40k thrown in, but the story (quite simple, and I still haven’t seen the ending) has a lot of transhumanism in it, as you can imagine.

    Children of a Dead Earth is a strategy game about fighting a war in the solar system, between human colonies. It’s as realistic as it gets, as in, literal orbital mechanics are involved. Not much plot though.

      > Children of a Dead Earth

      I'm currently completing a Master's in Mechanical Engineering, having taken Laser technology as one of my specializations. I don't think I have a chance to compete in that game. Just the description of all the details you have to take into account when designing your ships...

      >PHYSICALLY ACCURATE MATERIAL PROPERTIES - All materials, chemical reactions, and spectra are physically correct. When your arclamp pumps your solid state laser, the pumping bands need to match up with the actual emission spectra of your excitation gas. When the photon absorption of a material is needed, it is derived from actual refractive index spectra data.

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:

        To be fair, I never even went into that shit, I used the prefab designs. Simply dealing with the orbital mechanics and dodging and engaging with incredibly limited amounts of fuel is hard enough. But yes, it's an absurdly detailed game.

    For me, [Noita](https://store.steampowered.com/app/881100/Noita/) is rational in that it's all about manipulating fairly complex spell modifiers and numbers till you get something obscenely overpowered to match the strong, numerous enemies and the volatile environment. The world is huge, there are parallel universes and all kinds of things that make it seem 'real'. Each biome may seem independent but it's all part of a greater whole, worms move between... etc. I like the consistency of it.

    On the same note, [Katana Zero](https://store.steampowered.com/app/460950/Katana_ZERO/) is sort of rational in that sense. It makes sense for you to be able to retry, time and time again given that's your superpower. The gameplay fits the theme. Also both are overwhelmingly positive.

    The Witness is an explicitly rational*ist* puzzle game and walking simulator. Highly, highly reccomended.

  What are some rationalist works that have the same basic setup of Worm (One day a fraction of people gained superpowers) except with a PoD set back in the early 20th century instead of 1982? 

  In other words, Worm set during the World Wars and other political chaos of that era. 

  It doesn't have to be a Worm fanfic, but ideally it'd be as dark or more than Wildbow's work, and it'd be great if it had the same system since it's already very elegant.

  Feel free to recommend rationalist fiction that takes place around this era and is similarly alien space batty.
  ```

  - u/Dufaer:
    ```
    I think [Pith](https://pithserial.com/) matches most of your criteria. To wit:

    It's very Worm-y in tone, set in 1930s (or thereabout) magical Britain-equivalent.

    Superpowers come from magical ability, with magic newly exposed to the wider world. Magical power varies widely across mages and every mage gets one initial and unique ability (so that's pretty Worm-y) but can learn more.

    As for wars, the great war against the genocidal China-equivalent got won about a decade ago by magically expunging their whole culture from reality, leaving it a failed state.

    In the Britain-equivalent, poverty is high, crime is high, social stratification is high and they are out of colonies.

    The stars are long gone, the world is flooded, a revolution might be brewing and the water is ever rising. It's quite a Worm-y feeling.

    Not rational as such, but the Wild Cards series has a great premise and many interesting characters.  Basically aliens drop a virus over New York that kills 90%, makes 9% "jokers" (deformed in various ways, sometimes with abilities), and makes 1% "aces" (some sort of powers without the primary downside).  There are something like 30 books in the canon now and new ones are still being produced.

    Ar'kendrithyst is 50% slice of life and 50% action fantasy. There are big fantastical events that happen, but the author also shows the downtime between those events, and the characters just having fun or going about their daily lives. It's somewhat controversial on this site, but if you can get past the protagonist's personality, I found it very enjoyable.

  Tower of Somnus just released the first few chapters of Book 2, so that's on the menu again. (Book 1 was a NaNo project.)

Only WOTR has advanced chapters. I will update this when book 2 begins to land." which put me off supporting for now as I'm not interested in WOTR. Is the text out of date?

    I enjoyed it a lot. The start is a bit irrational in the build choice, although everything else the character does is quite rational. He wears armor, plans his approach, gathers information etc.

    &#x200B;

    It's really good, the setup for his build was a bit too forced, he's in a dangerous place without any information and chooses to raise a stat he doesn't know anything about that will provide him with as far as he knows no benefits but he still does it. A rational person would either add to it gradually or at least try to get some information on it first but other than that it's very good progression fantasy.

    &#x200B;

    I like the author, all he needs to do is not write harem stuff like he did in his other stories and most people will enjoy them, who knew.. I want to recommend Wake of the Ravager to my irl friends, but with that cover and that start it just can't be done.

      to be fair the main character is *tripping balls* at the start, so this irrationality makes sense in context.

        - u/Amonwilde:
          ```
          Yeah, he's cured. Agree that he could have put in points more slowly, though I think going with a long tail play makes sense if you're stuck insomething labeled "impossible." It's pretty forgivable as far as blunders go, and it's contained to the premise, which I tend to find more tolerable.
          ```

          - u/timelessarii:
            ```
            Yeah definitely. I honestly wasn't a huge fan of it but it wasn't terrible, I guess just not my taste.

            I wasn't hung up about the point investment at the very beginning, seemed reasonable-ish, but I think some people blame all of his weird choices on being high and I'm like... No. Was just one choice lol.

            I'm not one to say "x book should be/do y" but I almost wish he had been high for longer than just doing one thing, ie he is high and thinks the faeries and stuff are just part of his trip. 🤷‍♂️

            I'm glad macro is doing well with the book though, despite everything I've said 😅

            - u/IICVX:

              My perspective is that the mental whiplash in going from tripping to being A) stone cold sober and B) in the middle of an impossible situation does not lead to particularly rational decision making.

              - u/timelessarii:

                That's a fair point, though ultimately it wasn't being irrational that pushed me away. I just didn't find it very funny/engaging but like I said I think it just wasn't for me and I'm happy a lot of people have enjoyed it & macro is doing well.

  Has anyone here ever tried playing [5D Chess With Multiverse Time Travel](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1349230/5D_Chess_With_Multiverse_Time_Travel/)? If you've ever read [Branches on the Tree of Time](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time), this is basically exactly the kind of version of chess you'd train on if you were a general preparing to fight that sort of temporal war. It's a pretty baffling game because even if you're decent at chess it makes you feel completely inadequate - I doubt any human could fully master the entirety of its state space (the AI doesn't appear very good at it either). Small note, though, the "5D" in the title is effectively a bit misleading - the game is "only" four dimensional, as you have the two standard dimensions of the chessboard, time, and parallel timelines. Still. Really fun stuff!

    Not precisely fiction, but [Gramarie](https://forums.giantitp.com/showthread.php?291019-By-the-Inferior-Science-of-our-Enemies-Gramarie-Mark-II) is a D&D 3E fan-supplement focused around this sort of thing. A standard mid-level tool, for example, is a *ballistic engine* which instantly increases the velocity of a touched item by a large and volume-dependent amount, in a manner which is safe for the object itself, provided that it isn't launched into anything. While this gross violation of physics principles was created with the authorial intent that it be used to create railguns that get loaded with bullets, in practice people incorporate it into body armour which they then use to launch themselves or anyone they can touch through the air at great speed, in addition to still being able to railgun anything they can touch to one of the copper fixtures. If you launch a person, everything they're wearing comes with, so if you wear the device...

  The [HPMOR audiobook](https://hpmorpodcast.com/?page_id=56) is amazing- all the characters are voiced separately, like a radio drama. Harry's voice is perfect, innocent with a touch of whining, but with enough range to be a little frightening at times. Snape becomes an uncannily likeable mild-mannered professor who just likes to bully people which was an interesting take on him. Quirrell is respectably thuggish.

  Just found [Luna Lovegood and the Chamber of Secrets](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/TF77XsD5PbucbJsG3) from r/HPMOR, its a new ongoing 2nd year story from the end of HPMOR, both hilarious and clever.

  Seconding u/timecubefanfiction 's recommendation for the webcomic [Strong Female Protagonist](https://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-1/page-0/). Its a bit, um, weird, but very high quality, like a left-wing-focused version of Watchmen. As an aside, I'll recommend everything u/timecubefanfiction himself has ever written.

      Can't say I've ever been into hard SF, but if the work can be considered a classic, I'm willing to go into it. I liked Asimov mostly for Salvor Hardin.

    I follow quite a few webcomics on a regular basis. Here are the ones I love most due to their high quality story and artwork:

    ---

    **[Lackadaisy](http://www.lackadaisy.com/)** 

    A beautifully detailed period piece, this webcomic follows a wide cast of characters connected to the 'Lackadaisy' speakeasy as they deal with tumultuous times in prohibition era St. Louis: rival gangs, malingering revenue agents, and past secrets that refuse to stay buried.

    The art quality is professional level. All of the characters are portrayed as anthropomorphic cats, but they act just like humans, with amazing detail in expressions, clothing, and scene setting. Like most webcomics, the art style changes a bit over time, but in my opinion the quality starts out high and grows to become truly phenomenal.

    Example pages:

    * [Early on](https://www.lackadaisy.com/comic.php?comicid=4)
    * [More recent](https://www.lackadaisy.com/comic.php?comicid=151)

    The webcomic is relatively slow to update (understatement), but it has been reliably and steadily growing since 2006.

    ---
    **[Outsider](https://well-of-souls.com/outsider/)**

    This story is a space opera set in the 22nd century, after humanity, having achieved spaceflight, finally makes contact with an alien civilization for the first time. Sadly, first contact proves to be an ill omen: the aliens turned out to be refugees fleeing a pan-galactic war of annihilation waged between rival civilizations. Armed with intel from this encounter, the leaders of humanity realize that they must inevitably choose a side or risk being wiped out by either of the galactic super powers. The story follows a crewman on humanity's scouting expedition sent to investigate each side.

    The quality of the art is consistently high. The character style is a bit more anime-esque compared to the others I'd recommend, but the artist does a excellent job of meshing the drawn parts of each scene with the 3D rendered spacecraft interiors.

    Example pages:

    * [Early on](https://well-of-souls.com/outsider/outsider003.html)
    * [More recent](https://well-of-souls.com/outsider/outsider058.html)

    Like Lackadaisy, Outsider has often been slow to update, but it has been chugging along reliably since 2001.

    ---

    **[String Theory](http://www.stringtheorycomic.com/)**

    Sting Theory follows the life of an unethical scientist in a dystopian alternate universe USA where science has created abilities that seem supernatural. The aftermath of a catastrophic lab failure lands the main character in prison, his life seemingly in ruins, but powerful people lurk behind the scenes, angling to use him for their own ends.

    Out of all my recommendations, this webcomic has the most dramatic evolution of style over the course of its story. It starts out grayscale and cartoony, but eventually develops to wonderfully detailed color palettes, scene setting and character design.

    Example pages:

    * [Early on](http://www.stringtheorycomic.com/comic/pagethree/)
    * [Middle development](http://www.stringtheorycomic.com/comic/page-twenty-seven/)
    * [More recent](http://www.stringtheorycomic.com/comic/chp6-page-05/)

    I can't comment on the update schedule of this one since I haven't been following it as long, but it began in 2009 and has quite a few chapters already posted.

    This story follows two unlikely allies in their fraught journey to places they never should have ventured. Along the way the artist explores the depths of the unique fantasy setting: nations at war, conflicting theologies, and science on an uneasy leash to politics.

    The artist began her professional career long before starting Unsounded, and it shows. Out of all my recommendations, this one has the highest consistent quality throughout, and the artist loves to play with the variety of her medium. She has a flare for breaking through the borders of the page at climactic moments.

    Some example pages:

    * [1](http://www.unsoundedcomic.com/comic/ch02/ch02_17.html)
    * [2](http://www.casualvillain.com/Unsounded/comic/ch03/ch03_04.html)
    * [3](http://www.casualvillain.com/Unsounded/comic/ch03/ch03_29.html)
    * [4](http://www.unsoundedcomic.com/comic/ch05/ch05_18.html)

    Unsounded also has the most professional update schedule out of all the webcomics I've ever seen.  During posting cycles, the artist always uploads several pages per week until a chapter is fully uploaded (which typically means months at a time of steady, fast updates). Then, when the chapter is completely up, she takes a month-long hiatus to build up her page buffer again.

    [Never Mind the Gap](http://nmg.thecomicseries.com)- character-driven, somewhat slice-of-life about humans and androids coexisting in a small town. Fairly realistic depiction of AI (though no singularity takeoff). More importantly, the characters are compellingly written and rational.

    Much more well-known classics, to the point I would normally assume anyone asking had already read them: https://xkcd.com, https://www.smbc-comics.com. Both are very-long-running, regularly updated one-offs that can be read in any order, focusing on science and philosophy humor.

    I'd recommend Schlock Mercenary, if you can stomach the art at the beginning. That part gets a lot better. 

    What starts out good, and stays good is: There's no status quo. It literally starts off with one of the main characters breaking a monopoly on interstellar travel, and all the ripples and changes that come out of that.

    Every faction has goals and intelligent characters that do things even when the protagonists aren't visible. It's also complete! 

    Be warned that it literally ran daily for fifteen years, there's a lot to read.

    > Luna Lovegood and the Chamber of Secrets

    Seconding this.

    It's very laconic in style. Luna tames a Wrackspurt ("Wanda"), fails to befriend any peers and a double-witch, imitates a snake (or Voldemort) and generally deals with a boatload of antimemetic crap.

For example,>!it turns out that 1 hour in the parallel reality equates to 1 minute in ours (I don't remember the exact ratio) so they head into the alt-reality with their laptops to finish an app they'd been working on before an impossible deadline.

    I would argue that Marvel's *Dr. Strange* is decently rational, especially for a summer blockbuster type movie. I mean, it features a protagonist engaging in independent study to better understand the rules of a magic system they're exploiting.

    Although it suffers from telling not showing a lot of the time, it has a cast of competent characters who all pursue their own ends fairly reasonably, and while some of them make choices driven by emotion, none of them ever really hold the idiot ball that I can recall.

        Yeah, it's definitely only rational in a vacuum. Even in his next appearance in Thor 3, he's teleporting and creating matter willy-nilly, both of which would have solved problems in his standalone movie, and don't even get me started on his appearance in Infinity War and Endgame.

        If you consider the movie as its own entity though (which fair enough if you don't or can't), I'd maintain that it meets a lot of the criteria for rational fiction.

          > he's teleporting and creating matter willy-nilly, both of which would have solved problems in his standalone movie

          You could argue he learned those skills in between the two movies, so that's not necessarily a problem. Infinity War and Endgame though are kinda inexcusable if you want to be rational, also because it's unclear how is Thanos not already fundamentally invincible when he has the Space Stone. That's enough to one shot anyone, just teleport them in the fucking interstellar vacuum.

    I recommend *KonoSuba* and *Hinamatsuri* (manga) neither are extremely rational but both are extremely hilarious. There is anime of both.

    What I find very engaging about *Hinamatsuri* is that what might be just throw-away jokes in other works will often have long-lasting effects on the plot here. The status quo is definitely not conserved.
    ```

    - u/Dragfie:

      \+1 for both,  *KonoSuba*  is one of the better Isekais and  *Hinamatsuri*  is a completely out-of-the-blue hit. As good as Mob Psyco 100 IMO and both didn't make me cringe from irrationality.

      If we're talking comedy manga, can't avoid mentioning *Kaguya-sama wants to be confessed to*, a clever and arguably pretty rational  romcom about two very smart and very dorky teenagers in love who try to one-up each other with mind games to pull a confession out of each other. It's very funny, very character-driven, and often uses its setup to make some quite poignant and down-to-earth observations on how romantic relationships work, while often lampooning the worst tropes of the romantic comedy genre in the process. The only reservation I have is that lately it has had a bit of a penchant for going into more straight-faced serious arcs that are frankly the worst part of the series for me. Not awful, but a lot less believable and clever than the rest.

      Also, seconded both your recommendation, and recently I've started reading *Yuusha ga Shinda (The Hero is Dead)*, which is very Konosuba-like. A sleazy, cowardly, good for nothing farmer kills the destined Hero who's supposed to defeat evil etc. by mistake, and is forced by a necromancer to take his place as a soul inserted in his (now rotting) body. Cue shenanigans as he tries to live up to a reputation he can't possibly match and/or shamelessly make use of it for his personal advantage, occasionally happens to defeat worse evils than he, and generally be a force for Chaotic Neutralness at best.

    ```
    *Evolution Man, or How I Ate My Father* by Roy Lewis is a 1960 novel about a family of cavemen during the Pleistocene. They're led by a genius and extremely self-aware (as in, breaking-the-fourth-wall, actually-knows-the-names-of-geological-eras self aware) man who has a great knack for revolutionary inventions that will define the future of humanity. They invent, among the other things, fire, cooking, and marriage. It's a really funny novel that I'd say has also some elements of rationality - not in the sense of it being realistic (as I said above, comedy trumps all realism in it), but in the sense of representing in a humorous and condensed way the kind of mechanisms that could indeed have driven our early ancestors when laying the foundations for our culture. That said, it's still based on a 1960 understanding of anthropology and paleontology (such as the very notion of prehistoric men living in caves...), so expect it to be a bit dated in terms of its science.

      Just started reading this, and I'm enjoying it so far. I ran into a bit of an unexpected snag though, when I tried finding a map to refresh my memory of the series. Apparently getting a decent-resolution copy of the official Westeros/Essos map (that you can read the city lables on) requires buying the official atlas for $40. I don't think I spent that much on the first five books combined!

      That paywall seems a little... unreasonable?

      Edit: I found a fan-made map that seems to be pretty accurate, compared to the official one. It's not as pretty, but it's a whole lot more readable.

There's a few parts where he actually goes off the edges of that map and you basically just have to look up the wiki pages of the places he's talking about, but it has all the major cities which is most of what you need.

        If you aren't interested in reading the rest of the canon books, it would be worth reading a wikipedia level plot summary of them. It does help to have the background.

        It's an AU. 98% of the facts presented in canon are preserved, except for a few crucial details. And there's a lot of filled in details when the story goes places that are only barely mentioned in canon. The biggest difference is that it's a time loop so the actual story progression happens over and over again, sometimes fairly close to canon and sometimes dramatically different.

  I recently read the Cradle series and the first couple of books of the "Thousand Li" series. I'm interested in trying more xianxia, so I'm looking for recommendations. Requirements:  


  \- Above all, a good translation. Ideally the writing would flow similarly to a novel originally written in English.  
  \- A rational setting isn't required, but the protagonist shouldn't make too many Idiot Ball decisions. I'm okay with a story that doesn't hold up when looking at the background details like the world's economy, as long as the foreground makes sense.  
  \- Tropes are fine, since I don't have a lot of xianxia experience. I'd be perfectly happy with a relatively generic story that's executed well.   
  \- Complete is not required but would be a bonus.

    Most of these are on Royalroad btw.

    Infinite Realm: Monsters and Legends is good, has some interesting main characters. The power system is very consistent and deep, and the author does this great thing of having interludes from the most powerful people in the world. It's just overall good (compared to other litrpg/xianxia). The main characters sometimes make questionable decisions, but most of the time the decisions are because of power interactions (power requires sacrifice, and whatnot). Overall I'd say most characters beyond a certain power level are competent, and that even if the protagonists seem OP, the author finds a way to give everyone powerful OP abilities.

    Defiance of the Fall and He Who Fights With Monsters are good popcorn fics. Not too rational, has pulpy protagonists who always get a lot of power and popularity while quipping witty one liners (especially the second one). They are fun guilty pleasure reads.

    I've heard good things about Forge of Destiny and The Path Unending, which both started as quests on SV and SB and then migrated to RR with nice edited versions. Same for Ave Xia Rem Y, which wasn't a quest but also migrated.

    The Dao Of Magic starts off pretty meh, but it has some really interesting ideas and some interesting implementations of said ideas. Starts with a top level cultivator trying to ascend to the next realm, but getting smited down by angry upper realm cultivators into a much lower realm with almost no qi. I'd recommend it just to check out. I was interested enough to read up to the latest chapter. It's on hiatus now though.

    There's Street Cultivation, which gets recommended here sometimes. It's on Kindle Unlimited I think.

      FYI He Who Fights With Monsters isn't really xianxia, but is still definitely tasty popcorn.

      I have read Forge of Destiny, and can vouch for both it's goodness, and it's xianxia-ness.

      Yes it is really good.  So rational in its analysis of power structures the Chinese government banned the author from updating it because it indirectly challenged their authority.  It still has like 2500 chapters out there though, would recommend it here too.

  Has someone ever tagged their work with 'polyamory', and then just had it evolve into a standard harem, to see what people from this sort of place's reactions would be?
  ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    Harem is a stupid, overly vague term already. It can refer to a guy surrounded by thirsty women he never fucks as in most "harem" anime, or straight up polygamy, or a guy owning women as slaves, or just a promiscuous guy in non-exclusive relationships, and a bunch of other such scenarios. I'm not a prude by any means but I fucking hate harem in any fic because I know it'll mean stupid characterization, clumsy misogyny and bad writing.
    ```

    - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
      ```
      In fiction harem usually is employed in the context of anime or anime-inspired stuff, so I'd say it's not vague, and in practice:

      > a guy surrounded by thirsty women he never fucks

      is *definitely* what it will mean 99% of the time. Recently, a much funnier incarnation of the trope is found in the manga *The 100 Girlfriends who Really Really Really Really Love You*, which is a comedy about some dude who is literally forced by fate to have 100 girlfriends - not just love interests, literal girlfriends. So it's a true polyamorous relationship (that gets increasingly more ridiculous with each new addition; I believe he's somewhere around 10 or 11 at this point), and funnily enough, far from being your typical dense or perverted self-insert, the protagonist is instead this super considerate, super loving guy who treats all the girls with incredible affection and understanding and would likely give his life for any of them at a moment's notice without a second thought. I'd call the series wholesome overall if not for the fact that the ages of some of the characters would make their romantic association more than a bit questionable in real life (I think overall the whole thing is SO ridiculously absurdist and unrealistic, having also a habit of repeatedly shattering the fourth wall into non-existence, it's easy to overlook it as just part of the craziness, but YMMV). It's definitely a very unique, and for once, very *literal*, take on the harem trope.

        > In fiction harem usually is employed in the context of anime or anime-inspired stuff

        Anime/light novels-inspired harems admittedly tend to take the "guy surrounded by thirsty women he never fucks" route. However, more recently different, much more explicit, types of "harem" and "reverse harem" fantasy/science fiction books -- think E. William Brown's "Daniel Black" books -- have become popular.

        An Amazon Kindle search on "reverse harem" finds over 10,000 matches. Spot-checking suggests that roughly half of them have SF/F elements. A quick check of the ISFDB robot's internal database finds over 4,700 books with the word "harem" in the title, including over 2,500 "reverse harem" titles. And that's just the stuff that *hasn't* been added to the main ISFDB database (yet). See /r/haremfantasynovels for more details.

    Uh, maybe give a bit more detail?

    What did you like about it? What would you expect other readers of r/rational to like about it? Maybe what other works is it comparable to?

    On that last note, how would you compare it to [Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid) (the author's perhaps most well known work)?

    Also, I just read in a reader review that apparently the protagonist effortlessly wins everything. How accurate is that?
    ```

    - u/DXStarr:
      ```
      Perilous Waif is gleeful sci-fi fun, with a well-done setting and a naive but capable protagonist.

      The author actually tries to work out a halfway sensible far-future setting that still has human conflict. He comes a lot closer than most recent books to the sacred triple of "futuristic _and_ realistic _and_ relatable."

      It's a lot less suffused with violence and sex than the author's other books; it's also a lot more upbeat in tone.

      Interplanetary stowaways, cybernetic upgrades, legendary derelict navies floating in the interstellar dark, AIs contemplating the right of humankind to continued existence - there's a lot of space opera fun here.

      The MC definitely has more power than ideal for maximum tension. The interest is "how will she handle this?", not "can she survive this?"

      I think it's a fun romp, especially if you crave books that take their far-future settings halfway seriously.
      ```

      - u/Dragongeek:

        I generally agree with you but overall I found *Perilous Waif* frustrating. 

        On the one hand, the world building is close to brilliant. It's a great example of "hard far future sci-fi" because while there is some handwaving and clarketech going on, it feels more science-based and down to earth compared to something like the star trek setting. Critically, it takes the technology it introduces seriously and considers its effects on the wider world. Also, it handled the big AI question well (what are humans for in the future?) and manages to create a world where human(ish) main characters aren't obsolete.

        Additionally, there are some fantastic story threads in there. There's the whole "Level 6 AI" plotline simmering in the background but there are also plenty of identity, free will, and consciousness/transhumanism questions floating about. Then there are all the space-opera elements which leave the setting open with basically limitless potential. 

        On the other hand, when the author's tastes (and proclivity for writing erotica?) shine through things get a little... weird. I mean, I'm not opposed to sex in my fictions, but this story hits all the cringe-inducing tropes (eg all women are lesbians, actual furries, etc) and some that are not cringe-inducing but simply ick. Like, I get that the protagonist "ages faster" so she's "older than she looks" but come'on. There are a *lot* of things that raise red flags for me and some serious "men writing women" issues. 

        This is why I find *Perilous Waif* so frustrating. It has a fantastic setting, perfectly serviceable fun characters, an engaging story, and countless story threads that could all individually be pulled out and spooled into a whole books, *but*, all this good has an uncomfortable pallor cast over it from the author's proclivities which make me feel like checking the local sex-offender listings.

          FWIW, the author's earlier "Daniel Black" science fantasy series spent a significant amount of time on similar themes. His [Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644), which is listed in this subreddit's Wiki, also touched upon some of them.
