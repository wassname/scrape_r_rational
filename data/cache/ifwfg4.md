Wordpress has decided to make their new editor mandatory, FB-style, so hopefully there are no wacky formatting errors in this.

For those of you just joining us, PB is a grim high fantasy serial set in a Near-East flavored world, slowly working its way toward conclusion after a run of more than a year.  Lots of magic, politics, intrigue, and a steep learning curve for the hero.  If all this is new to you and you want to get in on the ground floor, [here it is](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/).  Thanks as ever for everyone still following along.

  Before the reveal at the end I was speculating that he was going to indwell the men to make an army of super soldiers.

    You know, that didn't even occur to me!  It's an interesting thought--but even with Mannagiri's knack for micromanagement, I don't think he'd be able to control them well enough to trust them (leaving aside sexual jealousy).  If he did, they might be handy as infiltrators, due to men having generally greater rights and freedoms in this society.  For sheer firepower, of course, it's hard to beat a handmaiden.

      Trusting them is a fair point, but Ram is fairly dangerous which implies that they would be too.
      ```

        Dangerous is relative, though.  Ram has shown considerable power compared to an ordinary man; he's not quite Superman, but he can move faster and hit harder than any normal man, in addition to regenerating and absorbing ambient heat.  Plus he's resistant to white sun and corruption effects.  All very nice.

        However, Mannagiri already has an "army" of handmaidens, whom he is used to working with, and in terms of sheer military utility they leave the men in the shade.  An indwelt man is strong and fast.  An indwelt woman is a fully automatic rocket launcher with infinite ammunition, exquisite aim and a variety of payloads which can be swapped out with a thought.

        If you put an equivalent handmaiden in Ram's position for most combat challenges, she would likely do better.  Consider the moonchild ambush in 9.4.  Ram takes a tremendous beating and survives, taking them down first by throwing rocks and then by rushing to engage at close range.  Girl-Ram could blast the lot of them out of their saddles in seconds, at that distance from her fire.  Even against Manka the murrush in 11.4, Ram played a valuable role, but only delayed the beast (with Pimna's help).  Manka was finished off in the end by the other women returning and destroying his foothold.  Even before that, the attacking barques were destroyed by Pimna (with Shimrun using his senses to target).

        To be fair, I haven't stopped to elaborate all the differences between ens and handmaidens, so it's not clear from the text how many of Ram's powers are shared.  It's said or strongly implied that handmaidens also heal quickly, resist heat, and endure the white sun.  They cannot sense haranuu, and cannot become ensi.  I haven't said as much, but I don't think of them as being particularly strong or fast.

        Aaaand now that I've written this epic reply, let me thank you for reading and offering feedback.  I do depend on it, even if I argue with you.

          I agree with all your points. Given that, let me slide to an adjacent point. Why spend time and resources on having a militia? Why not just indwell a few more girls and have them be the military/police? That would have to be less expensive and more militarily powerful, the militias patrol duties seem only weakly needed due to the social forces at play. So why do they exist?

          As a side note: I'm here from your comment on the classified thread of the late SSC.

            Awesome!  The answer to your question is more complicated than you might expect, and ties into--oh, politics, religion, economics, you name it.  Appendix A of the print edition will be a detailed analysis of pyre society, including the full answer to that question.

            The quick/short version: indwelling more women would not save money.  Militia are poorly trained and equipped, recruited each year from the dregs of the middle class, and easily replaced.  Every handmaiden is indwelt at infancy and raised in the temple, and isn't really useful until the better part of a decade has passed at a bare minimum, during which time she is a continual expense and somewhat dangerous.  When she's grown, she's a member of the social elite and due special consideration, along with a fair share of creature comforts.

            Plus, it's just not necessary.  You don't need a handmaiden to subdue rioters or discourage pickpockets--they're not the best at nonlethal force, plus there'd be a considerable risk of collateral damage if they got excited--and it would be scandalous on a number of levels.  If they got a few more handmaidens, they'd be using them to improve economic efficiency, the same as their sisters.
