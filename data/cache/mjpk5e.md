  Glad we finally have levelling in this story again, the system was always the main driver of interest for me. I really hope we get to see level 25 and the legendary class unlocks relatively soon. Relatively.

  On a more meta note, I also look forward to seeing the hivemind opinion switch back in favor of delve, at least until levels stall again. I can already see it happening in this thread.

    Yeah, I think I'm going to try something I've never done yet with a webnovel; let the chapters build up a bit. 

    I've been starting to loose interest a bit, and recognize that as the same issue most people seem to have: the pacing, which should be solved by just picking it back up later. 

    > I also look forward to seeing the hivemind opinion switch back in favor of delve 

    I think its just that before it mattered, people didn't bother to respond to the "I don't like it, therefor not rational" comments, but now that the devs are actually considering removing it the ppl (like me) who would normally not say anything are actually saying something.

      For what it's worth, I read this chapter just to see if it was as bad as everyone says it is. Spoiler alert; it's really not. The most grating thing is the lack of leveling or anything to do with the system. I think the author really should've warned folk in advance that leveling was gonna be taking a backseat in this story in the later chapters. I mean....why would you make a LitRPG and not have leveling be the main focus?/ But other than that, the other complaints (cheesy memes, unrealistic decisions, etc) are no worse than other fics I've seen recommended here. If you don't care about the leveling, then IMO you don't even need to stop reading.

      If you're looking for stories that can balance leveling with good plot development, I would recommend Salvos and Threadbare. Particularly the latter, as Andrew Seiple (author) has a lot of sequels. I would read those quickly, as he plans to publish them and possibly remove them from his site in the future.

      It helps a lot. I've been saving up since chapel 130ish. It doesn't _fix_ the pacing issues but it makes them more tolerable.

  I tried doing some pre-production work on a Delve parody, thinking it would be as easy to do as it is with Worth The Candle. Very, very quickly... within three paragraphs... I realized this was not the case. I can't make it work. It's impossible (for me) to make something interesting and/or funny with the source material.

  There are various reasons for this that weren't obvious until I actively bumped into them:

  **The Skill System is Bad**

  "Bad" defined as "for facilitating  storytelling" and "for making an interesting game system".

  It's somewhat similar to Diablo 2's system, except every single skill point yields a new skill. The main character's aura trees are designed to obfuscate this - almost everything is a utility skill. Even his attack auras, Heating Unit+Air Conditioner, double as utility skills.

  But the illusion shatters once you consider what the optimal combatant skill sets look like - a fire magician would have around 10 active skills and 40 passive skills at level 50. It's not very interesting whether one kills monsters with fire, lasers, or an axe. Certainly not the multi-chapters worth of attention Rain does considering his multipliers.

  Another arguable issue with it, is only a few types of skills interact with the greater world. You don't have to study or go on an adventure to learn a spell, you just pick it up off a menu. The most important type of reward characters can get in this world, and they have all the weight and drama of going to wal-mart and buying a burrito for a buck o'five.

  You see some of the consequences for this in the official novel - you'll never have a hard list of all the skills in the skill trees (though it should exist and should be finite), you'll never have an in-depth character sheet of a high level side character's skill list. Which I think is kind of a shame - the guy who does *I Hate Being Wed In A Fantasy World* has these absurdly huge character sheets of all the main characters. They're a mess, but they're a beautiful mess and I love them.

  Additionally the skill bloat makes the individual importance of any single skill much less. Again, obfuscated (so far) by Auras having massive weaknesses, thus making it easy to make various "crucial" passive skills. But that can only work until they begin to scale into being good skills, after that point it's putting sprinkles on top of yogurt. This is why it's been so important to keep Rain from gaining levels - to give the skills he has a time to shine and matter, and to give the author time to figure out how he's going to make a complete ~50 skill long build where every skill matters.

  The MC's leveling cheat letting him hit any level cap immediately is also an issue. If he lifted his level cap by ~20 levels, he'd double his skill list within a few chapters (by Delve's reckoning) and become a completely different character where it concerns his powers.

  **The Core Characters Don't Have Unique Goals**

  Rain's core drive in life is to make as many friends as possible. A boring version of Michael Scott. In my own opinion, the worst aspect of the character isn't his drab bog standard liberalism (though it makes it impossible for **me** to write the guy. 'He passes out after two sips of a long island ice tea' and 'he wears ninja turtle pajamas for the whole story' were not a good start to my efforts).... it's that *the guy isn't horny enough*.

  I'm not saying he has to be thinking about boobs constantly, just that he'd be a little more human if he had a pulse. The guy is chaste to a cartoonish degree, and I'm not just complaining that he wouldn't hold the horny stance samurai girl's hand or explore if he was deer-sexual when he lived with a deer for months on end - it's about any kind of *desire*.

  He has two of them. Make friends, and maximize the power of his aura skills through math. The text says he wants to snuggle with Ameliah, but I don't buy it.

  The two other main characters, Lonely Girl and Lonely Deer, are basically the same person as Rain. This makes the core cast... not optimal for doing zany or new things. Make them sit around a campfire and eat potato soup together, and they're 100% happy with the universe.

  They could really use a pernicious god giving them quests by edicts from on high, or something.

  **In Conclusion, It's A Rather Rigid World**

  About any idea I could come up with would be 10,000 times better with a custom setting, instead of being fanfiction. Rain goes into the sewers to kill slimes, screws up, and somehow causes the monsters in there to become The Blob, which wipes out the town? Maybe viable for around 12 pages. Change the idea to an MC who wants to feed everyone and everything to his "slime girlfriend" (the slime isn't a monster girl, it's just a slime. The MC is just a sicko.)? That's an obvious ~200 page horror story right there.

  Rain without auras and trying to stretch them out for as many manhattans as he can isn't Rain. Changing anything important and keeping it still be recognizable as Delve is really, really hard.

  If you want to write something like Delve, you're much better off making your own dungeon diving and/or tribe-building story.

    I agree deeply about the system the author wrote himself into a corner with the magic system. he has tried patching it with katas for martial classes and syncronization with the stats but i think is fundamentally flawed for storytelling purposes
    ```

    - u/Veedrac:
      ```
      Mentally I've got Delve categorized as ‘rationalist but not rational’. It feels like a story where the author is trying to walk through the fundamentals behind Rain's decisions, particularly with the open book formula and explicit math, but they've run into a wall where the setting isn't actually robust enough to handle what the author wants to be doing. So it ends up in a compromised position where on the one hand they're trying to be true to the intent of the story, and on the other hand they're trying to paper over the variety of holes they don't want to take over the setting.

    Though I would expect that only a tiny, tiny number of people have the opportunity to map out an optimal skill set. Nobody's sharing information, and the ability to view the skills on offer for various trees is locked behind an EXP gate that nobody outside of Rain's Dynamo build can afford to open.

    Most, I expect, would just take whatever skills are in the next tier of the tree they've already unlocked, active passive or otherwise. So the average level 50 fire mage (in as much as there can be said to be one when most people top out before 20) probably has every variation of 'shoot fire at enemy' skill topped out even if they're largely redundant with one another.

  It's probably fortunate for Val that he's never been able to beat Rain's detection. He'd inevitably have tried tagging along invisibly behind the group to tag the blue, and ended up getting ganked.

  - u/poequestioner2:
    ```
    Val's invisibility is sadly no where near his father's level. It only works on eye sight, nothing else. Mana detects him. Divination detects him. Sound detection works. Smell probably works. I'm personally curious if he's detectable with heat.
    ```

  I feel like Delve would benefit from a thread once a month to discuss recent developments; it doesn't really progress far enough in a week and that leads to issues. Then again, the patreon gating is another problem which effectively divides the readers in two, and worse, means many of the readers apt to defend Delve instead of attack it are kind of segregated off from the main discussion by weight of foreknowledge.

  In some ways, I've enjoyed the Delve threads because it undeniably dances on the line of what this sub considers acceptable, and seeing meta-fights about its acceptability and its rising and falling fortunes of this each week is an amusing minigame. It's kept fresh by Delve's neurotic tendency to jump between perspective and the extremely inconsistent quality this tends to produce week to week, but I can understand how patience with it is running thin.

  As a third point, I used to like discussing Delve on its own Discord, but then that got phone-ID gated and I ditched it. So there might be something of a low-effort-commenter refugee community from that alone.

  ```
  I've kind of drifted away from Delve, which I'm guessing puts me in the same category as others in this subreddit whom I'm guessing also don't read it, and want to see these posts removed. I don't know, maybe there are some that are hate-reading, then hate-posting?

  Anyway, with much respect to /u/alexanderwales, and the tough and often thankless job of moderating that you do, I think that at least some of the reasoning at play behind the consideration to remove Delve posts needs to be examined.

  "High" frequency of chapters is overstated. Judging by the topics, Delve continues to update once each week. Other works are not being rapidly buried under new Delve topics. Arguments to remove this story are from a purity of forum perspective - not from usability. Rationality is something subjective, and I certainly had the impression there was a degree of it present in the story concept.

  The upvote ratio is a net positive, which I take as evidence that there is considerable interest in the story on this forum, this despite a significant minority of forum-readers that downvote the updates. It seems entirely reasonable to me that those who dislike the story can skip by it, and otherwise continue to use the subreddit unimpeded, just as I do these days. Well, mostly.

  Months past, when I was regularly reading the story and posting to the threads, I found it very difficult to enjoyably discuss the work due to the avalanche of negativity present in the discussion threads. Note that the main thread itself tends to have a positive score in the double digits. If those who still enjoy the story are not commenting due to a perception of hostility - as I was - you end up with a handful of low effort threads mixed in with complaints.

  I'd ask that those who dislike Delve have some consideration for those who do. There are plenty of other things to chat about, explore, enjoy, and share in this subreddit. If Delve comes up as a recommendation, of course de-recommend it as appropriate. But ***please*** \- let others who want to discuss the story - especially rational aspects of it - have their space here, too.
