  Often it works by emphasising what it is that the characters do care about. To take a TV example, the central characters of HBO’s Rome are all slave owners and rapists. But what is emphasised is their own values around honor and duty. E.g. There’s a major conflict where someone kills a slave, because he didn’t ask the owners permission, and its made very clear how big a deal this kind of violating of the property of another citizen is. A character in that setting might agree in some abstract way that the death of a slave is morally bad, but it doesn’t compare to more important things.

    Yeah I think this is one of the easiest ways for a reader to grok the value dissonances. Humans are social creatures, and they pick up on what matters in a social context. Show an example of a moral decision, then show people's reaction to that moral decision. Basically show a culture war item in context of the current culture. If such an item would not be fought over, then you'll have to do a ton of exposition to cover the ground that social context would provide.

    I think rape is a bad example for the story to get into, because it seems mostly like a dead item to the relevant participants.

    I think EY might have been able to make a more interesting example from abortion and reproductive rights. Especially since it would have been far more relevant to the alien baby-eating happening in the story.

    Some scenarios off the top of my head:

    1. Someone gets a hold of the DNA of the [British Royal Family/Famous celebrity/or just plain old ex lover]. They proceed to create stem cells from the DNA, and then egg/sperm cells from the stem cells. Then they mix their own egg/sperm cells to create viable embryos. Original DNA holder doesn't want lots of their offsping coming from rando person. Debate happens while the offspring is [embryo/fetus/baby/child].
    2. Someone uplifts lions to an intelligent species. Lions have painful sex. Should they correct for the painful sex? They want to make further genetic edits to correct for the painful sex, but the already uplifted lions don't want them to.
    3. Someone starts vat growing a bunch of clones of them-self in a haphazard way. Causing some clones to die painful deaths. Technically they are just inflicting harm on alternate versions of themselves. All surviving clones don't care about the practice.

    Take that scenario and have the different characters have a sort of culture war fight over the appropriate response. If you are dead set on having a fictional world with legalized rape, then have one of the characters casually drop it as an argument. Like in the first scenario "Yeah the royal prince even tried to have the DNA thief tried under the ancient rape laws. Which caused them to get rid of the laws altogether since they were so antiquated." The rape laws are clearly gone because actual rape is just no longer a crime. Which I think conveys the whole point EY was trying to make.

      But all of these you can see both sides for.

      Isn't the point that past people would never recognise a justification for gay marriage as reasonable?

      The same way we'd never see any justification for rape as reasonable. Isn't the whole point that they rebelled because it is was unjustifiable? Maybe the reason is to be exciting on a date and for us that's not remotely acceptable
      ```

      - u/cjet79:

        If you want to demonstrate something is really far beyond the range of acceptability, then just show where current acceptability is, and make it clear that its a spectrum.

        <-----A------B-----C--|--D---->

        A = thing you want to demonstrate is super unacceptable.

        C and D = "reasonable" position on either side of the issue (reasonable according to the society you are exploring)

        B = position that D claims holders of position C espouse, in order to smear position C.

        You could probably just change out the words on some of the culture war posts from TheMotte in order to get this exact scenario. If you write it well enough using social ques, most readers will wholeheartedly accept these positions as dogma within the story, and they have no trouble understanding that A is just not what reasonable people believe.

        If you watch game of thrones (I dont watch it, so maybe i got this wrong), there is a scene I heard about at the end of the series where someone basically proposes democracy as a form of government and he gets laughed at. As far as I can tell, most viewers understood why he was laughed at. There were different shades of monarchists representing C and D, and this guy proposes viewpoint A/B.

  Honestly while I understand why it puts people off, I rather think the *point* of the passage in 3WC was to be unappealing. We are after all in that generation that, in the book, "thought the future had gone wrong". That's us. We think it's insane, and that's the goddamn point. The choices of the future generations are as mystifying to us as they are to those of our fictional counterparts. 

  Making it appealing or understandable would just turn it into another sci-fi Hope For The Future, which as the OP notes is not the intent. Justifying it would demystify it, and would make the decisions of the future generations Reasonable And Understandable, instead of Horrifying And Unfathomable.

  The past is a foreign country, and we are the barbarians who can't grok the future world.

    I think that is the point of "good" values dissonance, which Ozy is trying to point you to - all that work on seeing their perspective isn't to convince you of it, but to understand and experience the alien mindset.

    &#x200B;

    While in Threes Worlds Collide (which is overall a fine story), when I read this passage my emotional reaction was "woosh EY you really bungled the attempt on this here". Took me right out of the story due to its poor execution. I got "the point", but I didnt feel it at all the way good narrative does.

      I'd argue that if you can understand and experience the mindset it's insufficiently alien to you.

        Art is made with the intention that it will be consumed. If this is not universally the case then it is at least the case for art which has been posted on a public website with a comments section. 

        Some works of art, though they may not be "incomprehensible to the human mind" levels of *alien*, are still strange enough that they give me a sense of alienness without being apparently orderless and baseless. If the art is meant to give me a sense of the alien, then these cases are superior to works which may be objectively more alien but are also so incomprehensible that they cannot be grasped at all. 

        (And this is assuming that "alien" really does, in this context, mean "fundamentally incomprehensible" rather than "*presently* incomprehensible". Given that these are biological humans whose *culture* is the primary source of difference from us, it can't be anything but a failure that EY was able to make the doctrine of the superhappies, and even the doctrine of the baby-eaters, more understandable to me than the mindset behind "Rape is legal now").

          Oh have I got some Art for you. Starting with two of the most unoriginal and lazy links I could provide:

        I imagine this is definitional - what we mean by "understand" and "alien". I think its probably right to invoke Wittgenstein on this one, we wont bridge the gap.

  My reaction to the specific example had a couple levels to it.

  1: Wait, what?  Those people are evil.

  2: Ugh.  EY fell into the trope of using "rape" as a genetic evil.  Lazy.

  3: EY should have used something less cheap & shocking.  Like them being ultra-pro-gay rights.

  4: Wait.  Ultra gay rights isn't actually repugnant to me.  It's just "my tribe, but more!" That's shocking to my out group

  5: thinking about it, I can't come up with any good things that (1) fictional people could be for (2) would be more repugnant to me than my outgroup and (3) don't come off as cheap.

  And that's kind of where I left off.  And it annoys me, because now that I'm looking for it, I can't help notice how edgy characters have the same few "Morally Acceptable Vices"

  Like, Gregory House is a misanthrope.  And that OK because he hates everyone.  But if the writers made him racist towards some specific group, he'd be stop being an antihero and just comd off as bad.

  And now that I've noticed this, it has really undermined certain classes of fiction.  Now if feels like authors are trying to create the impression of iconoclasm, while walking very very carefully past the things that my tribe actually holds sacred

    Well SOMEONE got the point.

    \>  thinking about it, I can't come up with any good things that (1) fictional people could be for (2) would be more repugnant to me than my outgroup and (3) don't come off as cheap.

    And someone USED the point.

    And someone RETAINED the point.

    Institutionalised pederasty has been practiced pretty widely historically, so I don't think I'd consider it "cheap", and it's also pretty opposed to modern values.

      And if EY had used that he'd have gotten comments far worse than accusations of drab unoriginality or ignorance of the realities of trauma.

    >They didn't legalize rape, they abolished it so thoroughly that they didn't see any reason to have a law against nonconsensual sex!

    They might not be exposed to suffering or trauma, as you say, but that does not mean that abolished rape laws because rape never happened.

    >I can't imagine how boring your sex lives must have been up until then - flirting with a woman, teasing her, leading her on, knowing the whole time that you were perfectly safe because she couldn't take matters into her own hands if you went a little too far

    It's explicitly in the text that if you lead someone on for too long, they might decide to have sex with you whether you want it or not, and it's justly comeuppance for a social gaffe
    ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:

      Honestly though, if violence, traumas and mental damage are impossible, what makes rape worse than, say, getting hit by a snowball? The only thing I can think of is that rape takes time and you might have had other priorities. That said, when I first read the relevant section in 3WC I assumed that assault, battery and unlawful imprisonment were all still illegal, so the only legal rape would be that where no one actively tries to escape and does so unsuccessfully for more than a few seconds.

  Values Dissonance is hard to write. The writer may want this group to push the Overton Window for plot reasons but going too far would make them too detestable in the eyes of most viewers and beyond their ability to stomach (and continue reading). A book that nobody reads is worthless.

  Rape is one of them extremely sensitive tropes that is almost impossible to rationalise at all, in modern society it's often judged to be worse than murder. I mean, a society of murderous cannibals (e.g. Orks from 40k) would look better to most readers. Worth the Candle has corpse fuckers and that turns people off less than rape in that story. It's a subject even "edgy" stand-up artists (e.g. George Carlin) avoids for the most part, and Carlin is famous for his opposition to obscenity laws.

  Hell, for /r/rimworld where people joke about turning prisoners into leather hats and unwilling organ donors, a subreddit that is loudly proud to be banned alongside the Crusader Kings series and Dwarf Fortress in /r/nocontext for being "too easy", the subject of rape is still somewhat sensitive.
