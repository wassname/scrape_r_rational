  Incredibly strong final chapter of this incredibly long first arc of the story!

  &#x200B;

  I just wish the fight between Red and Blue had been a bit more balanced, since Blue's arguments felt quite weak and irrational in comparison to Red's. If for example he had claimed that Red could have made a difference by joining the group, thus at the very least potentially mitigating the tragedy, then it would have been much more impactful. 

  As things stand now, Blue's being clearly irrational and blinded by his "heroic trainer" persona: his argument basically amounts to a deontological grandstanding of heroic virtue signaling. While I don't think it's out of character for him to make such an argument, I think it would make for a much more compelling and deep-rooted inter-personal conflict if only he had thought into it a bit more and came up with more reasonable and convincing arguments on top of it. That way, Leaf would be stuck in the middle as opposed to clearly leaning on Red's side (as any reasonable person would).

  Of course, perhaps this is all part of the author's plan in order to set-up some future developments so..we shall see! I cannot wait for the next chapter, hope you will surprise us again with a mid-month treat (hopefully a bit less of a tragic one this time around!)

  P.S. That final scene with all the gym leaders greeting a nervous and slightly star-struck Red was pretty funny and awesome.

    Actually funny - I read this chapter as Leaf being on Blue's side! Not in his approach surely and is more understanding, but she seems equally upset over his decision to not go in.  It might help with the perception of balance, if others see it similarly.
    ```

    - u/Golden_Magician:
      ```
      I think it's a fair reading, but after hearing their arguments she seems to be intent on consoling and reassuring Red. In particular, she clearly asks Blue to tell Red it's not his fault. But you may be right in claiming that she might be more undecided than I thought on first reading.
      ```

      - u/Memes_Of_Production:
        ```
        Oh yeah, once Blue attacks she is for sure not about that life. But when she first hears, her internal narrative is very much "how could you? maybe it was the pressure affecting your judgement" etc. I think she evolves a bit during the conversation, but if you were to ask her at this moment if she wished Red chose differently, I think she would say yes.
        ```

      - u/Croktopus:
        ```
        she definitely seems undecided to me - it seemed like her desire to have blue say it wasn't his fault was more rooted in sympathy and not wanting aiko's death to tear them apart than a calculation of actual fault
        ```

    - u/personalensing:
      ```
      Leaf didn't strike me as upset or disappointed in Red when he first told her about his decision. It seems it's more of a clash between her image of Red built upon their night in the storm and his decisions then and the reality of him now and his decision when it came to Aiko. Leaf is looking for what changed between his time with her and his time with Aiko. She expected him to follow Aiko, but that doesn't necessarily mean that she also wanted him to. She was quick to take Red's side when Blue started accusing him, so I too think she was clearly leaning on Red's side overall.
      ```

      - u/Memes_Of_Production:
        ```
        Up to the reader of course, its just not how I see it! here, let me re-look at the text...

        Ok, so here is her first reaction: 
        >She stares at him, unable to understand what he's saying for a moment, then unable to to accept it. "You didn't… no, Red, you risked yourself to save strangers, you don't… how could you not…" 

        I think "how could you not" has to imply some level of condemnation there, some level of moral disapproval. And later on she tries to make excuses, but they feel like excuses - like she is saying he made a mistake.

        And during the Blue fight, we have moments like these:
        > "Would you have done different?" Blue asks, eyes piercing her. "Be honest, Leaf. For her, for him, for me. Would you have stayed outside?" Leaf's throat locks. She can't know what she would have done... she could say that, could try to stand up for Red, but... ' 

        Here she even thinks about how she could support Red, but she cant honestly say it - she herself wouldnt do it (so she thinks). 

        I am not saying she hates Red or anything, and I really hope she comes around to understanding his viewpoint (actually I am super worried about that, given how much connecting they did during their fight in the city, for that all to be washed away - it would seem so unfair. Though I also ship em heavily, that adds to the worries!). But right now, though she wants to support him and doesnt hate him,  I think the text says that she, from a moral standpoint, is closer to Blue than Red by a good margin.
        ```

        - u/personalensing:
          ```
          You may be right, of course, but the text just reads differently to me. It's funny how we all read the same text and yet come to such different conclusions.

          I worry too about their relationship, as I loved to see it evolve during the story. I find it amusing how I thought of most of Red's worries when he decided against going to learn from Sabrina on the cruise as unfounded, and yet now, when they seem to ring truer than ever, he is ignoring them. Even so, I think they will be alright in the long run. After all, even if your interpretation or mine is true, they separated on what looks like good terms and I don't think the connection they formed during the storm will be washed away so easily. I may be a little too optimistic here.
          ```

          - u/Memes_Of_Production:
            ```
            Yeah, thats totally fair - language, particularly emotional language, is funny that way. And Leaf certainly also thinks blue is a huge asshole right now, complicating things. 

            I have the same thought re: Sabrina - before him choosing not to go was a mistake, his relationship with Blue and Leaf was going to be fine! He cant let opportunities pass because of friends (or really, infatuation if we are being honest), and he can see them on weekends and itll all be fine. Now, even though it may still be smart, he has all these damaged relationships that he is leaving behind. 

            On the Leaf relationship being "washed away", maybe I am bringing in some meta-instincts here - this chapter was the end of part 1! But red and leaf had a lot of conversations they wanted to have and havent yet - their whole Aiko convo was hugely derailed by Blue, Leaf had intended to apologize/discuss the cruise and hasnt, etc. Since its the end of Part 1, however, I feel like its unlikely we will go *back* to those topics, if red and leaf have another heart to heart on Part 1 topics, it would still be in that section. Thus my fear! Hopefully I am wrong on the subject.
            ```

            - u/personalensing:
              ```
              You are probably right that we won't have a conversation about what happened on the cruise now that Part I is over. Which is a shame because I was looking forward to that. And it would have helped them understand each other better. Which, again, I would have liked to see happen.

              On the other hand, I feel like some of those issues were at least addressed this chapter. When Leaf was dealing with her feelings about the consequences of Zapdos' storm, she remembered some of Red's views and seemed to understand his perspective better than before and even agree with him someway. As a result, she empathizes with him a lot more than she used to. I think that's one of the reasons she grew angry at Blue when he refused to absolve Red of the blame for Aiko's decision. She understood what Red was going through, how hard it was for him, how much he blamed himself because she knows him now better than she ever did. So, she tried to help him and have Blue help him too. 

              So, while the situation is far from perfect, I think it's a improvement, however small, on how it was when they left the cruise. Of course, a heart to heart conversation would been welcome in this situation, but with Blue and everything that happened, I guess it just wasn't possible. We will have to wait and hope for the best.
              ```

              - u/Memes_Of_Production:
                ```
                General agreement, with the added caveat of if you view Leaf as having more conflicting feelings on Red, as I do, how much they have improved is dubious. But we certainly shall see, wont be the last time Red and Leaf talk, for sure!
                ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Just punched it up a bit to make it more clear, but Blue's perspective actually was that Red might have saved her:

    >"You didn't know that ahead of time, you're saying it now, after the fact!"

    Once Red sticks to his guns about it being suicidal, Blue insists that his decision making process is being determined by too much risk aversion; this time it may or may not have been suicide, but next time he may make the same call and let his team mates die rather than risk himself.

    Glad you enjoyed the chapter!
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      >"You didn't know that ahead of time, you're saying it now, after the fact!"

      Proving your rightness through hindsight is how Blue won all those Objections, isn't it?

      And meanwhile, Blue is considering how to stop his grandfather from doing something *actually* heroic, saving lives at the cost of his own, not just throwing a life away. You can't have it both ways. If it would be right for Professor Oak to stay home next time, then it was much more right for Red to stay out of the burning building. If it would be wrong, if it's worth Professor Oak potentially sacrificing himself for a good chance of saving others, then Blue's plans are purely selfish (I might even say "cowardly").
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        True, though Blue's concern for his grandfather has a lot to do with his exposure to the Pressure, which is kind of a predictable, absolute debilitation, and his own role in that. Oak would in fact not go into the storm if not for Blue being there.
        ```

        - u/Memes_Of_Production:
          ```
          I also read the Blue/Oak section as Blue both wanting his grandfather to not risk himself, and also being super-moved by his emotional commitment. Blue has his practical side, but also highly values the love on display there, and if the situation was reversed Blue would want himself to be doing pretty close to what his grandfather is doing - he has two minds on the issue, like most do, and at times one side comes out. Thats how I read your intent in pairing that opening with the conclusion, at least!
          ```

          - u/thrawnca:
            ```
            I'm fine with Blue having two minds on the subject, but he then needs to apologise to Red for taking that out on him. If Blue ever wants to be an effective leader, he needs to be aware of when his judgement is compromised by emotion, and actually take Leaf's suggestion that this isn't the best time to be discussing it.
            ```

            - u/Memes_Of_Production:
              ```
              Oh I dont think any reader here believes that Blue doesnt owe Red a huge apology for how he acted! Though I wouldnt expect one soon - Blue isnt going to admit to any hypocrisy until he is faced with some very similar choices, is my bet. Will see of course.
              ```

    - u/MilesSand:
      ```
      Could Red have saved her though? I don't think he had any ground types to dig their way out with, or steel beams in his pocket box to  prevent the collapse
      ```

      - u/elysian_field_day:
        ```
        don't think so, really. maybe teleport them out as shit starts coming out using abras, or something, but even that feels like quite a stretch. Blue is in the wrong here, and while that sort of thing is easier to decide in hindsight, knowing what happened, he wasn't there, doesn't  know the extent of the situation, so he is essentially just venting there. Understandable, in my opinion but not helping.
        ```

        - u/RynnisOne:
          ```
          It's 'understandable', but foolish.  He doesn't *care* to find out what the truth is, he simply goes on the attack because he is hurt.

          This is **NOT** the way to be the new Supreme Hero.
          ```

        - u/MilesSand:
          ```
          Teleport doesn't work from indoors, or was mechanic removed in the story?  In the games you'd use dig to leave buildings.
          ```

          - u/RynnisOne:
            ```
            Believe we have Word of God (ie: the writer) that no, Teleport does *not* work in buildings.  Even then, you have to be ready to react, and Abra only sense threats from living creatures by touching their minds.  Environment hazards can still catch them off guard as well as they would a person.
            ```

            - u/elysian_field_day:
              ```
              that also raises the rather metaphysical question at what point collapsing building is no longer considered indoors :D

              &#x200B;

              Rules lawyering aside, though, yeah, Red doesn't really have the means to save people in a collapsing building. \*Maybe\* when he gets a charizard, he could potentially do some Search&Rescue from above, but in this situation? He'd be just as dead as the other two.
              ```

            - u/zeekaran:
              ```
              > Teleport does not work in buildings.

              I was pretty certain that you could teleport out of buildings (the Renegade was about to) but you can't teleport *into* buildings which is why the telepads are on rooftops. It seemed Surge's brothers in arms were also teleporting out of buildings (and helicopters).
              ```

        - u/nipplelightpride:
          ```
          It sounds like he detected an Onyx heading to the area before the collapse, he might have given them a very slight forewarning. But you can't teleport out from inside a building, so I'm not sure how much that would have actually helped.
          ```

  - u/fishingforsalt:
    ```
    Honestly I think Blue's reaction is pretty realistically unreasonable: just logically sound enough for him to curl into his ideology and defend it with gnashing teeth, especially when driven by such a heavy loss.

    I'd also like to point out Red very quickly abandons trying to persuade Blue and instead tries to make him feel as bad as possible, such as Red shifting the responsibility of Aiko's death on Blue's contagious attitude, which isn't very "rational".
    ```

    - u/Revlar:
      ```
      It's pretty clear from Red final look back at Leaf that he's using this as his exit from the group and hoping inertia will keep him from looking back with regret as he pursues what he rationally believes to be more important.
      ```

    - u/RynnisOne:
      ```
      He stops trying to persuade because he realizes it won't work.  Blue has made up his mind and is lashing out, there's no convincing him of another point of view.
      ```

      - u/fishingforsalt:
        ```
        I don't disagree but antagonizing him when he knows Blue is equally distraught is not a paradigm of rationality.  I'm just arguing Red wasn't perfectly justified in his behavior, but that doesn't mean I don't sympathize or understand how he's reacting.
        ```

  - u/Llihr:
    ```
    AS a rationalist of course you don't see blue's response as a reasonable thing, you see irrationality of that caliber and shy away. Most people aren't rationalist- the desire to save a friend or die trying is a root emotion in a lot of people, its an emotional hammer strong enough to break mountains. To you blues argument was faulty- it is, its not logical, but emotions rarely are. It might be a lacking in us that we see blue as being unreasonable when in the face of the majority they'd agree with him, i believe.
    ```

    - u/Memes_Of_Production:
      ```
      I think we should be more charitable to Blue - emotionally we are also biased by how much of a complete asshole he is being! But (and I am repeating myself here, my apologies) if you are going to have the goal of "be a super strong combat team that beats gods", then you are certainly going to enter situations that look very close to suicidal. Combat teams need to have each others backs at critical moments, a mutual willingness to die for each other makes the whole team stronger and ironically more likely to survive.

      &#x200B;

      That of course doesn't mean you should follow them into dumb suicide decisions! There is no one rule to follow here, you have to just...be correct. That's hard to accept, you have to just \*be right\*, and trust each other that they made the right call sometimes even when its hard.
      ```

      - u/Golden_Magician:
        ```
        Of course, but part of being a good leader is also being able to assess when to commit and when to back down. I'm sure that coming to terms with this aspect of leadership is going to be part of Blue's character arc in the future.
        ```

        - u/Memes_Of_Production:
          ```
          Oh I agree - that was what my second part was pointing to. To be clear, I am with Red that he shouldn't have run into the building. I just think we shouldnt frame Blue as the "irrational" one - he has a different framework and career path, and it demands different things. He has a valuable perspective, when he isnt being a complete arse about it of course.
          ```

          - u/Golden_Magician:
            ```
            That's right! I also believe that Blue has a valuable and interesting perspective, which is indeed why I wish his arguments were a bit less irrational/toxic, in order to create a more balanced ideological conflict.
            ```

      - u/Trips-Over-Tail:
        ```
        Suicidal odds are fine if there is actually a chance of doing some good. Red, and Aiko, for that matter, had nothing that would allow them to clear the rubble that was trapping the people inside, nor a way to shore up the rubble if the building collapses upon them. It's the same reason that civilians are discouraged from running into burning buildings to rescue people: it's dangerous even with the right training and equipment, without it you're more likely to require rescuing yourself, provided that you survive at all.

        Blue kicking Red's ass for his decision is like reprimanding an unarmed ten-year-old student for not even trying to restrain and disarm an adult school shooter.

        Red would gladly give his live if it meant a reasonable chance of saving others, and he took that risk many times that night. Blue thinks he should gladly give his life even when the chances of doing good are absurdly slim.
        ```

        - u/Memes_Of_Production:
          ```
          I agree with all this in an on-the-ground decision - I think the key thing to remember is that Blue wasnt there, and knows none of these details! Blue will say "then you should have died!!" but he doesnt actually mean that, he thinks, really, that Red could have Been A Hero, he should have taken the risk of dying. Friends choose to die for each other, because by being willing to die you become strong enough to save each other and avoid that fate.

          Blue also has faith in Aiko - that she would only have gone if it was possible to win. He didnt know how the pressure affected her and subtly twisted her priorities. Also Blue just saw his Gramps risk his life for him in the same suicidal way and is super-moved, and also never really had his own hero moment while Red did and *botched it* and he is angry and weirdly jealous. Blue has a lot going on right now!
          ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      It's not just that Blue is being unreasonable. He's being hypocritical. He wishes his grandfather had acted more like Red, and is in fact trying to work out a way to bring that about, even though Professor Oak had much more reason to enter the fray than Red did; he actually saved lives, and didn't as yet die. If Red is a coward for refusing to pointlessly commit suicide, then Blue is doubly so for wanting to take away someone else's choices and stop them from making a *meaningful* sacrifice.

      Edit: And rereading, Blue was doubly hypocritical, because Red stated that he should have lied to stop someone from sacrificing themselves, and Blue attacked him for it: "You would have condemned them all to death, just to save two lives?" Yet Blue would be willing to lie, and condemn a lot of people to death, to save just one life.
      ```

      - u/Revlar:
        ```
        In this case I'd shy away from claiming it's hypocrisy, when all those signs also point to a more narratively impactful inner motivation: Blue is just coming off the emotional high of seeing his grandfather prove to him that he's the ideal trainer, the hero he looks up to who never backs down when it matters, and now Blue's holding Red up to that standard because he has an inferiority complex himself.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          > Blue is just coming off the emotional high of seeing his grandfather prove to him that he's the ideal trainer, the hero he looks up to who never backs down when it matters, and now Blue's holding Red up to that standard

          But it wasn't his admiration for his grandfather that I was referring to. Blue's actual reaction:

          > Blue stares in horror. "No, that's… why would you... You can't *do* that!" His voice is rising as his heart pounds, guilt and indignation warring within him. "Why didn't you *tell* me, it's bad enough you risked your life, but this is… You can't just throw your life away, the world *needs* you—"

          And then he starts making plans to deceive his grandfather next time:

          > Blue doesn't respond, simply holding his hand tight as his mind races to find a workaround. Zapdos came to him, this time, but if he decides to go into another Stormbringer attack… He would have to disable the tracking on his equipment first… no that would just tip Gramps off. He'd have to leave all his trackable equipment elsewhere, and his companions' too. But what if he calls…

          And then he tears strips off Red for being cautious and sensible, for *not* throwing his life away, and for enabling someone's heroic-but-futile self-sacrifice through honesty. It's understandable, but it is about as unambiguously hypocritical as it can get.
          ```

    - u/Golden_Magician:
      ```
      Fair points! However, my main criticism is that Blue's argument could have easily been more reasonable, while not losing any of this "emotional hammer" aspect of it. 

      &#x200B;

      If a friend jumped into a volcano without any highly trained ice pokemon, would it be considered cowardly not to follow them?

      &#x200B;

      Red's argument is that there's nothing he could've done anyways except for lying, so he tried and failed to convince Aiko to stay out. Blue retorts by saying "then you should've died!" which I'm sure even non rationalists would argue against. What if he instead replied something like "Sure you might have died too, but you might also have saved them! Didn't you think of that, Red?"
      ```

      - u/shankarsivarajan:
        ```
        Yes, it *would* be considered cowardly.

        - u/RynnisOne:

          Only by fools.

          Everyone else would call it sensible to not follow them.

            Would you consider deserters cowards? If you don't, you've got to admit your definition is idiosyncratic at best. If you do, why is it any different?

            Cowardice is often sensible.
            ```

            - u/thrawnca:
              ```
              Deserters are disobeying the orders of those who have the responsibility to decide what is best. If Jack had ordered Red to enter the building, on his authority as Gym Second, I expect that Red would have protested the danger, but ultimately obeyed. Jack didn't give that order, because he knew it wasn't necessarily best. So Red doesn't qualify as a deserter. He was being smart. Jack acknowledged that and authorised it.
              ```

              - u/shankarsivarajan:
                ```
                I'm not saying he is. I'm asking when risk-avoidance counts as cowardice.
                ```

                - u/thrawnca:
                  ```
                  > I'm asking when risk-avoidance counts as cowardice.

                  No, that's not all you said. You equated cowardice with desertion. I quote, "If you do [consider deserters cowards], why is it any different?" And I answered that, drawing a distinction around desertion, which is specifically about disobeying lawful authority. It's a subset of cowardice.

                  Interestingly enough, people often talk about courage as the ability to overcome fear to get a job done, but dictionary.reference.com doesn't think so; it suggests that courage is about facing something *without* fear, and it defines cowardice in terms of a lack of courage. By those dictionary definitions, I'd agree with you that "Cowardice is often sensible." Fear has an important role in our lives. On the other hand, if we use the Hollywood definition of courage, then I suppose that cowardice is about the failure to do what needs to be done due to fear, which answers your question about risk avoidance.
                  ```

                  - u/shankarsivarajan:
                    ```
                    Again, I am not saying Red is a deserter. I understand he isn't "disobeying lawful authority." But you *have* answered my question: you believe desertion *is* cowardice. I agree.

                    Now I *am* equating your regiment marching into a hopeless battle with your "friend jump\[ing\] into a volcano without any highly trained ice pokemon." I consider refusing to join them/him perfectly reasonable risk-avoidance. I'm aware that refusing to join the former is desertion. I see no paradox.

                    Appeals to dictionaries kind of miss the point. You think of cowardice as some kind of moral failing, from what I glean from your comments. I don't. And I definitely don't view disobeying orders that would lead to one's death, "lawful authority" be damned, as a moral failing. Cowardice? Almost certainly. Valuing one's life typically necessitates it.

                      Actually, I was pointing out that the dictionary definition doesn't seem to agree with common usage. If you "feel the fear and do it anyway" then most people would call that "courage" but dictionary.com does not. Which is curious.

              Choosing not to do something dangerous because it's not worth it is sensible.

              Being afraid of taking a risk and avoiding it because of that is cowardice.

      I think you're overestimating how willing the majority of people are to risk themselves. Red and Blue and Leaf are *all* more willing to risk themselves than average, and Blue and Leaf are *way* more willing to blame others for not risking themselves than most people. 

      Most people would accept that another person  did not risk themselves to save another for no other reason than that they didn't want to (E.g. a bone marrow or kidney donation), no risk calculus necessary.

    I feel that our judgement of whose argument is stronger is heavily biased by hindsight. Red doesn't to my knowledge know anything about structural integrity and making the decision to stay out of the building frankly seemed weird to me, especially when an authority figure is heading inside. 

    I think that Red's case looks stronger because of what actually ended up happening but if Aiko and the Second had died to pokemon attacks inside the building instead the story would have been different. I feel that Blue's perspective is valid.

      I dont need to be an architect to know a burning building is unsafe. Especially eithout much extra support.

      What could Red have contributed? At best he was a pair of hands.

      I remember looking at that before knowing what happened and thinking Red made the right choice. Several times before, people ignored burning or damaged buildings. They focused on staying in the open.

      Collapse was a strong risk. And there were no plans set up for id it collapsed. No survival scenario.

  Anyway, wow! Holy shit, that was intense! I expected an argument between Blue and Red, but that got really personal really quickly. Red just immediately went for the offense, which is to be expected because I'm sure he already feels guilty. LOVED Leaf this chapter, she's really improving from the person she was just a few chapters ago.

  Remember how a year ago we were all expecting Leaf and Red to be drowning or something because of the ominous chapter 55 ending of "I'm sure they're having a fun, peaceful cruise" and how surprised we were when they were *actually* having a fun, peaceful cruise? I remember being almost a little disappointed that after a month of theorizing about what shitshow could be happening on the boat, it was all just speculation. Turns out I just had to wait about a year for said shitshow. Woohoo! 

  Also. Really? You name the chapter we met Aiko in "Premortem" and the one where she dies "Postmortem"? Clever, but also cruel! :'(

  Blue can go fuck himself. Admitting mistakes are for when you realize you could've made superior decisions, and gotten better outcomes. Not for when you realize that you could've also leapt into the burning building and died alongside with your friends like a true hero would. He's so angry that only one of his friends died instead of two. 

  EDIT: I do very strongly think that Blue is mainly talking out of his grief for Aiko. He's looking at the person who is both still alive and who was most closely related to her death, and blaming him for not doing enough. But it is manifesting in terms of his heroic persona, where Aiko did the definitely right thing of trying to save lives, and the cowardly Red made a mistake and didn't go in with her. It doesn't matter that the results would be worse.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    "Admitting mistakes are for when you realize you could've made superior decisions, and gotten better outcomes."

    Perhaps Blue should hand in all those Objections, if he doesn't really embrace the principle that the person who turned out, in hindsight, to have had the better idea, should be respected for it.
    ```

    - u/elysian_field_day:
      ```
      While I agree, I think he deserves some leniency given that he is a teenager whose friend just died. Like, what he said there was not ok, but basically, what leaf said - they are all exhausted, pressure-shaken and grief-struck, having that sort of conversation at that time is just a bad idea all around.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        All true, and not only did his friend die, but his grandfather is looking at a hospital stay of unknown length, essentially having sacrificed himself to save his grandchildren. And Blue is in turmoil about that. It's easy to see how Blue could make this mistake. It's still a big mistake, which I hope he'll apologise for.
        ```

      - u/empocariam:
        ```
        I actually feel it is much more likely that once the dust settles, Blue quickly realizes his mistake and wants to apologize, but it is Red who stubbornly clings to the arguement as some sort of weird pennace, couching it in what ever stoicism lessons his psychic training provides.

  - u/turtleswamp:
    ```
    I think it's more that Blue made the mistake of forgetting that Red wasn't there for the "own your mistakes" bonding exercise and thus missed the subtext of the question.

    &#x200B;

    Blue wanted to know if Red could have helped them or not, even it if was only apparent in hindsight, but Red took the question at face value and Blue took Red's answer as a combination of deflecting blame from himself, disparaging Aiko's heroic sacrifice, and subverting the point of the exercise Red didn't know they were doing which pissed Blue off.

    &#x200B;
    ```

    - u/The_Magus_199:

      While that’s definitely an interesting thought, overall I’m of the position that ultimately trying to read rationality into anyone’s perspective here is a mistake - they’re hurt, and lashing out in an attempt to redirect the pain. Blue expected better from his friend and is struggling to cope with Aiko’s death. Red is SUPER DEEPLY traumatized in a completely different direction from Blue, and had to feel a friend die when he was already emotionally exhausted, so he’s just shutting down and trying to shove every part of him that’s able to hurt behind a locked door. And Leaf... well, she’s the least offensive here since she’s not attacking anybody, but also her attempt to just put it off and hide from the truth of a deep-set conflict finally coming out into the open really doesn’t solve anything so much as just being, well, a kid desperate to keep her friends together. This is the low point of the story so far, and ultimately I think it’s more about everything being frayed and broken than about any one specific point of failure.

  Aiko supposedly saw Ho-oh once, right? Ho-oh is famous for having revived the fallen Legendary Beasts who perished in a burning tower, and left a rainbow in its wake after the fact...

  Aiko died in a burning building, and it's pointed out that the day after it all went down that a rainbow is in the sky. Coincidence, or am I going crazy?

  EDIT: For the record, I'm not saying I think Aiko is going to rise from the dead, I just noticed the parallel is all and wondered if only I noticed.

          ```
          The legend itself exists, Leaf and Aiko talked about it on that rooftop chapter. But much like u/TheGreatTactician said, it was at the same time dosed with heavy scientific skepticism - "Ho-oh probably can't *really* revive the dead, Celebi probably can't *really* travel through time" were the sentiments said, I think.
          ```

        - u/TheGreatTactician:
          ```
          Considering that this fanfic seems to run on the rules of science and logic with no room for the fantastical, I doubt that the legend is true in this version, or at least not without some kind of very heavy science dump on how Ho-oh could logically create new living creatures/bring the dead back to life.
          ```

          - u/AKAAkira:
            ```
            The legend itself exists. And there still exists things that science fails to adequately explain yet, both in real life and in this fic. An easy one to point to in this fic is how Pressure is supposed to work, since it affects Dark humans and pokemon too (unlike other Psychic phenomenon). So I wouldn't go as far as "no room for the fantasical", or at least the initially fantastical before someone tries to figure out the mechanics.
            ```

          - u/The_Magus_199:
            ```
            Still, that doesn’t mean it can’t be symbolic! While Daystar confirmed that he didn’t plan this one bit, I could still imagine that theme leaking into the story now that he’s aware of it, perhaps with some sort of metaphorical phoenix symbolism in her legacy ultimately helping to inspire the trio or something like that.

      If this happens, we can expect it to be buggered up by a time-travelling Red and Celebi coming to save her, and instead merely driving Ho-Oh away.

  Arc 1 complete! And the Sabrina join for long-awaited narrative shift is a go , I was pretty confident on all of our prediction there at least.

  An obviously very impactful chapter, I think personally I was let down a bit by how little internal perspective and processing we got from Red. I think I understand the decision to put it in primarily Leaf's perspective - she is the more balanced in between the two for the confrontation, so you want the (relative) outside view. And she can be open with Red so he can tell her his feelings, giving us that internal process. I just feel like Red went through so many events without his perspective for a stretch, so seeing his own journey along that path was something I wanted to see.

  I also find myself surprised at how harsh Leaf was with Red's decision to stay behind. But maybe I was wrong to assume that - Leaf is more understanding in general, but they are still friends who battle together, it can feel like Red saying "I would let you die in the future". And maybe I am also biased as I am wholly on Red's side in this, I suppose there is an argument on the other side: you can never know how dangerous things will be, you have to take risks and have each other's back in the face of uncertainty to function as a combat team? I think all the contextual elements of the moment make me on Red's side (hell, the Second literally saying its a dumb idea), but without those I can see intellectually how for Blue and even Leaf it was Red breaking The Rules and defecting from his team. Emotionally I dont feel that though!

  &#x200B;

  Final Note: Leaf's plan is still at the nascent stages, but is an interesting first step, she always had goals but not a path forward for them. On first brush it seems unworkable? Like catching enough pokemon already seems like a constraint, and of course such conditioning doesn't pass down to children, and also its unproven how long it lasts outside of a pokeball. I wouldn't expect draft 0.0.1 to have all the kinks work out though, and I think a focus on the rampaging pokemon over the stormbringers themselves is a perspective we havent yet seen, a different angle of attack.
  ```

  - u/RynnisOne:
    ```
    She *just* gave herself that goal.  Give her some time to start working on the kinks.

    That condition doesn't pass down genetically in *our* world, no, but we're not sure how it passes down in the 'Mon world.  This is something she'd have to test, otherwise she would functionally need to 'domesticate' all 'Mon everywhere, which is a big stretch.

        Well if pokemon keep their programming it should be relatively low risk to capture the newly born pokemon, especially if this universe sticks to the idea that all pokemon lay eggs, since then it would be a relatively simple matter of regular sweeps of potential nesting sites (well simple compared to having to scour the world for young looking pokemon that might not have been caught before).

  Great chap!

  Gotta say I understand why Blue thinks as he does but I agree more with Red.

  The gym Second, who was in charge of the situation, told them that he knew what he was doing was an unreasonable risk, and that he was willing to take it anyway, but didn't expect them to do so as well. Aiko chose to do it anyway, and they died. I guess the main point is that none of the people who were actually there in the situation thought that Red was making the wrong decision; neither Aiko nor the Second thought he should come.

  It's also interesting to see Leaf going through *that* moment, the point where you intuitively and deeply realize that, for lack of better phrasing, the world is not a fundamentally save place. You and everyone you know really could die at any time, and eventually you will. I had that moment when I was a little younger than her, so seeing her experience it first-person was really meaningful to me. Surprisingly I haven't really seen many works of fiction that go into this, this change that people who have seen the fragility of existence for what it really is and know what they must do because of it. And because of it there's not really a word for it. So I just call that change that comes to those who know having *it*. Red had *it* for quite a while, and now Leaf does. I know I'm rambling a bit and not explaining myself well, but I think people who have *it* will know what I mean.

  As unfortunate as the circumstances around it are, I am glad to see that Red will be pursuing study with Sabrina. The descriptions and investigations of psychic phenomena are easily the most interesting thing in this story to me; in fact I think it's the best exploration I've seen of the concept in any science fiction and fantasy.
  ```

  - u/empocariam:
    ```
    I feel like if anyone is responsible for Aiko's death, it is the gym second. He knew it was a suicide mission, and he let a low badge first timer follow him in. Instead of "not ordering anyone to do anything" he should have ordered Aiko and Red to stay outside.
    ```

- u/thrawnca:
  ```
  I don't think that Red's honesty was a mistake. He hasn't been appointed a leader; it's not up to him to decide whether or not someone gets to make an informed choice. In the case of the Gym Second, it was the other way around, actually.

  I think that Jack's decision to go in was...probably a mistake, but he did specifically tell Aiko and Red that they were not obligated to come, that he was doing it for emotional reasons, that it wasn't smart. So he didn't really betray his position in making that mistake.

  Aiko's decision was much the same as Jack's. She went because she would feel guilty otherwise. I'd call it a weakness, a character flaw, because it hindered her from doing what *really* needed to be done; but we all have character flaws. I certainly do. So, if the goal is to save as many lives as possible, it was a mistake; but if she prioritised other goals, especially if she placed little value on her own life, then perhaps not.

  In the end, the mistake that was the most glaring, the most un-forced, the strongest example of letting emotions cloud good judgement, was Blue seeking Red out to chastise him.

    Edited :)  


    The silence is back, and this time Leaf pushes through her shock. "Blue, you don't mean that."

    "Would you have done different?" Blue asks, eyes piercing her. "Be honest, Leaf. For her, for him, for me. Would you have stayed outside?"

    Leaf's throat locks. She can't *know* what she would have done... she could say that, could try to stand up for Red, but...

    Blue reads it on her face, and nods. "That's what it means to be someone's *friend,*" Blue says, looking back at Red now. "That's what you don't get, Red. You're talking about risk and the smart thing to do like it's a game, like your decisions don't say things about who you are, how people see you. Forget strangers you're on a mission with, how could anyone trust you to have their back on a journey, if they know that's how you see things?"

    - u/narfanator:

      Hmm. Yes, I agree, but maybe...

      Maybe what's going on here is that there's this underlying assumption that, if you're the person who needs your back watched, you're "in the right", and your friends should watch your back.

      But there's a possible script inversion. If someone says, "I don't have your back on this", why do you NOT consider NOT doing it? This thought isn't complete, but I kinda want to keep going in this direction...
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Yeah, I agree. It's kind of what Blue did way earlier before they reached Aiko's ranch, where he was going to lead everyone back up to help with a Tier 1, and they were all like "Meeeh" and he took that as a sign that maybe it's not the best decision. Good leadership/teamwork relies on taking in feedback from others.


        But at the end of the day, someone may just have different priorities/knowledge/values. And when the chips are down, someone who will trust/stick together has a different relationship than someone who will always decide for themselves.
        ```

        - u/narfanator:
          ```
          Yes.

          So then I'd say... Blue's not recognizing that Aiko didn't earn that level of loyalty/trust from Red. Because I *can* see Red following Blue into that building... because Blue (in this hypothetical) would have considered what Red was saying.

          So Blue is reacting to the idea that Red wouldn't back *Blue* up when he needed it, without realizing that Aiko and Red didn't have that level of bond.
          ```

  - u/Golden_Magician:
    ```
    Now this is a really good suggestion, this addition would totally change my perception and interpretation of the scene.
    ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    I'm pretty sure Red would take the utilitarian approach and answer that if there's no reasonable expectation of actually succeeding, if chasing after him would be futile, then they shouldn't throw their lives away. He didn't stay out because of cowardice; he stayed out because entering would have simply added to the body count. In doing so, he embraced the Vermillion Gym's practical approach more wholeheartedly than Jack, who threw his life away when there were still people all over the city he could have actually helped, or Blue, who spent half the attack holding himself back from seeking glory.

    What's curious is that Blue has previously shown himself to be quite capable of hardening up to get the job done. That's how he caught a Shiftry. For him to rant at someone about being too pragmatic and not empathetic enough is unusual.
    ```

- u/ForMyWork:
  ```
  Ah, I thought this was building for a while, and with what happened to trigger it the fight between Blue and Red was a big one. More than anything else in the story I want more Leaf and Red, but that's going to be shaky with what's just happened. Though good for Leaf finding what she ultimately wants to achieve, it's a big goal, big as Red's, probably harder to achieve, though they are both monumental in sum. Surprisingly Blue is now the one lagging behind as far as goals go, being somewhat easier to achieve, which is ironic considering how goal oriented he is compared to the others. 

  Definitely looking forward to more Red as a psychic though. Good chapter, looking forward to the next one.

  doesn't leaf's idea seem, like, at least as hard as catching every dangerous pokemon ever? If that were possible, wouldn't pokemon already not be a problem?
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    At least as hard on the surface, yes, but even that would be a disaster, as it would unbalance the ecosystem and set off rampages. The idea of releasing human-safe pokemon as you go is more like a battle of attrition that might be won.
    ```

    - u/Croktopus:
      ```
      if you release a pokemon, can the pokeball be re-used? that's one way it could be easier, though pokeball-related finances haven't really been a limiting factor from what ive observed
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Yep, they can be re-used.  


        Ordinary pokeballs are definitely very widespread due to subsidies, but stronger ones are expensive.
        ```

      - u/personalensing:
        ```
        Is there even a way to release caught pokemon in the wild in this world? I remember Aiko telling Leaf that the sakki was a way to remove the pokemon's conditioning permanently as if there wasn't any other way to do that yet. Because if this is true, Leaf will have to find a way to release them too, not just a way to catch them.
        ```

        - u/Electric999999:
          ```
          They can release them, they just send them out, never recall them and reset the pokeball.    
          The current issue is that they're too passive/safe, because the pokeballs don't just condition them to not harm humans, but suppress hunting instincts (the very same ones that Red seems able to reactivate).
          ```

        - u/Croktopus:
          ```
          i dont remember that at all lol, but was it just about removing conditioning because a conditioned pokemon wouldnt survive in the wild? cuz with this plan we *want* the pokemon to be conditioned, just with the only conditioning being "be nice to humans"
          ```

          - u/personalensing:
            ```
            I think it happened in chapter 52, right before Leaf left for the cruise. And, yes, it was about the pokemon's inability to survive in the wild while they still had their conditioning. Leaf's plan would involve removing all their conditioning besides the "be nice to humans" part. I guess the best solution would be to design some pokeballs that only includes this side of the usual conditioning without the following commands part.
            ```

            - u/Croktopus:
              ```
              yeah my understanding is that it'll involve programming the proper conditioning in to "clean" pokeballs (seems like the easiest part of the problem tbh, really just a firmware update)
              ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      Wait, are you treating Leaf's new ambition as actually a good thing? My initial impression of it was more a creeping horror at the idea of essentially mind-controlling every animal on the planet. The failure states of such a conditioning program could very easily include several types of regional or even global ecological meltdown, and that's only considering honest mistakes rather than deliberate subversion. And then the ethical implications are *highly* debatable to say the least.

      Tl;dr Leaf's goal is scary not exciting.
      ```

      - u/The_Magus_199:
        ```
        ...to be honest, I saw it as “Oh cool, her goal is to manufacture the state of the world we see in the Pokemon games!”
        ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Oh yeah, that's definitely going to come up. Everyone's Pressure backlash looks different :)
        ```

      - u/empocariam:

        "Everyone would be happy if only I was in charge and could make them be."
        ```

    - u/Trips-Over-Tail:
      ```
      Plus, you might add to their conditioning the ability to recognise conditioned and unconditioned Pokemon under Pressure conditions and to instinctively defend humans and human settlements from fully-wild specimens during such events.
      ```

      - u/jiffyjuff:
        ```
        I think that's going a bit beyond "making Pokemon safer for humans and the Pokemon themselves alike", and edging into "turning literally all Pokemon, wild and captured, into slave races programmed to serve human goals".
        ```

        - u/Trips-Over-Tail:
          ```
          They'll only be part-time slave races.

  Blue's reaction at finding out the choices Red made was to be expected. After all, this was exactly what their conversation right before Red left for the cruise, was about. In this instance, Red was right, of course. He could do nothing in that situation to help Aiko. Blue is mostly being emotional here, but he is right that this was a matter of trust as well. I feel that if they would adjust their views a little, they could reach a common ground.

  Instead, Red runs away. This may be an unpopular opinion, but this is how I see him going to learn from Sabrina. I get that this psychic training is important to him and it's a great opportunity and all that, but I don't think that, in the wake of one of friends dying, after the fall out with his best friend, after a traumatic night, this is the best decision. I hoped that they would learn something from this terrible experience, that it would help them grow as people. It seems it worked that way for Leaf, but Red and Blue are stuck to their old ways or worse. And if they don't communicate, I don't see it changing. 

  And other reason I don't like Red going to learn from Sabrina, is the way his partition works. The way I understand it, his partition helped him deal with his grief for his father by locking part of it away. It may have helped him in the short term, but in the long term, it stunted his personal growth. I think it would have been healthier for him to deal with it like everybody else and I thought his character arc was pointing towards learning to accept that pain as part of himself and stop using his psychic powers to ignore it. Instead, it seems he learned how to manipulate that partition to do exactly that with his other emotions too and I don't doubt Sabrina will push him in that direction too. The part from his perspective at the end shows this the best. There is no emotion coming through. Red seems to be simply going through the motions and everything that happened appears much more distant that it was for Blue or Leaf.

  This is my reading of this chapter, and I know it may be completely wrong but I wanted to share it anyway. 

  Entertaining chapter as always and looking forward to the (probable) time skip. I'm really curious to see where we will pick up in May.
  ```

  - u/The_Magus_199:
    ```
    Oh, he’s absolutely running away. In the heat of the moment, while locking away every part of himself that cares enough to be hurt, he makes the decision to leave his friends specifically because he feels like that bridge is burning and it’s the only way he’ll make himself go.
    ```

- u/The_Magus_199:
  ```
  Holy crap, what a fantastic chapter. Everything is broken, and you can *feel* the emotion and pain pouring out of these three. I’ve seen a comment mourning that we don’t get much of Red’s perspective on the situation, but I actually really like it - he’s closing himself off to everything, to a degree that includes us, and not returning to his perspective until the brief final segment showing his decision sells both just how much this has taken out of him *and* the sheer awful finality of the way he’s running away.

  I love how everybody’s in the wrong here - Leaf is caught between her natural inclination towards the simple moral viewpoint of “just save them” and the sheer degree to which she can understand what’s broken in Red after he projected his emotions (and after getting a bit of a “this world is broken and horrible” moment herself), and in her desperation to save her friendship - to not feel even worse than today already does - she’s left just ineffectually trying to convince the other two to run away from a conflict that was, in retrospect, inevitable since the first moment we saw Red planning to try and manipulate Blue to keep him relatively safe.
  Blue is hurt and scared and angry, and a bone-deep difference in worldviews was just brought to light between him and his closest friend in the most painful and violent way it possibly could. Blue rages at the world for being cruel, he rages at the storm gods for killing people, and it all comes out in him running away from the pain by projecting everything into anger at Red for being there and not saving Aiko.
  And Red is just so emotionally worn out from this whole ordeal, culminating in Leaf’s injury and Aiko’s death just completely breaking him. Where Blue’s trauma is channeled into rage, Red’s manifests as a crushing despair, so heavy that everything seems useless. The world is cold and dark and cruel, and no matter how much he tries to ameliorate that, the feelings from his father’s death sneak up and whisper in his ear that it’ll still always remain true. Faced with the pain, he runs away, trying to lock every vulnerable part of him behind his partition in an attempt to not have to keep *feeling* that despair. Faced with Blue’s accusation, he lashes out in defense because the moment he admits that he’s hurting, the moment he lets himself be anything other than the cold, heartless, perfectly rational actor, it’s all going to come crashing back down on him. He tries to project the survivor’s guilt and self-blame onto anyone else who presents themself, Aiko, the Second, Blue himself - even the one mistake he considers his own is a cold, edged thing blaming himself for letting the others make their decision - and ultimately, rather than face the pain of opening up to his friends in this darkest hour, he leaves the bridge to burn behind him, running away from that as well by going to follow the one path he’s certain won’t force him to deal with his feelings for them.

  It’s just this moment of utter despair, and these moments only make the eventual points of hope all the more satisfying. I’m going to be on the edge of my seat for the next update, and the next, and the next; it’s going to hurt so much with their relationship left here until they finally manage to resolve it, and I’m going to love every moment of waiting for it.

  I think the third of the gym's thought that" It wasn't his friends, surely? If it were Oak and Juniper, wouldn't they have all gone in together? 'Who went in there, Verres?'" is really important to keep in mind. From the smaller interlude of chapter 66. At the same time i'm not sure that i can disagree with Red either in hoping that he could have changed Aiko's mind or in it being the wrong decision to go in.

  I'm really interested in seeing what Lt. Surge says to Blue in the near future. Especially considering the his bigger picture experience i mean i know that i was surprised how "cold" the priorities of the Gym were when we first saw Zapdos show up.

  The other thing is that well Blue is more or less emotionally compromised by the depths to which his Grandfather is and was willing to go to keep him safe, i mean Blue even has the immediate thought of how to keep his Grandfather safe instead of rushing to keep him safe. It by no means excuses the fact that he did just tell his best friend that he was better off trying and potentially dying than being in his words a "coward." But it should be at least kept in mind that his big role model was just putting his larger philosophy to practice and it makes the degree to which he holds his best friend to the same or a similar standard seem more like his frustration is more of a betrayal than anything else. Like he has a point in a world where you're fighting for your life it's of the upmost importance to know the people beside you aren't gonna just leave. But for the most part the people doing that leading, that he is looking up to, well probably didn't get there without losing people i mean for sure not without losing pokemon i mean we see an elite four lose her whole team upfront right in this chapter.

  Ugh how do i rephrase that... Blue is trying to emulate one of the larger than life figures that are prominent in his society, but the people that do that are well the survivors of the much larger group of people that had many of the same aspirations that he has now, and that of the current leaders it's almost unthinkable for them not to have the ability to make the exact same decision that Red made to not commit more to a potential loss. i mean the second himself passed up multiple opportunities to help people because being able to help those few people would have potentially prevented them from being able to more people in the near future or uh triage the situation.

  God i'm still not making the point i'm trying to... i might come back in a couple of hours and see if it comes out any better.

  Man, this is definitely going to change things, I'm still quite upset/sad that Aiko is dead, she seemed like she had plot armor, damnit!  

  But that's what makes me keep coming back, the emotional punches in this story are quite well done, and I can almost see myself as whatever character is currently "speaking".  

  And man, I can understand both sides of Blue & Red's argument, but I do agree with another poster that Blue seemed a bit too agressive, it seemed a bit one-sided when it comes to who I agree with (Red).  

  EDIT: After reading the edit you have for the argument scene, I'd say I agree with Blue, but I don't think either were going to end up with a discussion, as they are both tired/hurting a lot mentally, and already argue quite a lot. 


  My last thought is that even the second said going into the building was a dumb idea, I don't think he should have let a young trainer come in with him on what he was quite sure would turn out as a suicide mission.

  As much as I think Red definitely did the right thing from a utilitarian standpoint, and that I would've done the same if presented with the choices he had, I do feel a lot of people here are overly critical of Blue.

  It still is something of a cold-hearted decision to stand to the side as two people, and particularly friends, ran in to what you felt was certain doom. Blue was right at the very least about it reflecting the kind of person Red is.

  I guess the problem was just their differences in how accepting they would be of such a person.

  Excellent chapter!

  The best part for me was seeing Leaf finally understand Red's perspective on Pokémon, their value and their dangers. Great change from the reaction Leaf had on the cruise.

  I hated seeing Red and Blue fight, but that was to be expected and was well written. 

  I'm conflicted on Red becoming Sabrina's student. On one hand Red will get to explore psychic phenomena, but on the other hand it seems like running away from all his problems. Like from dealing with his grief without using a partition, or from his Aiko's death, or from his argument with Blue.

  Will we get a new chapter next month or do you need time to plan out Part 2 or something?

  Also, please, what happened to Seto and the woman driving Laura? At least Karen is alive, but sadly her Hydreigon died.

  I liked the end. Hopefully this is not going to end up like HPMOR where the entire origin of magic storyline gets the plot curse.

  Blue might.. not quite sure how to say this, but I'm guessing he has feelings for Aiko. Coupled with the loss of his parents, I suspect that loss, and its aversion is going to play a significant part in his future character development. This line, in particular,

  > Blue swallows, hands balled into fists at his side as he takes a slow breath. "Just… admit your mistake. Just say it, Red, it's okay if you were afraid," Blue voice shakes slightly on the word, "You can overcome that, we'll help you, but you can't go forward like this, thinking that what you did was right."

  seems like an element of **control**.

    As one of our resident shippers, I had suspected a Blue/Aiko feeling, but I feel like right now we lack evidence for it. Blue's perspective on the Elaine-kiss seems to be that of someone who has put no thought at all into romance, not someone who had feelings elsewhere. I would have to re-read the cave section for full details though, as that is their last major interaction.

  This doesn't really have anything to do with the current chapter, but I've had this thought for a while and the end of the arc seems like a decent place for it.

  I hope the subject of lucario comes up at some point. I'm interested to see how you'd handle the "genetically predisposed to justice" thing. Also aura, to a lesser extent, since I'm guessing the answer is functionally the same as the answer to all the other pokemon-based magic. Though if there are human aura users like there are human psychics and darks, that could be interesting.

  My current best guess is that lucario are actually partly psychic, with a low-power, long-range, high-specificity mind-reading, and base their actions on the averaged morality of the humans around them.

  Ok so over the course of the last few days I binged read this fic and god damn, over 600k of words and it's only felt like maybe 100k from how fast I read it.

  I knew this fic was still active but I had put it off because I had wanted to read the story in it's entirety or at the very least a good chunk of it so it's kind of funny that when I finally do decided to read it I get to it just as part 1 is ending. 

  Idk if you'll see this but I'll write down my thoughts about how I feel about the story so far. 

  -i absolutely cannot wait until mewtwo escapes, or finally takes initiative. 

  -your characterization is very good, usually whenever I read something I don't take time to envision everything out fully, mostly minor details like what side character did what, but on this fic I forced myself to really take it in bc I knew that you can make your characters seem interesting

  -which leads me to my next point. Aiko. God damn I didn't like her when she first came into the story. That didn't last long when it was clear she was going to be joining them for her journey. But damn she really grew on me. Her death was shocking but didn't really have that much on an oomph to it since I blitzed through the story but damn I know to others it was a shock. Ever since she saw one of the legendary pokemon I thought she was officially a main character and wasn't going to be killed off. Negl I skimmed through the chapter when she was going into the building bc I honestly didn't think she was going to die. Really hammered in how mundane the death of a main character can be and I know Red's fear of death is overwhelming now

  That's about it for now. Can't wait to see how this goes.
