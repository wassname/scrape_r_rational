## [RT][BST] Rational Harry Potter, with school-age Dumbledore as the protagonist

### Post:

HPMOR is often summarized as "Harry Potter, but if Harry were adopted by a university professor and studied magic using the scientific method" ([e.g.](http://davidbrin.blogspot.com/2015/03/a-quick-informal-post-on-yudkowskys.html)). This required a major change to Harry's character (namely [chapter 104 spoiler](#s "overwriting his mind with that of Tom Riddle")), and most of the actual experiments with magic were in early parts of the story. Canon Harry is good at flying and not being killed, but academically he's outclassed by Hermione (who's smart enough for Ravenclaw but moral enough to be a Gryffindor anyway), the Marauders (who became Animagi and created the Map), maybe even Draco (who conjured a snake in second year, and fixed the Vanishing Cabinet to evade Hogwarts' wards). There's already a more rational take on the Potterverse with Hermione as the protagonist, [Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9950232/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Perfectly-Reasonable-Explanation), but I think an excellent candidate for studying the fundamentals of magic is Albus Dumbledore.

Dumbledore's canon accomplishments are already impressive, and well-suited to the theoretical and practical study of magic. He won awards for "Exceptional Spell-Casting" and a "Ground-Breaking Contribution" to alchemy, and [published papers on Transfiguration](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore#Hogwarts_years_.281892-_1899.29), all while still a student. And after graduation he and Gellert Grindelwald basically planned to unite the Deathly Hallows and take over the world, which isn't too far off from planning to defeat death and create friendly AI. I think a good turning point from canon would be the death of Ariana: that is what separated him and Grindelwald, and made him less ambitious and more accepting of death as the "next great adventure." Or maybe keep her death, but make him all the more determined to find the Hallows and bring her back to life. Either way, he would still end up disagreeing with Grindelwald's violent methods of gaining power, but retain the desire to use it himself "for the greater good" ("for the coherent extrapolated volition"?).

Dumbledore went to Hogwarts in the 1890s, so most of the characters and a lot of the setting would have to be original, and avoid too many anachronisms. I expect this is why there are very few stories featuring Dumbledore and Grindlewald [on FF.net](https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&r=10&c1=351&c2=5717), and most of what exists is romance or still involves Harry.

What would really interest me is to see Dumbledore study magic on its own terms, and find a system of laws or categories of phenomena that explains magic without reducing it to complex Muggle science or arbitrary effects from a "Source of Magic" AI. Things like Harry's discovery in HPMOR that "a potion spends that which is invested in the creation of its ingredients," or [this fic's](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8324961/12/Magical-Me) classification of charms as modifying nine [accidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident_%28philosophy%29) (with transfiguration modifying essences). Imagine what his transfiguration papers would be like, or how he created spells and enchanted objects! Exploiting the contradictions between magic and science is fun for a munchkin-type character, but not really elegant.

I'm not a writer, and if I did write a fanfic I'd start with one requiring fewer original characters, but hopefully this can inspire someone else who wants more rational!Potter after HPMOR finishes this week. Or if anyone knows of an existing high-quality Dumbledore-protagonist story, I'd love to see it. (I'm already following [The One He Feared](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9778984/1/The-One-He-Feared), which merges Harry's and Dumbledore's minds after Snape kills him, and has a well-written flashback to his time with Grindelwald.)

  There are so many good ideas. If only an /r/rational paperclipper would tile the universe in awesome stories.

  I would not quite mind that apocalypse.

    Ideas are cheap. Writing stories is hard, especially if they're meant to be good stories with coherent themes and solid characterization, not to mention a plot. That's one of those unfortunate truths about the world (and more specifically, this subreddit).

    I'm actually against posting ideas. I think that it short-circuits some of the mental reward mechanisms that get people writing stories. You start describing this awesome magic system that you thought up with all these neat analogs to how online communities work, and you're getting this low level stimulation that erodes at the desire to write it out into an actual story.

      Yeah. I am very much a victim of this. 

      I find that the best solution is to do some minor idea bouncing in big groups if you need a problem solved or want holes to be poked (as I intend to do in a couple of weeks with a vampire story I'm cooking up), but to then do the heavy idea pouncing with just one or two people. 

      The key, though, is that these need to be people who are going to be invested in your story and will be disappointed if they don't get to see it completed, in the same way that any of us will be disappointed if HPMOR stops updating tomorrow. 

      I started doing this to help with my problem of getting two-thirds through a novel and then deciding that it's horrible and needs to be thrown away and never, *ever* talked about again, but I think it's a general-use tactic.

      I'll say.

  Yeah, I would *totally* read this.

  This sounds like a really good idea..  Canon Dumbledore is already a brilliant genius so you wouldn't even really have to change his characterization much.

  I'm loving the idea of a young ambitious Dumbledore trying to optimize the world and explore magic.   You could really delve deep into the HP magic system and its strange intricacies.  

  I especially like your suggestion to distance HP magic from muggle science.  This is a big pet peeve of mine.  Too often in fanfiction magic is explained away as exotic muggle physics or some other reductionist materialist explanation is used.  I mean come on, its *magic*.

  Like you I'm not much of a writer so hopefully someone else can write this story.

  I think this would be very cool to read, what with how HPMoR stopped being "Science Potter" somewhere around the trip to Azkaban and turned into "Slytherin ALL THE THINGS, with Tom Riddle!".

  And yes, Rowling's "magic" often seems *very* Aristotelian, which would certainly explain, on its own, why her Wizarding World is *so fucking backwards*: [they're all basically philosophy majors ;-)](http://lesswrong.com/lw/4vr/less_wrong_rationality_and_mainstream_philosophy/).
