  I admit that the name has put me off enough not to want to read this. Tell me, am I missing out?

  Edit: righty-ho then, i'll get to reading.

  Edit2: Aaaaaand, I love it. The writing is bubbly and enthusiastic in a very enjoyable way. Guess I'll be following this one.

    You are missing out. I've really liked this.

    Yes, it's pretty awesome so far. Would like to read a lot more of it.

    As the author, I'm probably biased, so I won't answer.

    I didn't realize that the name might be off-putting. Is it too corny?

      Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

      In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

      Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

      “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

      The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

      Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

      Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

      L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

        Well, neither is the story itself, unless you mean something different by those words.

        > Not sure you want readers who don't.

        Why not?

            Good point. Thanks for the advice. The reason I responded is that I myself am not entirely happy with the title (which I guess it may be too late to change now). Here are some reasons why:

            1. It's not a very clever title. Compare with the chapter titles, which for the most part engage with the themes of their respective chapters.
            2. It makes the reveal of Willow's Mind-name ("Secretly Awesome") less interesting/unexpected/exciting/compelling. I spent quite a while searching for a name for Willow and was very happy with the result. Now it's possible that I have, in my haste and excitement to get the first chapter published, undermined the value of this name.

              It's not too late to change it. I've changed titles on some of my stories. ff.net supports it, since what they care about is the story ID (which is invariant). I don't even think it will break any links.

              That goes to the same place.

              Bad (or rather, non-representative) names are particularly ungood if you're trying to draw people in. The television show "Cougar Town" was stuck with that name through its whole run, and that turned a lot of people away.
              ```

      It's a little childish. I'm particularly on my guard recently because I accidentally started reading some really bad fanfictions while wandering the interwebs, so I'm trying to avoid repeating that mistake. I wouldn't call it a definitively bad name in and of itself, but it may not be the same genre as what you're going for.

      Still, let's give it a read.

  Everyone knows about the Culture, and everyone is all too ready to leave whatever Earthly ties they have behind. Things are going too well for the protagonists, building up a tiny cult, and there's no antagonists yet in sight.

    Are you sure?

      ......

      Don't tease me like that. *pout* I assume you're referring to the Watcher's Council, as they've gotten the most discussion time, and possibly even Giles. As long as you don't make Giles evil, that should be fine.

        If only you were a betareader. Then you could find out early.

        (Actually, I haven't entirely settled on that part of the plot yet...)
        ```

- u/ben_sphynx:
  ```
  So, what would being a beta reader involve? Proof reading for sense? Consistency of plot? Grammar?
  ```

  - u/_immute_:
    ```
    To a certain extent. But ideally, it'd mostly be higher-level stuff than that -- what the sidebar calls [wise reading](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1w4llw/by_request_two_kinds_of_involved_responses_to/). We also might have free-ranging discussions about where the story might go, etc.
    ```

    - u/ben_sphynx:
      ```
      Heh, that looks like a somewhat challenging level of involvement.
      ```

      - u/_immute_:
        ```
        I know. The *quantity* of contribution described in the link is extraordinary (though if you're willing, it would be *really* awesome); I meant the link more as a suggestion for the *kind* of feedback that would be the most helpful. What I would hope is that my betas would be willing to talk about where the story is going, how well the themes work, ways to improve things, stuff it would be awesome to see, analysis of characters, tone of voice, etc., rather than merely pointing out typos or awkward language (which is, of course, still helpful). Basically, just direct feedback on the kinds of things an involved reader would be thinking about. Want in?
        ```

        - u/ben_sphynx:
          ```
          Well, I can give it a go.
          ```
