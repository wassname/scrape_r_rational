## [META] Something Odd is Happening

### Post:

So I posted the next discussion about chapter #14 in the read-through for *Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid* and for some reason, the post never appears on the front page of this subreddit. I tried deleting and reposting it several times now and even when I wait a few hours, it still doesn't appear.

Does anyone know what is going on?

The post is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/35mjwy/geb_discussion_15_chapter_14_on_formally/).

EDIT: Okay, I messaged the mods about it and it's been taken care of. Thanks for your help guys!

  Message the mods. It might have been auto-flagged.

  Not sure...my first hypothesis was some sort of oddity in the algorithm for reddit's 'hot' posts, but it doesn't appear on new either.  Hmm...

  EDIT:  I'll try commenting on it and see if that changes anything.

  Posts have to be upvoted some before they appear on the front page. Are they appearing in /new? If they're not appearing in /new, then your posts are probably being caught in the spam filter and you should message the mods about it.

    In a sub this small, I believe any post will be on the front page of /r/rational shortly after it's posted, due to the way that the "hot" ranking works.

      Heh. I like how you called a gathering of almost 3,000 people *small*.
      ```

        The internet runs on the 90/10/1 rule. If there are 3,000 people, there are 2,700 lurkers, 300 commentators, and 30 content creators. This is just a general rule, but I think it holds roughly true. It's still a fair number of people (and still my favorite sub) but I do think of it as being small.

          True.

          /Pedant Mode Activate!/

          2,700 + 300 + 30 = 3,030

          You probably meant 2,700 lurkers, 270 commentators, and 30 content creators. As well as the 90/9/1 Rule.

          /Pedant mode Deactivate!/

          Thanks for taking the time to be one of the 1% then!

            Content creators are almost always commentators as well, but the 90/9/1 sum doesn't work out if people can belong to multiple categories.

            You're both right!
            ```

      - u/blazinghand:
        ```
        Most of the stuff caps out at 30 or 40 net upvotes (sometimes it gets over 50 I think). We have a lot of subscribers but I feel like most people are just here to read. For a long time I was a just-reader because logging into reddit was too much trouble. 

        yeah though I think everything appears in hot
