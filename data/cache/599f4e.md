  Andddd I didn't actually get to flesh out the TV Tropes page as I'd planned. Oh well. Not much writing done, either, but at least I built up a buffer (working on grad school applications  and cramming to finish a Kickstarter project that's due at the end of this month). 

  **Synopsis**

  Across the world, one hundred adolescents unexpectedly find themselves in possession of superpowers, running the gamut from conventional to world-breaking to annoyingly limited. But despite the diversity of powers, certain patterns emerge, and as the Children begin to find each other, they realize that the world itself may be in great peril.

  Heroes save the world, but will they succeed in being heroes?
