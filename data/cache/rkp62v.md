  Okay, the second lot, I don’t think this week's offerings are as obscure as last weeks but I hope you still find something to read among them. 

  No summaries, just links and a short review. 

  This is the end of things I’ve read in recent months but I might post a couple in the new year containing stories I’ve kept up with for a long while. 

  Until then, a Merry Christmas. 

  [Peculiar Soul](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/42433/peculiar-soul) 

  A step above most other fictions on Royal Road, Peculiar Soul is well written, well plotted and well characterized, it does nothing badly. The story is about the MC learning about the world, learning about himself and finding his place, because of that the story does feel a bit aimless, the MC doesn’t have a goal or an ambition and by extension neither does the story. 

  There is tension to that, as I read I am waiting for the main thrust of the story to reveal itself and depending on the direction it goes down will probably end up being the pivot on whether the story will be good or great. Until then I’m excited to keep reading. 

  [Valkyrie’s Shadow](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/39336/valkyries-shadow) 

  Valkyrie’s Shadow is an interesting work of fiction, it is a meticulous exploration of the world of Overlord from a multitude of perspectives not considered in canon and a thought experiment of how one would use the undead (and other magics) to create a stronger, more prosperous kingdom.  

  The pacing is ponderously slow, the writing is serviceable, the characters feel distinct and the handling of the non-human perspectives is a stand out feature of the story. I’m actually tempted to call this a rational piece of fiction. 

  If the above interests you, you should give this one a try, if it doesn't, give it a miss.

  That being said, this is the only piece of fiction on this list (or the previous one) that I have never been upto date with at any point. I have completed the first act and left it there because while this is a story I admire it isn’t one that I enjoyed because I don’t like the character’s of Overlord or particularly the new ones introduced here. 

  [Speedrunning the Multiverse](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46319/speedrunning-the-multiverse)

  This story is less greasy than the typical Royal Road, progression go-wrrrr fantasy, partially due to the writing quality and partially due to the strength of the protagonist but is still of the same DNA.

  The story however, lacks tension that is kinda crucial to these kinds of stories, while the premise of speedrunning cultivation gives an interesting top down perspective on cultivation and the worldbuilding, it also robs the story of meaningful consequence beyond the MC having to start a new run.

  I think for most people reading this will know if this is the kind of story for them and for those who don’t, this is a pretty okay place to find out. 

  [The Last Orellen](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46901/the-last-orellen)

  Just great, just really great, do you like coming-of-age fantasy stories? Read this then.

  My only concern is the endurance of the author, he neither has a set schedule for release nor a patreon. In my experience, not great signs for longevity, especially since the story is set up to be really long. 


  [Pound the Table](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/pound-the-table-an-x-men-self-insert.951637/) 

  I’m not really one for legal dramas on tv so I was surprised that I enjoyed this story so much, it's a great match for the X-Men, which, was always a pastiche for discrimination. Seeing that tension through a perspective of the legal system is, for me, an unexplored idea. 

  This is helped along by the fact the author seems to know her stuff when it comes to the American legal system and y’know if she doesn't she can sell it well enough to convince me make it compelling. It’s just finished its first arc and I’m looking forward to see if it can continue it’s momentum into a second. 

  [Hive Mind Gives Good Hugs](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/45048/hive-minds-give-good-hugs)

  By the same author as Vigor Mortis, this work shares similar themes, though through the perspective of a very different character and in a very different world. I think it the lesser of the two but it's still enjoyable 

  Though they are more similar than the same I would say try Vigor Mortis first and if you enjoy it, try for Hiver Minds second. 

  [Reach Heaven Through Justice](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/reach-heaven-through-justice-young-justice-k6bds-crossover-oc.733996/)

  I like Young Justice and I have read a lot Young Justice fanfiction, I had only vaguely heard of Kill Six Billion Demons before reading Reach Heaven Through Justice and this is my first exposure to it, but this doesn't matter much because, as far as I can tell after a look through the K6BD’s wiki, almost everyone the MC mentions is an OC. 

  So you can go in blind and everything that needs explaining is explained to you in the fiction itself. 

  The story itself is technically competent but the heart of fiction is the relationship the protagonist forms with his new student as he rebuilds himself from the loss and failure in the past. 

  Separately I'd like to complement the fiction on how it handles the homeless. I don’t know how realistic it is but it's very much a perspective we don’t get to see too much in fiction. 

  [Evil Eyes](https://archiveofourown.org/works/34632028)

  This is a kind of a wanky iamverysmart SI that most should probably avoid on principle but it is written and elevated by the author of A Man On The Moon (the Mass Effect X Fate/ Stay Night crossover), who, is, pretty good at the whole writing thing. At least when he isn’t up his own ass. 

  I enjoyed it, there’s a lot of words devoted to theory crafting and worldbuilding. The action is really fun to read, the plot itself is pretty stations of canon but in a mostly interesting way, the characters are well written, if not really too much of the focus. 

  If you have a high tolerance for SI wankery then you might enjoy it as well, my biggest hope though is that the author isn’t actually this much of dick in real life.

    Man, Evil Eyes does something that I vehemently dislike. It tries to explain a seriously bullshit world with our world scientific phenomenon. 

    Naruto has all manner of weird stuff, like spirits, summons, and shinigami. It obviously does not work on our world scientific framework. But Evil Eyes goes to so much trouble to explain Chakra as a fifth type of fundamental energy.

    Why do 'science' fanfiction always fall into this trap? Explain the weird with new weird frameworks.
    ```

    - u/Flashbunny:
      ```
      I actually rather enjoy it, myself. The explanations are coherently delivered, and there's hints that the main character approaching chakra from a purely physical/material viewpoint is letting him figure things out that no one else is, but that the established ways of understanding chakra has its own insights that he's missing out on entirely.

      For example, it hasn't even tried to explain any of the things you've called out as "weird stuff".
      ```

      - u/AngryCoffeeBean:
        ```
        Good that you enjoyed it.

        I was highlighting the 'weird stuff' to point out that this is an entirely different world. Explaining it in our world terms takes away quite a bit of the otherworldliness.

        It could have been approached from a physical viewpoint without making Chakra an extension of our world scientific framework. Exploring that different physical laws with the scientific method would have been amazing. 

        For example, the mc has a panic attack when he thinks that there is no conservation of energy. Turns out there is. But why should the laws of thermodynamics apply here?
        ```

        - u/Flashbunny:
          ```
          If any of the fundamental physical laws that make up our universe were even slightly different, our universe would look extremely different; they're so low level that you can't really change anything at all without the higher-order stuff being unrecognisable.

          It's fairly easy to suspend your disbelief when a story says that physics don't real in their fantasy setting, but it's actually an extremely reasonable assumption to make that any universe capable of supporting human life would be, at most, tacking on a few extra bits to the same physics that our universe runs on. (And for those extra bits to not be fiddling with anything really fundamental at all, like conservation of energy, except under extremely limited circumstances - such as the presence of chakra.)
          ```

          - u/AngryCoffeeBean:
            ```
            Aha, but is it really necessary? This requirement of physics only applies to our universe. Perhaps in another universe, air is air, and does not have components. Perhaps there are no such things as atoms or other fundamental particles. In which case there is no need for our universe physics!

            To me that makes a lot more sense in most fantasy settings, and this additional stuff to our physics breaks my wsod.
            ```

            - u/Flashbunny:
              ```
              In another universe without physics, literally anything could be the case. Amongst literally infinite possibilities, that anything even remote recognisable as human or a world which humans could live in exists, is literally - not figuratively - infinitely small. Therefore, for any character that found themselves in such a situation, the assumption that traditional physics or something extraordinarily similar to such hold true is a reasonable one.

              It's fine to not like stories where people attempt to use real-world science to understand magic, but to have them stretch your disbelief in comparison to the effectively 0 probability possibility that no real world physics applies seems very silly to me.

              EDIT: I mean none of it is realistic when you drill down anyway, it just seems weird to get hung up on the more realistic option *because* it's not going for the less realistic option.
              ```

  - u/kraryal:
    ```
    *Reach Heaven Through Justice* is straight up great writing. Temmu Khan the MC feels human, his emotions make sense, he's humble, he actually thinks hard about applying what he knows to a new world with his new limitations. The relationships totally make this story fly.
    ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    _Reach Heaven Through Justice_ is great, and it's smart about how it crosses over - the MC comes from the rich and complicated multiverse of Kill Six Billion Demons, but he's in Young Justice. 

    Even if you're not familiar with YJ itself, you probably know enough just through cultural osmosis to know who everyone is; and since the MC is an interloper from a more esoteric setting, he ends up explaining some of the weird bits of his world to people in a natural manner. 

    And yeah iirc there's only one canon KSBD character mentioned - it's Jagganoth, one of the BBEGs of the setting. 

    That being said it is pretty good at sticking to canon and canon-ish KSBD concepts, martial styles, historical events and other such things.

    This is my biggest concern. A slow pace and a slow release schedule are not what I'd call a good combination. What's been written so far is engaging, but I wouldn't say we're really in the meat of the story yet either.

    Can the author sustain the plot once the basic "discovering how to access the magic system" arc runs out? A lot of stories falter around here, so it remains to be seen if this will be an exception.

  I finished Purple Days this week.  It's an ASOIAF fic centred on Joffrey waking up in a timeloop after his first death at his wedding.  It blows up its premise beyond that point, so I can't go into more detail.  I will say that any and all character development feels *extremely* earned, and the first \~half of the book has some brilliant development both in terms of Joffrey and the plot.

  Any problems I have with the book begin after around the halfway point, when a certain creative choice is made (>!bringing Sansa into the loop!<).  To be fair to the author though, I couldn't think of any way to pull off that decision in a way that I'd like, so it's probably YMMV (there's an earlier arc in the story that some people thought dragged on and which is most commonly described as the YMMV part of the story, but I loved it).  Even so, I enjoyed the second half too, just not as much.  I thought the ending was a bit rushed - which is ironic considering it's an 800k word fic building to one finale - to which the author himself admits to creatively burning out.  But I still liked it, if I weren't comparing it to the quality of the first half, I'd probably have loved it.

  TL;DR: The first half is an SS rating by my standards, and the second half is a weak S / high A rating.

  You can find it on [SpaceBattles](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/reader/), although I recommend getting a MOBI or something from [FicHub](https://fichub.net/) to read it.

  - u/TheTruthVeritas:
    ```
    I suggested this to some friends to serve as lab rats and they told me they only got through 1-2 chapters saying the narration and characters were arrogant and insufferable. I read the first chapter and I have to agree. The boring Japanese weeb-y tropes(God why does everything have to be set in Japan and use or make fun of tropes? Can’t we just have some good ol’ French special forces medics like in The Calamitous Bob?) really brought it down for me. Not to mention the characters being caricatures(the asshole gyaru, nerdy weeb, know it all) and needlessly stupid and antagonistic to everybody else like it’s a low quality webnovel.

    The MC in particular really annoys me. The first chapter gives off a lot of r/iamverysmart vibes with “I’d need a team of anthropologists to answer that” and everybody acting all shocked-it reads like some crappy “junior do you dare?!” xianxia or one of THOSE Japanese webnovels, at least nobody clapped I guess- and him unironically saying F = ma when the weeb was saying it was frozen time. And then the MC acting all smart and saying to pull her from the top by her *hair* instead of the legs like the weeb initially suggested, when pulling by the legs would’ve been perfectly fine and made a lot more sense.

    Does this get better? Right now I’m agreeing with my friends based on my initial impression and it’s giving me a lot of red flags. The narration seems like a lot of unfounded arrogance and iamverysmart energy and that’s really offputting. I’m hoping this is all intentional and the MC grows to stop being such an ass?

      ```
      The protagonist goes through harsh events that force him to gradually let go of some of his narcissistic asshole attitude. The character development starts to be apparent in chapter 6 and builds from there. He continues to be a misanthrope, but personally I found him much more relatable as the story progressed. It helps that other characters start taking the mickey out of the protagonist whenever he says something particularly self important. You could say that the story rapidly deflates his ego.

      As for the weeb stereotypes, that first chapter was particularly bad because it was told from the protagonist's perspective and he had a terrible outlook in the beginning. It will never be quite as bad after that. If anything, the author seems to have a goal of subverting tropes or at least showing how everything is more nuanced when the protagonist is forced to take a deeper look at the world around him.

      Latest reply here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/rppaqu/d\_monday\_request\_and\_recommendation\_thread/hqqnu7a/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/rppaqu/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/hqqnu7a/?context=3)

      But I'd agree with you on one part - the japanese weeb-y isekai trope the story starts with is cringey.  However the author also explicitly agrees with this, and the story is clearly trying to be a subversion of the trope and inject as much counteracting reality into the worldbuilding as the author is capable of, with a hopeful wish that it kills all badly-written isekai tropes for good (though sadly this will never happen).

      Personally, I immediately loved the MC for all his assholeness - made for a great plausible pick as Dark Lord.  He does obviously get better though - both morally, and by chilling out via help by the supporting cast - and I'd argue that's the intended growth which mirrors the story's themes.

    ```
    Seconding this. It's my favorite ongoing story on the RR at the moment.

    The pace is almost glacial, especially since it updates only twice a week with regular small hiatuses (for a good reason, the author takes care of their mental health and tries to prevent burn-out, which is amazing)—but I like slow burn, and I *love* the pace of the story. It really allows each of many, *many* characters it has to shine, and gives enough time to explore the rich world it has. If you don't like fiction that can realistically go for hundreds of thousands words, you probably wouldn't enjoy it. But everyone else would find it magnificent, I hope.

  I just finished [Vampire Flower Language](https://archiveofourown.org/works/13710744?view_full_work=true), a rational fiction romance story. I was very impressed by how author u/AngelaCastir was able to create a romance story where the tension was not in silly misunderstandings, but in actual differences in values.

  Much has been written elsewhere about how to resolve value differences: [values handshakes](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/values-handshakes) where both parties change their values; [dath ilan](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/dath-ilan) pareto optimal deals where both parties find an agreed middle ground; and even acceptance of a misaligned AI where you just roll with it anyway, [Friendship-is-Optimal](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal) style. But, without giving away any spoilers, I'm impressed by the novel way that Vampire Flower Language deals with this problem.

  I heartily recommend Vampire Flower Language. I've also written [a longer review on goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4402945229), though the latter three quarters of it is spoilery, so I recommend reading the novel first before checking out my full review.

    Holy cow, thank you for this comment, and the review on goodreads. I am glad that the story achieved what I set out to achieve with it, it means a lot!

    Especially thank you for the feedback on the shifting point of view removing the mystery, I am considering reworking the story slightly to be a bit smoother, have the themes go through the whole thing more, etc, and restricting it to Red's POV may well be a change we make as a result. I enjoyed writing Julias's POV but sometimes you have to kill your darlings...

      I wanted a rival in the cult, but not just an arrogant young master who hates the MC for no reason. It's at least understandable why he's annoyed. 

      When I DM'd tabletop games, I found the players would actively kill any enemies, so it was hard to have a nemesis. But if you gave them a rival, someone who was technically on the same team who they couldn't just murder, it caused more long-term simmering conflict. I hoped to reproduce that trick in writing.

  I started an interesting naruto SI fanfic last week, it's called [Evil Eyes](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13969877/1/Evil-Eyes). It's written by the same person who wrote Man Off the Moon, so expect pretty good writing for fanfiction. I like the focus on trying to explain chakra through science and physics, although the protagonist's rants on physics can get a little tiring at times. I also liked that the protagonist's past life actually matters, his hobbies and interests make a big difference in how he goes about in the new world, although once again sometimes it goes on the side of being too much rather than too little. The protagonist is slightly insane, which can be a plus or minus, although the insanity doesn't show properly until about halfway in the story. Overall I really enjoy it, even though sometimes it's a bit of an edgefest. 

  I've also been reading [Castle Kingside (Rewrite)](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/43462/castle-kingside-rewrite), it's very good. Kingdom building with a surgeon isekai. The author's knowledge of biology and the human body seems good, although it's not my specialty. The protagonist's motivations and personality is also good, and the world is very interesting. The rewrite makes a lot of the iffy parts of the original much better integrated (>!like his initiation to the crime syndicate, or learning about the world slowly!<). I really like the struggle the protagonist goes through to even get the slightest bit of development, when he starts from bottom rung of society.

  Looking for media (any kind really, watchable, fics, or published) about characters exploring a Big Dumb Object/out-of-context thing or slowly uncovering a mystery, especially with some horror undertones.

  I recently(ish) read **14 by Peter Clines** and it is 1/2 of a fun book setting up the mystery of the apartment building, but fails at the ending so hard its easily one of the worst things Ive read.

  I've probably read a lot of the classic recs for this here: *Cordyceps*, *House of Leaves*, *Rama Trilogy*, *Piranesi*, *Antimemetic Division*, and been playing a lot of *The Outer Wilds* (which is excellent if you havent played but definitely go in blind)

    [*Ra*](https://qntm.org/ra)? Quite possible that you've read it, but if not, it definitely fits the bill.

    The Magnus Archives is a horror podcast where the protagonist is an archivist for a bureau (I think?) of paranormal investigations. He reads out statements submitted by people who contacted the bureau as a way to digitally archive them, and the statements slowly reveal an interconnected story.

    I think the [Southern Reach Trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Reach_Trilogy) by Jeff VanderMeer would fit your request, though it's not particularly rational.

    The mystery at the center of the story is Area X: a region in the US that was quarantined after an unexplained event drastically altered it and rendered it uninhabitable. The story has vaguely Lovecraftian horror vibes. The first book in the series, *[Annihilation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17934530-annihilation)*, is the best in my opinion. It was adapted to a film, though I haven't seen it.

    Not a rec, but you might be excited to hear that [Denis Villeneuve is going to film *Rendezvous With Rama*](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/denis-villeneuve-rendezvous-with-rama-movie-1235062337/) - IMO it's a better fit for his style than *Dune* - and that was still good!

    - Iain Banks - there are a *lot* of teraprojects in the *Culture* series, and only some of them are superintelligent.  *Excession*, *Consider Phlebas*, and *Matter* have particularly notable-to-the-story big objects.
    - Niven's *Ringworld* is rather famous for being large, dumb, and (oops!) dynamically unstable.

  I would like to recomend [An Undertow of Sand](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/an-undertow-of-sand-percy-jackson-and-the-cthulhu-mythos.941042/) by Shujin.

  It's a Percy Jackson/Cthulhu Mythos fusion fic.

  The Gods of Olympus and of many Pantheons are Young and extremely tied to humanity and its beliefs. Their epithets are gained through belief and each epitheph contains a version of themselves that is slightly different from other epithets not only in powers but in personality, changing epithets is like changing rings that give different buffs in an rpg, and of course, you can have many rings at once.

  But for all the power the Gods of The Earth have, it pales in comparison to older gods. Elder Gods. The Prophecy says that a son of the eldest gods will reach sixteen against all odds, and indeed, it is those gods that it refers to. Percy Stele is son to the Elder God known by the Greeks as Ananke, the primordial goddess of nessessity, inevitability and fate. It is not its only name. The Egyptians knew it as >!the Aten!<, the Celtics knew it as >!the Mórrígan!<, and a peculiar man from Providence that wrote stories based on visions he had in his dreams called it by the name >!Nyarlathotep, the Crawling Chaos!<.

  The first chapter begins *in media res*, with Percy, Luke and the goddess Artemis fighting against the Teumessian Fox, a fox destined never to be caught. Also known as >!a Hound of Tindalos!<.

    Binged this, it is great. Thanks for the rec. Any other good Percy Jackson fics out there? I've read a couple, but the quality doesn't seem as high as other fandoms
    ```

    - u/Nivirce:
      ```
      The quality indeed is not as high as other fandoms. Which is why AUoS is such a fresh take. That said, there are a few PJO fics that seem to be pretty good. Generally speaking, [Ryuugi's fics](https://forums.spacebattles.com/search/23020756/) are really good, though he has a tendency not to finish them; I specially enjoyed his fic [Prytaneum](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/danmachi-percy-jackson-prytaneum.352191/), a PJO/Danmachi cross.

      Other than that, I liked [these](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/hold-tight-and-pretend-its-a-plan-percy-jackson-the-olympians-heroes-of-olympus.874528/) [two](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-one-where-percy-is-a-magician-of-questionable-competence-percy-jackson-the-olympians-the-kane-chronicles-au.883835/) by Rynna Aurelia. I also liked [Classical Hero](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/classical-hero-worm-pjo.396446/) a PJO/Worm fic, though it seems pretty dead by now. There's also [Salt-Breaker](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/salt-breaker-percy-jackson-asoiaf.770579/), a PJO/ASoIaF. Do keep in mind that while I liked these fics and thought they were generally good, the quality varies and Your Milage May Vary as well. 

      Finally, I would recomend looking at the [TV Tropes page for Fic Recs](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanficRecs/TheCampHalfBloodSeries) and [this thread](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/percy-jackson-and-the-riordanverse-idea-discussion-recommendation-thread.245423/) for discussions and sometimes recomendations.

  Request:  Hey all,  
  I'm looking for rational(ish) \[non-\]fiction (any medium) which delves into what happens after a technological breakthrough in mass transportation and/or logistics comes along.  Interested in-particular on the second-order effects, cultural changes, and transition process as either freight or passenger travel become an order of magnitude cheaper (or more) and are widely accessible.  
  
  I've read Worm 1/2, most HPMOR fics, Pokemon OoS, Animorphs The Reckoning, Worth the Candle, Dungeon Keeper Ami... so - most of the staples, and a whole bunch of other fics.  I'm guessing a good start would probably be either early railroad days (historical accounts/fiction), or a good Stargate Universe recommendation (I have seen none of that fandom but would like to start somewhere with the best writing, even if that's fanfic).  This is probably a driving force through a lot of stories though so hoping this request bears fruit.  
  
  Let's just say I'm involved in some interesting circles who are considering the likelihood of a few more waves of a transportation revolution incoming with the recent arrival of cheap solar, batteries, and electric engines - so I'm trying to put my downtime reading to good use visualizing what this looks like and what comes next.

  - u/taxemeEvasion:
    ```
    Stross's *Merchant Princes* series. It features characters with a bloodline that allows them to shift between two dimensions, our world and a less technologically advanced one. This impacts travel & trade. Copying from the wikipedia entry bc it describes it well:

    > The implications of this world-traveling ability are thoroughly explored by the series. The ability to take clothing and held items across allows a phenomenally lucrative import/export trade between worlds; wielders of this power have used it to become wealthy. Invaluable modern technology and medicine can be shipped to the feudal world; illegal drugs can be shipped in a world where the DEA has no power; and packages or messages that would take months to deliver by horseback can simply be mailed via FedEx in the modern world. 


    As a whole they're pretty good and worth a read, but have my usual Charles Stross complaints. Great worldbuilding, but he usually doesn't do endings or consistent characters well. 

    ---
    Less important to the plot, but some of the *Known Space* books deal with this in passing. Due to the development/purchase/gift of teleporter pad technology you can step from any where on earth to anywhere else. 
    I can't remember specifics but likely *The Fleet of Worlds* prequel series, possibly (??) *Flatlander* a series of short stories that deal mostly with life on Earth, and the beginning of *Ringworld* mention this the most. Again, the standard warnings about Ringworld and its sequels apply. Niven kind of goes off the rails when he doesn't have a co-author.
    Edit: See /u/ahasuerus_isfdb 's reply!

    -----
    If youre ok with communication developments in addition to transit, there are of course the Moist von Lipwig *Discworld* novels. *Going Postal* and *Raising Steam*. Loosely, about the post office competing with signalling towers, and the introduction of trains.

    Larry Niven's 1970s [Teleportation universe](https://larryniven.net/reviews/universe.shtml#teleportation) is a good match:

    > This near-future series explores the effect on society of a ubiquitous network of teleportation booths, which have replaced nearly all other transportation. Some stories feature reporter Jerryberry Janson.

    - u/taxemeEvasion:

    ```
    [The *Terra Ignota* book series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/166200-terra-ignota) is set in a world where supersonic flying cars have essentially abolished the concept of geographical distance. It focuses quite a lot on worldbuilding and the downstream consequences of that, and I believe the first book (or the first two) gives plenty of exposition on it.

    It's one of the central conceits of the setting, though not *the* central one — there's a lot of other weird stuff too.
    ```

    - u/Escapement:
      ```
      These are some of my favourite recent books, but I always recommend them with the cautionary note that a prospective reader should try sample chapters from the start of the first book on Tor before buying: [chapters 1&2](https://www.tor.com/2016/04/12/excerpts-ada-palmer-too-like-the-lightning-chapters-1-and-2/), [chapter 3](https://www.tor.com/2016/04/13/excerpts-ada-palmer-too-like-the-lightning-chapter-3/), [chapter 4](https://www.tor.com/2016/04/14/excerpts-ada-palmer-too-like-the-lightning-chapter-4/). Among other things, there's a lot of funky stylistic choices that some readers love and others cannot tolerate at all.

      You may also have a free copy of the entire first book as an e-book - it was on Tor as their monthly free ebook thing in March 2018.

      I felt the series started very well, the middle two books were good enough but not as spectacular as I'd hoped, and then the last book was extremely uneven with both many amazing spectacular highs and a few disappointing segments, but way more good than bad and and overall the series as a whole is definitely worth it.

    [One Step From Earth](https://www.amazon.com/One-Step-Earth-Harry-Harrison/dp/0812539729) is a very entertaining anthology of stories by Harry Harrison, all taking place in the same universe, and tries to be almost exactly what you described. The unifying theme is faster-than-light matter transmission technology: put one MT doorway in one place, put another in another place, hook them up stargate-style, and just walk through. He seems to have given quite a bit of thought to what the consequences might be, though he handles the resulting worldbuilding by indirect exposition for the sake of pacing. The first story is about the difficult and dangerous construction of the first interplanetary gate, between Earth and Mars. The second is about dropping a heavily sealed pressure vessel into Saturn to see what's really down there -- with an escape route to prevent it from being a one-way trip. There's a space opera story about a teleportation-enabled interplanetary war, a picaresque about an assassin on the run through an empire of hundreds of thousands of worlds, a rather unusual sort of medical drama about stopping a plague while it's still confined to planet zero, and an impressively varied assortment of other stuff.

    These are the classic form of science fiction short stories, the sort of thing you don't see as often now that the SF magazine publishing model mostly collapsed: they start with an interesting premise, there's usually a twist at the end, and in between those Harrison is good at making it fun to read. Recommended!

    Big thanks to /u/taxemeEvasion, /u/Noumero, /u/Escapement, /u/ahasuerus_isfdband /u/vorpal_potato (and pre-emptive thanks to anyone else).  Basically hadn't heard of any of those recs before, aside from Terry Pratchett (GNU) - though unsurprising as I haven't gone much into traditional sci fi yet.  Will probably work my way through all of these, possibly breadth-first, one book at a time to start?  We'll see.  I think the Terra Ignota and Teleportation universe series sound like the closest analogies so will probably start there!  Thank you again guys this helps a lot

      In [The Stars My Destination](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/333867.The_Stars_My_Destination) anyone can teleport basically wherever and whenever they want with some specific and plot relevant restrictions. While the societal changes aren't the focus you get a few glimpses through the book that you may enjoy.

      Keep in mind that while it was pretty progressive for it's time this is still a Science Fiction book from the 1950s where humanity has colonized the solar system but still cares about things like race and female chastity. So plus points for having an intelligent and relevant supporting character be a black woman, and minus points for bringing up that she's a black women every time the character is mentioned.

  Recently I read First Line of Defense: Welcome to the Universe ( https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/49390/first-line-of-defense-book-1-welcome-to-the-universe ), which is a pastiche System Apocalypse, Dungeon Core, litRPG, and Tower Defense game. It... look, I loved it, but part of that is that the genre pastiche worked for me and there's very little I've seen that's like it.

  So... anyone know of stuff that's like that? I think the Dungeon Core aspects could probably have been dropped entirely without the story suffering at all for it, but the TD/litRPG "gameplay" with the System Apocalypse justification really worked for me, and I'm very much interested in recs.

  (KU, web serials, tradpub, all fine. No fanfics. I mean it, seriously, no fanfics.)

    **Wayward Wolf (Witcher x ASOIAF)**

    >The year following the end of the war was the best he'd had in nearly a decade. Ciri was no longer hounded by men and elves, Yennefer's reputation was restored and Geralt was back to doing what he did best: simple Witcher's work. Kill the monster and get paid. No more conspiracies or prophecies to ensnare him. He should've known it wouldn't last. Post-Witcher 3 & Hearts of Stone, pre-Blood & Wine.

    I like this one best. Geralt finds himself in Westeros, in the days of the Mad King. There's a lot more magic (possibly thanks to him being there) that there was at the time in ASOIAF, and Geralt sets about doing Witcher work. 

    Really well-written, the first arc is done and the second is underway. It updates slowly unfortunately.

He'll take his chances fleeing to Essos once Robert Baratheon takes the throne, thank you very much.
