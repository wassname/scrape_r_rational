  Note that the first of these chapters (7.\~) is a dream with lots of hidden text.

  A [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L0E9DEOw382SxcnBB_old0rCqCa13xMuj6te5UD4Fgs/edit?usp=sharing) was created by readers to try to decipher as much of it as possible in a cooperative effort, with some decent success at least in the first few paragraphs. Mind you, the author has warned that the vast majority of the hidden text was NOT designed by him to be decipherable.

    Sounds annoying to read with a screen reader. Should this be tagged NSFW?

      The 'hidden words' in the chapter I'm talking about they are replaced by tildes, they're not meant to be actually read/undestood right now, though am sure we'll have a full reveal of them eventually in some future chapter.

      >Should this be tagged NSFW?

      Am a bit confused what you mean. The thread is already tagged NSFW.
