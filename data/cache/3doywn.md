## [WIP][D][FF]Business as Usual: Vlad Taltos crosses into the Worm universe after Golden Morning

### Post:

This is a rational topic in terms of how I am attempting to write the story, as opposed to the actual story itself.

I am attempting to have the characters act sanely, and reasonably, but the rational discussion here should revolve around the use of story elements as opposed to the content of story elements.

  The Imp scene in the most recent chapter is *weird*.

    It was also removed.  I decided that the story would be entirely in the narrative voice of Vlad.

    I'm probably going to have to re-read how Imp's power works in Worm, specifically in the last couple places where she shows up.  I was not happy with it, and she's going to start showing up more.

    EDIT - There was another change.  The next scene will be narrated from the viewpoint of Imp, in the same manner as Vlad narration, but (hopefully) with an Imp feel to it.

      I read the chapter after you removed the scene. I then proceeded to the comments below, found someone speaking about the Imp scene, and went "What Imp scene? ...oh."

  Fun! Looking forward to more Undersiders.

  What's the best way of keeping up with this story, assuming I don't regularly visit this forum?

  Is there a thread-specific rss feed or something? Email alerts?
  ```
