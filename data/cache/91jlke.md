## [META] Final Vote Companion Thread

### Post:

This is the companion thread to the /r/rational sidebar rewrite vote thread, [which is currently running now](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/91jltk/meta_rrational_characteristics_of_rational/).  Please see that thread for links to past discussions and further details.

If you have any comments or concerns about the vote to bring up, please do so here.  That other thread is locked to comments, but still accepts votes just fine.

    Agreed, there are 4 good answers but only one that people will actually read, so I'm voting that one even if the others might technically be more accurate.

    EDIT: I think I explained myself horribly. The one I voted is great, it's not like I "settled" for it. I'm just saying I valued clarity and conciseness over completeness. 10k word complete definitions can go in the wiki just fine, but we're voting for something that will go in the sidebar.

      That was my worry: they're mostly technically superior definitions, but lack the cogency of a quick pick-me-up rundown for the casual web fiction reader.
      ```

      - u/ketura:

        There's a balance to be struck between accessibility and accuracy.  I may be wrong, but I don't think that the goal of the subreddit is to average our aims with those of the other eight billion members of the populace; rather, I think the hope would be that we introduce more people *to* these concepts rather than diffuse them until they're popularly palatable.
        ```

        - u/nytelios:
          ```
          That would be ideal. Though I do think that the sidebar isn't the be-all and end-all to introducing readers to the essential concepts of the subreddit, since interested readers will necessarily come upon the tenets of rational fiction during their time here. As I opined in a previous post, a definition (for me) is *good enough* if it makes the idea of rationality more approachable to the average reader. My personal preference would be something of an irreverent 5th bullet "Just kidding, the actual definition of rational fiction is [link to compilation of definitions and this month's brainstorming]."
          ```

        - u/nytelios:
          ```
          I felt unconscionably guilty about commenting but not contributing anything constructive, so I threw together a redefinition intended to combine what I felt were the most cogent elements of everyone else's proposals. If nothing else, it hopefully helps narrow down the solution space.

          ##Characteristics of Rational Fiction:

          - Characters think and act in ways that are consistent with their beliefs/values, motives, and worldview. They are rational agents, in the sense that they have *agency* as unique individuals who pursue their own goals and don't exist only to facillitate the plot.

          - The characters solve problems or achieve their goals through intelligent application of their knowledge and resources. More importantly, these thought processes are usually transparent or at least plausibly reproducible to the reader through details in the story. Ideally, they go beyond obvious solutions and  exploit their knowledge and resources creatively.

          - The fictional setting has logical and/or consistent rules. Even if the world resists our common sense or "it's just magic", the author thinks through the effects and implications and makes an effort to remove or justify seeming incongruities. Worldbuilding should reflect the previous two points, e.g. social structures  and the world-system should be the realistic consequences of such characters.

          ##In Rational*ist* Fiction:

          - Rationalist fiction is about [*showing* good thinking](http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level3intelligent),  through the perspective of an intelligent character, so that the reader can reproduce or internalize those cognitive skills. If a story is structured like a puzzle, the reader can conceivably arrive at the same (or even alternate correct) conclusions by applying similar thought processes, reasoning, and techniques from cognitive science, logic, game theory, etc.

        Not to put too fine a point on it, but perhaps you all should have raised those concerns during the previous month, while they still could have been addressed? Because if you're now going to vote for whatever seems less wordy instead of *correct*, this whole endeavour becomes pointless and we may as well leave the sidebar as it is.

          [I did](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8u1vzj/meta_rrational_characteristics_of_rational/e1f2cyy/?context=1). But you seem to be confusing the purpose of a vote, of which I'm only one voice.

            >I did.

            Fair enough.

            >But you seem to be confusing the purpose of a vote, of which I'm only one voice. 

            Voting started eight hours ago, and three people already stated similar opinions. It implies that a statistically non-insignificant part of the community shares this concern, yet it wasn't raised almost at all during actual discussions. It's concerning.

            And frankly, I disagree with it. I don't think that trying to tailor the definition for people who don't want to read one sentence unless it's *exciting* is a good idea. If they're so disinterested, they won't stay around anyway.
            ```

            - u/nytelios:
              ```
              Sounds like a rather droll mirror of [the paradox of democracy](http://www.chs.ubc.ca/participatory/docs/Paradox%20of%20Democracy.htm). The active sub vets, rationality-educated "citizenry" are the ones are who are most involved in the redefining process, and the more lukewarm, apathetic members (like me) merely engage in the final product of the process: the vote. I'm self-conscious of my complicity in this discontinuity, but I'm not surprised I'm not the only one commenting given the disproportionate emphasis on voting in a democracy. Someone made a joke about appointing a Benevolent Dictator For Life - is it time to execute?

              I'm not advocating an *exciting* definition. The words I emphasized are cogency and approachability. However, I don't think it's beneficial to hold a sour grapes attitude toward potential newcomers on the basis of rationality pedagogy. I'm more for "if they're even remotely interested, give them a reason to stick around longer."

                  No, it wasn't the *whole* point. The current sidebar was too vague in some ways, and too specific in others.

                  E.g. in the portion of my suggested rewrite that addressed rational**ist** fiction, I actually removed two of the three bullets and thus made the definition smaller.

                  I think it's worth it to avoid a wordy or pedantic definition, but this is catching the edges of ideology and our expectations for the sub. I'm not supporting a lax, indiscriminate definition. Identity demarcation is important, but it isn't black and white, as the differing choices of emphasis of each redefinition has shown. Part of the attraction of r/rational is turning these irrational stories/characters into great rational fics and as long as the new specific definition doesn't intimidate a new reader/writer in its attempt to be correct, it's serving a good enough purpose.

          You probably shouldn't have made it only based on upvotes but instead make voters comment and vote since it means all the lurkers and more casual members will have to discuss rather than just upvotes the easy to read one.
          ```

        - u/ArisKatsaris:
          ```
          As the author of one of the less-wordy definitions, I support people voting for the less-wordy definitions. :-)

          But seriously, how wordy, complex & accessible something is, must always be part of the equation. People are allowed to have whatever criteria they want for the purposes of voting, and something being *brief* can be one of those criteria.

          I didn't hate the current definition for being *short*, I hated it for many other reasons.
          ```

          - u/Noumero:
            ```
            Oh, I don't mind that people prefer shorter definitions. Certainly brevity is a valid concern.

            What I'm concerned about is that a non-insignificant number of people stated its significance only *now*, when the proposals are locked, instead of during the discussions. If it's actually that important, but nobody optimized for it strongly enough, what else have we missed? Perhaps we actually should have let the previous thread run for two weeks, or ran some kind of review-thread/preliminary vote first.
            ```

            - u/nytelios:
              ```
              Nothing really prevents further discussion and edits of the chosen proposal though.
              ```

  - u/eroticas:
    ```
    Disagree that people who would fall asleep on the type of content that PhD holders would on average find interesting are realistically a target demographic for most of the prototypical examples of rational/rationalist fiction. 

    Potentially agree that brevity is important for the limited real estate of a sidebar / maybe the solutions should be revised for brevity.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I was exaggregating a bit. Sure, we shouldn't dumb it down for an average person. But It should be accessible to a rationality-curious reader, ideally 'have read HPMOR but none of the Sequences'-level
      ```

- u/ilI1il1Ili1i1liliiil:
  ```
  No matter which definition is chosen, we could include a link to the final voting thread in the sidebar, so that people who are still confused can get more information.
  ```

  - u/ketura:
    ```
    Better yet, incorporate them into a wiki page or something. But yeah, as a minimum have additional linked info to *some*thing.
    ```

- u/Krossfireo:
  ```
  What vote? Some context would be nice to people who don't check the sub all the time
  ```

  - u/ketura:
    ```
    Heh, fair enough; this thread existed mostly so I could link it in that one, but I suppose people might stumble upon this one first.

    We are near the end of a month-long series of threads discussing the best way to replace the "Characteristics of Rational Fiction" section of the sidebar.  In previous weeks we discussed various aspects of the problem, and last week people submitted their solutions.  This week we're going to vote on them, and next week we'll have the winner.  

    I've updated the OP with slightly more information.
    ```

- u/LupoCani:
  ```
  Even in contest mode, it appears low-scoring comments are hidden. If we believe this premature information is a concern, the only solution I know of would be to gild all comments in that thread, which (I hear) overrides score hiding.
  ```

  - u/ArisKatsaris:
    ```
    I gilded a low-scoring comment there, to check this out (with the plan to gild all of them if it worked) but it still looks hidden to me, so I don't think it works.

    EDIT: Eh, what the hell, I'm gonna gild them all anyway, lest someone considers the gilding of just one as favouring it unfairly or something. I can afford it and ketura deserves it for the effort anyway.
    ```

    - u/ketura:
      ```
      Well shucks. Thanks for that, even if it didn't accomplish its original purpose.
      ```

    - u/LupoCani:
      ```
      Indeed, gilding some but not other comments would be rather blatant manipulation. Thank you for gilding them all, I'm not seeing anything hidden anymore, though I can't guarantee that isn't somehow local to me.
      ```
