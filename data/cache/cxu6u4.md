    Luminosity is very good, and is something of a rabbit hole for Alicorn's other, also good content.
    ```

  - u/DuplexFields:
    ```
    Luminosity is a rationalization of Twilight, Radiance is a sequel from another character's perspective, and Flashes is an anthology of vignettes set throughout both books.

    I accidentally read Flashes first, so some of the drama of the novels was spoiled, but from what I've heard others say who never finished Luminosity, I guess it kept me hooked long enough for it to get good.
    ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    Yes, Luminosity is finished, and basically covers all four books of Twilight canon. However, you really need to read the sequel, Radiance (which is also finished), or else the story is quite incomplete.

  [The Arithmancer](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer) is another Harry Potter fanfic with rational elements.

  [A Practical Guide to Evil](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com) and [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com) are also popular with the r/rational crowd.

    Arithmancer isn't quite rational, but not bad.  The sequel, lady archimedes, goes full Mary Sue partway through, and her ethics get... weird with her reluctance to kill or just end the war through any of the ways laid out either in story or in HPMOR
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      > The sequel, lady archimedes, goes full Mary Sue partway through

      Yeah, very much this. I gave up on it, but eventually came back and was able to finish and enjoy the trilogy. My advice is, treat Hermione more as a plot device than an actual character, and enjoy the worldbuilding+munchkinry.
      ```

  - u/NorskDaedalus:
    ```
    Came to say exactly these three. At this point, I honestly like the Arithmancer a bit more than HPMOR (heresy, I know). It stays closer to canon, people are a bit more realistic in their capabilities, and the magic system is more universally explored, beyond just a few spells that are explained.

    Worm is probably the second king of Rational stories, and is incredibly well-written. It explores what a world that actually has superheroes/villains as a sizable minority of the population would actually be like. Warning: it’s fairly depressing.

    Lastly, a PGtE is the most unique of the three. While not yet completed, it still is incredibly long, absolutely hilarious, and has some really fascinating world building. It’s set in a fantasy world where being a protagonist or main villain is a measurable quantity, and tropes and story beats are both predictable and can even be weaponized by those who know what they’re doing. 

    I would personally rank the Arithmancer as a 10/10, Worm as a 9/10 (it’s just a tad depressing for me), and a PGTE as 10/10. For reference, HPMOR is probably a 9/10 and MoL is 8.5/10
    ```

    - u/Makin-:
      ```
      I'd say staying close to canon is exactly why I enjoyed the Arithmancer increasingly less as it went on. It becomes unimaginative, contrived and forgettable when all the stations of canon must happen.
      ```

      - u/NorskDaedalus:
        ```
        How far did you get? I found that while many of the same events happened, the exact reaction to them suffered wildly from their established method. By the time the war finally kicks off, there’s almost no overlap of the events, let alone how they play out.

        But each to their own, I guess.
        ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    The caveat on Worm is, it's a very dark story. Don't look for happily ever afters.

  Pokémon the origin of species. I think it’s a compelling and well thought out depiction of how a world where kids go out to fight and capture dangerous monsters (Pokemon) would operate, and has very “real” characters.

  Well, I'm still not entirely sure how to tell if a work counts, but if I'm not mistaken, the original Abhorsen trilogy by Garth Nix should be a good one. There have been at least two more books in the series since, but I'm not sure how they are, as I haven't read them.

  Does Mother of learning feel like HPMoR, or it's rational only because of rational characters, and doesn't have deep ideas? (Looking for next fic after HPMoR and Significant Digits myself)
  ```

  - u/Culric458:
    ```
    It's rational because *all* the characters have their own motivations and reasonable act based on them.
    ```

  - u/NorskDaedalus:
    ```
    Having recently been in your exact situation (looking for something nice and logical to read following HPMOR and Worm), I can tell you what I found that kind of scratches that itch:

    Worm, probably second after HPMOR as the archetypical Rational fic, which has reasonably-motivated characters, very well-thought out world dynamics, and a really brilliant power system, with people who fully use their powers.

    MoL, which, while it doesn’t have quite as hard of a magic system as HPMOR, is still quite logical and the characters each have their own motivations, and stick to those motivations, that ultimately makes it a very satisfying read.

    The Arithmancer, which fully explores a magic system much closer to HP canon (or at least closer to typical fanon), involves a very reasonably-motivated Hermoine (most of the others are left unchanged) and is overall an incredibly satisfying read. She combines science and magic in a way that is much more reasonable than HPMOR, and her new innovations come at a much more believable rate.

    By the same author, the Accidental Animagus is also quite good. While it doesn’t explore the magic system nearly as much, it works out fine. It’s much more character driven, and both Hermione and Harry (who serve as our primary POV) are prepared, reasonable, clever, and way less willing to go along with things “just because.”

    The Practical Guide to Evil is also top-notch. It examines a world where “hero” and “villain” are actual,  measurable qualities, and protagonists and antagonists are actually just far better at fighting than regular people. Stories can be weaponized, our protagonist is fed up with how the good guys have the deck stacked in their favor so much, and Dread Emperor Irritant (the oddly successful) is one of the best historical figures ever.

    Lastly, there’s the Metaworld Chronicles. While nowhere near the quality of the others I listed (especially at the start), it still becomes a fairly good read in time. It only passed muster as ‘rational’ in my mind thanks to the main character, who actually acts based on logic rather than emotion, but it does become a fairly engaging read with time.

      Ehhhhh, the Arithmancer is okay, the sequel is just godawful Mary-Sue claptrap with a contrived plot.  Honestly with how "competent" the main character is compared to the DE the war should be over within a few chapters, but she just sticks to bad tactics and it goes on as a result.
      ```

- u/edwardkmett:
  ```
  Worth the Candle is the obvious choice. It has a ton of content and is written by an author that is very well regarded here.

  I'm greatly fond of Metropolitan Man, also by Wales. Rational Lex Luthor.

  Sticking with Lex, [Inviolate](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5536346/1/Inviolate) is another good read.

  The Erogamer is coming along quite nicely. While I wouldn't say it is nearly finished it does have a lot of content.

  Unsong isn't really rational/rationalist but it is definitely rationalist-adjacent.

  Also rationalist-adjacent, Worm captures the general sentiment of having a protagonist that coldly considers her options at each point and a lot of the story takes place in her head as she tries to plan out how to respond to her rather crazy circumstances. The narrator is er.. a bit unreliable, which adds another layer to parsing the story.
