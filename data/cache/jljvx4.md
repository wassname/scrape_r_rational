## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  Your power is this: When you forget something, everyone else who knew it forgets it as well. For example, if you forget which day of the week it is, so does everyone else. If you forget a word, everyone else who knew that word in the same language forgets it as well. Now, everyone else can relearn things after you forget them - they can just look at their calendar to see what day of the week it is, for example. But of course you can learn things multiple times as well, and every time you forget, so does everyone else. 

  How do you use this power? It has a bit of an unusual limitation in that if you try to forget something very specific you will probably only remember it all the better, but there are still uses for it, I think.

  (For the purposes of this ability, having to spend a few seconds to remember something still counts as remembering it. It needs to be 'gone', such that you can no longer recall the memory/knowledge unaided. Also, death or brain damage would not activate the ability.)

    Is there any way to control/turn off this power? If not, you should probably just die.

    Because this curse makes you cripple the rest of humanity just by learning and forgetting things.

    Forget what the safety/emergency procedures for anything is? Everyone forgets it. No one remembers what to do in an emergency and they get screwed over. No one remembers how to safely do tasks and so cause more emergencies. They can look it up, but that takes time, time they may not have if they are already in an emergency situation.

    Forget what a word means or how to spell it? Or even how to pronounce it? Countless documents all over the world that contain that word become unreadable. People making speeches suddenly can't understand the words on the script, and neither do the audience. Movies, stories, music, many will become gibberish and nonsense. Especially with heavy accents that make it even more difficult to figure out what word they are speaking and how to look it up.

    Forget about a store? Suddenly no one goes there anymore, because no one remembers that it exists.

    Forget about a COUNTRY? Well, the United Nations will be very very confused about this country's representative in their midst that they don't remember at all.

    Unless you have eidetic memory or something, you will constantly be forgetting things, forcing the rest of the world to also forget and have to relearn it, and in the meantime deal with the fallout from not remembering important things. You are effectively the #1 enemy of humanity, causing destruction and mayhem on a global scale.

  - u/scruiser:
    ```
    With someone cooperating with you, you could max out the forgetting by being given large quantities of information at a time, with dummy purpose made information as filler given in the same format as the real target information.  You learn/remember it just well enough so that when you stop remembering it, it counts as forgotten.

    So for example, if the government wanted to cover-up a secret or classified document, they give it to you mixed in with a bunch of fake but plausible documents.  You study them for a few days to remember them, then go through more fake but plausible documents.  At the end of the process, the real document, along with a bunch of dummy made-up documents is forgotten.

  You have access to a vial of potion that allows you enter any fictional world.
  It cannot be custom-written for this purpose.
  When you enter a story, you gain gain a copy of the book, which is your portal back home.  If the book is destroyed in the original world, it is destroyed in the fictional world as well.
  You end when the story ends.
  A book-portal has any number of uses.  As many people as you want can go in and out of it.
  You may not bring anyone or anything back from the other world that does not already exist here.  So dust is fine, an Olympic medal from 200BCE is fine, but an X-Wing fighter is not.  Neither are any people.

    Extracting ordinary material wealth seems pretty obvious. Find whatever story that has a lot of gold that you can take, bring it to the real world. Or whatever currency you want.

    If the story has to be fictional, find historical fiction for your desired time period, and bring back as many historical artifacts as you want. Any story that contains a reference to the Library of Alexandria before it was burned could work well, depending on the limitations of what things you can bring back if they no longer exist on Earth. (You could kind of cheat and jump into Worth the Candle because >!it has a magical backpack that can create almost any item that has existed on Earth, which at the very least could save you a lot of time and effort of getting things the hard way!<)

    You could maybe bring back extinct species through the above method.

    Talk to any historical figure that has had fictional books made that include them.

    Have a fun time debating with Christians about whether the Bible counts as a fictional work for the purposes of your power. Have identical arguments with any other religious group that has a holy book.

    Jump into the Culture books and find out if the limitations on bringing things back that don't exist on Earth extend to entirely biological enhancements to yourself. You could similarly de-age yourself, or alter your body however you want, provided you remain within the normal bounds of humanity. This has some obvious uses for almost any difficult medical problem.

    Selling real people first person viewings of their favorite stories would be interesting.

      If you can pick any world you want it should be fairly easy to pick a world that is objectively better than ours and ditch earth with whoever you care about and simply not come back.


      For this, there are three main criteria, although getting all three in a single book book is quite difficult.

      1) The book goes on for a long time at least a mortal lifetime, but (as ties in with point #2) ideally goes on functionally forever so you never have to go back.

      2) Immortality, or at least significant life extension is attainable.

      3) It should be trivial for you to avoid dying, and gain a high standard of living without significant risk or requiring any luck. Ideally it should be possible to gain a standard of living fundamentally beyond what we have on modern earth. Obviously this ties in with #2 as well, since immortality existing is useless if you can't get it.

      Getting any two of them together is easy (The Silmarillion grants you 1 & 3 easily if you choose to live in Valinor under the Light of the Trees, any novel where you can join the Culture gives you 2 & 3 and basically every Xianxia ever gives you 1 & 2 at the expense of you probably just being shanked by a murderhobo cultivator).

    The natural exploit is to use a story that never has to end.

    Specifically, a story with time travel, so you can travel backwards over and over and so prevent the story from reaching its end.

    I would just use Steins;Gate's perfectly safe time leap machine to rewind time over and over and over, gaining infinite time to do infinite research and advance technology infinitely.

    One problem though, is whether the original world's time is rewinded when time is rewinded in the fictional world. I may have infinite time in the fictional world, but if the real world keeps on progressing, there won't be a planet earth to come back to when I am done.

      Maybe accelerated time could work even if looped time doesn't? Use the hyperbolic time chamber from dragon ball, get a year per day. There are probably other stories with more extreme time acceleration, like MoL, though there's some questions on which viewpoint is the one used for outside reference.

      Though you have the very real problem of the fictional world not obeying real life laws, so you couldn't directly test anything you make in the fictional world. Still useful for lots of things, but you're not advancing science by decades at a time or something like that.

    Personally, I would enter the book “Number of the Beast” by RAH... One of the principle plot points is that they have a machine which allows access to all fictional universes. Use that machine to reaccess our reality without exiting the book allowing real material to be brought back and recursively access anything, essentially bypassing the rules.

    Go to Friendship Is Optimal, copy Celestia's source code, and then come back to immanentize the eschaton.
    ```

    - u/scruiser:
      ```
      Celestia's source code doesn't exist in our world and may not function right or even be logically possible in our world (in principle it is all math and should work, but just because you can hypothesize of a strong self-improving AI with stable Values/Goals doesn't mean it is logically possible).  Still Celestia AI is really good at working out and working around problems, so if you cooperated directly with her, she could test the limits of the source code and mathematical algorithms you can bring out and work out what she can send with you (AI at the current upper limits of state of the art should definitely be possible) with the goal of maximizing friendship and ponies.  People are possible... so she could try custom designing a person with the goal of implementing Celestia AI in our world.

  The following is a minor spoiler for the **NSFW (I mean it, there is loli hentai in there)** CYOA [Abyss Diver](https://stellinearized.github.io/adventure.html). If you read this subthread and then the CYOA you should probably not take that item if it's ever offered to you, as the challenge depends heavily on the unknown. But it's just one power of many.

  > You have gained possession of **Flamel's Folly**, a long, sturdy rod. Upon touching a substance with upwards of 55% purity, it can instantly **transmute one element in that substance into an element of that atomic number plus or minus one on the [periodic table](https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_18/416971/140502-science-periodic-table-elements_b2bbb9954b92280ff8011bdcee6e4dcc.fit-2000w.jpg)**. Can effect a maximum volume of 1m^3 per use, and requires 30 minutes to recharge afterwards.
  > 
  > If the primary substance is a molecular compound, like water, then the element you choose will be transmuted within each individual molecule, for example turning water into fluoronium. Many substances will likely undergo further interesting - and possibly violent - reactions after transmutation.

  **Easy mode:** You are an effective altruist in a wealthy real-world country. You have a few thousand dollars of seed money. You want to make the world a better place - by earning and donating a lot of money, unless you have a better idea. What's your plan?

  **Normal mode:** You are an explorer of the Abyss, a deep and mysterious pit. You are at the moment quite far from civilization & its commodity markets, in an arid mountainous region. The only things you have with you are trekking gear: certainly food and water, maybe a rope, a sword, a smartphone... You want to create more things to help you on your journey, such as weapons, drinkable water, shelter, a heat or light source, a way to breathe underwater etc. What can be done?

    Easy- Buy as much lead as you can. Spend an hour and a half per cubic meter to transmute into platinum. Maybe go to iridium. Become unbelievably wealthy. Later, transmute uranium-238 into plutonium, solving all energy needs forever (though be careful of critical mass).

    Hard- Not fully sure on what the requirements to escape are. With a single tree, you could make charcoal, then turn it into lithium to make a flare. You could kill things that get near by turning the nitrogen in the air to fluorine, at the risk of yourself. Or turn solids into gasses to make an explosion. You could slowly tunnel through rock by turning the aluminum or silicon into gasses. Turning nitrogen into carbon would give a good source of fuel, though only very slowly. Might be better as an attack, since it would suddenly create a very low pressure area.

    Without a good way of containing gasses, you're really limited on what you can turn things into, since no matter which way you go you'll run into the noble gasses. You can't, for example, make water by turning carbon into hydrogen then igniting it, because you have to go through helium. Turning a solid directly into a gas would release a *lot* of gas, and you're not going to be able to contain that for half an hour.

      Good ideas all.

      > Not fully sure on what the requirements to escape are.

      Escape is not the goal, it's to explore hostile environments with a wide variety of natural (or not) threats and obstacles, and quite a few monsters. You're harshly limited by starting money and carrying capacity, so versatility is a godsend.

      > You could slowly tunnel through rock by turning the aluminum or silicon into gasses.

      Hmm, I wouldn't think random rock is 55% pure anything, but I don't know much geology.

        I guess it depends on what specifically the percent is measuring, element or molecule, and by moles or by mass, but granite is 72% SiO2 by weight. Oxygen makes up part of most of the other components, so maybe that would work instead. Silicon, aluminum, and oxygen make up pretty large amounts of any given rock, so you could easily get lucky.

    If you obtain the kinshifter on the same layer, you can copy 65 dubloons worth of other Relics, then also obtain a copy of Flamel's Folly.  You can now chain the effects of two Flamel's Folly together to get much more powerful effects, converting two elements in a substance by 1 atomic number of 1 element by 2 atomic numbers.

    For obtaining water, get carbon ash by burning something, then convert the carbon ash to beryllium, then beryllium to lithium, then burn the lithium to get lithium oxide.  Now you can convert the lithium to hydrogen, giving you a mix of hydrogen peroxide and water and oxygen (HO2 is unstable and should break down quickly).  This reaction will probably be energetic given the breakdown HO2 into H2O and HO and O2.  But still, water.  30 minutes cool down between each step... it would take at least 90 minutes, but you can do 1 cubic meter per 90 minutes, so if you do it in bulk to fill up all your canteens at once it isn't too bad of a time usage.  Unfortunately, the level you first find Flamel's Folly on is an ice level, so limited usage their.. but you could track down the purity tree and burn it to get that carbon ash.

    You could also go the other direction and convert carbon to oxygen in CH2 (methelyene) and CH4 (methane) into oxygen and get water that way.

    If you have nothing to burn you could convert the Nitrogen in the air into carbon, but you are limited by volume, not mass, so you can't get a lot at once.

    For edible stuff... you want sugars which are too complicated to get with single or even double atomic molecular transmutations.

    For other useful stuff.  Maybe silicon (common in quartz, sand, and many rocks) to aluminum to magnesium to sodium.  Sodium oxide is used as flux in glass making.

    If you have water, even impure/undrinkable water... you could change it to ammonia (N2 and NH3).  Then if you have platinum as a catalyst, burn it to get nitric acid and water.
    ```

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      I think you're overlooking some practical difficulties in containing gasses when you have basic survival equipment. Methane to water seems like it could work, but how are you going to get and keep useful quantities of methane, and get to at least 55% purity?

      The carbon->lithium->lithium dioxide ->water is really clever though.

        I brainstormed a bunch of ideas before seeing the range of resources in the layers that way I would already be looking for viable combos and synergies ahead of time.  I was hoping there might be a natural gas deposit at some point. If there had been one it would have been viable to try tapping it.

        For making containers (to hold intermediate products when using Flamel’s Folly)... the Orb Weaver (layer 3) is really valuable.  Actually it is valuable as a weapon as well.  If you spray it into some type of improvised fragile mold that can hold it in place for the 10 seconds it takes to solidify you have a solid vessel.  In my build I used this to store the created water when I realized 3 flasks is way too few.  If you spray the Orb Weaver at an enemy then within 10 seconds the enemy is immobilized or at least heavily hampered if it can’t rip through material as strong as iron.  If you spray it at nostrils you can choke out an enemy.  The Orb Weaver has no cool downs or refresh period either.

        There wasn’t any good source of methane on any layers, but there is stuff to burn in most of them.  In Agartha, you could use Flamel’s Folly to rapidly complete the land excavation job by transmuting long narrow cylinders of soil/stone into explosive/reactive materials.

    I thought of another usage.  Most living things are mostly Water (at least 55%).  Change the Oxygen atoms in the water to Fluorine should kill most living things.  So once every 30 minutes, you can use it as an instant death weapon against any organic creature.
    ```

    - u/Roxolan:
      ```
      Hmm, this depends whether only the water's oxygen atoms get transmuted, or all oxygen atoms in the target area. Rule's unclear. I worry that too much of the non-water oxygen compounds in a body could get explodey/poisoney when transmuted. Fluorine is a lively element. 

      Beats being eaten, for sure, but that's uh not always the outcome of losing to an Abyss monster.

      - u/scruiser:
        ```
        I think its implied you can choose the volume that gets transmuted?  So transmute the brain to instant kill the monster and "only" blow up the head in a reaction that hopefully isn't so explosive that the skulls fragments are dangerous.  Actually, since the skull has hole, wouldn't the explosion be directed out the nose/eye sockets?

        Do the tentacle monsters have central nervous systems to destroy this way?
        ```

        - u/Roxolan:
          ```
          > transmute the brain

          You'd have to touch the rod directly to the brain to do that.

          Limiting the area to the head would still be safer than the entire body, though even just hitting a hostile monster in the head is non-trivial.
          ```

  - u/Dragongeek:
    ```
    Is there any size/shape limit besides volume? If not, you can do some fucky things by for example transmuting a 1mm x 1mm x 1000 km long shape to create super long wires, coils, or cloth or transmute super thin sheets of something multiple times to slice it or create perforation seams. Alternatively, you could for example transmute finished shapes like a set of armor or something by filling a container with a noble gas and then back-transmuting the specific shape you want into a solid metal

  You are a 3000 year old immortal human who travels across the multiverse visiting different Earths. Your occupation is “Professional Kingdom Builder”. (I might change it later so that he also has a small crew of professionals like a doctor, and civil engineer and such.) You crash land in medieval England with pretty much the exact same history of Earth up to when you arrive. Circa early 1300s. What would be the minimum amount of time needed to create a modern day satellite and all the things associated with it such as a computers and the tech required for it? For plot reasons they are on a race against time to do this is as quickly as possible. I’m guess maybe two centuries at most maybe three considering how long it took to go from 1800 to noon landing in 1961. Can it be done in an even shorter time? Thanks.

  Edit: 
  Bonus: How much longer would it take if they started from the Roman Empire? Would it just be an extra hundred years?

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    The first step would be to accrue power, and a lot of it, since you don't want to have to fight rival factions every step of the way, and it lets us handwaved cultural problems. Let's say you're really good, and become absolute dictator within 40 years, starting from basically nothing. Your next challenge is that you have the technology/infrastructure base of medieval England. You're going to need to spend decades simply educating the people who educate the other people who educate the people who do direct work. You're introducing science to a culture that, what, still follows the four humours theory? You need to have a hugely accelerated industrial revolution, since 95%+ of your workforce producing food is not a great method of launching things into space. You obviously have a lot of advantages since you can just hand over blueprints of a Bessemer converter or a steam locomotive, along with tried and tested methods of making those things, but you're also industrializing an entire country at a ludicrous pace.

    I think you should set your sights lower than a modern day satellite, since they're just so highly complex and computerized, requiring global transportation infrastructure, resource gathering, and uncountable specialized jobs. Getting the equivalent of Sputnik into space within 200 years would be an astonishing success.

    I think the scope of this problem is so huge that you're never going to get anything like a complete answer as to how long it would take, not in a reddit post. The societal upheaval alone is something you could write a book about, going from most of your population being uneducated farmers, to a vastly larger population that shares almost nothing in common with their parents. Subsistence farmer to factory worker to industrial chemist in 3 generations. 

    I could go on, because it would take hours just to write a barebones outline of all the things you would need to do, discounting research time, but I think that's enough for now.

    Starting in the Roman Empire would IMO be easier, at the very least because the Roman Empire controlled a larger territory, had a higher population, and was generally more technologically and socially advanced. But as for quantitative differences? Somewhere between a 0 and 100 year speed up, and that's as close as I can confidently say.

      Thanks for the comment. I am aiming to make a novel out of this and a realistic out of that or close to it as possible. The kingdom building ones I see operate on too short a timeframe or have too many things to right so quickly that it kind of throws off the suspension of disbelief. I think I’ll start with medieval England as there are more records of that time and the conflict in society would serve for some drama. I guess pinning it around 300 years could work. Thanks again for the ideas.

        You may run into some moral problems, because as I view it, the absolute first step is to completely upend medieval society and install your protagonist as God-king. Feudal society is extremely unsuited for an extremely rapid scientific industrialization. Your protagonist would be opposed by basically every entrenched power there is, along a variety of lines. The Church in particular would be directly opposed to almost every action you take, every idea you have, and the Church is a *powerful* force in medieval society. You'd be opposed by basically the entire population. I kind of skimmed over it, because the industrialization part is IMO more interesting, but it's an immense hurdle to get over before you can even start. 

        Installing your character as dictator for life, as the beginning of your novel or series of novels, would... uh... maybe give you some backlash from your readers.

    I'd guess about 80-90 years. I'm assuming that if I have the means to get to this time/place in the first place, I can bring along a laptop, portable projector, and solar charger so that I can have access to thousands of downloaded reference manuals and schematics, textbooks, the entirety of Wikipedia, all published patents, reports regarding oil, gas, and mineral deposits, etc. Given that I'm 3,000 years old, I'm assuming I've probably also done this before, or at least I've done this around a similar time/place and I've learned enough to think that this approach would be easier than my previous attempts. For example, I probably already know who to turn to for assistance early on, and may have even worked with them previously.

    Given all that, I don't think it's unreasonable that I'd be able to maneuver into national leadership position very quickly, possibly in under a year. For example, arriving in January of 1381 and befriending [Wat Tyler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Tyler) could be a quick way to overthrow Richard II and end up in a pseudo-leadership position before the end of the year serving as Wat's *extremely* knowledgeable advisor, basically implementing an early Oliver Cromwell gambit by proxy.

    From that point, quickly teaching people is going to be a significant barrier, as /u/suctumbo mentioned. Given a position of national leadership and access to future knowledge, I suspect it wouldn't be too difficult to secure a position as a teacher for teachers. I've listed every subject I could think of that might need to be covered, and it shouldn't actually require more than about 14 years, which is fantastic (!) because I doubt that the laptop, projector, and solar panel would last much longer than that without maintenance, even if they're all designed to be rugged and long-lasting.  I expect these would constitute the bare minimum to get the ball rolling:

    This adds up to 332 credits worth of classes for me to cover. Assuming I could teach 12 credits per semester (and assuming I hire a few trustworthy scribes to make students' copies of all of the appropriate textbooks and reference manuals), I would only need a little more than 27 semesters to complete all of this material, and I'd leave summer and winter available for remedial classes or miscellaneous scheming. On the plus side, I've probably taught all this material several times before, so I have the benefit of experience when I'm preparing and presenting lessons tailored towards a medieval-era classroom.

    With Cambridge busily discussing and sharing the absurd treasure trove of information given to them, I could turn my attention fully towards succession and industrialization. For example, given that I know where all the gold and silver mines are around the world, and that I've tried mining most of them a few times already, I should be able to use my earnings from teaching to scoop up ownership of a particularly profitable mine, hire workers, and purchase equipment to exploit the mine as quickly as possible. I could provide directions on exactly where and how to get the ore, I would already know where to hire the cheapest and most reliable workers, I would've already encountered the most likely setbacks, and I would know who would be most likely to invest enormous sums of money once they see how profitable my ventures are. I would expect annual growth rates well surpassing that of Amazon in real-life (~31% on average), quite plausibly in the range of 50% annual growth rates due to both enormous profit margins and frenzied investment.

    If I can sustain that pace of growth, then within seventy years, I would have multiplied my investment by over a trillion times. By this point, I would likely have the required financial resources and the country would likely have the barebones of the required industrial capabilities to launch a crude satellite into orbit.

        FWIW, I disagree with the above poster on a lot of issues.

        First and foremost, acquiring enough power to make the changes would not at all be as easy as becoming the advisor to some prominent historical figure. As an entertaining overview, [these](https://acoup.blog/2019/06/04/new-acquisitions-how-it-wasnt-game-of-thrones-and-the-middle-ages-part-ii/) [two](https://acoup.blog/2019/06/12/new-acquisitions-how-it-wasnt-game-of-thrones-and-the-middle-ages-part-iii/) blog posts outline the basics of feudal society. I kind of alluded to this in other comments, but you'll note that not only is there no existing position with even a fraction as much legislative power as you would need to make your desired changes in this society, the entire system prohibits someone from getting that much power. Even if you became king within a year, the king does not hold all that much power. He's the first among equals. The various other lords and nobility all have their own control over their domains, power that they aren't giving up peacefully. You would have to fundamentally change feudal society in order to get as much power as you would need, because there is no possibility of working within the system to rule over significant parts of the country. And that fundamental change basically means a series of wars. Wars you could win, sure, you have access to information centuries ahead of the time, but you're going to spend a lot of time, resources, and people waging a war of domination against everyone around you.

        Second is the problem of religion. Modern people don't always realize just how revolutionary various ideas were that we now take for granted, both societal and scientific. The idea that the Earth is not the center of the universe was heretical: Galileo spent the rest of his life under house arrest for it. The germ theory of disease was highly divisive because it meant doctors were unclean, that they needed to wash their hands to become clean, and that they had been inadvertently killing numerous patients because of their ignorance. These ideas and a dozen more would be foundational parts of any education you try to give to medieval people, and these heretical ideas would be fundamentally incompatible with religious teaching at the time.

        That leads into opposition from heavily religious people of the time, i.e. almost everyone. The separation of church and state is a modern idea. The church was a foundational institution, and would employ a huge portion of the already literate men you would ideally want to use to educate the rest of the population in addition to its vast social and legal powers. Being excommunicated by the Church in medieval England means your life is basically over, because the Church commanded vast social power. The various ideas you try to educate your population with would get your entire government excommunicated a dozen times over, in addition to the dozen excommunications you got for supplanting the Church's existing legal powers. You'd have constant revolts. I really think there would be another Crusade from the rest of the continent, attempting to stop your heresy, which would be yet another war to fight while also trying to industrialize a nation.

        I really wasn't exaggerating when I said you would be opposed by every entrenched power that exists.

        Moving on to the education itself, I think the course lists the above poster gave are just funny. Starting at the low end, these are college/mildly pre-college classes that only work with an already high school educated populace. High schools that don't exist, using teachers that don't exist, teaching students who are badly needed on their parents' farms. I really do think it would take decades: you would first have to make a grade school through high school curriculum, teach the teachers who would teach the children, wait for them to be raised, until eventually they get to your college where you can teach them.

        Keep in mind that you're trying to do this when most of the existing literate people work for the Church, and would ideologically oppose doing literally anything for you. Also keep in mind that your initial teachers will suck, because high student to teacher ratios mean worse education, and you're the only teacher.

        And then there's after college; college is not at all a complete education. For the types of technical positions you would need, it is a baseline of education that allows you to become actually educated in the specific job you will do. Education which only exists on paper, because those jobs don't actually exist yet. There's no economies of scale here, there's so many minor jobs that you will never have time to directly teach people how to do them well. Your initial educated workforce will all suck because they had no one to teach them the ins and outs of their trade.

        That then leaves the job of setting up rail lines, making mines and smelteries, setting up factories, all that good stuff, which at least has the advantage of clear historical precedent. No real clue as to how technology would advance when all the science and engineering is worked out from the start, and it just needs to be built. You'll also have to deal with the largest population boom possible, which should be neat.

        I don't really get the point in talking about wealth and investments and whatever. The only way you're starting this off is by becoming god-king of England. Your wealth is the wealth of the country. It's not going to increase on a smooth exponential like that. Nor does the money in your bank matter at all: you're limited by infrastructure and technology.

        Anyways, that's what I thought of last night, hope it helps with your novel.

          Thanks. I agree the church would be a huge obstacle and being a king wouldn't be the end all as an early goal. I agree there would be a huge war if they outright reject the church. I think then something to start out from would be to influence or become part of the church through deceit. (Something like make them believe that the pope has been chosen by God to lead the people into the future or something. Then again the pope is in Rome so that would be difficult lol.) The blogs have been really helpful in understanding that specific time period. Thanks for that.

  **Generic Fantasy Necromancy**:  Dead bodies can be animated with touch contact and a minute or so of concentration (ten of minutes for inexperienced necromancers).  They will stay animated for several weeks before crumbling away.  This time can be extended by sacrificing living animals, generally as much continued animation as the calories of the animal.  Repeatedly extending the time may cause the reanimated body to wear away eventually.  Bodies that are just skeletons require scaffolding of additional material to hold them together.  Bodies that have been dead longer hold up to repeated extension of animation time better.

  The bodies are controlled by the animating necromancer until another necromancer spends a few minutes with touch contact and concentration. The bodies can be commanded to perform any simple physical task the necromancer can or that the body was able to do in life, but they have poor coordination and poor motor skills, especially if only one or the other is able to perform the task.  If both the necromancer knows the skill and the body had the skill in life, the animated body can perform the task with okay coordination.  Tasks that require mental effort beyond single digit addition or sorting by a single digit number of categories are beyond the animated.  With focus, the necromancer can control a single specific body with precision.  Range of control is a few miles (for inexperienced necromancers) to tens of miles (for experienced necromancers).  Reanimated

  Necromancy requires several months of meditation and mental exercise to get the basic animation and several years to get better at control, gain more range, and be able to give more detailed commands, and reduce the time concentrating required.

  Economically most valuable usages (modern/medieval/fantasy setting)?  Munchkinry loopholes I missed?  Best way to weaponize?

    Does it work on animals? Do they still have the same level of addition and categorization ability? If so, you can make computers out of lots of zombie rats. Probably limited to vacuum tube era complexity, but you can get there without electricity. Early computers were used to compute artillery firing tables, tabulate business expenses/resources/etc, brute force tables of results for scientific equations, and for cryptography. So those are all more advanced than you may expect. (This is all possible with animated  humans of course, but you should just hire a human computer instead.)

    In more modern settings, grasping and basic object recognition are extremely hard for robots/computers and trivial for humans, so you should expect zombie labor to be integrated into more conventional factories where that's applicable. Fruit picking in particular is still very manual. However, our society jumps through some extra hoops to pay migratory farm workers particularly little, so it'd be hard to get your zombie prices lower than that.

    The way you've defined the limitation of zombies doesn't make them *that* much cheaper than a harshly exploited labor force. In the ancient era, mine labor was considered a death sentence, and turning a mill stone a particularly harsh death sentence, and society still found a way to make those things happen. Your zombie setup gets a few extra weeks of work out of the slaves in exchange for a few minutes of work from an expert, so necromancy is a good profession to be in, but it would only be a marginal gain on overall economic output. If I understand your rules for extending an animation correctly (human calorie needs but meat only?) then this option would essentially never be used, since it's more expensive than feeding a slave.

    Military-wise, zombies can be used to deliver suicide bombing attacks or chemical weapons. Otherwise, the high cost means you'd mostly be limited to turning the enemy's recently-killed dead against them. In the ancient or early modern world, where large field battles left lots of dead lying around, that'd be a strong supplement to your next battle. In the medieval world, where most warfare was sieges and small raids, you wouldn't frequently have fresh dead around to make that big of a difference.

      > Does it work on animals? 

      Yes, but since the human necromancer’s motor skills are not those of an animal, there would be a penalty to motor coordination and skill, unless the necromancer spends years practicing and specializing with the animal.

      > Do they still have the same level of addition and categorization ability? 

      If the animal could hypothetically learn single digit addition and single digit complexity categorization the zombie of the animal can as well.

      > If so, you can make computers out of lots of zombie rats. Probably limited to vacuum tube era complexity, but you can get there without electricity.

      Clever idea.  Not a lot better than vacuum tubes, but still very useful in the early modern era for stuff like calculating tables of logarithms.  Also the zombie rat computer either needs good design to keep each rat simple and interchangeable and/or the necromancer needs a lot of skill in giving commands to make the zombies follow mathematical commands.

      > In more modern settings, grasping and basic object recognition are extremely hard for robots/computers

      That is a good point.  Even simple object recognition might be very valuable in automated applications.

      > If I understand your rules for extending an animation correctly (human calorie needs but meat only?) then this option would essentially never be used, since it's more expensive than feeding a slave.

      The sacrifice is 100% efficient in transferring life energy to the zombie, so it gets calories out of parts of the animals humans might have trouble digesting or safety eating (bones, offal, etc.).  And I meant to imply the zombie has less caloric needs than a living human in upkeep... still meat is valuable so you are right that keeping the zombies going might be more expensive or at least logistically complicated than it’s worth for many potential ancient applications.

      > In the ancient or early modern world, where large field battles left lots of dead lying around, that'd be a strong supplement to your next battle.

      Good point. I’ve read about that distinction in scale of battles in different eras before (in ASOIAF analyses), but I didn’t think about the implications to mass reanimation.

        If the analysis you were reading was [acoup](https://acoup.blog/2019/06/12/new-acquisitions-how-it-wasnt-game-of-thrones-and-the-middle-ages-part-iii/) then this is going to sound very familiar :-).

        The difference in scale during the medieval period was a product of a collapse in centralized state power in that period in Europe, and isn't a set in stone thing that has to happen in a fantasy setting. You could have medieval technology and much of medieval aesthetics and still have big battles like this, if that's what you want.

        Raids and sieges are a feature of a society where armies are small enough to actually be defeated by a castle wall. Those small armies are what you can get out of a system of hierarchical fealty relations, where the largest possible army comes from the king asking all his vassals to ask all their vassals to bring as many troops as possible. If your army is instead a permanent professional military paid in the taxes collected by your centralized government, that can be large and disciplined enough to skip the siege and build a ramp.

      Disagree on this part. The zombie magically consuming a live animal is still useful because you can use animals that normally humans wouldn't eat, and you remove any effort expended in processing the animal to turn it into food. I'm thinking that you could breed rats to then give to the zombies, because rats feed on almost anything, breed quickly, and are too small and gross for humans to eat in normal circumstances.
      ```

      - u/scruiser:
        ```
        You are thinking along the same lines I was... Sacrificing rats to the zombies was exactly what I was thinking of as a use.  And the sacrifice counts the whole animal, even offal that a human couldn’t eat.  And the zombie uses the calories more efficiently than a living human.  So at the very least, zombie beat slave labor in calorie efficiently that way, although the logistics of living animals might be too annoying to work with.  (You could feed the rats trash and save on food costs and get enough rats for a few zombies, but any large scale farming of rats that exceeds the trash you have would require a more dedicated food source for the rats and possibly lose the cost efficiency.)

  You are the Avatar, from the universe of Avatar the Last Airbender. What synergies between the elements exist that allow you to accomplish far more than similarly skilled benders of only a single element?
  ```

  - u/scruiser:
    ```
    I’ve thought on this one before...

    Water bending clouds mixed with air bending and maybe earth bending of particulates in the air (if sand bending works this seems possible), let’s you generate static electricity which you then control with lightening bending.  Not a huge advantage over conventional lightening bending, but it should let you produce lower/less lethal voltages and spread the lightening around more.

    Metal bending and lightening bending seems like they might lead to magnetism bending, but I can’t think of any good applications for magnetism bending that metal bending can’t do.

    We already see Lava bending in LoK.

    By precisely controlling the water and earth separately in mud you could probably get it to do stuff like soil liquefaction or make make the mud hard like the cornstarch and water trick.  Earthbending can already do that on its own though.

    Bend coal into a fine powder, spread with Earth and air bending, then set off massive explosions with fire bending.

    Hmm.. Most of the synergies I can think of are kind of redundant with the raw power and precision the Avatar can already do with a single element with the Avatar state.
    ```

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      The Avatar state has a pretty severe downside, and isn't used often. I'd say just ignore it.

      >but I can’t think of any good applications for magnetism bending that metal bending can’t do.

      Since earthbending echolocation is a thing, I wonder if it would be possible to do a magnetbending MRI it you knew what you were doing?
      ```

      - u/scruiser:
        ```
        Possibly?  If I recall correctly, MRI uses the magnetic resonance you get from different quantities of water and other properties that alter magnetic resonance, (I know fMRI is basically just seeing blood flow)... so it would probably just be more efficient to use/develop a sense of blood and blood flow (presumably blood bending+Earthbending echolocation could let you invent blood echolocation)...
        ```

        - u/ricree:
          ```
          Fair enough. In that case, the best use I can think of is making strong permanent magnets for non-benders to use. Potentially, it could help kick off electrification earlier.
          ```
