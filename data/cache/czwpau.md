  Well there you go, a nice 18k word drop to round out this arc of the story.

  As promised last week I'll be going on a brief hiatus, both to finish moving and also to recover a bit of sanity and plot out what I *sincerely* hope will be the final leg of this strange adventure.

  Thank you so much to everyone who's reading along, everyone who's leaving positive comments, everyone who's leaving *intensely* sourced Pathfinder rules lawyering, all the spellcheckers, the artists, that one guy who may eventually produce a translation of this whole thing in *russian*... you've taken this from a lark, a first attempt at writing something for the public that I thought wasn't going to go anywhere, and turned it into a passion project for me.

  Posts will resume in October, unless I finish a surprise or two to drop on you in the meantime. See you there!

  Hot damn has it been a wild ride! The level of escalation that the arc got to was simply insane; you frickin started this story with a guy and his wife trying to talk down some rando cops and now they're facing down frickin zombie space marines with magical mind dragons!
  I'll be totally honest with you, if this was the end of the story proper I wouldn't be the least discontent (baring the juicy drop of that metanarrative pre-story super war, that sounds like a hella interesting plot thread).
  On the other hand, WE GONNA HAVE A PICNIC IN MORDOR WITH DELMUT! Woo!
  Thanks so much for the story bud. Enjoy your new house, moving is a pain but it's also pretty invigorating changing up your daily routine, at least in my experince.

  I'm trying to find the comments for this story so I can keep up with the hype, but I don't see any on archive of our own or Reddit....do I need to log in to the former in order to see them? Any help would be appreciated as I'm totally lost, thanks.

  Immensely satisfying. A time loop did make an appearance, most excellent, and without all the gory details, well done.  I'll be reading when you pick it back up, many mysteries to resolve.

  Holy shit. What a wild ride. It's been fun thus far, so let's get October here already.

  So I'm thinking we got classic Warhammer 40k marines running about, but I can't make sense of their corruption being from within their universe, another narrative force, or just plain magic.
