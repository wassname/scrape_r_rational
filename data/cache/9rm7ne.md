## [RST] [TH] [WIP] Where Only Names Grow

### Post:

Short version: This story is a mixture of horror and solvable whodunnit murder mystery set in what I guess I can only describe as a very advanced, post-post-apocalyptic fantasy setting, though that doesn't _quite_ capture it correctly. It's about a woman who solves crimes that took place in the distant past, while slowly trying to unwrangle her family legacy. [Start here.](https://whereonlynamesgrow.com/2018/10/25/introduction/) 

Longer version: Some of you might remember me posting this story under a different title last year. After a bunch of critiques about the pacing and structure of the story, I went back to the drawing board, and over the course of several months it sort of transformed into something very different. This time, I have everything planned out in a lot more detail, so hopefully it won't run out of steam again. Almost everything is different except for one of the prologue chapters.

I don't really know how to describe this story in simple terms any more without using a lot of pretentious terms like "experimental" or "meta", but I'm posting it here because, aside from obviously including a great deal of introspection and reasoning by virtue of its genre, it also features a lot of the subject matter that appears popular with this crowd. Without saying too much, the story is in part about death, birth, and mourning in a society where those concepts have been deeply subverted by technological and circumstantial change, and people trying to overcome those problems.

I hope you enjoy it.

  Oh, I'm glad it's back. I enjoyed it in its previous iteration.

  Glad you're taking another crack at this one. Murder mysteries are right up my alley, but I couldn't get into the story the first time around. This version was definitely easier to follow, immediately leading with a smaller mystery gave me something to chew on. I generally like closed rooms, meta commentary, and explicit reliable and unreliable narrators so this is ticking a lot of boxes for me.

  As for the observatory mystery, I'm excited to dig into that one. All of my initial thoughts were shut down or at least touched on (the telescope was *empty*- bah, thought I had something there). I think I remember you saying in the previous version that there would be several smaller mysteries like this, and I hope that's carried forward.

    Thanks for pointing out the typos! Not sure what happened in that last paragraph.

    I'm glad you found it easier to get into this time. In retrospect, the first version was a mess in a lot of regards - I got a ridiculous amount of words deep without offering much clarity on the setting, the main characters, or the general direction of the plot, just hoping to keep the readers attention by intrigue alone. Other than just overestimating my technical skill and a lack of concrete planning resulting in poor pacing, I think my biggest mistake was how I was using the format; I approached it basically the same way as you'd write a novel, only with a bigger word count, when with a serial the inherent investment that comes from buying a book just isn't there.

    I spent a lot of time thinking about how best to structure a slow-paced, ambiguous story like this in a way that could better keep people's attention early on. In some ways I think the result is still pretty flawed - right up until yesterday I was thinking about ways I could cut out the Prologue (1) part completely and throw people directly into a mystery, but I couldn't figure out a way to convey the context it provides more succinctly in a way that didn't feel forced. I hope it doesn't lose me too many readers.

    (edit: Actually, I might just end up cutting it and folding some information into the subsequent part, even if it comes out a bit crudely. It looks like a lot of readers are dropping off in it right now.)

    I'm open to any suggestions if anyone else is reading this, though obviously how much you can really edit a mystery without it being sort of cheating is limited.
