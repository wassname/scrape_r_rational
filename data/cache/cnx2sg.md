    Can you imagine the moment of 'I've been fucked' when he acts as attorney to a losing case for a young Hero vs. Villian at Cat's Academy.

  Looks like this is probably the last chance to theorycraft on the Bard's plans. Final theory from me is that the Liesse Accords are what she's been working towards. She's: 

  - Made sure the Doom happened to give Cat the idea.

  - Killed Captain to make sure Black would take her seriously as a threat and destroy the weapon.

  - Set up a Crusade against Praes so Malicia would make a deal with the Dead King to get everyone at the bargaining table

  - Broke Cordelia's trust in the heroes and made sure peace couldn't be made with Callow so that the only route possible for Procer to survive would be through the Accords.

  - Stripped Hierophant of his magic too...idk, we'll see what happens. Maybe so Sve Noc would end up reading his mind, and then they'd get a wake up call against blindly walking into stories that'll kill them and obliterate the drow, who'll probably be a key part of the Accords.

    It seems like a bit of a stretch that the bard would be *that* good at playing the long game. But that she had something like the Accords in mind seems plausible.

    Could you elaborate how the Bard broke Cordelia's trust in heroes? I don't think I recall what you are referring to.
    ```

      In one of cordelias interludes is showed that the saint influenced the priests to name cat the arch heretic of the east and making every treaty with her invalid and peace wih her almost imposible. This would in turn deprive cordelia of allies/give her another enemy while the dead king pounded the door and eventually destroy the principate. All that because the saint though that the principate is rotten to the core and must be cleansed.
      ```

    It can't *just* be that.  Remember, the Dead King (who was risking - and ended up losing - a *piece of his soul* to perform a ritual to find out) heavily implied that if the heroes and villains knew just what the Bard was up to, they'd all turn on her in an instant.

    The Liesse Accords are definitely a piece of it, but, if that were all, why would old Neshamah think that people would be *that* pissed off at her?  Sure, this plan of hers has cost hundreds of thousands of lives, but it has the potential to save tens of millions, or more.  The heroes would grumble at the methods used but bow to the greater good, and the villains would applaud the sheer ruthlessness she used to achieve her goals.

    No, there's something else she's trying to accomplish.  Something that requires the Liesse Accords, yes, but something a lot less popular than those have proven to be.

    And I can't wait to see what it is.

  Good to see that she's the responsible one.

  So what now Bard? I mean you said to the Swordsman that her brand of Evil wasn't guaranteed, that the gains for the small folk weren't set in stone but enforced by a single regimes strength and that it could all end with the next Dread Emperor/Empress? We've seen the little bits of influence that she had on the Tyrant, the Dead King and even bits of a plan for Amadeus. So what does she see wrong here? 

  I mean Cat's big thing is the somewhere between transitions and the finding of a "Better Way/World" we've seen here marry Praes training with the steadfast nature of the Callow people, we've seen her marry Summer and Winter ending their reigns for the possibility of something new, we've seen her change in both big and small ways the Drow's culture all the way up to influencing the Night Goddesses themselves to be better. So why is there only a problem now Bard?
  ```

  - u/Nimelennar:
    ```
    There wasn't.  She even said so.

    The problem was that Cat was going to try to turn the Pilgrim against the Bard.  And, while the Liesse Accords themselves might suit the Bard's plans, not being able to meddle with them obviously doesn't.

  >“That is uncanny,” she muttered.

  is this a reference to something?
  ```

  - u/Don_Alverzo:
    ```
    Black said the same thing when he and Bard spoke in the Book 4 Epilogue.
    ```

    - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
      ```
      haha, nice

  That's one helluva cliffhanger. Must be Friday!
