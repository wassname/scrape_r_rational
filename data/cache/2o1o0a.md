  I'm curious as to what other muggle nations think about a nuclear weapon being used on the UK so soon after the Cold War. The Soviet Union is gone, but post-soviet states still have their weapons and resources, and so do the Americans, and so do all the European nations in firing range of someone willing to use nukes. Just *moving* nuclear weapons has caused international incidents that nearly destroyed the planet.

    Especially since it was apparently fired WITHOUT approval.

    Yeah, I'd probably be more worried about that little factor than random wizard attacks on the level of civil unrest.

    Good point.  By that act Quirrell would have moved the world closer to an all-out nuclear war, not farther.  All it would take is one guy in Russia with an itchy trigger finger deciding that this is the beginning of a war.  Especially with the complete mess that was in Russia immediately after the dissolution of USSR.

  Yay, Greengrasses are coming to Ukraine! (which just got it's independence - USSR had fallen less than a year ago, so the economics it not in great state)

  I kinda stopped following this story somewhere around chapter 20, after reading the heavy criticism the "Muggle War" plotline was getting. Now the rewriting's all done, it safe to jump back in?

    It's a lot better, though perhaps still not as good as the earlier chapters. I'd say it's safe.
