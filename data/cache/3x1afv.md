  Besides this, how would you go about munchkining canon WH40k?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Canonically, you actually can't: the Grimdark Force will stop you.

    That said, I consider canon WH40k to be kind of... *incoherent*, because nobody ever actually *reinvents* clear, rational thought *in ten millennia of human existence across an entire galaxy*.  The Old Ones, the Eldar, the Necrons, and even the goddamn Interex (basically Culture/Federation expies) are all said to have had Sufficiently Advanced technology, *and yet*, none of the scientific theories behind such technologies are *in any way* recoverable via *mere experimentation*.

    WH40k should be considered an example of what happens when you try to run a universe on souls and magic and it backfires massively, because it would ultimately have been simpler and more robust to your universe coherency (eg: the number of times direct paraphysical intervention becomes necessary just to keep Time running) just to use science.

    Oh, and half the time, Chaos will fuck your shit up, and if you're human-aligned, you can't actually get rid of Chaos, because it's fueled by *your SOOOOOUUUUL*, without which you will *literally* turn into a p-zombie.  No joke.  The Necrons are basically, "this one species got cancer all the time, so they tried to upload themselves into robot bodies, AND IT WENT HORRIBLY WRONG BECAUSE STAR GODS ATE THEIR SOULS."
    ```

      The funny thing about 40k is that every race/faction has a different reason for lacking progress. 

      Eldar are just trying to survive long enough to create a god (Ynnead) that can kill the thing that eats their souls when they die. They seem to act fairly reasonably in this context, surprisingly. 

      The Mechanicus lost the vast majority of people that actually understood their tech back in the heresy, and their god (Omnimessiah/ probably the void dragon) seems to actively encourage recovery of old data over finding of new, so good luck with them. They also get severely angry when any other humans try to take away their tech monopoly.

      The tau are too small to matter, and also are brainwashed by their ethereal caste. There's also weak evidence that they were created as a weapon against and/or attempt to redeem the necrons.

      The orks had their intended intelligent caste/subspecies go extinct, and were designed as a weapon anyways. Despite this, they seem to often build new things, and even seem to have attempts at research. It's unclear whether their constant state of warfare keeps them from progressing. 

      Chaos is not really worth mentioning here, but I will note that Tzeentch (one of the big 4 gods of chaos and also the god of hope) explicitly schemes against himself and his followers because it's more fun that way. 

      The necrons are kind of weird here. They had a working society with no ftl and a multi star system empire that was advanced enough to have a chance against a ftl capable progenitor race, then made a deal with soul eating star gods for immortal bodies and a way of breaking into their enemy's ftl network. They somehow managed to get their average citizens to lose mental acuity and maybe sapience in this deal, allegedly due to said star gods doing something, which can be alternately blamed on poor computational substrate in new bodies or maybe their souls getting eaten. On the bright side, they did successfully murder the abusive precursor race they were fighting, and they also destroyed/captured the star gods that betrayed them. It really says something about the universe when these seem to be the most effective race...

        I think the *really* big question about the Necrontyr is: how could they have lost their SOOOOUUUUULS and become p-zombie Cybermen if they had no Warp presence in the first place?
        ```

        - u/obviousdisposable:
          ```
          Good point. They canonically have souls, because the C'tan were bribed by using them as snacks. 

          Maybe them having minimal warp presence pre C'tan is no longer canon?

      This is why I love 40k. Where even the good guys are semi-xenocidal, brainwashed, communist theocrats. (As opposed to all the other factions, who don't even bother with the "semi-" and skip straight to xenocidal or even omnicidal.)
      ```

      - u/Transfuturist:
        ```
        >communist

        Well, first of all, not all centrally-planned economies are communist (I would describe the Imperium as more of a military fascist theocracy), and second, is the Imperium centrally planned?
        ```

        - u/GaBeRockKing:
          ```
          I'm talking about the Tau.
          ```

          - u/Transfuturist:
            ```
            I thought the Imperium was the good guys. I'm not too familiar with 40K, I just picked some stuff up from sup/tg/.
            ```

            - u/GaBeRockKing:
              ```
              The imperium are the main characters, but they're also massive dickbags, mostly out of necessity. Tau are marginally less evil mainly because their policy for aliens is "brainwashing an assimilation" rather than "purging and xenocide."
              ```

            - u/redrach:
              ```
              /tg/ tend to despise Tau, seeing them as 'weeaboo' (probably due to their mecha-inpsired aesthetic), so their view of them is pretty biased.
              ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          The Imperium range between capitalist and feudalist, with a heavy dose of loosely-enforced but genocidal religious fundamentalism.  That is, if you're an Imperial citizen, you've probably done something "worthy" of Exterminatus, but you'll only *actually* get Exterminatus if an Inquisitor actually shows up, which they mostly don't.

          For context, basically every meme you've ever seen about xenos, HERESY, BLAM, and "HUMANITY FUCK YEAH" was, quite unfortunately in the last case, Warhammer 40k-related.

          The Tau are called "weaboo space communists", and are considered "too good" for the setting because they're *merely* Totalitarian Utilitarians who're willing to *use fucking diplomacy for once* and accept other species as vassals rather than being outright xenocidal.
          ```

          - u/Transfuturist:
            ```
            Actually, I read the Humanity Fuck Yeah threads and they're 40K-unrelated. It's more like humanity porn, where humans are the most X in a galaxy of not-very-X aliens. Humanity is the most militaristically psychotic. Humanity is the only species able to lie. Humanity is the most adaptable species. Humanity will fuck literally anything that moves and a lot of things that don't.

            I find it quite enjoyable, despite its masturbatory nature.

              > Humanity is the most militaristically psychotic.

              How do you think that's unrelated to 40k?

              >Humanity will fuck literally anything that moves and a lot of things that don't.

              Actually, among the natural world, that *is* an unusual feature of the human species.  *Really* weirdly strong sex drive.

      One explanation is that its very difficult to maintain coherent infrastructure at scale in this universe. When it takes long time periods to travel between star systems and theres a real risk of any ship getting lost or delayed you need the insane imperial levels of forced cooperation to get anything done. 

      It may also just be a fact of this universe that technological progress becomes exponentially more difficult. Even pre dark age humanity doesn't seem to have invented anything ridiculously powerful, just better versions of the conventional tech the imperium uses, aided by weak AI. The few things the eldar have done above this are more reliant on warp powers 

      Its basically a universe where technological solutions can't really exist to the major problems, and the species are stuck in a hobbesian/malthusian death spiral

        Except that Dark Age!Humanity *did*, until they developed asshole psykers and all Mankind starts killing each-other for asshole reasons.

    Depends on the era. If it's early imperium, the emperor could probably have done a lot better with some small changes, like warning his primarchs about chaos. 

    Modern day? The space wolves have the right non-mechanicus tech base and connections to have a shot of improving things, but don't think that way. If you manipulate the void dragon's prison so it ?goes back? to encouraging finding new information, it might work. IIRC, ark Mechanicus ships have proper ai and full stc data but the Mechanicus don't know this, so that might work too

          It *moved the enemy ship back in time* so they couldn't dodge while they were being *bombarded with black holes* that were *perfectly targetted during a fucking Warp Storm*.

          Dark Age of Technology!Humanity were downright Tengen Toppa.  Like, holy shit, truly, *there is no kill like motherfucking overkill*.

          Pity the plot never moves forward.

          Its pretty good, does a good job of not making the culture too overpowered when they could easily have broken the thought experiment. And giving some rationalisations for how thigns work in the 40kverse. 

          negatives would be length and lack of engaging characters
          ```

- u/narfanator:
  ```
  40k, at it's base, does a pretty good job of giving a good explanation for why everything is terrible: Free thinking will literally eat your brain.

  Actually, now that I write that, I just want you to go read the Laundry Files and then come back. The necessity of bureaucracy + cthulhuian horrors that come from your brain? Explains a lot.

  THAT SAID, my other favorite "oh hey that makes it make sense" about 40K is that all their tech is basically true Singularity-left overs (although what happened to the AIs is unanswered), and that the "warp" part of their engines (when in real space) is the *heat sink*.

  Edit: So it's not that the Mechanicus doesn't *try* to understand or is unaware that they're a cargo cult - it's that the rituals are literally basically the best understanding possible for a human for the sheer advancedeness of the tech.
