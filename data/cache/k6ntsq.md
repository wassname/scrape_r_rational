  The biggest problem of xianxia tropes is that high level cultivators don't need low level cultivators. Any kind of taxes or tributes  from low to high don't make sense. That make existence of sects and clans kind of pointless. If it's a pure reproduction instinct for high levels existence of that  instinct should be a common knowledge. If it's some kind of divine/karmic law that require high levels to support low levels it also should be a common knowledge.
  ```

  - u/HermitJem:
    ```
    I think that Forty Millenniums of Cultivation makes a decent attempt at addressing this - high level cultivators need resources to maintain their cultivation AND to try to hit even higher levels of cultivation. So this explains their need to set up sects (and companies) to make money to fund their cultivation pursuits. Of course, you \*could\* seek out such materials yourself, but it would probably be less efficient?

    It's the "industrialization" concept - efficiency/progress is created by a large group of the working class
    ```

    - u/OnlyEvonix:
      ```
      I think high level cultivators were compared to attack helicopters or aircraft carriers: incredibly effective in certain situations and qualitatively beyond infantry but require the support of a large industrial society and infantry still have important tactical roles.
      ```

  - u/Se7enworlds:
    ```
    One of the things high level cultivators need to do is suppress low level cultivators from becoming high level ones.

    At each stage resources needed to maintain higher levels of cultivation become increasingly scarce, but there are generally hundreds of lower level cultivators trying to advance.

    Taxes are possibly not necessary, but there to remove resources from the system and diverting them to a friendly power structure, to further winnow competition and ensure those that do thrive have a compatible perspective.
    ```

  - u/Gavinfoxx:
    ```
    Maybe some system where making pills or whatever requires industrialization of cultivation for a sufficient mass of materials to purify and combine? Or the higher levels need certain kinds of food?
    ```

    - u/BoojumG:
      ```
      That was my thought too. Sure, high level cultivators are ridiculously powerful, but they can still only do one thing at a time.

      Superman can do a lot, but no amount of flying really fast or lifting heavy things can feasibly produce a million pounds of beef. An industrialized society can do it easily. Replace "beef" with whatever a high-level cultivator might need a lot of to fuel their further advancement, with "refinement" steps in the middle as needed.
      ```

      - u/Gavinfoxx:
        ```
        There's a bit of discussion of this in the other thread, and apparently my carefully modified post of this in r/Fantasy, even though some jerks are really downvoting it, is giving suggestions for works that handle some of these aspects in ways I really wasn't expecting!
        ```

  - u/burnerpower:
    ```
    I think the civilizations with sects/clans would eventually outcompete those without. While on an individual level there is very little to gain from raising up new cultivators, its a huge benefit to the society. Any society willing to constantly invest in new cultivators is going to on average produce more and better cultivators, and if they do it well those cultivators will be loyal to that society. There's a startup cost for sure and thats a disadvantage, but humans are already predisposed to protecting their tribe and especially their children.
    ```

  - u/KamikazeHamster:
    ```
    In those settings, might makes right. Therefore itâ€™s actually reliant on the schools to produce high level fighters to protect the country. Taxes go to the school or government so they can try to speed up cultivation of all tiers.
    ```

    - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
      ```
      But why do grandmasters care about countries? What do countries do for them in exchange for running sects?

      (Street cultivation had a good answer: the grandmaster liked TV and other modern stuff that needs a globalised world)
      ```

      - u/KamikazeHamster:
        ```
        Having power does not automatically make you an asocial asshole. Sometimes, people are just nice. They might have been raised by a nice family and have good morals, caring for those around them. Sure, there's the "power corrupts" trope, but that's just a shortcut. Even if some are not very forgiving, there's still an underlying love.
        ```

  - u/NotValkyrie:
    ```
    Some novels play with the idea of faith power. High level cultivators are techinically farming low level cultivators and mortals for that energy.
    ```

  - u/ThatEeveeGuy:
    ```
    My first thought on seeing this was that it'd be interesting to have a setting where cultivation works like a pyramid scheme. Raise 10 disciples to level 2 in order to unlock level 3! It's not really in the spirit of how things are in the genre, but.
    ```

- u/CreationBlues:
  ```
  The biggest thing you ignored is the tension between cooperation and resource scarcity. Why is everyone assholes? Because if you don't militantly protect your resources you're gonna have a bad time. Why do people form sects? You need people to have your back, make your tools, make your drugs, and so on. Why do people care about the people below them? Because life is hard and boring and getting people to do the dirty work for you is easy. As for why good manuals are rare, again resource scarcity and difficulty.
  ```

  - u/Gavinfoxx:
    ```
    Uh... that doesn't necessarily come as a direct response to scarce resources.  Humans are, for example, typically adverse to going on multi-murder sprees.  I don't think simple scarcity of the high-value resource is enough to have that show up as a constant, unremarked thing at *every level of society*, as happens in some Xianxia.
    ```

    - u/CreationBlues:
      ```
      There's definitely going to be less violence in general, but there's going to be general classist violence, xenophobic violence, and political violence. The resource scarcity just makes those scuffles count for something. As long as you're not being an asshole to your in-group, and you've got talent, you're gonna be given a pass because that's just how people work.
      ```

    - u/Izeinwinter:
      ```
      My personal take on it is that it is the very long meditation dives. It breaks social bonds, because you desync from everyone else. The typical cultivator spends most of their time meditating... and *the meditation is not on a fixed schedule* - so whenever they are out and about, the set of other people who are out and about is different from the last time, so they cannot form lasting social ties.

    That's to be expected, with their population numbers the number of great works should be much higher than what we currently see. It being hidden by a "not enough interest to be translated because great stuff is not necessarily popular with average people" would go some way to explaining the phenomenon.

    > . Anglophones can comfortably dismiss all of xianxia as trashy and dumb since it never occurs to them that their sample is entirely drawn from the lowest common denominator.

    Do you really get annoyed if a Chinese person says the superhero genre is dumb and trashy? Obviously they are talking about what they have available to consume. 

    Seems pointless to say to them, oh well, the niche stuff is actually good so you're totally wrong. If a new superhero thing is translated it's gonna be exactly the same, so unless they're going to learn English it seems a meaningless difference 

    What's the point? 

    Besides which, you might as well say this in every thread in existence, the quantity of Chinese discussion I will surpass every English forum and will only continue to increase. I can't find simultaneous data but WeChat had 50 billion messages in day in jan 2019 and whatsapp now has 100 billion per day (obviously not all in English)

    A reminder that there is more content than they can access has helped how? How is telling the Chinese that of course there is Worm that they can't read anyway going to help them? Don't discuss the superhero genre Chinese friends because it's already been done on reddit!

  It's already been mentioned in this subreddit a silly number of times, but Will Wight's *Cradle* series hits so many of these points that I feel it would be irresponsible for me to *not* mention it. 

  1) The planet it takes place on is huge, with a wider multiverse outside it.

  2) It's a science-fantasy setting, with madra taking the place of electricity and soulsmiths replacing engineers.

  3) Putting aside the idea that enormous personal power has dangerous effects on the human mind, there are a number of Paths (especially the stronger ones) which directly influence the mind of the user in negative ways. These Paths are highly restricted. (Blackflame, Hunger Paths)

  4) For the most part, it's pointless to fight someone more than two levels above you, so wars are mostly heavy posturing and minor skirmishes until the highest level combatants on each side kill each other, at which point the side which still has high-tier cultivators wins by default.

  5) The economy of Cradle is mostly based on coinlike physical manifestations of personal power (Scales), which means that high-tier cultivators are automatically rich. We haven't delved deep enough into the economy yet to see how rational this system actually is, imo.

  6) Anything can cultivate. One of the most powerful characters in the setting used to be a tree. Then they died, and became a tree ghost, and *kept cultivating*. Of the two major civilizations on the MC's continent, only one is human.

  7) Relative power levels are clear and fairly consistent, although not inviolable.

      I think that's a misunderstanding. >!They simply learned the greater powers we have been hearing about for all the previous books sooner than normal. But in the normal fashion, such that we can see why and how they got there. They didn't break the power levels so much as go around the other way.!<
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Not really a misunderstanding. For most of the series, >!herald and sage were explicitly called out to be only achievable after archlord; even Northstrider said so near the end of Uncrowned!<.  

        The established rules of the setting (laid out by the very top experts) was proven wrong in such a manner as to give the MCs super unique powers/status.
        ```

        - u/cthulhusleftnipple:
          ```
          The conceit of most works of fantasy is that the protagonist(s) are special in some way. Unsurprisingly, the same is true in the Cradle books, though personally I feel it's much better justified than typical. Certainly you can make a case that the main characters power levels have jumped significantly faster than expected, but that's been true the entire story for reasons that are fairly well supported in-story. Would you prefer that the main characters spend a few decades slowly slogging through the power levels because that's typical in their world?
          ```

          - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
            ```
            Special shouldn't mean breaking the established rules. It should mean accomplishing great things within those rules.
            ```

            - u/cthulhusleftnipple:
              ```
              If that's how you see it, then so be it. I don't see it this way.
              ```

    - u/Revlar:
      ```
      I agree to the extent that I agree that the way the powers were achieved was not properly satisfying, but neither really broke the rules.

      The books are BUILT on the narrative of >!the characters stepping above their station and acting out of turn in a system that treats people as known quantities instead of ascendant beings.!< That they end up transgression against the known "order of things" is not out of place.

      Wight's goal was, in my opinion, to have his three protagonists >!approach the final stage of their growth differently from each other. That's how you get the standard path versus the two distinct aberrant ones.!<

  Nobody here going to mention Forty Milleniums of Cultivation? I remember seeing it recc'd here a couple years ago, and keeping up with the daily updates, it's probably the most rational take on xianxia I've seen. It dodges and addresses all the issues and tropes that commonly plague the genre, from the dog eat dog world, power scaling across stages AND time periods, level of civilization, inter-cultivator relations, techniques, and so on.

  From civilization and government as a whole, the relationships and status of Cultivators at all levels, commentary on aspects like the typical and primitive "dog eat dog" worlds you see in other xianxias, FMoC is pretty damn good. I especially love how the author explains certain things like why two sects are killing each other over a piece of poop, and why that's the only logical course of action.

  There's a lot of philosophical talk about civilization and humanity and whatnot, and while it may not be as good as what some people here may prefer, it's much better than virtually every other xianxia.

  FMoC really plays to the strengths of the xianxia genre and does some unique things, like an actual advanced society with mechs and space ships, as well as the perpetual journey of going against the universe and the eternal darkness to survive and thrive. All the characters in the novel are also competent, which very few other xianxias have, and the power scaling and leveling is even more grounded than Cradle's.

  My explanation isn't that good, the rec for FMoC does the novel justice and really explains how it rationalizes the xianxia genre, definitely worth checking out. I'd dare say it's even more rational and logical than Cradle.

    It may be less relevant to the discussion, cause it is a xianxia transplanted to warhammer 40k universe. 

    From what I read, the discussion is about looking at the usual/common tropes we see and trying to see how to sanitize them, to make more sense, to remove senseless exaggeration, etc. To make them more rational. 

    FMoC could provide some insights how to sanitize xianxia (or to make it better quality, rational, adapted to western tastes), but it has too much western world building to it for this discussion. 

    The discussion could also be when xianxia stops being xianxia and becomes westxia (or westia, or wesxia). 

    Face slapping (which is pretty alien idea for people non-familiar with sino culture) would be integral part for country of origins and it is not used (a lot) trope by western authors. 

    So coming back to FMoC - is it still xianxia? or is it already westia?

  There's lots of ways to smooth the sharp edges of Xianxia but the result would depend on the specifics of the baseline laws of reality you chose. Your specific examples make it seem like you have an idea for a setting in which you'd like to see a rational story. That's cool. However I do think that a lot of the problems you're pointing at are more a result of authors not being smarter-enough-than-you to think of everything you'd think of, rather than being unsolvable problems with tropes in the genre. 

  To this day I'm pretty certain that the reason I liked HPMOR, (which is fanfiction of a very trope heavy setting/story), so much more than many other fiction books is just down to Yudkowsky being smarter than me by a large enough margin that he came up with cleverer tricks while _also_ taking the time to change the rules to close all loopholes I would have ever thought of and more.

  To give a few examples of where I think some problems you list _are_ solvable:

  * The only problem with making larger more varied worlds rational, is that you need to build more stuff into the world for them to seem big, and the bigger you build, the more likely you accidentally made an exploitable loophole that the reader will yell at the protagonist for not exploiting. At the other end, smaller worlds can get boring if part of the draw is setting, so going that way can _also_ be bad. Authors just need to find a balance between their ability to find and close plot holes in the world rules, and their desire to include more plot dynamics. 

  * A lot of the things that people think a rational person would recognize as infinite positive feedback loops and exploit, can be easily made unexploitable with additional mechanics that add limits or diminishing returns. There can be interactions between powers that prevent their combination, or training and upkeep-of-training time investment requirements that make wider training focus a severe handicap. What breaks the enjoyment isn't even that there is infinite scaling so much as that bad fiction doesn't do enough to get the reader to accept the reasons infinite scaling isn't user or more widespread.

  * Stories don't even have to be hard scifi or hard fantasy in order to be sane. I love hard magic systems but.. The reader doesn't need to know the rules, nor do the characters, so long as the characters come up with basically everything most readers do, and then act on or explain the infeasibility of those ideas. And good enough descriptions can even allow damaged, less-educated, or less-genius characters to _not_ come up with things the reader would think of, so long as the reader's ideas are acknowledged and dismissed in some other way so that we don't assume the author was just too dumb to see the exploit.

  * Massive battles with tons of collateral can be part of rational stories too, they just have to have an appropriately balanced effect on the outcome. That doesn't mean that stories would have to all be dark, but if large populations in a setting continue to exist afterwards, that would need a satisfying explanation (could be done with cloning, resurrections, higher birth rates, having children always raised in time chambers etc.)

  A lot of that sounds like the galaxy in the Culture novels, except replace people with civilizations. About the only thing that a planetbound civilization can create that's actually valuable to an Involved civilization is primitive artworks.

    Yea, I don't really see the relationship... having read both. They are too utterly different, except for the fact that 'there are things with lots more power than normal folk around'.

    - u/Slinkinator:
      ```
      I see it, think of it more in terms of how your setting plays with scarcity and social construction to create the setting for the type of stories you want to tell.  The way you're constructing this is really similar to the way iain banks constructed the culture.
