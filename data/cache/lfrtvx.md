  That was a really satisfying conclusion, but I can't wait for more.

  I'm glad Tasia's back again, I like her character and want to see more of her. She was sort of peripheral character this volume since she, while she was important to both Ana and Wes' character arcs, she wasn't involved in all the shady merc stuff. She's definitely clued into things now, though, which means I suspect she'll be a more central character in the second volume. Plus she brought Cardamom with her, which is nice.

  Speaking of Tasia, I'm noticing that Ana's still refering to her as "Tasia" and using female pronouns. Normally, that would be the correct thing to do, except I don't know that Tasia actually identifies as female? She wore a female chassis and took a female name because she was replacing Wes in the role of "Rowyna Ebbridge's daughter," but in her interlude she seemed to identify pretty consistently with whatever chassis she was wearing, and she's currently wearing her original male body. This is an understandable thing for Ana to do, of course, since she only got to know Tasia after she'd ousted Wes, but it's still probably something that should be addressed. Funnily enough, Tasia probably has/had a similar issue with Ana, since she only knew her as "Ernest."

  > “The water is rising,” I said.  “It’s time we find out why.” 

  I am super fucking hyped for this. Don't get me wrong, I've really been enjoying the political elements of the story and the revolutionary drama, but in the wake of Commonplace's failure and all the main characters deciding "actually, fuck Paragon," I am entirely ready for the story to shift gears and focus more on the background weirdness of the setting. We've had repeated hints of weird shit in this world that everyone actually living in it seems to take for granted (oracle snakes, the lack of stars, everything about the ocean, etc.), and every one of them has only made me grow more and more curious about what the *fuck* is happening. It's about damn time people start looking for some answers.

  On the subject of weird background shit...

  > Above, to the two moons shining overhead.  Two full moons, or close to it.

  Have we seen mention of the fact that there are two moons before? It's such a subtle thing that it might have come up before and I just missed it.

    I remember something of two moons before yes.

    Edit: Some google-fu gives me several mentions of it
    "I stared up at the night sky, and the **twin crescent moons** overhead." from 10-B
    "She stood over me, a shadow blocking out the **light of the moons**." from as early as 1-D
    Also, 8-B and C, and 12-C mention them, and those are from Grace and Florecen's POVs

  Nixing protection rackets seems like an incredibly bad idea. Because the concept runs both ways, with the business also being protected from criminal rivals. By getting rid of them Ana risks either:

  a. The businesses getting snapped up by rival gangs and mobs, leaving a power vacuum into which violence can flow. The winner may have a far less normal-people friendly mentality than commonplace. Or Paragon might clamp down and in doing so increase their hold over society. Both options will leave a ton of collateral damage and risk rising tensions on the streets.

  b. The businesses turning harder to the government for protection, handing Paragon even more political support, with a socioeconomic class who have historically been some of the key demographics of nationalist authoritarianism and militarism. (From a more useless perspective, keeping protection rackets might help surpress this political dynamic)

  Honestly, this highlights how the squeamishness towards illegal activity held by... centrists (I guess?) like Ana can be real unhelpful. Because sure, on the spherical cow face of it organized crime is bad. But at the same time if you have a government that wants to increasingly jackboot the lower classes, with no bottom-up power building tolerated, what are normal people to do? 

  Now aiding and abetting a mafia is one thing, but the general mentality of washing your hands of people who resist oppression the second they break the law, even if it's the only way their resistance can survive, inherently biases your perspective and actions towards the government whether you want it to or not.

  Also for fuck's sake if you're worried about exploitation of prostitution change the structure of it to give the actual sex workers more control. All nixing it entirely does is dump a lot of them out in the street to be snapped up by other gangs.

  That was a pretty great ending for Ana's arc. On to the next page!

  The twist with the Lavender book was pretty cruel, albeit practical. An extra layer of security if it every falls into the wrong hands.

  It looks like the gang is going to have to find a way to save Wes and Jun. Tasia/Nell joining is going to be pretty neat, though his(?) research still hasn't been mentioned, whether it becomes relevant is TBD I guess.

  Also, I've now posted a rec thread on SpaceBattles and SufficientVelocity. Hopefully that gets some traffic to the story.

  > The Butterfly’s Dilemma

  Let's talk about this title. The Butterfly/Caterpillar’s Dilemma.

  What the hell does that mean?

  The point of the anecdote is that, no matter what you do, sometimes you're in a situation where you've have a very high probability of getting preyed on before you can get into a good situation. It's a great metaphor and all.

  But how is it a *dilemma*? It's not the caterpillar can choose *not* to go into a cocoon and potentially get eaten, can it? So why this specific name?

  The people demands answers!

  (although I just noticed the symmetry of arc titles and it's great; I thought the author had just reused the same arc title twice)

  > I leaned back, bathed in warm sunlight, and Left-Hira massaged shampoo into my hair, just like they did in fancy salons. [...] Her experienced touch felt relaxing, easy.

  Reading paragraphs like this, it's a little hard to remember that Hira is actually an incompetent slob when she's not actively leeching skills from various experts.

  > Thinking of those last two made my chest ache.  Wes won.  He’d become Lady Ebbridge again. And I wouldn’t be seeing him again for a long, long time.  If at all.

  Why? It would be easy enough to arrange a meeting through dead drops.

  > “So be it,” I said.  “I don’t want to be a mob boss.  I don’t even know if I want to take Tunnel Vision’s identity.”

  Yeah, honestly you haven't taken any of the steps that would be necessary to make the transition smoothly. It feels like Hira is a lot more attached to the "impersonate Tunnel Vision" idea than Ana is.

  > “You want to get your throat slit?” said Left-Hira, running her fingers through my hair.  “Want to get your eyes put out and your skin pan-fried with onions?”

  Nah, you could always loot whatever stashes TV had left, steal from the lieutenants' personal mansions, and start over in a new country.

  I mean, they already considered doing that a few chapters ago, and most of the reasons they couldn't (eg Ana dying) have been fixed.

  They do need to save Jun, though.

  > “Grace kept good records, right?” I said.  “We can use those to determine the most morally bankrupt members of her organization.”

  Okay, so let's get this straight:

  - After an encounter with a known illusionist, Tunnel Vision showed up brutally injured, then dropped off the map, and nobody has been able to talk to her, except a few henchmen who only get to talk to an unknown lieutenant who nobody has seen before but knows all their secret codes.
  - Most of their funds have been sunk into a revolution which, if I'm reading between the lines, a large part of the mob wasn't that ideologically attached to. Most of their money-making activities are on hold while TV is giving no sign of life.
  - After recovering, TV's only moves have been to buy a train ticket, get a haircut, put up missing cat posters everywhere, and talk to a low-level lieutenant. She has made no visible attempt to contact Maxine Clive or any of her allies.
  - Ana now intends to start methodically murdering members of her organization, and hope that the others don't react or demand that TV protect them.
  - And she also intends to tell them to cut most of their revenue sources for ethical reasons after they spent all their money backing a failed revolution (and apparently some lieutenants have lost everything they had).

  Keeping in mind that Ana has neither the personality of TV, the callous violence required to keep a violent mob in line, nor the ultra-powerful vocation to pull of the kind of plans that TV could do...

  I'm having a really hard time imagining how Ana can possibly hope to fool lieutenants that have known TV for years, secret codes or not. Some of them have to be pretty pissed they still haven't gotten orders or news while Paragon is cracking down on them.

  And even if she fools them, I can't see her maintaining their loyalty for any length of time. The mobsters so far have been described as mercenary, motivated by profit and by fear of Tunnel Vision; even if Ana starts murdering anyone who steps out of line, they'll still want to work for someone who pays them.

  > “The Symphony Knight.”  According to a local newspaper, Lady Corbin was already planning a live concert for the piece she’d composed during that battle.

  Bits like this remind you how disconnected from it all Paragon is.

  > The Neke had a tradition, with the invention of fabricated bodies

  Is it really a tradition if it's less than 20 years old?

  > This was like that.  Even though the language fit, even though the words and sentences seemed normal, I couldn’t understand any of them.  When I squinted at them, I could sometimes make out individual letters, one at a time, out of order, but couldn’t string them together into anything coherent.

  Interesting.

  I wonder if you could brute-force your way out of that, SCP-style?

  You could try to decode one letter at a time, in a way that lets you figure out words.

  I'm not sure what the exact mechanics are. On the one hand, the magic has to be in the information, not the printed book, otherwise the Spirit Block wouldn't work.

  On the other hand, the Spirit Block doesn't block *every single word* that figured in their holy text; like, presumably, if the 99 precepts include the world "you", then people can still say "you", just no in the concept of reciting the precepts. So you could still transcribe individual words.

  Maybe you would have to do it with multiple people, so that each of them doesn't hold enough information that the magic knows to censor it?

  > Even today, just one storm kraken could still rip apart merchant ships, and the occasional military submarine.  Anything less than a battleship, and captains needed to steer clear of hurricanes, and the monsters that came with them.

  I love that bit of worldbuilding =D

  > They’d been laid out in some sort of strange pattern.  Tentacles and eyes and chunks of their bodies had been sliced off and rearranged.
  >
  > Together, they formed a massive triangle.  Then, a smaller triangle, of the same shape, flipped upside down and placed inside, dividing the larger one into four separate triangles.
  >
  > Even smaller triangles had been placed in those ones as well, dividing them up.  And triangles within their triangles, and so on, getting more and more minuscule, as far as the eye could see.  

  > The sky was full of oracle snakes.  Hundreds of them, maybe thousands.  Small ones, the size of a man, and massive ones, larger than this house.  Larger than most ships I’d seen. They wound their flat coils back and forth under the night sky, silent, floating high above the ocean.  Each of them had Akhara’s Triangle on their scales.

  > The oracle snakes were looking at us.
  >
  > All of them had turned in our direction, staring down with tiny, pitch-black eyes.  Not at Elmidde, not at Paragon Academy.  Towards a small beach house on the coast of the mainland.

  > Were the oracle snakes getting closer to us?  They drifted in our direction, slow at first, but constant.  Inexorable.

  I won't lie, that entire scene was chilling. Amazing.

  > And then, the oracle snakes froze midair.  In unison, they turned north.  Gazing back towards Elmidde and Paragon Academy, still dark after the attack.  *They see something there*.
  >
  > The army of snakes scattered like cockroaches.  They shot away in a hundred different directions, flying back into the thicket of clouds, soaring away towards the open ocean.

  Reminds me of that scene in Endgame, where everyone goes "Wait, did the ships that were bombing us all turn towards *something in the sky*?"

  > I turned my head leftwards, and gazed at the darkened Paragon Academy, the dim lights of Hightown.  I saw the cable car station, far in the distance.  The place where I’d clipped one of the trees near the peak, during my frantic descent to chase after Grace.
  >
  > I’d imagined myself looking at that view, sipping mulled cider in one of Paragon’s common rooms or its banquet hall, with my newfound friends.  I’d imagined soaring through the air.
  >
  > But this was better.  This was so much better.

  I want to make fun of this scene, because how corny it is and the textbook linking of early foreshadowing with Ana's closed story circle and all...

  But honestly, these tropes are popular for a reason. This is *really* great.

  This is a good story.
