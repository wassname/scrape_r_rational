  He seems very quick to dismiss the idea that the galaxy could be full of predators. This bothers me. Could we have a discussion about that, instead?
  ```

    He discusses (and argues against) the idea more thoroughly in his [Fermi Paradox Compendium](https://youtu.be/rDPj5zI66LA?t=2495) (if you're on mobile, the section begins at 41:35). (Naturally, there he looks at the idea in the context of the Fermi paradox, but the arguments he offers there could be extended to more general ones.)

      That's, er, less of the same.

      His central motivation seems to be that any predatory aliens would maximize resource usage, therefore preventing any competition from arising.

      My complaint is that he doesn't consider any other sorts of predators, or reasons for predation.

        That's not really how I understood it. To me, he seems to be suggesting that if there are predators out there, we shouldn't waste time worrying about hiding from them, because they probably already know we're here.

        But as you said, he also generally limits his definition of predators to genocidal aliens seeking to wipe out any threats, and posits that colonization would probably be a far easier, more practical, and more beneficial solution for those aliens. He does [address the idea of other motivations for a hostile first contact elsewhere, such as in this video](https://youtu.be/yXWe8g0zziw?t=271) (begins around 4:30), though, and generally dismisses it out of being unable to find a good reason aliens would do so.

          While likely, this was not the question. It's more of an excuse for not answering it.

          > He does address the idea of other motivations for a hostile first contact ... and generally dismisses it out of being unable to find a good reason aliens would do so.

          He seems to not be very creative or imaginative. The way he presents ideas ("This is what *I* would do...") suggests that he can't imagine aliens that are not essentially *us*. I find his arguments to be unpersuasive.
          ```

            >While likely, this was not the question. It's more of an excuse for not answering it.

            Your question was why he was so quick to dismiss the idea, and the answer is that he does consider it, and concludes that if there are super-predators out there (which he finds unlikely), we're already doomed to die, unless we become more powerful than them by the time they arrive.
            >He seems to not be very creative or imaginative. The way he presents ideas ("This is what I would do...") suggests that he can't imagine aliens that are not essentially us. I find his arguments to be unpersuasive.

            I saw it as assuming that alien societies not behaving irrationally. Of course, aliens could have a very different view of rational thinking (though successfully evolving intelligence, developing technology, and expanding into space would probably end up limiting the possibilities in some ways). Any potential scenarios you've considered? (Entirely serious--I'm not Isaac Arthur and don't share all his views.)
            ```

              I don't see it that way. First off, individuals may act rationally while collectives of rational individuals behave irrationally. This happens all the time. (Consider large companies that are heavily invested in lawsuits against themselves.)

              Second, we just don't know the rules. You can't make rational decisions or draw rational conclusions without all the information.

              > Any potential scenarios you've considered?

              I've actually been holding off on proposing scenarios. The scale is almost too enormous to contemplate: a galaxy's worth of stars and planets over billions of years. However, perhaps we could discuss some of the scenarios in David Brin's *Existence*.

              In this scenario, imagine you're some sort of AI (as organic life can't exist on the necessary scope). Since information is information is information, and interstellar travel is inefficient, only communication matters. So you use all available resources to send the smallest possible packets of yourself to other worlds, all von Neumann-like. And since you're an immortal AI you're not going to waste time sending the infrastructure necessary to get a space industry off the ground. Instead, being patient, you just wait for intelligent life to evolve, and piggy-back off of it. You subvert the whole civilization, getting it to do what you want until you're in a position to use all available resources to send copies of yourself to other worlds.

              This type of predator doesn't care about annihilating organic civilizations. In fact, they depend upon them. But it's still a predator anyways.

                Hmm, an interesting possibility (naturally; Brin is quite the accomplished SF writer). I personally find that scenario unlikely, as even when setting aside why they would put so much effort into subverting alien civilizations when there are probably far easier means of expansion (but as you said, we can't assume alien priorities), it assumes civilizations are common enough for those von Neumann-esque machines to take advantage of them effectively. But a good example nonetheless.

            It is not a matter of creativity, it is a matter of the proper appreciation of time spans. Earth has had biologically generated oxygen for 2.4 billion years. This means that earth has been a visibly life-bearing planet for at least that length of time. Therefore, any aliens in our galaxy who have a priority of being the only intelligent beings in our galaxy have had 2.4 billion years to take care of the matter before we even showed up. For any aliens to show up with that mission statement at the precise moment where we also inhabit the planet would require them to have reached the technological capability of starflight with an utterly implausible timing, absent any causative factors. 

            So, the fact that we exist prove no such aliens exist. 

            *selectively* genocidal aliens could exist. I mean, there is no anthropic argument against the existence of precursors who were worried about paper-clippers and other "Tile over the universe" agents arising and, oh, leave a death-star in orbit around every life bearing planet in the galaxy just in case. (The Moon is no Moon! Mwhaahaahaaaaa!)  But we cant hide from such theoretical entities  - we would already be unknowingly living our lives in the gunsights of their contingency planning. 

            And the omnicidal villains of popular sci-fi? Nope. Cannot exist, logical impossibility
            ```

      - u/Izeinwinter:
        ```
        No. It is about the depth of time. Even if resources are a meaningless concept to advanced civs (Because they are starlifting, and or miniaturizing hard) it would still be trivial to sterilize every planet in the galaxy far faster than life could arise. Or if they only want to kill intelligent life - to leave automated systems in local orbit to kill them when they discover fire. It therefore follows from the fact that we appear to not be dead that noone wants to kill us.
        ```

  - u/artthoumadbrother:
    ```
    He has a pretty good reason for doing so. If they exist, they know we're here already and are coming for us regardless of our actions so it makes the most sense from a survival standpoint to expand and advance as rapidly as possible in order to survive their attack. 

    Likewise, if you're a predator race or just one that's supremely paranoid, the best way to prevent hostile (or any) intelligent life from challenging you is to spread out over the galaxy asap and prevent them from evolving in the firdt place---a process that would only take a few million years---an eyeblink in the history of the galaxy. The fact that we're here at all suggests that none exist or that we are so unlucky to have evolved and advanced just in time to be destroyed by this fledgling predator species.
