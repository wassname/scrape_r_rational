  Just started reading, getting signs of influences from TGAB, which you referenced, and PGTE. The Host bits made me think of Wandering Inn too.  Do you draw ideas primarily from webserials or do you have paperback influences too?

    I’ve never actually read The Gods are Bastards nor The Wandering Inn, so I’m not certain what reference you’re referring to. And while web serials are certainly an influence (as that’s the format), I read a lot of fantasy. My main physically-published influences are Brandon Sanderson and Jim Butcher, and I aim to replicate how good both are at plotting and writing epic climaxes.
