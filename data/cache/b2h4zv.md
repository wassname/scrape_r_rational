  Not sure if anyone's seen this before but a quick search didn't show it posted here before.

  Disclaimer: Not my work

  Villain, With A Code (VWAC) is a college age superhero story with the MC as the impossible son of two S tier villains and a villain himself. When caught he is sentenced to attend the story's hero school, with hints that there's a behind the scenes agenda at play.

  I won't spoil more about why it's RT but it ticks the first two bullet points in the sidebar and possibly the final one too.

  It's currently at 52k words and updating at least once a week.

  Despite being a bit too much wish fufiment/OP MC with the vector powerset this is a fun read.  The world so far is half the reality of worm and half the vile corruption The Boys is known for, so while you have characters that almost make sense you also have all you'd expect of a high school full of super powered adolescents playing status games. It almost plays a bit of the wrong thing for seductive reasons game worm does, or maybe I just don't quite like the main character. All that said it is a very fun read.
