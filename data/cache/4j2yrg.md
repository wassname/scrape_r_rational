  ```
  Blood Wings is the completed first book of a planned trilogy; [the sequel](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11830798/1/Team-7-s-Ascension-Lines-in-the-Sand) is updating at a decent pace. Not rationalist but realistic, with partially redone worldbuilding and history from the canon, and more realistic power levels and progression, and an emphasis on good tactics and being smart over the typical shonen punching.
