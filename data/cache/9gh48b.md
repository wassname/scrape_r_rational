  > – Dread Empress Massacre the First

  Oh, hey, looks like Cat *does* climb the tower at some point.
  ```

    ```
    EE [mentioned](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/08/27/chapter-48-shadows/#comment-21305) that Catherine would rule under the name of Dread Empress Victorious, which is somewhat more frightening, in the sense of the implications for her ascension and reign.

      I like it.

      "Triumphant" gives you the impression of someone taking over and doing amazing things, bragging about their accomplishments and everyone acknowledging how awesome they are.

      "Victorious" is simple.  "I beat everyone else".  No pretentious claims to grandeur, just a flat out statement that everyone who tried to fight her lost.
      ```

    that quote reminded me pretty strongly of DBZ abridged

  ```
  Cat mentioning the Drow might have to relocate as an opportunity is... odd. A goblin settlement is one thing, but drow? They're pretty much antithetical to any surface morality. It'd be a disaster to dump a pile of them into Callow.
  ```

  - u/Menolith:
    ```
    Well, if she doesn't want them in Callow, she could dump them in Arcadia.

    There's a lot of room in the courts, now.

    _Edit:_ The more I think about it, the more sense it'd make. They are already dark-themed backstabbing assholes, so they are already basically Winter-lite. I doubt that they are going to stop the dwarves and Cat definitely isn't, so her showing up with a portal and a proposition of "Dare you enter my magical realm?" is pretty lucrative when the alternative is death by dwarf.
    ```

      ```
      you should always think twice before entering someone else's magical realm...
      ```

    ```
    The globins have managed it despite the awful interlude from robbers pov. They are very separate and secretive so I'm sure it could work. Since they have no apparent issues with being above ground, I can see it happening.
    ```

    - u/notagiantdolphin:
      ```
      Sure. That's why I'm saying it's one thing. They're not nice, but there isn't a huge cultural bulwark against any sort of partnership with other species. To the drow, surfacers are slave species. Look at what we've seen from them - crabs in a barrel. They don't just murder for position like goblins, they have a magic reason to kill each other for knowledge and power.
      ```

- u/Ardvarkeating101:
  ```
  Gotta give props to Triumphant for making the *Dwarves* pay tribute
  ```

- u/Megika:
  ```
  Are there dwarf Named? Has this come up?
  ```

  - u/aerocarbon:
    ```
    Good point. There's no reason to think there *aren't*. From what I can remember about Naming dynamics, a mantle is etched into the fabric of reality over time as narratives and stories within a given culture are repeated; e.g. the White Knight slaying a dragon and saving the princess, the Tyrant stooped over in their throne, plotting for total Calernian domination, or the Wandering Bard getting sloshed and meddling.

    Dwarves definitely have a culture, which means they would have their own stories, which naturally implies they would have their own Named. Makes me wonder what *kind* of Names they would have.

    Cat should *hopefully* realize this, at the very least. Having the "world's foremost Namelore expert" as a mentor would have its upsides, one imagines - regardless of her Foundling™ brand impulsiveness.
    ```

  - u/magna-terra:
    ```
    as the other guy has said, most likely. if the ratlings of all races can have named anything with a culture can. 

    to give my 2 cents on what sort of named they would have i can immagine they would be more inclined to names closer to tech and administration.
    ```
