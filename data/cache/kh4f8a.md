  On Chapter 24 right now, just want to mention that the creative text effects/formatting are very effective and cool.

  Small note for the first chapter - the text boxes say Flotation System Integrity 35%, the narration says 74%, and then the next text box says 34%, so I assume some part of that is an error.
  ```

  - u/zenoalbertbell:
    ```
    Thank you so much for reading and thank you for reporting the error!
    ```

    - u/plutonicHumanoid:
      ```
      Yeah, the story is great! Really pulling me in, I want to say more but I don’t want to give spoilers and I want to finish it first! Also, I finished chapter 31 nearly in time with the music finishing.
      ```

    - u/plutonicHumanoid:
      ```
      Chapter 40 kinda bounces around because of one of the lines that changes, hard to read because of that.
      ```

      - u/zenoalbertbell:
        ```
        That part is intentionally a bit incomprehensible (>!Danielle is similarly having to pick out overlapping nonverbal concepts!<) but I appreciate the feedback. I'll try slowing it down a bit to see if that makes it more pleasant to read.

        Edit: Oh, I see what you mean on mobile. Hmmm. I'll see what I can do.
        ```

        - u/plutonicHumanoid:
          ```
          Your spoiler is broken.

          That’s not what I meant, I meant all the paragraphs after the changing lines also bounce around, because one of the changing lines changes from taking up a single line to two lines.
          ```

          - u/zenoalbertbell:
            ```
            Yep, I realized shortly after I posted and edited to fix my spoiler too.

            I've fixed up the formatting a bit and I think Chapter 40 should no longer do that. Thank you very much!
            ```

  I'm at the halfway point, and I'm really enjoying this.

  Some notes so far:

  * I like how the alien thinks in an alien way.  After encountering way too many rubber-forehead aliens, something truly inhuman is a nice change.
  * The foreshadowing has been great; I loved how it was set up almost immediately that >!this was Earth!<, although I didn't realize >!the exact time period until the K-T impact.!<  I'm really looking forward to seeing what the >!simulation foreshadowing!< is about.
  * The scene from the POV of >!the cat!< was amazing, especially the >!mouseover meow text!<.  I wonder if there's other stuff like that that I've overlooked.
  * The >!text messages!< bring the narrative to a **dead halt**.  Like, seriously, I am reading at a lovely clip, and I hit one of those blocks (I'm currently writing this while waiting for the second block to populate itself), and it's the most frustrating thing ever.  There needs to be a FF button on those or something.

  Apart from that minor frustration, and the fact that it is now time for me to get some sleep, this has been awesome.  Great job!
  ```

    Okay, I've finished the work.

    I still enjoyed it, but I think the first half is a lot better than the second half.  The questions you asked are a bit more interesting than how you answer them.

    Some notes I took as I was reading:

    * The >!text messages!< were definitely a more pleasant experience for me when fully pre-populated, but ">!Text message scrolled all the way to the bottom!<" presents its own difficulties (do people know to scroll up?)
    * Nice cordyceps reference!  Coming back to that as it was explained in the next chapter, is that just a reference to the real-world fungus, or is it also a reference to the [story that has been posted here previously](https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868)?
    * I would have recognized Hall of the Mountain King anyway, but good job letting people know what the song is before you played it!  There's nothing that's quite as annoying as a pop culture reference you don't get (for instance, that horror movie they were watching; I had a feeling I was supposed to get that, but I can't think of any vampire movies with a catchy song in the middle).
    * You might want to consider including more references to RADM Omar's last name in blocks from her perspective; I wasn't entirely certain that "Shyamala" and "Omar" were the same character until Ch.34, despite the improbability of both of them being simultaneously promoted from Commodore to Rear Admiral.
    * >!"I don't want to hurt you," she said.!<  was a PERFECT payoff to that set-up.

    Now, thoughts on the work as a whole.

    I'm willing to forgive a lot of contrivance in the set-up of a story (as opposed to later), so >!this great space-bound creature being able to survive re-entry, but unable to adapt quickly enough to fend off a shark attack, although it seems kind of a stretch, is fine.!<  I'm a bit less forgiving of the fact that >!the alien is able to recognize an asteroid strike from the presence of iridium, but not able to recognize multiple nuclear detonations from the presence of short-lived radioactive isotopes. 
     Yes, that would have clued the alien in earlier on the presence of intelligent life, so I see why you didn't do it, but it seemed like a capability that was set up that didn't re-emerge when it would be useful, *because* it would have been useful.!<

    I really enjoyed the interactive webpage design; my only problem with it (beyond my previous complains about that one element) is that it wasn't always obvious when there were things being hidden (e.g. the >!cat's meows!<, and it wasn't always obvious when changes to the webpage were complete (e.g. >!the instructions to the President!<).  I was reminded of how the old webcomic, [Kid Radd](https://www.bgreco.net/kidradd.htm), when doing long video panels, would put an ["END" tag](https://www.bgreco.net/kidradd/comic21.htm#p2) when the videos were done, so that people would know there's nothing left to see and can move on.

    The ending bugged me a bit.  >!I mean, I'm all for happy endings, but not only was nearly everybody saved, but then literally everybody was saved, again.  It was a bit much.  At the very least, it could have brought up the consequences of doubling the Earth's population (not even counting the Librarians).  !<  There's also the matter where the >!structure of the universe breaking down, the ability to use this break-down for time travel, and the ability to arbitrarily change the laws of the universe (e.g. the mass of a fundamental particle)!< seemed to come out of nowhere, without even any particular foreshadowing (yes, the antagonist stated that they were going to try to accomplish something like, but the timing on it was just ridiculous - remember what I said about contrivances belonging at the beginning of the story - as well as it making >!no sense that the Traitor would even need to bother singling out the Earth for destruction if the whole universe could be pulled down around their ears!<).  And, like the great, lamented cartoon TV show ReBoot, >!we never get to find out anything consequential about the User.!<  (No, the crappy live-action The Guardian Code doesn't count).

    One thing that really confused me was >!What was the deal with Godblade?  My interpretation of the events was that the moment at which the President swung the blade was the exact moment at which the Traitor contacted the Coward, expecting the Coward to delete itself when it heard the message, but instead, it just severed its connection to Library communications, which also severed its ability to control its minions on the surface.!<  Is that right?  If so, it seems like a heck of a coincidence that >!the Godblade!< did exactly what it was sold as being able to do, given that wasn't the expected reaction.

    All in all, though, I really enjoyed it.  The world building was great; as I've said previously, I loved that you made your aliens actually had *alien* priorities and morals (although I felt that got undermined a bit towards the end, particularly with >!"Bullshit."!<, as great of a line as that was).  I liked the way that the humans reacted (although >!the President!< was a bit much), I liked how utterly batshit the lead-up to the ending was, with the >!copies of Danielle everywhere!<.  

    I'll probably go back and read it again, looking specifically for any interactive elements I've missed.

    Thanks for writing and sharing it!

      Thank you for the continued detailed feedback!

      >cordyceps 

      The reference was primarily to the fungus, but I absolutely adored _Too Clever For Their Own Good_.

      > that horror movie they were watching; I had a feeling I was supposed to get that, but I can't think of any vampire movies with a catchy song in the middle

      The movie from Monster Movie Night is entirely my own invention. Maybe there _should_ be a vampire movie with a catchy song in the middle, eh? Eh?

      >payoff to setup

      Can't tell you how glad I am to hear it, >!I was terrified it would come off as corny and ruin her Moment of Awesome.!<

      >boom boom contrivance

      >!As you say, I had to get the protagonist into the 21st century. My handwave here is that the first time there was a functioning viral sensor net, and the second time the protagonist hadn't bothered to rebuild said viral sensor net yet. (There was ample time to do it, but my handwave _there_ is that there didn't seem to be a reason to hurry, they had been waiting for evolution to settle down into something easier to build interfaces against, and the Librarians are much more comfortable operating on long timescales than we are for obvious reasons.)!<

      > END tag

      That's a splendid idea. >!You watched all the way to the end of Chapter 50, right? Ah, from your further statements I see you did not. Yes, I really need to work something out there like an end tag or hiding the 'next' buttons until it's done. I recommend scrolling to the end of chapter 50 and waiting a few seconds beyond the end of the Universe.!<

      >swords

      >!You had the right of it; the reaction the Traitor/Protector expected was total self-destruction. I have a throwaway line justifying this during the Traitor/Protector's chapter where they justify the sword as a contingency in case it doesn't work/partially works-- if a few of the "drones" were to survive or start malfunctioning rather than clean themselves up properly, the Traitor/Protector wouldn't be giving up their pawn. It's a weaker point in the story for sure.!<

      >why even go to earth

      >!Justified as layers of contingencies in case the Traitor/Protector wasn't able to end the universe on a reasonable timeline (or at all), as well as a continuation of their prior modus operandi of sanity checking with every living member of the species before pulling the plug.!<

      >Bullshit.

      >!Hahaha I agonized over this line. It's the harshest language in OCTO (I don't personally mind adult language when I read things, but I held myself to roughly PG-rated language to try to help me differentiate my character's voices from the way I talk in real life, make OCTO a teeny sliver more accessible, and set myself an additional level of challenge.) Ultimately I went with it because I couldn't think of a better wham line, so I'll use up my Artistic License card on this one unless and until I think of something better for it.!<

      Thank you so, so much for reading. I can't tell you how much it means to me that you put this much thought and effort into your feedback.

      Edit:
      >spoilers regarding the thing mentioned in the END tag spoiler up there

      >!Regarding time travel, it's actually not physically possible in this setting. Essentially, a one-time exemption was granted by the Users to spin up a fresh timeline so they could see what would happen. The exotic-matter bug was patched in the new timeline, resulting in splosions.!<
      ```

        ```
        >The movie from Monster Movie Night is entirely my own invention. Maybe there *should* be a vampire movie with a catchy song in the middle, eh? Eh?

        Oh, *absolutely* there should.

        > Ah, from your further statements I see you did not.

        Ohhhhhh.

        Yes, that adds quite a bit to the ending, thank you.

        I had rather thought that this was going to be the other way around, that >!the humans had destroyed the Library and were trying to figure out how to reconstruct it, and were "ghosting" a Librarian using the Librarians' own technology, in order to try and undo their mistake.!<  But I like this answer, too.

        Another question, based on that newly-revealed text: >!Is "instantiate a connecting branch" how the time travel and the change in the laws of physics supposed to be justified, in-story?!<

        >why even go to earth

        My observation there was more >!"You're destroying the rest of the universe anyway, why put specific effort into pulling the Earth's stellar matter into a black hole?"!<

        >Thank you so, so much for reading.

        You're quite welcome, and thank you once again for writing and sharing it!

        - u/zenoalbertbell:
          ```
          I edited an additional spoiler into my previous reply, but you pretty much got it.

          > >!why put specific effort into pulling the Earth's stellar matter into a black hole!<

          >!At first this is what the protagonists on Earth believe is going on, but really the Traitor/Protector was opening wormholes connecting the black hole to _everywhere_, leading to the destabilization of the universe. They just saw the ones closest to themselves before they detected spacetime starting to fray.!<
          ```

          - u/Nimelennar:
            ```
            Then this needs to be rewritten:

            >>!It was a probabilistic process. The larger the wormhole, the less precise the placement would be.!<
            >
            >>!Luckily, **for the protector's ends**, that was more than sufficient.!<
            >
            >>!Smaller wormholes opened up near the satellites, each barely large enough for a few grams of matter to come through.!<
            >
            >>!The primary thread sent through enough of the exotic matter from the gas giant for their orbiting facilities to begin opening larger wormholes.!<
            >
            >>!The first one was only a few light-minutes away **in the wrong direction**.!<
            >
            >>!The next one was **far closer to the mark**. It was near enough to this system's primary star that its corona began to peel away, pulled by the massive gravitational force on the other side of the wormhole.!<
            >
            >>!Then, another one opened. Then another.!<
            >
            >>!The solar system began to be honeycombed with openings in space itself leading directly into the black hole where the protector had discovered the awful truth.!<

            This suggests, from an omniscient viewpoint, that >!"for the protector's ends," having the wormhole further from the star is "in the wrong direction" and that "the mark" being aimed for is the Sun itself.!<
            ```

            - u/zenoalbertbell:
              ```
              Ahh, good catch.

              I have a few thoughts on how to patch it, but I have to cop to this being a bug.

              Best handwave I currently have is >!they _were_ aiming for the Sun, but not _just_ the Sun-- other stars too, feeding the black hole and increasing the gravitational fields emanating from the wormhole mouths.!<

              Edit: I added a couple of lines to hopefully hotfix this for now.

  [OCTO](https://zalbert.net/octo) is science fiction with horror elements. OCTO is complete and is a little over 113,000 words in total.

  OCTO is OC.

  OCTO is about a lone survivor doing everything possible to save a civilization from the brink of annihilation.

  Escalating levels of spoilers follow.

  >!A series of unlikely disasters leaves the protagonist stranded on an ocean floor with only a tiny fragment of their advanced technology functioning.!<

  >!The protagonist is not human. The protagonist's species is extremely long-lived; their civilization achieves interstellar exploration not through FTL travel but just by waiting out the long journeys. They are a people characterized by extreme curiosity and implacable patience.!<

  >!The planet the protagonist finds and explores is Earth.!<

  >!Other characters show up twelve chapters in.!<

  >!Since it's a big spoiler I didn't tag it in the title of the post, but there are transhumanism and simulation elements later in the story.!<

  >!I feel this is the biggest spoiler I can give here since it gives away the game:!<  
  >!OCTO is my attempt at rational Lovecraftian/Gigerian kaiju fic.!<

  Content warnings:  
  OCTO contains graphic violence.
  While there is no explicit sexual content in OCTO, there are two or three uncomfortable situations and implications.

  I hope you enjoy my story.
  ```

- u/FeepingCreature:
  ```
  That was fun! 

  I also think the ending was a bit too rushed and compressed, but I really enjoyed the story as a whole.
  ```

  - u/zenoalbertbell:
    ```
    I will certainly cop to that. OCTO was actually a NaNoWriMo project gone awry-- I didn't stop at the end of November and was quickly approaching the 50 chapter mark releasing them on a daily basis.

    I'm planning to self-publish next year (more to have a copy on my own bookshelf than anything else), and I think a good chunk of The Edit will entail condensing the first ten chapters and expanding the last ten.

  I'm on chapter 10. This is very good.

  My current predictions:

  * Since chapter one: >!The planet MC has landed on is Earth. This seems all but confirmed by now.!<

  * Since chapter one: >!The Library is DNA-esque—but since MC makes no such comparisons, they either don't know what DNA is and in for a big surprise when they figure it out, or consider the Library to be black box-ish. In the latter case, the Library can have some negative side effects we are yet to find out.!<

  * Since chapter ten: >!MC is literally Cthulhu. Dwells at the bottom of the ocean and whispers things into the land creatures' minds. Also, you know, *octo*.!<

  No thoughts about >!the traitor!< yet. I have a strong feeling that it turns out that >!the traitor has indeed uncovered something terrible that would make the MC's entire journey pointless!<, but I really hope it's not the case. The best subversion would be that >!the traitor was infected by a virus or gone mad, or something like that. Making the conflict uncomplicated and sides clear would be the biggest twist I could've possibly imagined!<.

  I'll try to comment every ten chapters in replies.

      **Chapter 11:** >!While MC's society seems slightly *dystopian*!<, I love it to bits. Seems perfect to me—I, too, would like to >!endlessly roam the galaxy, always learning new things!<.

      **Chapter 12:** Frankly, I was surprised at the word "millimeters." This is the first time a direct size measurement is used. Before, I occasionally was getting confused trying to figure out how big the things MC was describing actually were, but that seemed intentional and part of the fun. The same goes for >!"cockroach"!<. Is that an effect of >!increased computational resources!<? >!Library restoration!<?

      **Chapter 15:** >!The dog is okay. Phew. I was getting super worried.!< 

      **Chapter 16:** Spoilers and some other cool stuff don't work for me due to me using a night's mode theme. Everything that came before this chapter worked perfectly fine. The site's native theme is way too high-contrast for my eyes, but I had to switch to it. :c

        I'm sorry about the contrast issues. :\ I've been using Google Chrome's lighthouse mode to try and do the best I can from a readability/accessibility standpoint, but I think nothing short of a full night mode/day mode toggle implementation will make it perfect for everyone... and that would now entail going back and untangling my messy CSS, gah.

        I hear you, I'm sorry, and I'll take a look at it later to try and see if I can do anything to improve the experience for everyone. (For what it's worth I use [this extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-reader/eimadpbcbfnmbkopoojfekhnkhdbieeh) for most sites and I think it has a contrast slider that might clobber things a little less?)

        Nothing to report about chapters 20-30, to be honest.

        **Chapter 31**:

        Wow, that's one uncomfortable rendition. I've heard many variations of that music, but this one *really* fits the tone—which means it sounds *horrifying*. Also,

        > >!Danielle started to play faster, switching virtual instruments on the fly.!<

        was perfectly timed with the song playing faster for me. I also like to include music in my fiction, and I know how hard it is to line it up. Awesome job.

        **Chapter 36:**

        > "WHAT."

        WHAT.

        **Chapter 37:**

        Ok, I haven't yet completed the chapter, but galaxy brain prediction time: >!The entity connecting to Tom is the traitor, who is not present on Earth physically but devised a scheme to exert an influence on it either way.!< 

        Ok, now I have completed the chapter, and yeah, now I'm 95% certain >!it's the traitor who told Tom how to make the Flaming Sword!<.

        Ooooh, >!antimemetics!<. Spicy. I love me some spice.

        **Chapter 39:**

        ....pretty....

      I wanted to wait 'till I read chapter 30 to post, but this requires my immediate attention as a native Russian speaker.

      **Chapter 23**.

      > >!"Привет, ребята, как дела? Это твой мальчик Константин!"!<

      should be

      >!"Привет, ребята, как дела? С вами Константин!"!<

      I would probably even change >!Константин!< to >!Костян!< to make it sound as informal as you aimed for.

      > >!"сука блядь, что это?"!<

      The first letter should be capitalized.

      :D

  Just finished. This is probably my favorite complete work I've read from this sub since Cordyceps, and edges up towards Worth the Candle for absolute favorite. I agree with the other commenters that the pacing could stand some work, but the author's already said they're going to rejigger that. I'm looking forward to re-reading it once that's done; like many of the works mentioned below, this one lends itself to coming back for seconds. 

  Here is a brief list of works this reminds me of:

  * 17776: The Future of Football, for the clever use of text gimmicks & broad scope

  * Cordyceps: Too Clever By Half, for the use of cognitohazards & mystery elements

  * Ra, for the complicated multiversal sci-fi shenanigans

  * The Commonwealth Saga by Peter F. Hamilton, for the portrayal of believably nonhuman intellects (specifically, much of Octo's early explorations on Earth reminded me of MorningLightMountain's introduction in Commonwealth Book 1)

  All of those are favorable comparisons to works I love. If anyone is on the fence about diving into this, I hope this comment can convince you--I really had an absolute blast reading it, start to finish. ZAB, I hope you write more stuff & post it here.

    I was also reminded by Ra due to the esoteric sci-fi elements!

  Really interesting read, had me hooked. Although a classic case of America being the be all and end all of everything. I enjoyed the different writing and points of views used. Although felt the ending was a bit rushed, nether the less, I will be thinking about this story for some time to come!

    Way guilty. I originally meant to lampshade or mitigate this but it got lost in the write-what-you-know shuffle.

    Thank you for reading, the feedback, and the kind words!

- u/hugh-spaz:

  I've really enjoyed this, from start to finish. I especially appreciate the use of Gimmicks throughout the story, it really utilizes the lack of restrictions that come with the medium.

  Great work!

    Thank you for reading.

    (In case anyone is wondering how he read it so fast, /u/hugh-spaz was a beta reader while I was writing OCTO.)

  I like this a lot- not done reading yet, but >!It's a shame the president holds the idiot ball in such a hackneyed way.  Maybe it's deliberate, and the cartoonish president and higher ups are part of the simulation (assuming it's humans on the outside running a simulation?), but it's just annoying.  The humans are fucked, anyway- they don't need to be gimped by a cartoon bureaucracy.  It would be more interesting to see them do everything (mostly) right, have competent organizations and leaders, and lose anyway.  I'm not so interested in watching viewpoint characters get angry at strawmen, and I feel it weakens the work.!<

  Still, I like it a lot.  Binging it right now, might come back with my thoughts when I'm done.

  edit:  >!Okay, guess there's more to it.!<

  edit 2: >!Done.  Pretty good, though the ending seemed a little rushed.!<

    Thank you for reading! This was my first outing. I'm going to spend a bit (probably at least a couple months) preparing OCTO for print so I can have a copy on my bookshelf, but I have a few things in mind for my next story. I have an [RSS feed here](https://zalbert.net/zab.rss).

    Thank you so much for reading and for the detailed feedback! No, really, this is gold and I'll be coming back to it when I give OCTO **The Edit** for print. As you said, many of the questions you had were answered in the text, but there's a lot I could make clearer.

    I just want to be sure, >!did you stick around after the end of the universe in chapter 50?!<

    (>!Also, I'm beyond delighted with your speculation about the simulation, haha.!<)

        While I will leave >!the question of stacked simulations!< to the imagination, the ~~form of imagination~~ thread of inquiry you're engaging in here is *precisely* what I was hoping for and is the reason I wanted to write this story and post it to this subreddit. <3

  This story is incredible and I need to make an offline copy of it for my own Library. ;)

- u/Auroch-:
  ```
  I've just started it, but it's very interesting. The thought process is very reminiscent of Deathworlders's Hunter Alpha of The-Brood-that-Builds, though in very different circumstances and threat model (and therefore very different timescale).
