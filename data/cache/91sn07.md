## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  So I'm planning a story with two magic systems, but I'm running into a problem.

  The first magic system is based on fields. There are several fundamental fields, and each field is associated with a set of particles. Particles can interact with multiple fields, and with each other via force-carrying particles associated with the fields. Particles can bind together to form Elements, each of which has special properties. [Here](https://sciencenotes.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/PeriodicTableWorks.png) is a link to the elements I've fleshed out so far. Elements can be combined together to form new substances. Magical creatures in this world are collections of substances that self-replicate and have been selected for over time.

  The second magic system involves time and space. The flow of time changes depending on velocity, though locally physics appears the same to all observers. There is an attractive force which binds matter together, and this force also warps the flow of space and time.

  The problem I'm having is that I can't make these two magic systems work together. I can't quite integrate the attractive spacetime-warping force into the field theory of the first magic system - every time I try, I get conflicting results between the two magic systems. I've been trying to fix this by messing around with strings, but so far I haven't gotten anywhere.

  Does anyone have suggestions as to how I could make the two magic systems work together? Do you think anyone would notice if I just didn't address this problem?

  Thanks!

  God

    I say just run with what you have. 

    Worst case scenario you can *liquidate* the whole thing and start over later.

    I'm not sure it's a problem, Lord.

    Your average citizen (from peasant to king) only interacts with magic in superficial ways. They'll memorize the quirks of any mass-produced arcana they own, entirely uninterested in the unifying principles behind them. Teach them the principles in compulsory education and they'll be forgotten as soon as exams are through. They certainly won't be reinforced by everyday life.

    Working mages will have a somewhat more complex understanding, but most such scribblers will learn spells by rote. What they can't memorize they'll look up in the tables in the back of a book. The methods whereby the most useful arcana are made have been perfected and standardized for decades if not centuries.

    The majority of that small percentage of magicians who actually *create* spells or *invent* arcana might operate within one of the two "systems" you mention. More likely they'll use a simplified abstraction built atop either or both and it will work perfectly well for whatever they're making. When something doesn't go according to plan, it can usually be brute-forced. "That's funny," they'll say, and they might make a note of it, but then they'll get back to the task at hand. The methods whereby modern spells and arcana are innovated has been standardized for years if not decades.

    At the narrow peak of this pyramid are the theoretical magicians. Those who create not spells or magic items, but whole fields of study and potential enterprise. Or that's what they used to do, anyway. It seems for the last few generations they're basically on the same page as you.

    There truly may be one single perfect magic system underneath the two awkward ones we've got... but who beside gods, theoretical magicians, and armchair intellectuals gains anything for even caring?

      Thanks for the input; it's true that the average mage won't notice on their own. However, later in the story, the theoretical magicians are going to have more sway than you might think. They'll be able to get billions of dollars in government funding to do their research, and their popular writing will captivate millions. I'm worried that if they notice the inelegance, they'll start to doubt my existence and spread this doubt to everyone else. That will really mess up my story.

    Can you give an example of a test someone might perform that would demonstrate a paradox where the rules conflict?

    If you can, I recommend hiding such conflicts behind a boundary beyond which nothing can be observed. Safely hidden away, even if a paradox can be proven to exist, it can never be demonstrated in practice and you're in the clear.

    --

    Also, you might not want to use an *attractive* spacetime-warping force. Just let the curvature tensor be a function of local mass-energy distribution and the current metric. This will result in an attractive "force" in the most common scenarios.

  You wake up one morning, open your eyes, then open a different pair of eyes on the other side of the planet. You open your mouths to gasp in shock and two breaths of air flow in. One of you cries. 

  Turns out, there is a finite number of souls in existence. That number is somewhere around 7.6 billion and we just ran out. From now on, until the world populations shrinks, each newborn child gets assigned a soul that is already assigned to another body. Two bodies inhabited by a single soul have a single conscience, they share sensory data, memories, knowledge and personality (though since the new body is an undeveloped infant, the personality of the original body largely dominates), but the muscles in the new body are untrained and the soul is unaccustomed to using them, so it still takes time to learn to do things like walking and speaking. 

  Possessing two brains worth of processing power allows a soul with two bodies to perfectly multitask between the two bodies, but it does not otherwise make you much smarter than a single bodied human due to the inefficiencies of the [mumblemumble].

  Which new bodies get assigned to which souls is completely random: a man can end up with the body of a female baby and a farmer in North Korea can end up in the child of a North American billionaire. The only thing that is consistent is that people that already have two bodies do not get a third until the world population reaches 15.1-ish billion.

  How would you expect the world to react to this revelation? What will people from different countries do when their children wake up with the minds of complete strangers? What will those same people do when they suddenly find part of themselves in a completely different culture?

    Some consequences off the top of my head:

    1. The first several thousand are just assumed to be crazy (odds are bad that somone with adequate resources and eduction to demonstrate otherwise is among the first to share a soul). Worse chances are good the condition gets defined as a mental illness and, it takes the better part of a generation to figure out it isn't, and another one to get it accepted as such by most people. 
    2. Religious evangelism skyrockets as they finally got something the average scientist will concede is empirical proof of the existence of a soul. Naturally enough of them run with this as proof that their specific religion is exactly correct that chaose ensues. 
    3. Soulmate pairs become the standard for secure communication between distant points where low bandwidth is acceptable and eavesdropping is not (like between a base and a warship, or between an embassy and the capital). Also for spys. This gets awkward when the population does approach the 15 billion mark and probably leads to a Y2K-esque panic at the last minute. 
    4. A lot of drama happens as a result of custody battles between parents and soulmates of new children.

        Noticing something is up and correctly identifying what is up are two very different things. 

        Competing diagnosis will include:

        1. Posession
        2. Reincarnation (baby is remembering a now ended life not experiencing a shared life)
        3. Environmentally triggered infant schizophrenia (blamed on vaccines, GMO food, specific brands of baby products, etc.)
        4. Alien hybrid babies
        5. A novel developmental illness
        6. The "next step" in human evolution leading to genius babies

        Also how odd the babies behave is dependent on how much access a body that hasn't fully developed has to skills possessed by its soulmate. If the infant brain still has to learn motor control and language at the usual pace before it has the wetware to actually use the skills its soul possess there might not be much unusual behavior to notice as the soul will have had months possibly a year to get used to the situation before they can act out of the expected range, and by then many will choose not to.

            I would not expect the adult to behave erratically at least not involuntarily so. The premis states that souls contain the personality and are perfect milti-taskers able to run each body normally in parallel. So it should be capable of keeping the adult body "business as usual" to the extent that the personality wants to (rather than say, spending a ton of time looking for the infant body).

            The thing is to be detected as unusual an infant would have to behave outside what an infant is normally capable of. That would IMO depend on the "mumble mumble" that keeps multiple brains in parallel form being able to exceed human intelligence levels. Does it work in reverse and enable a soul to run what its infant body hears through its adult body's language center to try and discern words? Does the same work using the adult bodies language center to convert words it no something the infant body's motor control can turn into correct sounds? 

            Also, I still thing your unfairly applying meta knowledge of what the correct answer is when assessing what claims of thei phenomenon would actually sound like.

            An adult reporting that they experience the sensations of a second body. Most likely while expressing concern that they have gone crazy. These reports will be disproportionately made to therapists who are bound by confidentiality so word will spread slowly and it will take a lot of reports before any pattern is perceived, and chances are by the time it is perceived somone will have made the claims publicly and it will be unclear if new cases are genuine or attention-whoring copycats. 

            Parents of an infant claiming their baby is somehow special (hardly unusual). They are likely to have a preferred explanation and claim that is the cause. Without the infant's cooperation they'll be unable to prove it, so a lot will be called hoaxes as the infant stops cooperating when it becomes apparent the parents went in a direction it didn't like, a lot will only be reported locally (they only told their priest and the priest didn't pass it up the chain after deciding it wasn't a real demonic possesion, etc.)

            Sure, once someone actually does track down their soulmate they'll be able to pass a variety of specific tests to prove their claim. However, that's going to take a pretty specific set of circumstances:

            1. Correctly identify the phenomenon they are experiencing (would "i have a second body" actually be your first thought?). 
            2. Make an effort to locate their soulmate
            3. Have the resources to succeed at locating their soulmate
            4. Secure the cooperation of the soulmate's caretaker(s)
            5. Go public rather than quietly exploit it for personal gain. 

            \#1 is sort of a double whammy as incorrectly identifying the phenomenon could lead to trying to prove the wrong thing. If the first person to actually clear all the other steps happens to be a UFO nut who thinks that alien hybrid babies are psychic and that's why they share the sensory experience of this baby, could majorly setback identification as they pass double blind tests cositant with the claim, so it makes sense to start looking for proof aliens.

                Keep in mind more than 1% of the population is homosexual and that has been considered a diagnosable mental illness and many people still claim it should be.

                Mostly I think that it will take long enough to prove the phenomenon is real that the initial claimants will have been diagnosed with some form of hallucination/delusion (the correct diagnosis for somone describing the symptoms without their soulmate on hand to prove it isn't), as more cases come forward it'll be reclassified as it's own separate condition, and when proof finally does happen most people will still think it's a hoax until having it personally proven to them.

                I also think you're wrong about finding reliable information. When you do that google search you will in fact find many more groups than you estimated all of whom have different mutually incompatible explanations, enough of which will be wrong by enough that they will inhibit determining the correct explanation. You provided one I hadn't thought of yourself with your parallel universe explanation which you admin might keep you from trying to track down your soulmate. Now cosider that chances are everyone who is on those message boards probably has their own unique similar idea, and you should get a better grasp of the problem. Then remember the Internet is full of trolls, and for every real case you'll have 2 lying copycats, 3 people trying to maliciously discredit the others out of spite, and a dozen parroting variations of "extraordinary claims require extrodinary proof".(numbers made up)

                You are also assuming that people connect the distinct weirdness of all the soul-sharing babies to one phenomenon.

                The parent of their own soulmate, the two infants in different cities that share a soul, the teenage boy who thinks he's hit the jackpot being breast-fed, and the priest of a cargo cult on a pacific island who's soulmate is a baby in India are not necessarily going to present symptoms similar enough to determine that they aren't four completely unrelated cases. 

                Science works not because it comes up with right answers but because it has a framework for discarding the wrong ones. That takes time, and during the process people think all kinds of wrong things. Something that is as much an outside context problem as 1. souls being real, and 2 souls being shared between bodies won't be figured out quickly. IMO a 40 year cycle (better part of two generations) from first appearance to accepted as fact and being commercially and culturally exploited is pretty fast really.

                    The problem is 1% of the population believing a thing (even if it's the same thing and provably correct) does not actually make that the majority interpretation. And in this case there won't be consensus among the 1% about what is happening, and proof will not be trivial in the general case. 

                    The 99% will be skeptical and will point out that the video would be pretty easy to fake (film the infant, then film the adult mimicking whatever the infant did and splice the footage together, a green tarp and a copy of Final Cut would probably be adequate). 

                    Also, by the time that video exists there will be people who asked their therapist about their perceptions and have been diagnosed with something. Also, if the video does go viral, expect copycats (probably involving actual cats somehow), which reduce the credibility.

                    A useful though experiment might be: Consider what you'd say to somone who replied to this thread with "hey that's exactly what's happening to me right now". How would you react if you knew this just a hypothetical world building exercise on Redit, and that person is either a troll or deluded? because THAT is how this looks to the >99% of the inhabitants of this universe who haven't experienced the phenomenon themselves, or who already sought help and have been diagnosed with delusions.

                    And to your point on social taboos:
                    Souls, witchcraft, demonic/spirit possession, and care/corruption of babies have been hotbeds for taboos longer than homosexuality has.

      > You'd suddenly care more about the suffering of folks all around the world, since you might up spending half your time in another place. 

      I would expect people with one body in a wealthy country and one body in a developing country to arrange for the latter to move to the former. But yes, you'd still spend some time living in another place and seeing the world from a different angle. 

      > Having extra children and ransoming the ones with two bodies might be lucrative.

      I was wondering if anyone would catch this exploit. Yes, I expect this to become a pretty lucrative market for a brief time, but I also expect the world to be pretty invested in finding ways to crack down on it.

    At what point during evolution did souls start connecting living creatures? Do all current humans have souls? Have all Homo Sapiens? Did extinct members of the genus Homo? All apes? Primates? Mammals? Vertebrates? Animals? Eukaryotes? If not, why not?

    Regardless, this will determine what sort of brain people wind up connected to, and how frequently they can expect to.

    Have past souls detached and gone elsewhere upon death or were they wiped clean and recycled?

    If the former, then that process has hit a major hiccup: Will souls will only depart if *all* of the creatures attached to it die, or will any single death detach all those connected, requiring them to hook up to some other soul? In either case there's an odd statistical time limit. If souls only detach if everyone dies, then progressively fewer will depart to wherever souls have gone before. Even a 1% growth rate doubles population every 70 years, roughly human life expectancy. The addition of shorter-lived animals with higher growth rates will complicate the process.

    Clearly if all lives reassign at any death things are even more chaotic as individual souls will have to incorporate partially constructed memories into their gestalt on what will shortly be a regular basis. Again, this is going to be enormously more chaotic if mice, ants, toadstool mushrooms, and staphylococci are included.

    If reincarnation is the order of the day, and non-humans are involved then it's interesting to speculate whether it was human population than caused it or, for example, the increase in populations of livestock. Is it going to be a big problem if there's a climate-based algal bloom? On the other hand, was it important that souls be regularly cleansed? Do they decay or degrade after a few hundred years of continuous use?

    On a similar note, perhaps we have not run out of souls but merely outrun their natural rate of reproduction. Was this caused by the exhaustion of some other metaphysical resource, perhaps a whole soul ecosystem is out of balance? If so souls may begin to die off for lack of sustenance, and their inability to reproduce could be a sign of darker days to come.

      ```
      > Do all current humans have souls? Have all Homo Sapiens? Did extinct members of the genus Homo?

      All minds of a deliberately vague "sufficient level of complexity" which currently only includes humans, have souls. This does probably raise some weird edge cases for, for instance, humans with brain damage, that I don't really know how to resolve.

      > Have past souls detached and gone elsewhere upon death or were they wiped clean and recycled?

      Wiped clean and recycled. 


      > On the other hand, was it important that souls be regularly cleansed?

      > On a similar note, perhaps we have not run out of souls but merely outrun their natural rate of reproduction.

      These are both excellent points. Neither of those is the case, but the people in this world have no way of knowing that, so they are both interesting things to have characters believe.

        If we're talking brain complexity, then it will almost certainly include the cetaceans who have a significantly larger and more complex cerebral cortex than humans do. Also keep in mind the weird massively parallel brain systems of the cephalopods. The larger ones might cross that complexity boundary. 

        A population of only a few million though, so it would be an edge case.

    The good news- if birth rates are high enough people become, well not immortal, but undying. If there are two-three times as many bodies as there are souls, then basically everybody has two bodies. If you lose bodies, such that you only have one body, then you will be near the top of the list to get another body. 

    There is some question if you lose something when a body dies. If you have an old body and an infant body, and the old body dies, what happens? Does the person's mind essentially regress to an infant's, who grows up normally aside from strange barely remembered memories? What about children or teenagers? If this is the case, I imagine it might take a while to find out. Long enough for people to slip through the cracks. 

    There will enevitably be cases where people are born into bad situations across the globe. People will be born across country borders with little ability to immigrate. If countries do allow reincarnates to immigrate then expect people to game that system.

    Most reincarnates will be born in places with high population growth, like India. It would be interesting to see how the Indian government reacts to wealthy foriegners trying to "steal" peoples babies.

    On the plus side I expect people to develop a lot more sympathy to the plight of others across the globe.

     I expect people who are [born into bad situations or become disabled or get very old] and have another body in good shape to commit suicide. I expect this to occur more often as we hit the twice as many bodies as souls mark and one can get a "backup" body more easily. Of course, if your new body is likely to be ransomed back to you that will effect your cost-benefit calculation.

    I also expect to see people very mad and trying to prevent people from committing suicide. After all, they are selfishly taking bodies from those more deserving, or so those people might say.

    Some people might try to pretend to be a new soul, in order to avoid being ransomed or whatever else a hostile government might do to them. Expect methods of detecting reincarnates (checking to see if the respond to foriegn languages, careful monitoring of online behavior, etc.) some of these methods will be prohibitively expensive to apply en mass (probably the more effective ones), so not everyone will be caught. Expect plent of false positives and negatives.

    As the population nears immortality, new souls would become much more rare. They would be the result of people's bodies dying at nearly the same time. I expect this to be the result of assassination or execution more often than not. Regardless, new souls would be treasured.

    Speaking of execution, criminal justice becomes much more difficult if a criminal has two bodies, especially if the government doesn't know about one.

    Having thought about the implications of a soul with two differently functional brains in the otehr discussion, it occurs to me that an adult with mental disabilities gaining a neurotypical soulmate could be an intersting case to examine.

    Would the personality of the soul inhibit the development of the second brain or would the second brain having abilities the soul previously lacked access to, but which don't violate the "mumble mumble" about super human capabilities cause changes to the personality?
