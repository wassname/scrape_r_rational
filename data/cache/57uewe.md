  Have either of you read [Wheel of Time](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime)? It's one of my favourite fantasy series, and it's incredibly prophecy heavy. I'm not sure there's a prophecy trope it doesn't use in some way. Dozens of PoV characters, and by the later books they're all being influenced by one or many prophecies, which they may or may not be interpreting correctly.

    I don't know if /u/alexanderwales has, but I haven't. Keep hearing a lot about it, but it's not all good, so I've been prioritizing other things :) I think I'm concerned that it will basically be another Sword of Truth, in that I'll enjoy the early books and characters, but the plot itself will eventually become a twisted and convoluted mess, and the characters will become caricatures of themselves.

    Has anyone read both series and can compare them a bit for me, without spoilers?

      I haven't read Sword of Truth, and honestly I doubt I can give you an objective assessment of Wheel of Time, since I started reading it at thirteen and my fondness for it is probably influenced a lot by nostalgia.

      I got about halfway through the first book and then stopped. Most of the analysis I'd heard about the series was that it really started getting good around book four, then there was a stretch from book 6-10 where nothing much happens.

      I wanted to read the series mostly because it's one of the big ones, but I have a fairly strict "drop it if I'm not having fun" policy on longer series (i.e. don't throw good money after bad). The prospect of suffering through somewhere between four and seven books that I wouldn't really be enjoying just to get fantasy reader completion credit didn't seem worth it.

  I saw in your linked post that you said:

  > Almost every single story that has a prophecy or any kind of "precognition" in it could remain exactly the same, or be improved, by the clean removal of them.

  I think there is one prophecy that falls out of that category, the one from the Lego Movie. It's unique for a specific reason: it's complete ########. To quote the guy the seer: "I made it all up." What are your thoughts on it? I'm not trying to nit-pick your views or anything, I would just like to hear your thoughts on it.

  Edit: Just saw [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2z5ooe/d_goddamn_do_i_hate_prophecies/cpfzsjv) you made which answers my question. Sorry about that.

    No problem :) I also talk about it a bit in the episode. Overall it was amusing and mostly well done, but it still acts as a "twist" that subverts the prophecy, while the whole movie you and everyone else has no reason not to treat it like it's real. Plus, he really does end up being the hero that saves the day, so...

  ```
  From a story structure perspective, what about prophecies that are resolved towards the beginning of the story, as the inciting incident?  For example, a post-apocalyptic story where there was a prophecy in the backstory about what would set off the apocalypse?  In this case, the prophecy doesn't so much drive the plot directly as it establishes the legitimacy of the source.
