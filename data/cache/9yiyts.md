## I think I've noticed a basic bias in plot structure that is related to author gender. Can you sanity check me?

### Post:

When I started reading Wildbow's Worm I remember I ran across a number of message board threads in which readers were speculating that Wildbow was female due to how well he seemed to be able to write a female character. And I'd also wondered briefly if Wildbow was female, but then I saw how the plot went and decided based on my past reading the author was probably male.

What was it that made me think this? It seems to me that I've noticed a pattern in sci-fi/fantasy plots by male vs female writers. In Worm (which I consider to some extent the archetypal example of this) POV characters have a tendency to become more dangerous and capable the more they're tortured. Taylor is at her most terrifying when things are at their worst. Indeed, the whole setting revolves around the conceit that in a small percentage of cases a person who has been totally crushed will gain the power to effectively fight back. This is a theme I seem to see over and over in male authored sci-fi and fantasy, especially in the "rational" writing community, which is, presumably, almost exclusively male. POV characters become more dangerous and capable the worse the situation is and the more they've been tortured by the author, almost as though the torture earns them power. Overwhelming odds produce superhuman performance.

By contrast, female authored sci-fi and fantasy more commonly seems from what I have read to have plots where a POV character confronted by overwhelming odds or torture will not exhibit corresponding superhuman performance, but will instead simply fail. However, they generally survive that failure, often (it seems from my reading) falling into an imprisonment or slavery situation in which they lose the majority or even all of their agency (sometimes even a situation with disturbing elements of sexual slavery and humiliation) from which the POV character will then be able to organize a chance to escape and turn the tables, but only after a prolonged period of helplessness and commonly subjugation to a hostile character's will. The archetypal example of this plot in my reading is in the works of Vernor Vinge's former wife, Joan D. Vinge, in her Cat series, and another great (horrible?) example is Stephanie Meyers' Host. I am, sadly, in general less able to offer examples of this than of the "overwhelming odds produces superhuman performance" plot, as I have a tendency to quit and discard stories with too much failure and helplessness and too little superhuman performance.

To put this in crude and very sexist terms, from my reading it almost seems that if, for instance, a male author's POV character were about to be raped they would be more likely to suddenly develop superpowers (in one form or another) to fight off or kill their attacker, either before or after the attack, while a female author's character would more likely fail to offer effective resistance, be raped, get pregnant (or get a disease, or get abducted and held in slavery), have to piece back together their shattered life/psyche, and then finally reacquire full agency and go on to do something effective.

I formed this observation after a period during which I sought out the works of female sci-fi and fantasy authors, however I accept the possibility that I may be wrong (indeed the likelihood that I am wrong and have fallen victim to my own biases). I have definitely noticed occasional counter examples, for instance Richard Adams has a number of stories in which his female characters are literally held in sex slavery, and Brian Sanderson's Stormlight series has a main character enslaved early in the first book and stay a slave for more than one book (although I notice that Sanderson's character seems to have rather extreme amounts of agency for someone who is a slave, including such things as hidden superpowers, something I've observed to be more common among male author's characters who are enslaved in some manner). Stephan King also represents a counter example of sorts, though an odd one, in that his male characters seem to generally follow the normal pattern of increased capabilities under pressure, while his female characters instead seem to have a tendency to show hidden depths of weakness and helplessness when the chips are down.

Could I have some outside input? More counter examples are welcomed.

  I'm not sure if I've noticed a gender difference, but it's an interesting thought  While reading this, though, I couldn't help but think that the latter example of failing, having horrible things happen to you, and having to pick up the pieces is more rational and realistic. People don't suddenly gain new abilities when the chips are down. If you fight in the face of overwhelming odds *you'll probably lose*.

  I'd be interested in a different perspective to this, though.

    Another interesting thought is to wonder if male readers like the power trip fantasy of the unrealistic plot more, while female readers prefer the "realistic" one. Is is interesting to notice that almost all "rational" fiction follows the unrealistic irrational power trip plotline.

      That's an interesting point. I generally like reading stories that are either nonfiction or have really realistic characters, because I can use some of the strategies for dealing with things in real life. (Mainly interpersonal relationships, and judged based on how realistic the dialogue and interactions actually are)

    While that is true for real life, it would also depend on the power system in use. A system that uses willpower as fuel could get a sudden burst of power from an adrenaline-fueled "fight of flight" response.

    Still, I agree with the above for the most part.

      Or someone who's had some abilities all along but hasn't been willing to use them (for whatever reason) could suddenly try something they haven't tried before.

      Still, I also generally agree with the above.  If you want someone to suddenly show new powers at the most desperate moment, and you want to be remotely realistic, you need to justify it.

    Perhaps the extreme level shown in fiction is unrealistic, but this behavior of bouncing back does exist in the real world. If we enjoy reading capable protagonists, then it makes sense that this kind of trait would be selected for. And from that poll before, we know that a large part of the rational fiction fanbase value competent characters.

  Honestly, I feel you are reaching. There are enough works out there now that you can pin any kind of trend you want and have no shortage of examples.

  You used *Worm* as an example, and yet the sequel *Ward* features a protagonist who is an excellent counter example, someone who wasn't empowered by being broken but instead has required four years of intensive therapy just to get to being *functional* after what happened to them in *Worm*. Not to mention that the unconnected work the same author wrote immediately after *Worm*, *Pact* is one I lost interest in for the same reason as you did with many of your counterexamples

    [I've written on /r/Parahumans](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/9oexpn/ward_spoilers_frustration_with_the_state_of_the/e7tprmt/?context=3) about how Ward, with its acknowledgement that people don't instantly "bounce back" from trauma, represents a much more mature outlook than the largely-optimistic "teenage" outlook of Worm. And that, I think, may be at the root of what we're seeing here.

    Without overly generalizing, it's within reason that many female science fiction authors, who have generally had to show the maturity to succeed in a male-dominated subindustry (and an industry based on imagination, to boot!), may tend to write characters who similarly have to mature before they can display agency.

  There are enough examples and counter-examples that you can choose to see any trend you like. Broadly speaking, though, I think *on average* itâ€™s true that protagonists of stories written by male authors have noticeable differences from protagonists of stories written by female authors, and that can manifest in many ways. 

  Again, though, since this vague feeling of averages is just a quick internal survey of the examples you can think of, it depends on the kinds of media you consume.

  A good author will have both. Even a bad but prolific author will almost certainly eventually have both situations.

  Harry Potter series has both situations.

  Hunger games series has both situations.

  Time braid seems to have both situations.

  I'm actually having trouble coming up with any mainstream stories that seem to just have only instant superpowers. Or always losing to become more powerful and recover.

    I think one of the major criticisms that I have seen of the Harry Potter series is somewhat in line with the thoughts outlined in this post. I've seen repeated many times on a predominantly male forum (which shall remain nameless) that there was this shift in tone between book 1-4 and 6-7, with 5 being a transition between the two.

    In the beginning, the story plays out like a typical boyish fantasy, with Harry being set up as the archetypal hero figure, performing amazing feats and overcoming incredible challenges against all odds. In these books the plots revolve around Harry (+friends) acting independently and trying to resolve their own problems; he has a boatload of agency, and the authority figures are often the main antagonists. And then in book 5 he is sidelined by these same authority figures, and when he eventually rebels and acts independently it goes awful. 

    Book 6 is Harry trying to recover from the slapdown life gave him, and he just goes along for the ride with dumbledore, and his attempts at independence go awfully. Book 7 is just Harry reacting to plot and doing what dumbledore or some other person tells him to do(read: hermione), with the anti-climactic grand finale being to surrender in a dumb christ parallel *to the literal* (figurative) *devil* (which, lets be honest, was an awful idea. What if it didn't work? Harry is dead, voldemort proceeds to kill all the mudbloods and rules britain with an iron fist). 

    Also, they complain that this shift in tone is accompanied by Hermione going from helpful sidekick to kingmaker. :shrug:

    I don't agree on all points, and I definitely don't think it's simply because Rowling is a woman that it played out this way. What I do agree with is that I felt the books became increasingly unsatisfying to me as I was reading them, even though I couldn't say why that was. It is the main reason I gave HPMOR a shot and eventually found my way here,  so I'm thankful for that.

      Okay, there are many criticisms to point at HP, but this is not one of them. He's doing exactly what his mother did for him. At the very least (and that happened too) everyone he died for will be protected from Voldemort and his death eaters' curses, so they might at least defeat his side of the war, if not Voldemort himself.
      ```

      - u/nohat:
        ```
        If that was all it took then the Killing Curse wouldn't be considered unblockable. Basically there must be some sort of head canon to explain why this doesn't happen all the time. It's also not clear if death eaters were included in the protection, and while it made voldemort's status effects wear off quicker (stun, silence), I doubt decapitation would wear off.

  I don't think you're the first to notice this.  Hell, in Japan, the entire genre wherein a plucky male hero barely scrapes out a series of inevitable wins against increasingly powerful opponents due to increasingly contrived power gains in their increasingly most desperate hour is called...  "boy" (shounen).

  It's gotten to the point where it's refreshing to see a young male protagonist actually lose at something meaningful.
  ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    I agree. Japanese media has a tendency to target very specific demographics in ways that you don't see in the west as starkly, which does present some juicy data points up for interpretation. 

    I think he's somewhat right about the male portion of his analysis, mostly in that genre fiction tends to be where men go to live out their power fantasies, and those fantasies tend to echo each other.  

    He's way off in the female portion, I think because the specifics he provides, which indicates he probably does not read a lot of fiction authored by women, and because his examples seem to be drawing a false equivalence. I do think women have their own power fantasies that differ from men's, but I don't know precisely what they are.

  You are just pattern-matching to your theory.

  Even in your main example - Worm, there are characters who dont improve under pressure (e.g Panacea and Glory Girl), and this is even more so the case in Ward. And if you look at the rest of Wildbow's works your theory makes even less sense - in Pact for example overwhelming odds often make the protagonist weaker.
  ```

- u/eroticas:
  ```
  I haven't read most of the works in your analysis. Off the top of my head, some major sci fi/fantasy books involving a realistic depiction of trauma and ptsd are 

  Harry Potter (Rowling, female) is kinda a superpowered revenge fantasy against the Durseleys right at the start (albeit, he doesn't gain powers via torture, they torture him because of his powers). He revisits this dynamic with Malfoy and Umbridge to some extent (Malfoy's bullying gets Harry the broom, etc) 

  Animorphs (applegate, female) tend to become more formidable the more they are tortured. Although, sometimes this ruthlessness is arguably bad and leading to worse decisions. Much of the serious is ghostwritten. 

  Winston from 1984 break under torture (Orwell, male). But the whole story is a tragedy, which shifts the dynamic. 

  Ender's game (card, male) confirms your hypothesis by getting more formidable the more he is tortured (but it was all a mistake in the end, and ultimately most of the people he hurt were not the ones who hurt him). 

  Matilda (Dahl, male) confirms your hypothesis with her psychic powers being triggered by anger.

  So far I'm not convinced. That said, all these works are so popular that they filter more for success than any artifacts of the author's gender's psychology. If you wanna make generalizations about gender it might be more helpful to see what books boys and girls *read* rather than *write*.

  >Stephan King also represents a counter example of sorts, though an odd one, in that his male characters seem to generally follow the normal pattern of increased capabilities under pressure, while his female characters instead seem to have a tendency to show hidden depths of weakness and helplessness when the chips are down.

  Don't forget Carrie, she's kind of like the horror version of Matilda, albeit she does have to sit there and be tortured until the final breaking point.

    Matilda's powers are triggered by boredom, not anger. Her immense intellect requires an outlet, which she cannot get because the tyrannical headmistress won't let her advance a grade. This is literally stated by the narrator.

  Which books are you thinking of, for King?

  Counter example is Terry Goodkind in Wizard's First Rule, before the protag became a massive Mary Sue, and I think Patricia Briggs Lionheart series? Also LKH's Anita Blake series. May be worth differentiating not just gender of writer but "class" of character. I would be surprised if females writing female warriors didn't give them that Limit Break.

  - u/OrzBrain:
    ```
    Pretty much every single female character he's ever written, including Susannah in the Dark Tower, who I think he actually meant as an intentional counter example, but which still didn't come across that way for me. Consider how much of the story she spends with her mind broken in one way or another, repeatedly acting as the antagonist, *and* being hijacked by being pregnant with another antagonist. None of the male characters were nearly so likely to being rendered helpless or subject to being hijacked by outside forces, body and mind.

    And have you noticed the death rates of male vs female chars in his books?

    I did consider mentioning LKH's Anita Blake as a counter example, but then I would have had to admit that I actually read those things. After a while the mechanical elements of the antagonist being introduced as the most powerful thing ever and then the protag leveling up and casually swatting the antag at the end via unearned power really started to bug me, and that was *before* it turned into a porn series.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Susannah fights back each time, though. Like bad things happen to her, but she never just breaks down and "takes it," which is how I interpreted your post. Like even when the demon was raping her, she let Odetta "out" to use that personality to fight back and hold him in place when he tried to escape.

      *shrugs* Beverly starts in abusive relationships with both her dad and husband, but her first scene ends with a limit break, and she eventually limit breaks against her dad? Pretty sure the wife in the Shining fought back when Jack went nuts. Protag in Rose Madder starts the book fleeing an abusive relationship, but when he shows up again she kills him. 

      Maybe that's more what you mean, an enduring first rather than Limit Breaking right away. But you may be confusing "bad stuff happens to women" with "women are rendered helpless?" I know you said they eventually turn it around, but when we're talking about *on-screen time* I think King's women tend to spend more of it fighting back than enduring.

      Agreed with Anita Blake, it has good parts to it but the bad ultimately outweighed it for me. Was still a guilty pleasure for awhile.

  Lois McMaster Bujold's characters have gained skills and abilities during torture and subjugation on several occasions. The most obvious example is Mark's torture on Jackson's Whole in *Mirror Dance*, where he gains the ability to perfectly compartmentalize his psyche to resist the torture indefinitely and then kill his torturer.

  So, no, I don't think there's a gender pattern here. I would instead expect that "the hero struggles and overcomes torture" is a common trope, and it just happens that the couple of trope-breakers the OP is familiar with are by female authors.

  There is definitely a male voice and a female voice when it comes to writing. It just makes sense considering that men and women on the whole see the world in different ways. However, whether or not you can detect this really comes down to the authors writing style. 

  If you're reading a lot of fan works or personal projects then I suspect that the vast majority of the writers are not going to bother trying to write in a way that would obfuscate their gender, but a skilled writer could definitely do so, or even write in a way that people might perceive as more masculine or feminine, intentionally. 

  Like others have said, trying to pin this down to specific buzzwords or concepts, like some sort of mathematical formula, is likely to be an endeavor fraught with mistakes. Instead, I think a study of the characters and settings would be able to reveal much of the authors worldview and then you may be able to infer a gender (or even a race or class) from there. At least, that's how we did it back when I was in college, so many eons ago.

  The major gender bias I've noticed is that female authors consider being fat to be terrible, torturous and almost fate worse then death. Male authors just *meh*.

  Another counter-example: Miles Vorkosigan, written by a female author, and who is a protagonist very much of the first type you cite (he's even explicitly conscious that he does much better under pressure, and eagerly piles on constraints during conflicts because it 'activates' his super-awareness while hobbling his opponents).

  Even in the book where he fails hard, gets fired from his job (though there is conveniently no permanent casualty), breaks up with his girlfriend and ends up depressed with no apparent future, he turns things around spectacularly, saves his former boss' life, lands an even better job in the end and gets the girl.

  I'd reccomend reading some Anne Mccaffery. The Rowan series has a few examples of both your patterns in stories. Some times within the same characters. Pretty long series though each book is mie like a diary/series in itself for a given character then a conventional plot. 

  The pern series is more about powerful relationships giving you power in my experience (dragon bonding). Both series are sci fi although science marches on happened to a lot of the psychic stuff its no more out there then dune.

  For a direct fantasy try the enchanted forest chronicles. Its actually a pretty fun fantasy/fairy tale deconstruction. Although I think it was written backwards so the last book ends up being oner of the weaker ones.

  However power and ability is not exponential and not strictly speaking what any of the stories are about. 

  Ursula k leguin tends not to focus on exponential power much at all in my experience and although trauma and stress might give characters a boost its just as likely to destroy them.

  A further counter to where this trend is coming from could need made with the Lauren Faust MLP reboot. Her contributions and push for the show was more of a action/adventure pattern and less slice of life. So the bias you might be seeing is in publishers (who are often established people from an older era with their own bias bundle) and readers favoring a familiar pattern rather then an inherent bias in the authors on gender lines.
  ```

- u/gridpoint:
  ```
  What you're referring to is a general trope where characters learn from bad experiences and get better at action during crises. Comparable to leveling up in games.

  In Worm getting powers is usually a traumatic event that isn't of immediate benefit. Taylor getting her powers only ended up with her in the hospital for days. There was no fighting back then, only the suffering. She didn't get to use her powers against her tormentors until much later when she fought against the Wards. And it's suggested that capes are drawn toward similar crises that resulted in their trigger event. Anyone undergoing a trigger event results in nearby parahumans becoming incapacitated and suffering momentary memory loss so those conflict situations still aren't easy.

  Same thing with HPMOR, where a rational Harry Potter takes stock after a traumatic event, listing all the ways he could have reacted differently to prepare himself for the next crisis.

  I think a good sanity check might be thinking about random books written by women and seeing how they compare to this.

  I definitely understand what you're getting at, but I don't think it's a certain general-case.

  What I've experienced in Male vs. Female authors is that with female authors, the books tend to have more "It's ok to stick around at our current level of power and write slice-of-life stuff."

  Male writers seem to be more interested in getting to the point, and going above and beyond. Male story-telling seems to revolve around getting somewhere, going places, and being ambitious as hell. With female authors, the characters go to the same places, get around the same areas, and they ascend to the same levels as male-written ambitious characters, it's just not _about_ the getting there.

  It's surprisingly similar to how men and women look at sex. With men, there's a slow build-up, and you're slowly but surely _focusing_ on that one bit of release at the end, when you're above everything else. With women, it's more about the build-up, the sexyness beforehand, during, after, etc... 

  Men seem to also be a lot less accepting of defeat and submission because of hormones and the like.

  TL;DR: Guys and girls write books like how they have sex, but not in the way you've implied, in my opinion.
