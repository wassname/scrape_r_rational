  Wow, I completely forgot about this one. It feels like it's been years since it updated.

    It actually reliably updates every four to seven months.  Twice a year on average

    Sailor Mercury gets isekaied into the dungeon keeper (both 1 and 2) universe and then has to fend for herself against a world of antagonistic bad guys (other keepers and suchlike) who see her as a threat, and antagonistic good guys, who assume she's evil because she's a keeper. Armed with her sailor powers and science, she sloooowly manages to hold her own.

      I miss Beryl and her shenanigans in portal-space. Was that just a one-off plot bunny? I found this story in 2014, and it was huge even back then.

    I highly suggest it even if you have no familiarity with either story universe, I didnt either and I still thought the story was great
