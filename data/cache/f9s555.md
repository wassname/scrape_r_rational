  ```
  The marshmallows and the 15-minute wait were a reference to the Stanford marshmallow experiment. And Chili's "you all eat too slow, he could take the food away anytime and you'll be sorry you didn't eat when you could" was a reference to follow-up studies involving reliability. Any more psychology references in this chapter?

    >"you all eat too slow, he could take the food away anytime and you'll be sorry you didn't eat when you could" was a reference to follow-up studies involving reliability

    Also painfully invokes the real fears and behaviors abused/neglected children tend to develop. Foster kids whose original families starved them will often steal/hoard food or overeat when it's available, for exactly the reason Chili gave. (Eating to the point of vomiting, like he did in an earlier chapter, is also a real thing; kids who have been hungry their whole lives aren't easily able to tell when they're full.)
    ```

    ```
    Explanation please?
    ```

    - u/gryfft:
      ```
      [Here's the link to the Wikipedia page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment), but in a nutshell, the experiment was an attempt to measure self-control and delayed gratification in different circumstances for children aged 3-5. 

      They had hypotheses about how different activities would affect ability to delay gratification. They gave the kids a choice: one marshmallow now, or wait fifteen minutes and get two. They did followup studies on the kids later in their lives and found better life outcomes for the kids who managed to patiently wait.

      Subsequent studies found that socioeconomic status explains a lot of this. So, Chili eating the marshmallow both reflects his background of abject poverty as well as predicting bad life outcomes for  him.

  Welp, there goes my suspension of disbelief. Good-tasting fondant? Really?

  (Good luck Gaizemaze, I hope things get better for you at a rate that's surprising, but not so fast that these well-wishes sound like wishful thinking.)
  ```

- u/RUGDelverOP:
  ```
  There's two chapters, make sure you read them both.
  ```

  - u/gryfft:
    ```
    Thanks for mentioning, I'd missed it entirely.

    /u/gazemaize, I think I speak for more than myself when I say I'd definitely contribute to a Patreon or GoFundMe if it could help your situation trend towards tenable any more quickly.
    ```

    - u/tomtan:
      ```
      I would gladly do the same
      ```

  The vape room explicitly did not go where I expected. As Chili says, she has spoken multiple complete sentences before! Perhaps her zen-like brain-damaged state will mean Mahuika is the true winner. Except she vapes so probably not.

  I love the reference to the [Stanford Marshmallow Experiment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment).

  But what happens now that the title character has been eliminated? HAS the title character been eliminated? You couldn't do something like change the name of an ongoing story. Who would do something like *that*? Maybe somebody litigating a grudge. Some kind of grudge litigation. 

  We'll find out in a long time I guess! Thank you for this story so far, Gazemaize. It's been a highlight of every day there's been a chapter. It's the new weird thing I try to get my friends to read with no context. It's a love letter to Dahl but the writing style is also all you in the best way. Take your time and take good care of yourself.
  ```

  - u/CeruleanTresses:
    ```
    Maybe we'll find out what happens to eliminated contestants between when they screw up and when they're released from the factory. That's a perspective we never got to see in the original book.
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      Wonka mentions off-hand that they get their lifetime supply of chocolate.
      ```

      - u/Makin-:
        ```
        He didn't mention how long that lifetime would be.
        ```

      - u/CeruleanTresses:
        ```
        Sure, but we never get to see firsthand the process of de-blueberrying or otherwise getting them into condition to be released. So maybe we'll get to see that side of the factory from Chili's perspective.
        ```

        - u/gryfft:
          ```
          Don't forget that he's now a *citizen* of Wonkaland.
          ```

- u/tomtan:
  ```
  ok, next story by gazemaize "Tide and the Chocolate Factory"  continues after the Vape Room :)
  ```

- u/CWRules:
  ```
  Well that didn't go where I was expecting.
  ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  ... what?
  ```

  - u/Roneitis:
    ```
    This is a perfect comment
    ```

    - u/Uncaffeinated:
      ```
      ...for every single chapter of this story.
      ```

- u/None:
  ```
  mahuika is one of the better characters genre fiction has ever placed before us
  ```

  ```
  >A plate fell into his hands and he started to devour it.

  *crunch*
  ```

  - u/gryfft:
    ```
    > After everyone had eaten enough cake and WonkaFondant and paper plates Mr. Bucket and the five children left to go to the Vaping Room.

    They were paper plates! Perfectly edible.

  ```
  if chilli is really gone, I must say I did not see this coming.

  Also, hiatus :(
  ```

- u/xamueljones:
  ```
  This wouldn't be the first time that gazemaize/teddyteddyteddy >!killed off!< the protagonist.

  Also how many people believe the hiatus notice is true or not? I'm tentatively leaning towards true but I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't.
  ```

  - u/CWRules:
    ```
    > Also how many people the hiatus notice is true or not? I'm tentatively leaning towards true but I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't.

    It would be a really stupid thing to lie about. What if he actually does need to take a break and nobody believes him?
    ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      It's mainly because chapter 6 was a fake-out with everyone thinking the story was finished and done. It even had "Status: Complete" on the fanfiction website, until the seventh chapter was posted.

      I'm just wary of the hiatus notice being the same thing where the next chapter ends up being posted a week or two later pleasantly surprising people.
      ```

      - u/CWRules:
        ```
        People thinking you're lying about a story being finished is one thing. People thinking you're lying about taking time off for your mental health is another. That's not something I'd want to train my readers to expect.
        ```

        - u/xamueljones:
          ```
          True and that's an important distinction, which is why I'm somewhat willing to believe the hiatus is true. But I'm still wary.

          EDIT: I may also be biased towards hoping it's a fake-out, because that would mean both that the story is being updated soon and that gazemaize isn't having real life problems which would be really nice.
          ```

          - u/CouteauBleu:
            ```
            Yeah, I wouldn't get my hopes up.

            "Nope, turns out I didn't have life balance problems after all" doesn't really make for a good or shocking joke.

            Odds are the author is mentioning mental health problems because they're having mental health problems.
            ```

    ```
    i was wondering what else this person had written, is that a name i could find on ao3? would it be worth my while? canâ€™t check at work
    ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      There was a website with other works, but it got taken down, so it's not online anymore.

      I'll PM you my offline copies.
      ```

      - u/obelisk729:
        ```
        Sorry to bother, but would you mind PMing them to me as well? Game by God very much sounds like something I would dig.
        ```

        - u/xamueljones:
          ```
          Sent. Let me know if there was any issues.

        thank you! are they similar to this? worth reading?

          A brief history of Korridor shamelessly ripped from this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dvlxwu/what_happened_to_game_by_god_and_monsters_and/):

          * *Game By God* was about a web serial writer who competes in a *Danganronpa*\-style murder-mystery elimination game. It was put on hiatus a couple of  chapters into its third arc because the author thought it was too ambitious
          * *Ship Poster* was about a virtuoso violinist hired to play for a luxury cruise ship  that rich people go on to live out their final days. About two-dozen chapters were released in total before the story was also put on hiatus for reasons I won't repeat here (they were given in a blog post titled "You Fooled Me Once")
          * *Serial Infringement* had a really cool twist on a superhero premise, but only one chapter was released before the site (and the author's various accounts) went offline

          They have nothing in common with *Chili and the Chocolate Factory* other than meta-themes like when in chapter 6 where they talk about the nature of stories and audience expectations (remember the bit about marbles?).

          All of the stories were pretty good on a chapter to chapter basis, but none of them have proper endings. They were well-written enough to the point that I'm still glad to have read them even with the abrupt endings. But your mileage may vary.
          ```

            appreciate it.

            Those all sound really interesting! Can you pm me your copies too?

        Hi, I'd love a PM too... I somehow never read his work before. Thanks!

    Is that the case? I thought he just forgot that the Cake Room was between the stairs and the Vaping Room.
    ```

- u/fljared:
  ```
  Does anyone know what the "Happiness Central" is in reference to? Is that another Urkeldelphia?
  ```

- u/xamueljones:
  ```
  Does anyone think the fondant thing is a reference to "The cake is a lie!" thing?

  After all, Bucket keeps promising things and either doesn't deliver, or in with side effects that make people regret getting their gifts.
  ```

  - u/CannedRealm:
    ```
    I just thought it was a reference to fondant being inedible plastic.

    - u/MultipartiteMind:
      ```
      Chapter 12, read (first uploaded or not?) before the above comment was made.  '>!Fine! Fine! But please! If you must skip steps, at least touch them with your shoes! It will contaminate the WonkaSteps otherwise! JUROR! No! You cannot land on the steps with your teeth! No! Your exposed bones are not any better! Stop it! JUROR, I am begging you!!<'
      ```

      - u/Uncaffeinated:
        ```
        I think it still says that. It's been a very long time since I read the original book, so I didn't notice the similarity to Gloop.
        ```

        - u/MultipartiteMind:
          ```
          Ahh.  Before Gloop falls (though in the first movie is pushed?) in, 'Oh, no! Please, Augustus, please! I beg of you not to do that. My chocolate must be untouched by human hands!'.  Once Gloop is in the chocolate, Wonka doesn't say a word until he goes up the pipe--even when told that Gloop cannot swim--and then afterwards laughs, teases the parents about Gloop not being turned into marshmallows because the pipe goes to the Fudge room, and then assures them that he is perfectly safe.

    Considering it takes a transhuman candy wizard to make edible, and probably gives you tumors, i'd put it down for hate there.

  To be frank I don't know whether he's just fucking with us or it's actually on hiatus and also fucking with us.
