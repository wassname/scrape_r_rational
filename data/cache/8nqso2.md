    Right? I could just *feel* the indignation.
    ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      Indignation? I was reading it as pants\-wetting *fear* at what the two crazy teenagers were thinking and that he was stuck on a boat for a week with them.

    I was surprised at "Small Pokémon, only at the pool area" though. I mean, Pokémon are pets. Even that giant fire\-breathing dragon is gonna snuggle up to its trainer given the chance.

      Also gonna poop a fiery mess in the hallways if they're not careful. Best contain it to where it'll do the least damage, clean up wise.

    Felt like a pretty accurate depiction of what a crush at that age is like. A strange kind of obsession that creeps up on you, but without the specific content it would have for an adult

      ```
      >the specific content it would have for an adult

      I'm borrowing this 10/10 euphemism
      ```

- u/nicholaslaux:
  ```
  Actual prediction regarding the multiple psychics per group - each R&D team hires at least one psychic to detect intrusion from other teams as a psychic equivalent to an NDA to foster the ability to collaborate. Each group of two or more is a group of that many different teams working together, without having to worry about it their patents or other ideas are being leaked.
  ```

  - u/akaltyn:
    ```
    I suspect that Red is going to get another reminder, like with Sabrina, that there are players in this world who don't fuck around.
    ```

  - u/Lipat97:
    ```
    Or they were all specifically invited for something to do with Mewtwo. It could also be that closet psychics are more likely to succeed because they use their powers to get to the top. But yeah yours seems the most plausible.
    ```

  - u/ManyCookies:
    ```
    But Red only noticed the minds on Day 2, if they were protection psychics they'd be around on Day 1. And if they weren't coordinated they wouldn't be in symmetrical positions.
    ```

    - u/nicholaslaux:
      ```
      Only noticing on day 2 seems like he could have just missed it on the first day.

      As for the symmetry, I'm not really sure what that implies. It could be something to do positioning how psychics can shield others' minds, and if everyone has a psychic in their group, then they'll be clustered similarly?
      ```

      - u/ManyCookies:
        ```
        Oh Red was specifically pushing his mental senses out when he first noticed, that's plausible then.
        ```

    - u/Electric999999:
      ```
      There's no indication that anyone knew boarded the ship at any point, so they must have been there from the start. Red just didn't notice them because he wasn't using his psychic abilities.
      ```

  I know exactly where this chapter is heading.. and that escalated quickly. "Fun, peaceful cruise" indeed.
  ```

  - u/KnickersInAKnit:
    ```
    Okay that Leaf quote out of context with all the discussion about taking the fic in a lemony direction had me in tears.

- u/The_Magus_199:
  ```
  *I got this feeling at like three AM while watching Netflix~*

  Okay but more seriously, great chapter. It’s really nice to get back to Red and Leaf after a pretty long time with just Blue’s group, Red meeting president Silph was pretty cool, Red’s caught the preparations for the attack on the S.S. Anne but doesn’t realize it yet, and... um...

  ...Oh, who am I kidding. As awesome as this chapter is, too much of my processing power is taken up by an infinitely-looping squeal at the cuteness of Red’s crush for me to make any sort of rational commentary. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ll be listening to *I Ship It* for a month.

  I loved the Game Freak reference. Pokemon games on both sides of the fourth wall!
  ```

  - u/PDNeznor:
    ```
    Also the pokemon amie and holocaster cameos! Looks like somebody just finished a replay of x/y.
    Man, I hope Game Freak gets those AR helmets out soon so *somebody* gets a scouter level reference in.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      No replay needed, I've been thinking about these things since I first played them years ago :P It's just a convenient place in the story to have them brought up as works-in-progress, for whenever the X and Y stories take place in relation to Gen 1.
      ```

- u/Grasmel:
  ```
  Now I'm really conflicted. The obvious thing for Reds personal growth and career ambitions would be to stop being a trainer, yes. I thought as much back when he talked with Sabrina. On the other hand, that would be crap for the story. Splitting the party temporarily is one thing, but a permanent split wouldn't make sense. 

  Here's my prediction: Red will decide to stay with the group for a while longer, a few months or so. He will justify it to himself by saying "a few months won't make a big difference over the span of my life" and because he doesn't want to leave his friends. It will also be because of his crush, but he won't admit that to himself.
  ```

  - u/u__v:
    ```
    I honestly think a 6 to 18 month separation for the group would be pretty good for where the story is right now. Blue is coming down off a harrowing encounter that cost him his strongest Pokemon, and nearly got them all killed. At the same time, he seems to be responding really well to the environment of Vermilion Gym, and so I can really easily see him just throwing himself into that fully for a while, especially when the next gym is Erika. After the boat stuff, there's definitely enough weird stuff going on to potentially keep Leaf busy piecing together loose threads, and that could easily lead her to branch off into Red's mom's story line to actually progress the plot. Meanwhile, Red can take some levels in Wiz, flesh out the Mewtwo storyline a little with Sabrina, and maybe publish a paper or two.  


    Plus, there's all sorts of stuff that naturally would bring the party back together in the near\-ish future. Blue is definitely going to want to train his Abra for Erika and Koga, and will probably need Red's help. Leaf would probably be the one who first stumbles upon the whole Lavender town mess, and will probably want some reinforcements to help save Mr. Fuji, which just snowballs into invading Silph co, the radio tower, and then the Rocket lair.
    ```

    - u/Kizadek:
      ```
      Yep, I am totally comfortable with this as well. Even some time skip would be well received.
      ```

  - u/InfernoVulpix:
    ```
    Given the indication that Red's going to ask his mom about Silph (and we all know the mess involved with that), I feel like the story's nearing a tipping point, the start of Act 2 if you will.

    Red's got a once in a lifetime opportunity to get just about the best psychic training possible, Blue's gathering a following and exercising his leadership skills independent of the group.  Leaf has the foundations laid and basic lessons learned to start pursuing stories on her own and earning acclaim as a journalist.

    I figure that these competing pressures will soon come to a head and have the group split up temporarily - a few months, maybe a year or two - before they reunite in Act 3 once whatever Team Rocket's doing comes into full force and the heroes need to save the day.
    ```

  - u/Electric999999:
    ```
    Well he has one goal that requires him to be a trainer, fighting the legendary birds.
    ```

  - u/Silver_Swift:
    ```
    He's also like twelve, right? It's not a terrible idea to stick around and have fun with his friends for a bit before he surrounds himself with psychics (who, as has been established, don't have the best interpersonal skills) 24/7.
    ```

    - u/ketura:
      ```
      I dunno.  If the psychic Stephen Hawking told me I had a time-limited offer to study directly under her, I might have to consider that such opportunities don't roll around every day.
      ```

    - u/The_Magus_199:
      ```
      Yeah, like, I’d say that even if just for a well-rounded growth slash “put on your own oxygen mask first” standpoint, taking the time to be with his friends and grow up *is* a tangible benefit that Red really shouldn’t feel guilty about considering with the weight it deserves.

          I suspect Oak and his Mom would also be kinda worried about Sabrina having so much influence on him at a formative age
          ```

  - u/TheGreatTactician:
    ```
    Honestly I see this dilemma as a non\-issue. Red should just continue journeying with his friends until Blue and Aiko finish off collecting their gym badges. That would only take a year or two max with their skill levels, I imagine. Meanwhile, he can continue growing his talents for training and catching new Pokémon to help him with his research, as well as working on his psychic abilities himself and chipping away at new research work.   


    It honestly seems like Red is acting like he has less time than he actually does when realistically, unless he meets an untimely end, he has plenty of time.
    ```

    - u/Silver_Swift:
      ```
      The only problem with that is that Sabrina's offer might not be valid any more in a year or two.

      I agree that finishing his journey first is the correct decision, but he is giving something up to do it.
      ```

  - u/tokol:
    ```
    Planning for the future is well and good, but I think we're all about to learn a more important lesson: opportunities happen before you're "ready" for them.

    My guess is that Red's current emotional conflict will be resolved when the plot swoops in and forces Leaf and him to save the ship (for some unknown value of "save"). Additionally, just to make the choice for Red more clear, I wouldn't be surprised if Sabrina ends up implicated (*we do know she is working for Giovanni*).
    ```

- u/WalterTFD:
  ```
  It's funny to think of humans attempting to survive in this world before they could catch Pokemon.  Truly, the past is a foreign country.

  Man, that was a lot less disastrous than I thought it would be, given how the last chapter ended.

    I considered posting a chapter consisting entirely of the following instead, for at least a few hours:

    >Red and Leaf lie on the SS Anne sundeck, sipping drinks. The sun is warm, and the waves make a soothing refrain all around them. Red turns to Leaf and says, "What a fun cruise."

    >"Yeah. Peaceful, too."

    >"Yep."

      ```

  Oh boy, here we go. I was feeling down since I'm on my final exams, but this is already making me feel better. Well, better start already. I will be writing down my first impressions, later I will make a more organised comment.

  So, leaf is looking beatiful. My inner reaf fanboy is screaming already. Is that dress a reference to manga blue? Anyway, Red is totally me here. Not that Aiko doesn't have waifu potential tho.

  The boat sounds great. Will we have some "having a nice time" scenes? I hope so. When I like the characters, those are always my favourite parts.

  >Sir, this is a FREAKING BOAT. We can not allow DEATH MONSTERS

   poor stafman, I'm having a lot of fun imagining this scene

  >It's a date

  STOP TEASING MY INNER FANBOY

  >Nothing like what he’s feeling

  I should learn to shut up

  >She takes it with a grin, and his pulse kicks up

  JUST... breathe

  >right now he’s absurdly happy that the coming week will just be him and Leaf.

  Yes

  > what we’ve been dreaming of: peace of mind.

  Now I wonder how living in this world feels like. Even if we can die by chance just if a driver messes up, you don't think about it. There, people know that at any moment a rampage can happen. You are never safe. I don't know if everybody lives with fear, but there is probably a generalized subsconcious alert state.

  >Heads Up Display

  TIL what HUD means. Neat

  >It’s a live calculation

  You are telling me that you also adapted THAT into the story, and that it makes sense. Been a rational fic, I bow my hat

  >Psychic power found to correlate with amount of gut bacteria?!

  Oh, sweet references to real life journalism. I need to get my videogame journalist friend into reading this, he would love it. Sadly, he has so few free time...

  >we’ll have a decent amount of space to run laps in…

  How big is that room???

  >Viridian Fire

  Random thought, if we were to adapt this to the Spanish audiencie, it would literaly translate as the "green fire". Sounds silly tbh

  >and form a new region

  Orange Archipelago or sevii islands reference?

  >The frontiers around it have been slowly expanding

  So pokemon force civilization to not expand completely. I like this concept, makes the world mysterious

  >Thundurus hit one of the cities

  I would love an interlude about something like this. Yo have already shown you are able to make regular rampaging pokemon to be terrifying, this would be breathtaking nightmare fuel

  >in his grandparents’ days

  And know I want an interlude of this. I would love to see your approach to that kind of world

  >His hand hovers over the wine, curious, but then he grabs some juice

  So my fanboy mind. Just needs to switch this. To create the fanfanfic

  >I’m trying to be realistic!

  I'm identifying myself so much with Red in this conversation. I don't want animals to suffer, but I don't care that much to stop eating. 
  ...wait, I am feeling a lot like Red in general. Does that make me guilty when I root for the reaf ship?

  >Yay!” She wraps an arm around him and hugs him, causing heat to flush through his body and up his face. “You know it’s not actually grown in pokeballs, though, right? It’s just using the same tech.” “Ah. Makes sense,” he mutters as she releases him, quickly raising his bottle for another drink.

  They are just too cute together 

  >The warmth stays with him for the rest of the night.

  *pauses reading so he can enjoy the peace of the moment* Thank you daystar

  >No, seven… nine… twelve… in all directions…

  What.
  Oh wait, other readers are waiting for plot to happen. Here it comes, I assume. Not that I'm not getting excited too

  >pidgey nuggets

  Concept makes perfect sense, still sounds funny

  >and not because he doesn’t know anyone here and would feel awkward sitting beside them

  So Red is not totally me. I would admit it shamelessly

  >the president, founder, and CEO of Silph Corporation holy shit

  HOLY SHIT INDEED

  >It… tastes like pidgey

  Proof of The Matrix existence

  >price of food will soon get much lower

  Talking about that, how does energy to mass conversion work here? IRL it would be WAY more expensive to produce the required amounts to meet the em2 equation

  I'm really liking Mr. Silph

  >Well, that’s it, then. He’ll tell Sabrina that he’ll become her student.

  Waiting here for the "that would mean not seen leaf" moment. Personally, I think a strong personal relationship can be the most valuable factor

  >That’s not all I’d be giving up.

  Called it

  Well, look how late it is here. I guess I will have to leave my extensive comment for another day. As always an amazing read, really enjoyed it. I hope we reaf fans get more love like this, and red makes the right choice.

  Btw, I'm begining to think that I should make a list of questions I want to ask you, I keep thinking more and forgetting them. Here is the newer one: how do you deal with special berries, like the ones that help you resist a specific attack type? Are there any legends about power granting berries, like the liechi berry tree at Mirage Island?
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Glad I could improve your mood a bit :) Reading your comment was fun for me too! 

    Special berries exist in some forms, but many of them don't function the same way as in the games, since they're so tied to specific and arbitrary game mechanics. But one berry has already been mentioned as something Red fed his Pichu to make his electricity less risky to train with, so things like that are generally what I have in mind.
    ```

  - u/Silver_Swift:
    ```
    > Random thought, if we were to adapt this to the Spanish audiencie, it would literaly translate as the "green fire".

    It already means that in English too, viridian is just a fancy word for green. Honestly, I think Viridian Forest is kind of a silly name to begin with, but then again, most pokemon city names are like that (I think all generation I names are colours).

    You do realize that Leaf is like eleven right? I know it can be easy to forget sometimes, what with her having the mental maturity of someone at least five or six years older than her in our world due to cultural and evolutionary pressures in the Pokemon world, but PHYSICALLY she's still a preteen! Same thing with Aiko. What do you mean she's your waifu?

  Also the disaster at the end of the chapter wasn't the right kind of disaster I was expecting

- u/daydev:
  ```
  > discover origin of species

  Roll credits? A fitting chapter for the joke, I think, as it kinda conveys that melancholy/longing/loss you feel when a book or an arc ends even though it's not really applicable here, the end in nowhere near (?) and the upcoming change in circumstances is not that fundamental, we've been going in and out of separated POVs for a long time now.

      ```
      Oh boy.

      Back in the Grand Old Days of fandom on Yahoo Groups, livejournal, private archives, and finally Fanfiction.net, in the late 90s and early 2000s, the term "lemon" was used to describe a fanfic with explicit sexual content, because for whatever reason people were allergic to saying "explicit sexual content," "porn," or similar things. This was mostly a thing in the anime fandom communities, though it spread by cultural diffusion into others.

      The fact that people no longer know what I'm talking about when I refer to it 1) makes me glad that fandom has grown up enough to use real words 2) makes me feel like an Old Man of the Internet.

          I'm not against the idea of young characters exploring their sexuality in fiction, but these characters are still too young, to me; I'd feel uncomfortable even implying it. At 15 or 16, sure, I think a "fade to black" would be okay.

    Remove the second comma. (And consider revising if it's still confusing).

    As is, the second comma makes it read so that "which is itself fairly uninteresting" is parenthetical. That's fine, except it makes the main part of the sentence read as "The main dining hall is packed for the welcome speech ... to Red".

  Huh, so that auto\-catching\-robo\-arm thing was probably what you were alluding to in the last thread. Wonder if Bill was involved in this too, if not for the programming then at least for the financing. For that remaining blind spot of underground pokemon, it can probably get the pokemon under its own command to use Earthquake for massive damage \- but that's probably too prone to collateral damage to actually be a viable idea, outside of extreme situations. Hm.

  The way you ended that chapter was very poetic, how Leaf's own comment on splitting up unknowingly echoed Red's own decision and dilemma. I've come to notice these kinds of things more, where I doubt I would have even five years ago, and I always find myself admiring the way authors can weave what would otherwise be a throwaway line into a higher\-level theme so fittingly. Nicely done.

  I wanted to ask:

  The story implies that the native language of Kanto is Japanese.

  So why does everyone speak English exclusively?

  Older generations are shown as still using some Japanese (Koga "about to lapse completely into Japanese" in that interlude; or Red's dad commanding his Mightyena in Japanese).

  The younger generation also seems to know Japanese (Blue's "sakki" and Red understanding his dad when he talked in Japanese).

  So why does everyone use English? Plot purposes? It'd be sad if native languages of the regions died out...
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    My not-quite-spelled-out-in-universe explanation is that the latin language and its descendants are based off the shapes of the Unown, which is what it's called instead of English, and once knowledge of them was made worldwide it became the de facto basic language.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Thanks!

      So how well can Red's generation speak Japanese? Does Unova (or the other regions) have their own native languages?
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Most regions have their own, yes, though I'm thinking that modern latin languages are more like different dialects than anything. Red's generation knows Japanese as basically a second language, though one acquired at an early age, so fluency and no strong accent.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          Thanks for the answer!

          It's a bit sad to see neglect of native languages in the universe ... this is how entire cultures get lost to time...

          Still, great story!

  Not exactly related to this story, but to a rational interpretation of pokemon in general.

  I'm writing a story that isn't exactly a rational fiction, but uses a rational setting (consistent rules, realistic).  As part of the this, I've been reworking all the mechanics of the games into something that makes more sense.  One thing I'm not sure about is how to do a rational explanation or alternative to pokemon evolution by trading.

  I have two ideas at this point.
  1. In the wild, evolution by trade is actually a result of migration
  2. Results from moving between different "packs" of that species, like when a male lion leaves the pride it was born into to make or take another.

  Any suggestions would be much appreciated.  Thank you.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    I like both those ideas, and considered similar things before giving up on the idea altogether as too game-specific. If I tried rationalizing that then what about holding items while being traded? Or evolving with another pokemon in the same party? (It's not like they're actually next to each other when they evolve, one is in its pokeball), or holding your 3DS upside down?
    ```

  - u/crivtox:
    ```
    I also planing to write a rational pokemon fic .(well a pokemon mystery dungeon  quest inspired by this and mfd more specifically) and have been trying to justify some really gamey bits of canon, but I think I haven't though of trade evolution yet.
    I think you should just ignore the trading part, and just think of it as an abstraction of more specific evolution mechanics.
    Maybe metal coat for example  just represents the Pokemon eating a lot of metal , or maybe its an item that the Pokemon has to be in contact whith for along time .
    Kadabra could need the psychic contact  of multiple psychic Pokemon and 
     trainers  or something like that .
    ```

  - u/wadaboutit:
    ```
    I do remember that originally the plan for golem and machamp was that they had to be traded with each other a la escavalier, but it got dropped. 

     Since trades are executed digitally, and  both golem and machamp are very rare among trainers in rby, there could be a data corruption concept.  note that machoke gains a pair of arms and graveller loses it.  

    For Alakazam/gengar,  I could see an interpretation that mediums and psychics are studying different aspects of the same phenomenon and only by being exposed to both types of trainers can a kadabra or haunter reach its full potential.
