  I don't believe it. Or if it's true, it has some way of seeing what Bulma typed - cameras, or what the key inputs sounded like, or how long between each key etc.

      The fact that she's named Caroline certainly doesn't help. Dunno if it's a shout-out, a hint or just coincidence, but it gives an ominous vibe for anyone who's played Portal 2.

        It's a shout-out :D. Kudos for being the first one to point it out. Considering also how the whole chapter involves *cake*...

      Oh right, the killing Goku Maximizer.

  So apparently aliens never discovered encryption or compression, or for some reason are broadcasting unencrypted uncompressed audio data for their primary form of communication.

  Frieza must have also been doing all this stuff for decades, and pretty close by, because habitable planets would be at least a few light years away.

  I also enjoy that Bulma basically proves that intelligent extraterrestrial life exists in the universe, that there are multiple distinct intelligent species, and hasn't yet thought to tell her father or anyone beside Goku yet. Even aside from all normal implications of this, contacting those alien civilizations would allow them to get information on what DOESNT work against Frieza. Like, does he kill planets because they are too aggressive, and spares peaceful locations? Does he demand tribute? What are his abilities? This is all pretty relevant.

    About light speed: as I've said elsewhere, I think the Dragon World isn't relativistic, and probably hasn't the same value of light speed as we do. So distances involved may be different from what we're used to. As for intelligent life... I mean, they already had the data, and an inkling of what it meant, they just lacked some kind of decryption key to be 100% sure.

    (and you're right about encryption... maybe some transmissions ARE encrypted, just not all because not all of these are super-secure. No, ok, I'm just covering my own ass here, I might not have thought this *completely* through. Corner of shame)

    Contacting alien civilizations when someone able to destroy planets is out there and they don't know your position yet sounds like a *super* bad idea. Sure, more intel can't be bad, but if the price of intel is revealing your position to the entire galaxy, you probably want to play it careful there. And it's not like they can understand these people's language anyway.

      That's true. I think later Dragonball shows had Bulma using ships that travel between planets, and your story hasn't mentioned people knowing about FTL travel yet. So they could just have an incredibly high speed of light

      I think lack of compression is the more noticeable issue. It makes some sense that if you're using enough energy to transmit across stelar distances, you aren't trying to be secrative. Secure communications could be done through lasers, or some other narrow beam signals that would be extremely unlikely to be pointed at Earth. But compression is really simple, and saves a lot of transmission time. If Bulma or anyone on Earth noticed that these signals could be decompressed into an audio file, it wouldn't be a question as to whether alien life exists. Not to mention that figuring out a completely novel compression algorithm without knowing anything about the end product would be really hard.

      Yeah that's fair. I suppose if the language is figured out, they could broadcast to whatever part of the sky that the least number of mentions of Frieze come from, but that could still be too big of a risk.

        We can actually have hard proof of that. The first test trip Popo and Bulma do with Kami's spaceship is to Jupiter, and it only lasts a few seconds. Even at their closest, Earth and Jupiter are approximately 30 light minutes away! So that was already FTL for our standards. Yet they need one month to reach Namek, while Goku's ship, built on the model of the Saiyan pods, only takes 10 days, and is thus 3 times faster. And of course, Goku himself is able to Instant Transmit... well, instantly, to Namek as needed. And the dragon does that too. Which is all FTL signalling, and we *know* this is a universe in which time travel is heavily frowned upon, and FTL signalling basically *is* time travel. So I deduce that either Akira Toriyama didn't know/care about the finesses of special relativity, or Dragon World has either a higher lightspeed limit, or no limit at all.

        And we wouldn't want to insinuate Toriyama-sensei doesn't know his theoretical physics, right?
        ```

        - u/SometimesATroll:
          ```
          Since instant transmission is said to work by turning the body into light and back, I'd say light travels at an effectively infinite speed in this setting.

            That explanation is Dub only, isn't it? I always heard that this was a FUNimation thing, and in Japanese it's just straight-up teleportation.

        Originally, before militaries really started to do anything resembling encryption (i.e. using ciphers to keep a text secret), they used "codes"—which were essentially one-off forms of compression (with e.g. whole words being associated with particular numbers relayed via a numbers station.)

        "Code-breaking", then, in the original sense, refers to reverse-engineering unknown methods of compression.

        Over the years, humanity has become pretty good at it! Compared to cryptanalysis on ciphers, cryptanalysis on codes is considered *easy*.

        That's a problem even with the uncompressed audio, speech is very distinct from random noise. I'm guessing they pretty much _have_ figured out that these are interstellar communications, they just can't be absolutely sure without some independent source to verify against.

        Knowing Frieza is a name is still a big deal though, because it tells them that some form of communication is happening between the different alien civilizations.

      Wait, so are we assuming in DBZ the Luminiferous Aether is a thing?
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        I don't think that necessarily follows, not if you intend the Aether the way Michaelson & Morley did (if you don't, then you could argue even our electromagnetic quantum field is an 'aether' of sorts). If the Aether was a fluid, it would carry waves with finite speed. The only thing that really disagreed with experiment there was the fact that light waves did not behave like they were carried by a medium with a definite state of motion. I'd see it more as tweaking our existing equations by increasing *c* a lot. If *c* tends to infinity, you get yourself classical mechanics at all speed scales.

        But I'm not going to try and work out a fully consistent system of law of physics for Dragonball Z. It's probably completely impossible and would require an insane amount of work for a confusing, dissatisfying result. If I ever do something like that, I'm going to do like Greg Egan did and create my own fictional world with its own laws of physics (and optionally blackjack and hookers).

  I know this is late, but I wanted to add something to the "uncompressed SETI signals" discussion you were having.

  A number of issues were raised, including:

  1) Interstellar transmissions would probably be compressed.

  1.1) A compressed signal would be difficult to decode.

  1.2) A successfully decoded compressed transmission would be unmistakably sentient in origin.

  2) Even in analog form, speech is distinct from noise.

  Combining these, I think we can invent a reasonable explanation. Suppose the signals are compressed - which I believe will make them similar to noise, since distinct patterns are an obvious opportunity for further compression - in an hitherto unknown format. Then, we can imagine Bulma's new knowledge of alien languages allowed the computer to perform a [known-plaintext attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Known-plaintext_attack) on the recorded transmissions, cracking the compression for the first time and exposing the original sound.

  This isn't entirely unproblematic, since the three syllables she remembered probably would not be enough for such analysis, but at least it works in principle. We can mitigate these problems as well. For example, suppose memories from the afterlife are much better than ones from regular life, since they were recorded without imperfect ear and brain architectures as a medium. There's also the fact that compression is meant to be decoded, (and interstellar encodings might even be made with simplicity-to-crack in mind, much like our SETI) and if we want to go there, we can say Bulma used technological memory retrieval to make sure the computer got as a precise recording as possible.

  Not all of this can fit into the narrative as presented without some retconning, but I thought it was worth pointing out.
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    Thanks, this makes a lot of sense! It would definitely mean some retconning, but I don't have *too many* issues with the idea. It's way too early to think about any of this, but I could have a rewrite of sorts where I fix small issues like this one day.
