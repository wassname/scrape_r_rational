## [WIP][D][BS] National Novel Writing Month: Final Week

### Post:

This is a general purpose thread for anything you'd like to talk about for National Novel Writing Month, which is currently in progress.

* Want to check in your some progress?
* Want to talk about what you're writing?
* Out of ideas and want some help?

Feel free to make posts to the subreddit if you crank out a chapter you want to share, have a meaty question you want some help with, or something like that; this is more a place for things that aren't quite substantial enough to warrant their own posts.

  Hit the 50,000 mark Saturday. Going to keep at 2,000 per day until the end of the month, then do 2,000 per day 6 times a week, then reevaluate at the end of December and, if need be, switch to 5 days a week.

    Congratulations on meeting the word count goal. I look forward to reading it once/if you post it.

  We're in the home stretch!

  I need 2,200 words per day in order to finish. That's not a terrible prospect. I've got few other non-work obligations and I've got time off for Thanksgiving, but I'm also traveling to visit family. It might be a little bit tight.

  Plot-wise, I'm still not where I need to be to actually wrap this up at the 100,000 word mark, but I think I'm close enough to the finish line that I should be able to just power through to the end (but I have other outstanding writing obligations first, so maybe not).

  As always, the updated-daily [link to the text can be found here.](http://alexanderwales.com/darkWizardNaNo2015.html) As fair warning, this is probably being removed shortly after the first draft is completed, though I have no idea whether there's actually anyone reading along.

    FWIW, I've been checking that link every couple of days to catch up, and have definitely been enjoying it.

      Yep, I've just read it (I really liked the beginning last year during the nanowrimo so I had to read the rest).

      I like it more than Shadow of the limelights. It feels a bit rougher around the edges but the characters are more likable and just Henry and Sofia but also Ventor, Hirrush, Omarr and Adrianna and that's what makes it very enjoyable to me. Having people with widely disparate point of views that are self consistent in their beliefs and actions and that are each likable individually despite the fact that they would dislike each other.

    I have officially failed at reaching my goal, ending at 97,255. Thanksgiving is mostly to blame (though I also probably would have made it if I hadn't spent time on the appendices for *Shadows*, or if I'd started from 50,000 words instead of lower than that). I think it's time to spend a few days reading back over what I've written, make some quick edits, finish everything that remains for *Shadows*, then dive back in and finish this (though there are lots of things left to write, and I wanted to start up another proper web serial before too long).

    Edit: Also, as fair warning, this thread will be unstickied in a few days once everyone has a chance to deliver whatever after-action report they'd like to give.

  I made it, but with an asterisk.

  I started with ~60,000 words written; I had this great plan where I was going to finish *The Change Storms: Induction* in October, then do an romance novel for NaNoWriMo.  That didn't happen; I kept thinking "well, I'll wrap Induction up by the end of the first week, then do 50k on the romance in 3 weeks.  That didn't happen.  Finally, three weeks in, I started logging words for Induction.  The problem was that I would write a chapter, edit it, then publish it over on Patreon and the /r/changestorms subreddit, so I was losing a lot of words as I went.  I was only counting words in the final versions, so I only logged about 30,000 formally.  If I hadn't finished the book in November I would have put myself down as a 'fail'...but I *did* finish it.  Yesterday (November 30), on the plane back from Thanksgiving on the East Coast, I wrote the last word of the last chapter in Induction.  So, I submitted the whole book -- 98,075 words -- and took the win, then noted in the 'synopsis' section on NaNoWriMo that I should get an asterisk.

  Oh yes, the latest chapter (ch15) is available [over here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changestorms/comments/3v0qmb/chpr_induction_chapter_15/); the remaining ones will continue coming out weekly.

    There's something about finishing a piece of creative writing while flying through the air in a giant metal contraption that gives me a much stronger feeling of poetic/narrative completion than finishing it anywhere else.
    ```

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      I know, right?  To my mind it embodies the 21st century -- the decoupling of work from location or employer, the easy mobility, and the *freaking amazing technology*.  That plane had WiFi and power sockets in the seats.  I could literally have published the book from 7 miles above the earth.
      ```

- u/avret:
  ```
  8k words thus far, i'll get 2k more by the end.  This is a good start, at least.
  ```

- u/brandalizing:
  ```
  Final total: 64,255. Felt like I was starting to burn out, so I took a break Saturday and Sunday. Now I'm back up and running, aiming for 1.5k a day 6 days a week. Hopefully I can have my first draft finished by the time I get out of the army.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Careful there.  It almost sounded like you said "I've only got {6,3,2} {months,days,minutes} until retirement!"  You know what happens to anyone who says that.
    ```

    - u/brandalizing:
      ```
      But I *can't* be a redshirt! There's no one I interact with that could possibly be a main character!
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        *laugh*

        Well, everyone is the main character of their own story.
        ```
