## Resources for understanding how the world works

### Post:

I have been following rational fiction for a while (mostly worth the candle), and I have to admit that some of what the characters talk about goes over my head. This is especially true when the characters are discussing politics, psychology, etcetera. To that end, I would like some recommendations as to how I can accrue enough knowlegde and understanding of topics such as economics, trade, and history so that I can comfortably follow these amazing stories. Thanks in advance.

  Honestly, I owe a lot of what I know to Wikipedia, mostly because it's always there, instantly accessible. I'll visit at the drop of a hat, ready to read and follow links, and I think that's a good way of getting a lot of broad understanding of the world, because you can plug in gaps in your knowledge in relatively short order. Having some level of information hygiene is an important part of that, but yeah, there continue to be a lot of things I don't know, and I use a combination of Wikipedia and Google to keep myself informed.

  Broadly speaking, I think it's best to go for authors and works that you can read most easily, even if that comes at the expense of information density, because you'll absorb more, faster if you're having fun than if it's a slow, confusing slog. There are a lot of books and works of landmark importance which I think you're better off just ignoring in favor of more digestable modern versions: [*The Federalist Papers*](https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/full-text), [*Wealth of Nations*](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations), or [*The Communist Manifesto*](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Manifesto_of_the_Communist_Party) are all important works to have some familiarity with, but they're not the best ways to get those juicy ideas, because their authors (and target audiences) came from a vastly different time and place than our own. I have a deep love for source documents like that, but so many of them have been refined and distilled down that it's more efficient to get them from a modern source.

  I often gravitate toward "brief histories" of one kind or another, especially those which have anecdotes, or are centered around some particular thing that I know will also help me get a broad understanding. *Lifted: A Cultural History of the Elevator* was ostensibly about elevators, but touched on a lot of history, class struggle, technology, architecture, and other things in a way that helped to weave a contextual web of ideas. Similarly, *From Front Porch to Back Seat* was primarily focused on courtship, but also talked a lot about urbanization, economics, etc. in a way that I found helped me to connect some ideas. Just try to make sure that you're not reading someone with an axe to grind, or if you do read them, make sure that you know about it ahead of time so you can correct for it as you read.

  A handful of recommended books:

  * *The Law of Superheroes* goes into a lot of legal topics through the lenses of fictional characters
  * *A Little History of the World* covers an enormous amount of ground in relatively entertaining fashion
  * *Godel, Escher, Bach* is perhaps a bit too up its own butt, but introduced me to a lot of topics and ways of thinking that would have taken me a lot longer (though enough of it is mainstream now that this has kind of become a source text that's lost its punch)
  * *Technology in America: A Brief History* really goes into the nitty-gritty in a lot of places in a way that I appreciated
  * *How to Invent Everything* is a guide to inventions for a time traveler, works best as a reference work, but has a ton of information

  These are all books that I've read that I took something from, all fairly broad.

  I guess I should also say that I had a liberal arts education, and took a bunch of different classes about all kinds of things that had little in the way of practical application, but which helped inform my thinking in one way or another. (I double majored in English and Computer Science with the intent of going into technical writing, but graduated in 2008, when the goal became 'get a job, any job'.)

    Oh, I nearly forgot about Youtube, which I sometimes put on while writing or doing other things (especially cooking). Some recommendations:

    * [engineerguy](https://www.youtube.com/user/engineerguyvideo), science and engineering, including a production of Faraday's *The Chemical History of a Candle*, which is well done
    * [Then & Now](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkS_HP3m9NXOgswVAKbMeJQ), history, philosophy, politics
    * [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw), math
    * [LegalEagle](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpa-Zb0ZcQjTCPP1Dx_1M8Q), law
    * [Adam Neely](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnkp4xDOwqqJD7sSM3xdUiQ), music and music theory
    * [Voices of the Past](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoGR_EedlhKDVuWNwYWRbg), readings of historical accounts
    * [Technology Connections](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy0tKL1T7wFoYcxCe0xjN6Q), inner workings of technology, typically 1980s or later
    * [Wendover Productions](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9RM-iSvTu1uPJb8X5yp3EQ), logistics
    * [Townsends](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxr2d4As312LulcajAkKJYw), historical cooking
    * [Todd's Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWnlQMQ-ACfhpD68yWRsnJw), historical archery, arms, and armor

    That's taken from my subscriptions list, trying to narrow it down to those that I think are high value and *mostly* educational.

    >Lifted: A Cultural History of the Elevator

    Wait, so if I write a book where the protag gets isekai'd and utilizes the knowledge contained in this book to improve things, whilst maintaining a generally chipper and positive tone, does it become an Uplifting Uplift Uplift story?

      I can't come up with a non-fallacious argument why it wouldn't be, but that doesn't mean there isn't such an argument. If I use this fact as the basis for believing that eventually an ironclad argument will be discovered which will disprove your assertion, I would be committing the "fallacy fallacy" fallacy.

    > *Lifted: A Cultural History of the Elevator*

    This explains a lot. Like Chapter 14.

    But seriously this is a great list, including some I hadn't heard of, thank you!


    > I guess I should also say that I had a liberal arts education, and took a bunch of different classes about all kinds of things that had little in the way of practical application, but which helped inform my thinking in one way or another.

    And so much this. The liberal arts education experience is no joke in exposing one to a broad selection of ideas, from which connections and ideas can be built with later on in life. As a basis for improving science it seems like a pretty useful practice considering how many of the classical scientific giants had such broad interests in a number of subjects.

      Speaking of that, there's a book called "I Am a Strange Loop", it presents the ideas from GEB in a much more digestible, understandable, and entertaining way. I couldn't get through GEB, but really enjoyed this one. There's also an audiobook version. Highly recommend it!

      Oh, I've always loved elevators. Not in a weird, obsessive way, but they're one of those "invisible" things that most people don't think all that much about, and there's something about those hidden things that tickle me. I got the book because of a love of elevators, rather than for any other reason, and elevators show up a lot (or at least, more than you'd naively expect) in WtC for the same reason.

    ```
    Small nitpick here because that's something I know a little about myself, but if someone is going to try to look for the cliffnotes version of Socialist/Communist/Marxist theory  ***you don't want the Communist Manifesto***. That work, as iconic as it might be, it's basically a long and detailed pamphlet.

    ***Das Kapital*** is the one you need to look a modern explanation of. ***Wage, labor and capital*** is like a simplified precursor that  some people insist is a very good staring point. And ***Critique of the Gotha Program*** is kinda important too to learn the difference between pre-marx or utopian socialists and post-marx or scientific socialists.

    Of course, I would recommend anyone trying to learn about that to actually read those works instead of explanations of them because they're a chore to get trough, but those are the works that actually mattered, even if the manifesto is the famous one.

    I love your story, but I don't have a good grasp on your actual writing process. So please take this request with the knowledge that if it would be a pain in the ass to implement, it is my most heartfelt wish that you ignore it. That said:

    * It would be neat to see your own Wikipedia references or what-have-you for each chapter. An out-of-story research log that we can follow? A list of inspirations or sources of knowledge?

    I often find myself Googling things out of WtC just to pull more contextual information in for myself, but that's a bit flawed as Google is not a perfect or equal search engine.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      I think it would be interesting to go through and make an annotated version of the story, but it would take time that I don't have, and I don't really know how it would be best to implement it for easy consumption. Maybe if I find myself doing a full edit and/or re-read, I'll do that. Or maybe if I can figure out a way to do a community sourced version.

  The obvious answer is of course [the sequences](https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality), if you haven't read them (along with classical philosophy often found in college or highschool just so you can understand what the hell everyone else is saying; I'm sure someone somewhere has a better list within easy googling). The author (of the sequences) also self inserts a list of books into his [HPMOR fiction](https://hpmor.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_books#Non-fiction) that one might consider a new rationalist to have read (note the ***context*** of some of these books; some of them were used by the *villain* as justification, some were mentioned as books people should look at with a critical eye). [This post by the same community](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wfJebLTPGYaK3Gr8W/recommended-reading-for-new-rationalists) (read the comments for the primary response; though the post itself and the pingbacks are meta-links to other lists) is a great jumping off point for related stuff ([Paul Graham's essays](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html) show up a lot), though mostly in article format. I'd be curious if there was a better list of books by this (the less wrong) community I missed somewhere.

  For continuing learning the issue becomes a bit more difficult. One could use the above to build a good base of knowledge, but to continuously update and exercise that knowledge is also important. For financial news and theory I follow [Money Stuff](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine) ([subscribe link](http://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/join/4wm/moneystuff-signup&hash=54223001ca3ffcf40f2629c25acea67a) to beat the paywall) as a jumping off point every day. Professionally I use the news aggregator [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) (managed(-ish?) by Paul Graham from above) along with various reddit communities (including this one!), as well as some interpersonal connections I maintain. But this is a very personal answer.

    I would also add Slate Star Codex to this list. In my opinion - much better written than the sequences, more fun to read, covers many of the similar subjects.
    ```

- u/jtolmar:
  ```
  Yudkowsky's sequences on LessWrong are useful, if quirky, for general rationality and cognitive biases. Some more in-depth but *far* less approachable sources are Causality (Pearl) for the nature of probabilistic reasoning and causality, and Philosophical Investigations (Wittgenstein) for the philosophy of language (work your way towards these, don't dive straight in). I actually don't know anything that addresses cognitive biases as well as the sequences though.

  Some fun introductions to philosophy are [Existential Comics (webcomic)](https://existentialcomics.com/) and [Philosophy Tube (youtube channel)](https://www.youtube.com/c/thephilosophytube/videos). Since "philosophy" includes everything from political-economic theories (Smith) to completely opposed political-economic theories (Marx) to ill-advised attempts to describe the world using formal logic (Wittgenstein) to rejections of the idea of language as formal logic (also Wittgenstein) to complete horseshit (Thales), it helps to have some a fun survey of what's out there before diving in.

  I learned economics so long ago that I don't really have a good source anymore. One huge thing I see most sources ignore (including the ones I initially learned from) are is the effects of ownership - you usually see microeconomics as a toy model of a two-person transaction and a lot of conclusions get turned on their head if there's a third person who decides whether or not the transaction gets to happen. One good framework for this is Marx's distinction between personal property (stuff you own that you use) and private property (stuff you own that you can charge other people to use), which can be very handy when analyzing things (Marx is a mixed bag but this bit of insight really is golden). For fun economics, shoutout to [Spice And Wolf](https://myanimelist.net/anime/2966/Ookami_to_Koushinryou), an anime about microeconomics and romance (and an anti-shoutout to Maoyuu Maou Yuusha, the other anime about economics and romance, which has a child's understanding of both).

  I'd recommend [A Collection Of Unmitigated Pedantry](https://acoup.blog/resources-for-world-builders/) as a fun intro to history. He does a good job of covering how working historians actually go about their job and think about things, as well as some more specific stuff like how state power works and how the tactics/operations/strategy division works (he recommends Clausewitz on this, but I haven't even started reading him yet). Recommending this mostly because a lot of pop history subscribes to a horribly outdated model of history based on great men, great ideas, and great battles, and once you've seen the real thing it's a lot easier to be suspicious of that stuff. Also shout out to [donoteat01's Franklin series](https://www.youtube.com/user/donoteat01/videos) for some American history and some very good history of labor activism, but he's much more pop history than acoup. And shout out to /r/AskHistorians, another place where you can learn the real history vs pop history smell test (but I think acoup is better at it).

    Re: LessWrong, at this point the best source is the book form [*Rationality: from AI to Zombies*](https://intelligence.org/rationality-ai-zombies/) (physical copy or free electronic version).

    I would also recommend https://equilibriabook.com/ and https://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/

  A lot of this stuff is also bullshit. I love Yudkowsky, but he builds a lot of stuff on extremely questionable psychology. Nearly every physcholgy experiment he mentions in HPMOR (Stanford prison, Asch conformity etc.) had been compromised and mired in awful methodology. Most other authors are even worse with their American centric understanding of politics.

    I'll keep that in mind and focus on other sources, thanks for the input.

    Edit:

    Yeah, I think that I am going to avoid anything by Yudkosky, even if none of [this](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Eliezer_Yudkowsky) is true. Perhaps it would be better to judge based off of my own thoughts, but I doubt the benefits from reading the sequences will be worth the time investment,

      You've stumbled across an ancient internet feud - Rationalist wiki has a specific dislike of Yudkowsky. Take it with a spoonful of salt.

  Expanding on Wikipedia crawling: find a topic you want to know about, read some of the overview and the interesting parts, click on the links to stuff you don’t know about, repeat. If you run out, hit random article until you find something interesting. Easy to spend an hour or two this way.

  [Naked Economics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40180021-naked-economics) was required reading in AP Macro econ when I took that class a decade ago. I really liked that book.

  If you go the Wiki route, I'd probably start [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology), with Epistemology. 

  MIT has an [undergrad course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/linguistics-and-philosophy/24-211-theory-of-knowledge-spring-2014/index.htm) on the subject, in OpenCourseware, though I don't know how good it is. (You can also look up Theory of Knowledge syllibi for a good high-school level view. This will probably have a broad range of accessible readings on random topics from history to behavioural economics.)

  If podcasts are more your thing, there are definitely some cool ones out there that explore some of the concepts you're looking for.

  One thing I enjoy doing is exploring the banal.  As you go through your day, ask yourself "Would this thing I just did seem like wizardry to someone from 500 years ago?"  If so, figure out why.

  As an example, you've probably had a mug of tea or coffee in the last week, and you probably don't live near a place where tea/coffee are grown.  Okay, what is the backstory of that tea/coffee?  How did the leaves/beans get to where you bought it.  Imagine it's a film in reverse:  The barista takes the beans out of the pot, puts them in a large container, loads it onto a metal cart (truck) powered by explosions created by burning the oil of plants (well, algae/plankton/etc) that died hundreds of millions of years ago.  That truck drives  backwards across incredibly flat and smooth black roads that climb up and down enormous mountains and pass through giant tunnels.  It moves tirelessly at a speed fifteen or twenty times that of a horse  across dozens or hundreds of miles to a port.  Men take the bean containers and load them into a steel box the size of a small building (aka a cargo container).  The steel box is picked up by a metal arm larger than a building (a powered crane) and placed onto a metal ship larger than multiple football fields.  That ship is crewed by fewer people than crewed a Yankee clipper, yet it travels five times faster than the fastest wooden ship ever built.  It sails backwards halfway around the world, shrugging off the worst storms on the way and never losing its way despite no one aboard ever checking their sextant.  At the other end it's unloaded by another massive metal arm and onto another truck where it's driven to a plantation that stretches for miles.  

  You get the idea.  Now, take any piece of that story and start googling.  How exactly does an internal combustion engine work?  How does oil form and why is it found in the places it's found?  Is there any correlation between the cultures in oil-producing areas?  What is the history of one of those areas and how did oil production affect it?  How and why were container ships developed?  Why is cargo transported in containers instead of loose, and who came up with that idea?  How do ships navigate?  Do they divert around storms or sail through them?  How do they know where the storms will be?  And so on.

  It's a fun way to learn about the structure of the modern world and, as a bonus, it provides an appreciation for how amazing our lives are.
