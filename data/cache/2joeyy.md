  Still not a fan of the instant comprehension that stops people casting Patronus, people can't partial transfiguration without innately comprehending the universe at that level, but at the word of some strange they instantly are devolved of their entire previous world beliefs hammered in since birth.

    ```
    Partial Transfiguration and the Patronus are completely distinct things. Patronuses work by thinking happy thoughts which distract you from thinking about death, so being told that they are death stops you being able to do that, since deliberately distracting yourself is incredibly difficult. Partial Transfiguration operates off of completely different mechanics and is to do with world beliefs, while the basic Patronus is not

      There is absolutely no way that distracting yourself from a thought is harder than distracting yourself FROM ACTUAL FEELINGS OF FEAR AND HORROR AND SCREAMS OF YOUR PARENTS DEATH, since all of those are also thoughts but + actual real physical effects.

      There's also the incredibly nonsense idea that no one has ever mentioned the word death in the entire history of all people using patronus ever, or thought about it (for example a lot of peoples worse memories will be of death which would mean they could never cast a patronus).

        Don't shout at people, it's rude.

        Nobody ever said that these people aren't allowed to have ever thought of death, it's whether they can distract themselves from such thoughts that is the issue.

        People like Harry, Hermione and Padma weren't good at so distracting themselves, so they couldn't cast Patronus v1.0

        And few people can cast it.

        >(for example a lot of peoples worse memories will be of death which would mean they could never cast a patronus).

        People very often fail to cast a Patronus while under the effects of a dementor.

    The next time you press Space don't think of pink rabbit.

    And in this case thinking of pink rabbit makes pressing space impossible.

      ```
      icould ...ok, I was planning to reply to your comment that it is possible since pressing space is such an ingrained habbit that I could easily do it automatically without even thinking of anything, and I was going to do that without spaces, but then I accidentally pressed space. Does that count?

      (It's similar to how you can leave the stove on when you leave the house, even if you resolve to think of the stove next time you touch the front doornob)

        ```
        Ok, bad example. You're right it's muscle memory. But you know what I meant.

        BTW - I've noticed that making "notes to myself" in head works for me lik 90% of the time, if I visualize myself geting the note in the future in proper circumstances, like "I will get a note that I should buy a tea when I will get out of bus after geting back from work today".
