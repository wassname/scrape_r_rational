## [MK][BST] Teleportation

### Post:

I've been thinking of doing some superhero original fiction as soon as my current writing queue clears out.  One idea I had related to teleportation and how it could be abused.  Let's call the character Al.  Here are the rules of Al's power:

* There is no range limit on his teleportation.
* In order to teleport somewhere he needs to have a very clear picture of it in his mind.  This means either he can see it directly, he is currently looking at a detailed picture of it, or he is extremely familiar with it from spending a lot of time there.
* In order to teleport somewhere, he must know roughly what direction it is.  If he's lost his sense of direction (e.g. underwater, in a dark room, etc) he can't just teleport out.
* Whatever he's carrying when he teleports goes with him.  I need a more specific definition of "carrying" here, but the basics are intuitive: he can take it with him if he is lifting it, if it's inside something he is lifting, or if it's on top of something he is lifting.  
* He swaps places with an area at the far end, so there is always room for him when he arrives, but he will be unable to move if he teleports into a solid object.   Losing his sense of direction at this point Would Be Bad.
* Because he swaps places with his destination, the space that he and his carried stuff occupied is now occupied by the air / water / rock / whatever that was previously at his destination.  If he were to teleport into rock, lava, a roomful of chlorine gas, the blastfront of an explosion, outer space, etc, then the effects of those environments would be felt at his source.  (Of course, he wouldn't survive any of those environments without appropriate gear, but that's not relevant.)
* He is shifted into the momentum frame of his destination, so if he teleports from the pole to the equator he isn't mashed into a wall by the change in the earth's rotation.
*  When he arrives, his facing will be the same as it was at the source point.  (So, if he was facing east and he teleported to the south, he would still be facing east.)
* He cannot take part of an object with him when he teleports.
* If he's touching it / gripping it he needs to bring it with him.  In other words, he can't teleport out of handcuffs or if he's chained to a big lump of granite.  

Yes, he can teleport straight up, to the moon, to Mars, to exoplanets given a sufficiently detailed image, etc.

If you woke up with this power tomorrow, what could you do with it?  Mostly the idea here is to help me figure out where the fuzzy edges of the rules are so that I can define them more clearly.

EDIT:

* He cannot bring part of an object with him, but he can switch himself with a part of an object.  In other words, it's possible for him to teleport into a wall without instantly dying -- there will just be a him-shaped chunk of concrete back at his source point.


The "needs to bring it with him" needs more refinement, because I'm fuzzy on what it means.  Obviously he's touching the ground, so he needs to be able to leave that behind.  He's touching the air, but he doesn't bring that.  He *does* bring his clothing.  I'm not clear on whether something that's touching his clothing would have to come too.

In particular, I need better refinement on how this would interact with the "he can switch places with part of a solid object."  I think this would mean that if he teleports (part of) his body into a solid object then he can't teleport out unless he can chip the material away manually.

And no, this will not be Jumper fanfic.  :>  (Hadn't actually thought about that movie until I wrote the previous sentence.)

  There are several jumper books that explore these ideas. Spoilers below.

  ...


  A jumper learned how to turn the jump power "On" and keep it stuck like that, so he existed in two places at the same time. This was used to flood stuff with water, as well as drain all the air out of a sealed room. Later, a jumper learned to fly. The jumper was always familiar with their current location, so they jumped to exactly where they already where, but with a new velocity vector. This trick was also used to punch really hard.

    Grr.  I got all the way through thinking about this, got to that last sentence, and then realized that pretty much this exact thing had already been done.  I didn't realize that there were books of it too -- the movie didn't explore the ability that much so I figured there were lots of bits to find.  Sounds like there's less than I'd thought.

      One book was about the jumper building a spacesuit and traveling to outerspace. That's the jumper that could create velocity. She put on her suit, flew up, and did cool things. Very good book. Lots of hard science. By the end of that book, I felt like I could build my own spacesuit. I highly recommend it. In fact, I recommend the whole jumper series, especially if you are going to approach a similar idea.

  Read the book *Jumper*, which the (terrible) movie was based on. It's got lots of cool stuff. The second and fourth books in the series are also pretty awesome. It follows almost all of the rules that you outlined above, and the author does a good job of thinking out the consequences of these rules, and extrapolating on them.

  Edit: If you don't want to read them, I can spoil them for you when I get home.

      Alright, I'll try to keep this fairly brief.

      **Book 1: Jumper**

      * David discovers that he can teleport to places that he's familiar with.
      * He uses this power to run away from home (where he lives with his alcoholic father).
      * He steals a lot of money from bank vaults (which he only needs to really see the inside of).
      * He starts "acquiring" jump sites by going to them and solidifying his memory of the place, along with taking lots of photographs and video for reference.
      * He saves a bunch of people in hostage situations (terrorists on the tarmac - much more relevant in 1992).
      * The NSA get wind of him, mostly through his carelessness, and try to capture him by using the people close to him.
      * He realizes that he's always "resting" with respect to the reference frame of the ground following a jump, so he practices jumping away from a fall.
      * He practices a technique for lifting people up to jump them - usually going behind them, getting them off balance, lifting, and then jumping them.
      * He dumps a bunch of people in a lake in the middle of nowhere, effectively keeping them imprisoned (they deserved it).
      * He acquires a bunch of jump sites at emergency rooms, and then trains for jumping there reflexively when something bad happens.
      * He buys a cylinder of bulletproof glass and puts handle on the inside - this allows him to jump into a room with hostiles and makes them unable to shoot him even when they've got guns drawn.

      **Book 2: Reflex**

      * A shadowy organization drugs him during a meeting with his NSA handler, and sedates him. They get him into surgery and put a clamp on his vagus nerve that will activate if it doesn't receive two overlapping radio signals. If he goes outside the overlap zone (say, by jumping) he gets put in an incredible amount of pain, starts vomiting, and will die quickly. I thought this was a pretty clever way of turning a teleporting man into a tool. They can control where he can and can't teleport to.
      * He develops "twinning" where he teleports to a place and then teleports right back where he was, as a way to get around the limits of the implant.
      * Unlike with your rules, he takes some of the surrounding air with him. This lets him use twinning to flood an office building by setting his other location as in the water.
      * The shadowy organization tries to capture his wife (teleportation is either contagious or learnable with enough trips) by finding a room that she frequently jumps to, and making it airtight then filling it with noxious gas so that when she jumps in, she'll inhale it and fall unconscious right away.
      * The shadowy organization develops a jumper detector - it's basically a modified gravitational-wave detector that looks for a sudden change in gravity caused by someone popping into existence.

      **Book 3: Impulse**

      * Ten years later, they're using their powers for good - doing a lot of humanitarian stuff, occasional work for the government (extractions mostly), trying to track down what's left of the shadowy organization, etc.
      * Realizing that they are always stationary with respect to their reference frame following a jump, their daughter tries changing her reference frame, and after some trials and tribulations, is able to add arbitrary amounts of velocity while standing still - letting her jump straight up in the air at 20kmph, or letting her throw a very hard punch.

      **Book 4: Exo**

      * Their daughter develops a one-person space agency. He goes into a ton of detail on this, which I really appreciated - acquiring a space suit, adjusting for air pressure differences, communication with the ground, etc. They deorbit space junk and put microsats into orbit, then eventually build a space colony. The book ends with Cent becoming the first woman on Mars.
      * Twinning is used with low-Earth orbit to create a hard vacuum in a room full of enemies.

      (I believe that most of this is accurate, but I might have gotten a few things wrong - for the most part, its a very well researched series.)

  Yeah "carry" needs some hard rules.

  How much can he carry? Does he need to be fully supporting it or can he be using, say, a wheelbarrow? How about a weight too heavy to heft, or merely too awkward to balance, for more than a few moments before dropping it? For example, he's holding somebody's hand and they jump into the air.

  What if that person is holding somebody else's hand?

  The "momentum frame" bit needs some work as well. If he teleports into a car traveling on the highway, exchanging part of himself with the parts of the car that his standing form has replaced, one would hope he isn't immediately bi or trisected by the remainder.

  Alternately, what if he happens to teleport into the edge of a baseball bat just as it's swinging to hit a home run. Does he match momentum with the bat or with the ground? Neither is going to be ideal, but think hard about *why* either one happens and you'll have a clearer idea of how the ability works.
  ```

- u/MoralRelativity:
  ```
  Regarding the sense of direction aspect. Is this directionality to do with line-of-sight or is it absolute? I'm thinking here of the curvature of the Earth and tele-porting to the other side of the world.

  On the same topic. How exact does that need to be? Can Al apply a process of elimination given that if he can't teleport then he knows the direction is not right?

  First off, definitely read the Jumper series. Some my favorite novels and nothing at all like the movie. The character puts a lot of thought into doing things safely and right the first time to avoid problems like teleporting into solid objects. Given what's been spoiled so far, you might think there's not much untrodden ground, but that's what I thought about my knowledge of D&D munchkinry before 2YE came along and you've proven me wrong in the most entertaining possible way.

  Re: a specific definition of "carrying". When the force he applies to an object counteracts (or for purposes of teleporting out of, say, deep space, would counteract at his destination) the force due to gravity, however briefly, I think he can be said to be carrying it. That stops him from loading a shopping cart full of stuff and popping away, unless he can lift the cart and its contents for long enough to teleport and also stops him from getting away if he is, for example, chained to a wall (since he may be applying force to part of the chain but the rest is held up by the wall which is a solid object too large for him to lift). Unless he can maneuver himself in such a way as to not touch the chain at all like maybe letting it hang at its lowest point and then teleporting out of it. It seems like a reasonable power limit while still having potential to end up broken (used in combination with the reference frame momentum trick, maybe).

  Edit: also, the ground: if his subconscious is already handling the destination reference frame issues, why not let it handle the ground interface issue too? He has a body image of himself as X cm tall, and that's as far as the effect reaches (just never ever wear platform shoes). Jumper handled it by having an area of his surroundings a couple of nanometers thick come along for the ride, which would be mostly air but also a small amount of whatever he was standing on.

  With regards to what the teleporter can take with them, one could use the following rules to make it more well defined as opposed to intuitive.
  The more I thought about this, the rules I had to add, but I can't see anything obviously broken at the moment.


  1) The teleportation works on whole, entire objects. Either an object is teleported with you or it is not. Liquids and gasses are considered to be collections of an innumerable number of teeny tiny particles.

  2) The item must either be in contact with skin, or in contact with another solid item of adequate size that is itself teleporting. 

  If 'solid item' is too vague, we could define it more explicitly as a continuous object requiring a certain amount of force to break at any point. A very thin rope with a weak spot might then be counted as two ropes.

  Similarly, two discrete, touching objects would be considered the same object if it took more than a certain amount of force to separate them. **

  The adequate size rule above has two purposes.
  Items must be of sufficiently small size rules to stop everything in the same building / on the same planet from being teleported as well.
  Although rule 3 actually makes this redundant.

  Items must be of sufficiently large size, to stop all gas / liquid / sand particles close to you from forcefully being teleported as well. This is important.*

  *This doesn't stop really small items from being teleported. Sand/liquid/gas in contact with you or with another large item would be teleported. But Gas particles that are only touching other gas particles being teleported, wont be teleported. So you don't take a whole room full of air with you.

  3) Objects that extend more than a certain distance away from the skin / centre of mass of the teleporter are not taken. Meaning that only solid objects that exist entirely within a certain volume (possibly a sphere) relative to the teleporter are displaced.

  4) Any substance contained entirely within a container being teleported, is teleported as well. A container could be defined as a closed continuous surface not allowing particles of a certain size to pass through. This allows liquids and gases in containers to be teleported. Any solids of sufficient size in a container would have been teleported anyway as a consequence of the first three rules.

  These rules should work if the teleporter has no control over their teleportation. The 'carrying' rule seems to arbitrary to make rigorous. The above rules should let you take another person if they are touching you and sufficiently close.

  ** This rule has the consequence that heavy items touching the ground wont be taken, as they are touching the ground and the force between them causes the item and the ground to be considered as the same object. If they can be lifted for just a moment (and all other rules are satisified) it would be possible to take them.

  If we let the teleporter choose what to take, we can relax some of the above rules and just let the teleporter what to take. Although this may affect the efficiency of the teleporter, if they are consciously having to think about everything they want to take in order to avoid being naked at their destination.

- u/Sceptically:
  ```
  Ouch. He'd need to not be touching the ground in order to teleport? And ~~if~~ when he gets himself embedded in a wall then he'd be stuck there unless he could manually bust himself out? That could turn out lethal rather quickly.

  What if he teleports into a block of concrete with his mouth open? Does the concrete fill his lungs? Or does it stop at his lips?

  What's the minimum distance that he can teleport? How does he avoid ending up with his feet an inch into the floor? Could he hold out a piece of paper, and teleport so that the paper cuts through something? What's the minimum time between teleports? Could he teleport somewhere holding a grenade, then teleport back before it explodes? Could he [teleport into the sun for a nanosecond](http://what-if.xkcd.com/115/), and teleport back out, leaving a large chunk of plasma at his original location?

  Also, how can he teleport into a solid object if he has to picture his destination? It's pretty difficult to picture the inside of a block of granite.

  >In order to teleport somewhere he needs to have a very clear picture of it in his mind. This means [...] he is extremely familiar with it from spending a lot of time there.

  If he's teleporting to a location that has changed significantly since he last saw it, does the teleport go through anyway? Does it simply fail? For example, he's teleporting to his childhood home, but someone else has moved in and bought all new furniture.

  If there are several places that his mental image could match, does it pick at random? Does it pick "the closest match"? Does it choose in some other way? Or fail? For example, he's teleporting to a hotel room, and there's 100 identical rooms in the building - where does he go?

  Either way, could this be used to gain information about a place without actually teleporting? I'm imagining that Al attempts to teleport to his safe-house, but specifically pictures the door being locked and the room being empty. If the teleport fails, he knows it's not safe there - and his attackers don't know he knows.

    If he's just teleporting to "some random hotel room that looks like this" then it fails.  If he's teleporting to "room 202", or has some other unique descriptor for the room, then it works.

  Ignoring the whole found-out-and-dissected-by-the-NSA bit. Also assuming that teleportation takes place in a manner that prevents relativistic happy fun times. What I would *actually* do is just shorten my commute. Probably do a bit more tourism and hiking.

  > In order to teleport somewhere he needs to have a very clear picture of it in his mind. This means either he can see it directly, 

  In a clear night sky with a telescope, I can see the Andromeda galaxy. Presumably that isn't enough to let me teleport to the Andromeda galaxy -- or would it? If so, this offers extremely cheap space exploration: I don a space suit, teleport to the moon, look at a particular nebula, spend a handful of jumps getting close to that nebula, gather telemetry with my space suit, and teleport back.

  You found an exoplanet? With a good image of the region, I can teleport to some spot nearby, then hop successively closer with relative jumps. If I see a place that's sufficiently Earthlike, I can investigate it further, even land. The moment I detect danger, I'm back home in a decontamination tank.

  You want to set up a space station? Lift in in a helium balloon ten inches off the floor and I can teleport it to orbit. Or if that's cheating, I can at least heft 80kg chunks into space, and I can go up there with minimal preparation and cost to assemble these chunks.

  > or if it's on top of something he is lifting.

  How does this translate into zero gravity? Can I grab onto a giant space station and teleport with the whole thing?

  > He is shifted into the momentum frame of his destination, so if he teleports from the pole to the equator he isn't mashed into a wall by the change in the earth's rotation.

  Similarly, if I teleport from here to the moon while jogging, I will be going a jogging pace relative to the surface of the moon. If I am falling at 100m/s and teleport to the far side of the gravity well I'm in, I will be falling 100m/s in the opposite direction.

  > He cannot bring part of an object with him

  How about fluids?

  > but he can switch himself with a part of an object.

  Which is scary, actually. Some of those objects are people. I would need to install webcams in the places I typically want to teleport to in order to ensure they're empty when I want to teleport there.

  The first thing I'd do is get one of those belts that vibrates in the direction of true North, or maybe implant a magnet into a finger. People seem to have acquired tremendous sense of direction after taking those steps. That would solve the most dangerous drawback of the power. 

  After that, I'm not sure. It would be tempting to get rich. If I managed to resist the draw of easy riches, I'd probably get in touch with Bill Gates, Elon Musk, or someone else capable of doing great things for humanity. Teleportation could probably solve a lot of problems for the developing world.

  I think it might be possible to imprison someone by standing in a jail cell, wearing a very large sumo suit, swapping places with a target, and immediately teleporting back to a safe place.

      To increase my physical volume. That makes teleportation accuracy less of an issue, as well as reducing the chance of injuring my target. If the sumo suit is large enough, it is conceivably possible to displace more than one targeted person.

  Could be used to break practically unbreakable things? Say he needs to get his crew of criminals into a bank vault. He could stand before a wall/menacing vault door, then teleport so that a part of him is inside the door, then quickly away, then repeat until the hole is big enough for his people to get in.

  Similarly, if it ever becomes necessary to break the Unbreakable Artefact, just teleport so an arm appears where half the artefact was?

  Well, getting a job as a photographer would probably be a good idea. Otherwise, it could potentially have applications in digging/construction/mining. As in, teleport in to clear out chunks of rock, etc. You can then do stuff with the chunks of rock that are cleared out. Would he be capable of telefragging?

    It almost doesn't need to be said. Unless you have a Zion(and interventional godlike figures don't really belong in rational fiction), powers will apply just as well to organic material as inorganic material. There is the issue that if the character users that, they'll come to be seen as a living weapon, though, and they may be wise enough to avoid demonstrating that. They might even decide to lie about it.

  Reference frame hacking. He's falling towards the ground for some reason - can he teleport directly to the ground without plowing into it at the same speed?

  If not, can he teleport to the *exact opposite location on the planet* while maintaining a reference frame with respect to, say, the Sun, so that he's now traveling upwards instead of downwards? And when he slows to a stop, can he now teleport safely to the ground?

  If his reference frame is always going to be with respect to the nearest gravitational sink, that's going to be problematic. If he falls from somewhere and reaches terminal velocity, he can keep teleporting back up into the air, but will presumably eventually succumb to fatigue unless he can find somewhere like a giant airbag to appear above.

  Hacks from density-changing power exploits:  
  - being able to cut through any form of normal matter by teleporting a hand or finger into the matter, then teleporting back out again, leaving a crudely gouged hole. He could make neater cuts by picking up a knife or a chopstick and teleporting only that part of "things he's carrying" into the target. If he can control exactly what comes with him during teleports, he can disintegrate chains, handcuffs etc.  
  - being able to place items inside or the other side of things (like containers or walls) by tying them to a thin string, swinging the string until it's horizontal, and then teleporting himself, the string, and the item so that the string penetrates the container/wall and the item winds up embedded or on the other side, with only the smallest hole in the penetrated surface to give it away. Maybe use fishing line?  
  - should he take to wearing a face-mask with an oxygen supply? It'd handle the problem with destination material getting into his lungs, provide a few minutes of air while he reoriented, and it could have a built-in mini-gyroscope in his field of view which always showed which way was 'up'. Escape any embedding by teleporting a mile up, then looking for the ground and immediately teleporting back to it. Might want to start wearing shoes/boots with shock absorbers, or an airbag suit, or something which could minimize the impact of short falls. Or just have a permanent set of emergency-services giant airbags (the kind used for jumpers) set up in a cave somewhere. Or take to wearing an emergency small parachute all the time.

  (On a side note, if the material of the destination fills his lungs if he has his mouth open, does he have to block his nostrils as well?)

  Wealth hacking. What's the value of genuine moonrock to specialist collectors? What are people currently paying to put micro- and nano-satellites into orbit? Would the character be interested in smuggling? How about delivering "diplomatic parcels" to embassies?

  How stealthy is the character? Could they track people while staying out of sight on rooftops or other locations? If he didn't want to empty out bank vaults to make some cash, would he consider tracking drug dealers to their sources, tracking those sources to *their* sources, and eventually seeing if they could wind up looking at somewhere with a stupidly large amount of physical cash stored on the premises? Which leads to the question of how much of a pallet of cash could he grab with a jump-in, jump-out maneuver? Especially if he seeded the area with smoke grenades first and then did multiple jumps? What if he wore a sumo suit and just teleported into the cash pile from his storage location? (Sure, a lot of cash would be chopped up, but the raw volume should bring a lot of it back. And doing it again on a two-second delay would allow the cash which had been surrounding him on the first appearance to fall into the hole he'd made, making it a target for the second trip.)

  Come to think of it, I'm really liking the airbag-suit/sumo-suit thing. Automatically increase his 'displace' volume *and* handle short falls!

  I'd prioritize setting up a lunar colony. Get a self-sustaining automated factory system going there. Port in starter batches of the small, high tech stuff like laser diodes, motors, and computer chips, make the bulkier stuff out of refined regolith, get an in-situ tech spiral going until it is truly self replicating (hiring/kidnapping engineers as needed), then cover the whole Moon with robots.

  For startup cash, instead of trying to sell authentic moon dust (potentially raising questions about where it came from), maybe sell it online as moon dust [simulant](http://www.orbitec.com/store/simulant.html). Martian dust simulant sells for $500 for 50lb. A few dozen trips, using an old scuba suit or something, and you have enough to finance some better engineered gear (like maybe an actual space suit). After that, you can stay long enough to look around a bit. In certain impact craters (caused by C-type asteroids) there are probably diamonds. These could be sold to finance further operations.
  ```

- u/lsparrish:
  ```
  The ability to teleport objects you are holding, combined with the fact that whatever is there at the destination changes places with it, seems pretty exploitable.

  You could hold extremely lightweight objects and teleport next to big heavy objects to move or cut through them. It could be used to tunnel your way through a mountain (just need a piece of styrofoam long and light enough).

  If "carrying" applies to buoyant, inflated objects, one could conceivably use a helium balloon inflated in the desired shape and just barely heavier than air, to displace arbitrarily large structures -- entire mountains, perhaps -- lifting their rocky mass to extreme heights, etc.
  ```

  - u/lsparrish:
    ```
    Teleporting while holding onto a piece of diamond might be a way to fuse two or more of them together. Big gems fetch disproportionately higher prices relative to small ones, and diamond dust is actually cheap, so you could make money this way even just using diamonds from earth.

    By using a glass replica of an exquisitely cut gem, you could turn raw uncut diamond into finished gems directly. Rest the replica on your hand and teleport to holding your hand directly under the bulk. (The diamond section ends up at the other location and the glass ends to buried in the raw diamond.)

    You could also make some 'stamp' three dimensional shapes out by teleporting in plastic models from a 3D printer. So you could make durable, tough customized components for your workshop, and maybe even a good suit of armor. (In addition to the protection, picking stuff up with powered armor might be a way to increase teleport limits.)

  His potential as an assassin or saboteur is pretty damn extreme with the current power description.  Here's a very low tech example.

  Put on a protective suit.  Fill a creatively-designed (so you can study it and teleport back to it) storage tank to neck-height with diesel fuel, and feed non-oxygen gasses into it.  Use a drone or live video to teleport to a site.  Inflate a very large airbag, drop a lit thermite charge, and then teleport back into the diesel-filled room, holding the airbag below neck level.  You then exit the tank out the ladder.

  Even if you carry sparks back with you, there will be no oxygen in the diesel tank to ignite, but a couple cubic yards of diesel fuel will appear at the point where you teleported out, right on top of the magnesium flare you lit.

    This took me a second...by "pop an airbag" you mean "inflate it", right?  I thought you meant pop as in "pop a balloon" and was confused.

    Yeah, that would make for a pretty big problem for whatever was on the other side.  I don't think you'd get a thermobaric explosion, just a giant Molotov cocktail, but that would be bad enough.
