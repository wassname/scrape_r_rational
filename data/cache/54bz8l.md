## [Q] Recommendations similar to Mother of Learning?

### Post:

I just finished reading Mother of Learning (as much as has been written so far at least) and absolutely loved it. The setting, the magic system, the quality, pretty much all of it.

The main thing I'm looking for more of is the way the MC steadily gets realistically and satisfyingly more powerful and more knowledgable (compared to certain parts of the setting) without outclassing the major struggles he faces and without making his allies obsolete (both common flaws in power fantasy).

Anyone have recommendations for anything that does that well? I'd probably prefer a roughly fantasy/sword-and-sorcery setting, ~~ideally original fiction, but I'm open to other settings and fan fiction too~~ original fiction only please.

**Edit:** I think I underestimated how many responses would be fanfics. Unfortunately, I'm just not familiar with enough of the common fanfic canons to read many of them.

  l recommend [The Gods Are Bastards](https://tiraas.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/). While it doesn't focus much on a protagonist getting more power (for one because there are many of those, but also because they're quite powerful already), it does involve the characters becoming more knowledgeable (one of the main settings is a University after all) and I think it is done quite realistically. The characters not only learn magic, but also history, politics, society and about themselves. 

  It's my favorite web serial among the ones I'm currently following.

  As a comment:  I don't think unfamiliarity with canon is a problem in a well-written fanfic.  If it's done well enough you likely won't even recognize that it's fanfic -- for example, it could be argued that Mother of Learning owes more than a passing nod to D&D.  The city of Cyoria bears strong resemblance to [Waterdeep](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Waterdeep), with the dungeon under it mapping well to the [Undermountain](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Undermountain).  It's been quite a while since I finished MoL, but as far as I recall the magic systems (clerics / wizards / psionicists) map well onto the D&D systems.  Many of the monsters referenced were clear analogues from D&D.  Obviously some of this is simply cross-pollination between fantasy tropes, D&D, and mythology.  Still, the similarities are strong.  Chances are good that you are not intimately familiar with the Forgotten Realms canon, yet you clearly enjoyed MoL despite that.

  Some recommendations I would make, all of which are fanfic and none of which (in my opinion) require familiarity with canon:

  * [Dungeon Keeper Ami](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/)  A brainy magical girl (Ami) ends up in a fantasy world and accidentally bonds with an evil artifact.  All the good people assume she's evil and fight her, and she has to defend herself without breaking her own moral code.  There's a moderately uncomfortable amount of "clothes fell off" considering that the protagonist is 14 at the start of the story, but it's not too bad.  The power levels increase gradually but significantly and it's highly rational.
  * [Dreaming of Sunshine](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7347955/1/Dreaming-of-Sunshine)  A young woman from the modern world wakes up in a land of kung fu battle wizards and needs to survive.  Her personal magic levels aren't much compared to those around her, but she leverages them into major power in very believable ways that often involve the proper application of explosions.  The relationships and characterizations are especially good.
  * [Lighting up the Dark](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9311012/1/Lighting-Up-the-Dark) Written by my quest co-author /u/Velorien, this is the story of a young ninja who is *not* an idiot and uses his power in very munchkinly ways to beat significantly stronger opponents.  It's smart, funny when it chooses to be, and the characterizations are excellent.  
  * [Marked for Death](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest-story-only.24793/)  *cough, mild self-promotion, cough*  This is a quest that /u/Velorien and I write.  (If 'quest' is unfamiliar to you, as it was to me, it means that the readers vote on what the protagonist should do next, but the authors define the rules of the world and choose the actual path of the plot.)  I've linked the story-only thread, but feel free to [join the discussion](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/) as well.

  Side comment:  /u/FuguOfAnotherWorld (aka Jackercracks) was a co-GM on the Marked for Death quest until he got eaten by ~~a grue~~ the video game Stellaris.  (Come back, man!  We miss you.) He writes [Roll the Dice on Fate](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11402847/1/Roll-the-Dice-on-Fate) which I like very much but I suspect leans too heavily on canon to fit what you're looking for.  Still, I didn't want him to feel like I was ignoring him.

  I think [natural 20](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20) and [2 year emperor](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3xe9fn/ffrt_the_two_year_emperor_is_back_and_free/) are similar, though natural 20 is on hiatus.

  Oh and also worm's pretty good if you haven't read it (not really fantasy but there are superpowers and the gradual increase in the power of the MC). And the [fanfiction](http://archiveofourown.org/works/3998737/chapters/8979811?view_adult=true) that stemmed from that as well. Oh and also [the gamer vs RWBY](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/rwby-the-gamer-the-games-we-play.306381/) was great; it's long as hell but unfinished.

  There's also [Zombie knight](http://thezombieknight.blogspot.com/2013/04/page-1.html) that's sort of like this, though the powering up is a bit bumpy.

  [Transdimensional brain chip](http://brainchip.thecomicseries.com/) is worth a mention, though it's not a fantasy setting.

  Re: Your edit, /u/Cuz_Im_TFK: except for natural 20 which requires harry potter knowledge and has some dnd tropes but knowledge of them isn't needed, everything I linked is stuff I enjoyed while knowing nothing or nearly nothing about the original stories/universes (2ye, rwby vs gamer) or are original fiction (worm, zombie knight, transdimensional brain chip).

    [I have good news for you](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/rwby-the-gamer-the-games-we-play-disk-five.341621/).

    I do think that the story is great even by rather strict rationalistic standards and that the worldbuilding it has is stellar, but if OP is looking for a vaguely realistic power curve then that TGWP can't provide. A lot of the story revolves around the fact that the main character's superpower is utterly broken.
    ```

    - u/appropriate-username:

      I do not see at all how "the MC finally got inside the plot device" is by any stretch of the imagination finishing the story. If anything, the author cut off at the very top of the climax.

      It's great and very lengthy and what's there is satisfying but the story doesn't definitively explain any of the plot hooks even at the very end.
      ```

      - u/Menolith:
        ```
        The book is finished, but the series isn't. It's not like the author just dropped it halfway through, as is the case with a lot of stories.  
        He's focusing on a Percy Jackson crossover currently, but a sequel is planned in the future.
        ```

        - u/appropriate-username:

          But I don't understand how the part where they stopped can even be called finished for the book. Nothing's resolved, the last part only raises more questions. The stopping point seems pretty arbitrary to me.
          ```

          - u/Menolith:
            ```
            It is somewhat arbitrary.

            Maybe the author intended to mirror the [](#s "story-like nature of the MC's power by cutting the story after "act one," so to speak. Reaching the Important Plot Device and chasing off the Big Bad are both things which usually happen at the end"), even if in this case it leaves a lot open.
            ```

  The [Infinite](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheInfiniteLoops) [Loops](http://infinite-loops.wikia.com/wiki/Infinite_Loops_Wiki) might have what you're looking for, with some looking.  Basic premise is *something* happened to the machine that maintains the multiverse, and to stabilize things the various universes of the multiverse (as in, our world's fiction) enter time loops, each centered around an 'anchor' that is aware of every loop in that universe.  Other characters from such universes eventually being looping some of the time and characters can wind up in other universes for a loop, but the core premise is that the loops won't end in a conceivable time frame, so all of the characters just have to find ways to pass the time.

  A lot of it looks at characters after they've really hit their stride and the only possible challenge to their power are other loopers, so it's fairly character-interaction based, especially since most loopers trend to being relatively benign to each other, but there are also stories written about characters just entering the time loop for the first time, which you might like.

  I also once read a Ranma 1/2 story called [Right Moments](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/764256/1/Right-Moments) which sort of fits the bill.  Ranma enters a one-day time loop and learns more and more techniques and gets more and more powerful and knowledgeable, with appropriately more difficult challenges he decides to take on.  Ranma generally goes it alone for most of the story, though, and the core time loop elements start to break down (long-term safety, multiple attempts) when he spends more and more time interacting with the spirit world.  Even still, I found it a good time loop story for such an unsaturated genre.

    Obligatory plug for the Worm infinite loops that I compile but have had no part in writing: https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10451949/1/Worm-Loops

    They're part of the Infinite Loops group, but only semi-canon because of disagreements. They're still pretty good though.
    ```

    - u/InfernoVulpix:
      ```
      I think I remember seeing those disagreements play out, and was worried that the concept of Worm Loops would dry up if all that it had to its name was a large battle about how the setting was supposed to be.  It's good to see, at least, that the ball got rolling anyways.

      Personally, I think if we could have agreed on two major camps we could have justified a weird situation where the Worm Loops were effectively two different main universes on Yggdrasil, where maybe it was and is a perfectly ordinary branch that got 'copied' to the junk space, in which Taylor wound up getting admin power.  You would have two Taylors and other Worm Loopers, but that could be played out as an amusing quirk instead of a canon-breaking mess.  But hey, if this works, it works.
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I've tried finding the infinite loops before but I can't never find the stories themselves, and when I do it seems like some kind of weird group roleplaying instead of a productive story with a planned ending.

    Am I doing anything wrong? I *have* found some snippets that are interesting but I can't find anything that ties it all together into a sane storyline.
    ```

    - u/InfernoVulpix:
      ```
      Since it's snippet based, most of the stories you find are going to be on their own, without a greater plan.  If your problem is that you're finding the *threads* and there's only one snippet for every twenty discussion posts, look for compilations instead.  The compilations are where someone took the snippets that count as canon and put them all together.  The coherent, multi-part stories will be there, spread out around the other one shots, so you can skip past them until you find the title of the next part.

      You should be able to find the compilations on the tv tropes link.

  I feel the burning desire to recommend [All Night Laundry](http://www.all-night-laundry.com/) despite the fact that the only thing it has in common are time-travel shenanigans.

  [I'm a Spider So What](https://armaell-library.net/novel/i-m-a-spider-so-what) is a nice story where the protagonist reincarnates as a spider in a RPG world. It's pretty good due to how it subverts the common tropes for protagonist reincarnating into a Gamer Mary Sue. [Here's](http://blastron01.tumblr.com/post/150808855361/im-a-spider-so-what-107) the link for online translations of later chapters.

  [Gamer Arc](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11019074/2/Gamer-Arc) is a good RWBY fanfiction with Juane as a Gamer, but is not ridiculously overpowered as in The Games We Play.

  In fact, here's the fanfiction [collection](https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Title-The-Gamer/119494/) of all RWBY fanfictions involving the Gamer power in some fashion.

    Hey, thanks. I actually read a decent amount of LNs and WN, so I've heard of I'm a Spider So What and have considered reading it before, I just haven't been able to convince myself that a spider can be a relatable main character (or do anything interesting from a human perspective without a copout like a transformation ability). Would you mind trying to convince me to read it? 

    Also, is canon RWBY any good? Worth putting on my "plan to watch" list on MAL?

      ```

    - u/blazinghand:
      ```
      The main character in I'm a Spider was originally a human with a pretty unique writing style. It's important you find a good translation, because she speaks in a distinctive way with a lot of idioms and stuff that don't translate well unless your translator is pretty good. Here's an example of her style:

      > Oh ho! All three meters went up by two, as did Offense and Defense, and Magic Power and Resistance went up by one. But uh, hey, Speed, what are you doing? I remember you being 348 before, and then you gained… twenty one points…? Isn’t that a little weird? The other stats were a little more reserved about it… aren’t you trying a little too hard? …Offense, Defense, why did you go up the same amount? You’re leaving Magic Power and Resistance in the dust, you know… Uuuuunbelievable…

      And:

      > After my successful defeat of the first squadron, the wasps started attacking continuously. I wiped out the second squad they sent at me without any trouble, but after that, things started getting a little hairy. They started sending multiple squads at once. No waaaaay! I mean, this is the right thing for the wasps to be doing, but, please look at it from my perspective! I don’t want this many wasps to come! I’m still totally safe in my nest, but there’s this constant feeling of pressure, you know! What am I supposed to do about all of these wasps constantly buzzing around me, day and night?

      The translator who I think does the best job is blastron01. The passages above are taken from his translation. His translated version only has up through chapter 106, but is the highest quality and captures the tone and quality of the original writing in a way I think others (including Turb0's) do not. You can read it here: [(link)](http://blastron01.tumblr.com/kumoko-contents). 

      Here's an example of blastron1's translation notes:

      > Translator’s notes for this chapter:
      >>1. These lines are referencing the opening lines of I Am a Cat, a famous Japanese novel. “I am a cat. As yet, I have no name.”
      >>2. There’s joke here that’s difficult to translate directly: the protagonist says “I can’t live a normal life”, then remarks that “life” (人生) contains the kanji for “person” (人), and that it would be more accurate to swap that out for “spider” (蜘蛛) to make “spider-life” (蜘蛛生).

      This should give you an idea as to the quality of the translation. Very good quality.

      I recommend RWBY if you like action anime with a character-focused story. I think of it as similar to Soul Eater, except I actually like the characters, setting, and humor. It's not perfect or rational, especially at the beginning, but it's more mature and intelligent than it seems. It's nothing profound, but I enjoy it.

      It's still a goofy story about teenage girls in colorful outfits wielding crazy weapons going to a school for monster hunters, but if you don't mind the inherent silliness of that idea you should check it out. Just make sure to binge it, since it's written and paced like a normal anime despite the short episodes.

  *[Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644)* (fanfiction for *[Naruto](https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Naruto)*; 204k words, complete) might fit. The protagonist's increase in power definitely is gradual, and she suffers several major setbacks over the course of the story.
  ```

  - u/bassicallyboss:
    ```
    It does a good job doing a slow, realistic-seeming increase in power.  It's also very nice that it's complete.  In that sense, it has what you're looking for.  However, I didn't enjoy the writing style or tone as much as I like *Mother of Learning*'s.  MoL feels like professional quality.  Not on the level of the best writers out there, but about even with more skilled new authors. I've certainly read worse in books that I purchased.

    On the other hand, several aspects of TB (including the sex and the [surprise worldbuilding and character details introduced partway through](#s " about demonic possession, heaven and hell, and Sakura becoming a literal goddess") felt very amateurish.  Mostly in delivery, but also partly in conception.  The interpersonal relationships read like they were written by a teenager, albeit one with good grammar and some experience with internal struggle.  If copyright could be ignored and the story were eligible for professional publishing, I expect it would need a solid editing and some cuts first.

    On the whole, I liked it a lot less than I expected to, given the high regard I saw it given on this sub.  I kept expecting it to get better, and while it did in some ways, it didn't in others.  I don't often abandon books or stories, but I also have pretty high standards, so I might have if I'd known how it would go.  That said, it does have its good points, and others clearly weren't bothered as much as I was by the style issues.  I expect that it comes down to the matter of fanfiction.  This isn't a story that just happens to be about Naruto characters, the way *The Waves Arisen* felt.  It's fanfiction through and through.  If that doesn't bother you, you'll probably enjoy it a lot.  If it does, you'll probably have the same reservations that I had.

    [Edit:  For what it's worth, I didn't have much familiarity with the canon when I read it, and I was able to understand what was going on pretty well.  YMMV.]

  For me, the training and growth of a character is by far the most satisfying part of fantasy. Mother of learning is likely to go down as my favorite book ever so it seems like our interests align. Here are books that I've liked based on the above qualifications.

  1) firehurler. Indie fantasy book by a redditor that is incredibly well written and has a lot gong on. though the main character starts out with a ton of raw power, he gradually learns how to control it and how to use it.

  2) lightbringer series. Book 4 of 5 is coming out really soon but it is well written and has a solid sense of progression of the main character

  3) the waves arisen, Naruto fiction. Does run into the issue of making other characters obsolete, though not entirely. Very good gradual power up, though you probably want to have seen some Naruto.

  4) Pokemon, origin of species. Unfinished currently updating rational fiction. Very well done, probably my second favorite currently updating web serial.

  5) wheel of time. Certainly not rational fiction but if you haven't read it, well the main character goes from human power to good level without overshadowing the rest of the cast. There are like 2 to 5 secondary main characters who also power up in similar fashion. It may not be the most gradual power up, there are several jumps in power but in the end when he reaches his final level you feel like he has transcended to a completely new level both in power but also in his ability to deal with people and influence the story. It's incredibly satisfying after such much suffering and work though the work tends to be of  thematic significance than actual training.

  6) I haven't read this, I'm trying to finish off a few series before committing to this, but Worm is the obvious next thing I need to read.
