  For the past two years I've been writing a rational scifi series of novellas which takes place in a realistic alternate earth very similar to our own in the very near future. Its targeted towards a more general audience, and the setting and characterization are designed to be self consistent and plausible. Also for bonus points, includes a realistic same sex relationship between two men who are not effeminate and who also happen to be POV protagonists, and the relationship is a part of the plot and not just grafted on, and the fact that their relationship is same sex is not treated as a special important or defining part of their characters, and certainly not the only important thing about them -- all of these obvious common sense things together are unheard of in fiction. 

  Also includes a fairly nonpartisan approach/perspective on contemporary politics. The story is fairly critical of literally every single human faction in the world. It basically is intended to hold up a mirror to the world and let humanity glimpse it's own reflection. And it does so pretty concisely, since its a series of novellas rather than novels, for readers with shorter attention spans who are hesitant to commit to reading longer works.

  I figured were basically talking about rational earthfics, so might as well talk about mine lol
