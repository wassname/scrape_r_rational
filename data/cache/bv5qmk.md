  This is my Twig fanfic "Graduation project". Though it makes references to the Twig universe, you don't need to have read Twig to understand it, and it doesn't spoil any major event in the story; please avoid spoilers in the comments below.

  This is obviously ~~ripping off~~ inspired by *Instruments of Destruction*, as well as my own experience in Epitech Innovative Projects (though I sure wasn't paid ridiculous amounts of money at the end of my graduation project).

  As this is my first long-ish fiction story, I'm eager for any feedback, especially feedback about what could be improved, and about sentence flow and how well any individual paragraph conveys an idea. Feel free to tear me apart :)

  I will post a aooo link as soon as their system is done registering me. In the meantime, pastebin is all I have.

  I kind of hated this, having already read Instruments.

    Yeah, I can see it.

    Part of it is that for a student project, the natural story structure will be "Students has brilliant idea, student is overconfident, everything goes wrong, school gives student good grade anyway" which is pretty close to the structure of Instruments; part of it is me being lazy and just plain reusing concepts from Instruments.

      eh, i wasn't really expecting to see original story structure, I just wanted to see some bioengineering project details and that's what I got. I enjoyed it :)

  Enjoyable read. I had read instruments before, but didn't realize/remember resemblance until it was pointed out. Good representation of the twig universe without spoilers. In terms of the writing, sentence flow, etc--I think it was fine. Nothing was jarringly out of place or seemed poorly written.
