  Is oath magic new, or old? Because this makes an enormous difference.

  If oath magic has been a part of the setting for a long time, it will have been woven into the fabric of society on a bone deep level, and have utterly transformed it, because this is the kind of thing that allows you to eliminate the agent problem. 

  Agents of the law will be utterly incorruptible - and perfectly trusted.

  Merchants will be non-deceptive, and known to be so, and so on and so forth, because everyone will be using standardized oaths that have been long codified and shown to be abuse and loophole free over the course of centuries.  

  This also limits munchkinism rather severely, because people will be very, very skeptical of any new oath that isn't in the Codex of Duly Tested, Examined, and Approved Oaths. No oathing to tell the truth and then being technically truthy to get away with shit - if you want to establish trustworthyness magically, you take either the Witness, Judge, Trader, or Enforcers oaths of Not Deceiving People, and those are all darn bulletproof. 

  If it's new, people will be making up their own oaths and everything will be a clusterfuck because they get it wrong.

    It's quite old, but in the setting it doesn't make much difference. An Oath is a great tool for building trust, and it's useful for merchants, but it loses it's effectiveness when it comes to the ruling class.

    The magic system in this setting allows for people to train to a ridiculous height. People can become so strong such that an entire army of people at a lower level can't hope to scratch them. Now, consider that the Oath magic had to be new at some point. The people running the country are going to be the strongest individuals (power gives resources, everyone wants resources for further advancing their magic, large amounts of treachery pre-Oath, ergo the people at the top got there by the sword and stay there with their newly acquired resources) and the people a little lower the totem pole are still going to be strong. They're not going to want to swear Oaths giving away their ability to deceive, to struggle for power. After all, if you reach a high enough level, you can live forever. The people who swear they will never do no wrong are cutting off massive amounts of their own potential for growth. And it's likely they would all band together to avoid making any Oath of the sort, maybe even swearing another Oath to rebel or kill the king's loved ones if they're ever forced to swear an Oath against deceit and the like. So no precedent is set for Oath swearing as a requirement to enter into a position of power, it would never become the tradition and wouldn't be as suspicious if someone didn't swear an Oath upon entering the position.

    As for law enforcement, what could swearing an Oath help with there? Criminals can also swear Oaths, making it easy to pass Oaths of truthfulness, by simply Oathing away the memories of the crime. There would be a few more steps once the enforcers get savvy to this, but then there's just a few more steps easily accomplished by Oath. As such, Oaths of truthfulness are nearly worthless after the fact. It's better in-setting to rely on the other branches of magic - scrying, divination, that sort of thing - for anything regarding crimes, because then anyone with knowledge of such things can easily repeat the tests to see if the law enforcement is being truthful or not.

      It's not so much for the purposes of a trial. 

      how to put this.. Okay, modern analogy; Law enforcement relies on people trusting the cops. The more trustworthy law enforcement is, the more effective it ultimately is, because people volunteer information to trusted agents of law and order in a way they do not to such agents that are viewed with suspicion. 

      Thus, the black witch king in the mountain may be a corrupt and ancient being with a drinking problem, but if said witchking is wise, then the Sheriff? The sheriff is sworn to the law. If the witchking is foolish, sworn to the witch-king.

- u/ulyssessword:
  ```
  There are two exploitable features here, aside from the obvious.  The first is magical knowledge, and the second is magical enforcement.

  You have a sealed box and a friend in front of you.  You make an oath: "I swear to give my friend a sealed box containing an apple within 10 seconds, or else I will give him a dollar."  You give him the sealed box, wait 10 seconds, then check if you have lost a dollar.  You now know if the box contained an apple.

  Depending on how smart the Oath magic is, you can solve everything by binary search.

  Also, depending on the specifics, it could be used for free, instantaneous transportation.  "I promise to not touch this table, or else I will give [far off merchant] 100 bales of cotton."  Touch the table to teleport the cotton from your warehouse to theirs.
  ```

  - u/Jiro_T:
    ```
    If the oath can make you do things it isn't possible for you to do on your own, there are much better uses than teleporting bales of cotton--oaths become a do-anything spell.

          That's fair. From there it's a matter of skill with rules lawyering, who has more information about the exact rules of Oathing, and who moves fastest. Which means you'd end up with some countries under oath-king rule and some not, which sets up up a nice set of ideological differences set a story in.

    - u/callmebrotherg:
      ```
      This seems overly cynical in that you assume that this would be the case in every kingdom. There are many monarchs whose underlings were, at least on balance, faithful to them. This becomes more common as you get into smaller polities (i.e. tribes, clans, and bands) since the ruler was closer and closer to the whole group. Depending on when Oath magic got started, you're probably going to see a whole lot of large nations that are ruled in a weirdly tribal/band-like fashion despite their size, because Oaths allow them to maintain that structure.

      The person who discovers oaths first becomes the oath-king, unless he's a coward or helpless or stupid or something. This is how it'd play out:

      * Person A (discoverer of oath magic) abducts some person (B) weaker than him, and forces B to swear oaths of fealty to him on pain of torture. The oath of fealty also includes a provision that prevents them from revealing the fact that they've been subverted.
      * Rinse and repeat. Person A can abduct a bunch of people weaker than him, or even have his vassals abduct people, all of whom are weaker than his vassals.
      * Once he has enough people, he can have his vassals team up against stronger individuals, forcing them to swear oaths of fealty too. Even if he's only able to abduct the weakest people in the village, once he gets a bunch of them together they'll be able to overcome any ordinary person. And once he's claimed a bunch of ordinary people, he'd be able to overcome a soldier (bows are really useful). And once he's claimed a bunch of soldiers, he'd be able to overcome even a competent soldier / knight, etc.
      * Eventually he will be able to subvert his entire village, and then other villages, towns, cities, kingdoms, empires.

        That should work, yes. But you can't offer your ill health, so you'd be in the same condition post Oath breaking as pre, just without the disease.

        It's also worth to mention that the story is set in a medieval style world, so most non-magical medicinal practitioners aren't capable of diagnosing tumours and the like. A modern-day insert or a capable mage could detect the like, but the latter would have other methods for dealing with this sort of thing anyway.

            ```
            No, because you do not currently own those future diseases. You can Oath them away when you get them, but you can't do so beforehand. You also can't set up an Oath where, if you ever fall ill, you Oath away that illness, because you have to own the consequence at the time of swearing.

      Consider: I don't just own my skills, but my experiences and memories. These could easily be passed down the line to descendants if I was for example on my deathbed. Depending on whether the "self" is contained in a soul in your setting, you could easily craft an Oath to trade bodies with another.

      Continuously retraining in a skill could highlight better teaching practices such that the teaching is quickly optimized. Also, people develop and retain skills and knowledge differently, so one package of skills cycling through a series of novice learners to build on the product could output a broader and therefore more useful package.

      Large groups of literate individuals could read through pages and transfer all the memories/knowledge contained within to one person so that the information is absorbed at incredible rates.

      I wonder if it's possible to duplicate memories through oaths rather than transfer.

      Edit: You could through social pressure and time form a society in which the eldest son is duty bound to host their father's soul/memories/skills when they are close to passing, continuing the lineage.

  Oaths as a method of communication.

  "I shall not die. If I do, may this flower which I invested care into raising burst into flames". Now you know if he's dead or not.

  You really gotta firm up "consequences" if you don't want to inadvertently create an entire magic system based on "consequences". It's very hard to give people free reign over what the "consequence" is without finding an exploit. (Even with the example I gave, you can tie the flower-oath to something more trivial and weaponize the flower by tying it to dynamite.) 

  The easy way is to have rigidly fixed consequences.
  ```

- u/OutOfNiceUsernames:

  Firstly, it would likely impose a sense of objective morality upon the world. No matter if the oath works through “divine intervention” or something like a technologically advanced alien civilisation, it would still mean that the population *has* to adhere to certain standards and word-definitions and is unable to ignore them. Maybe some countries would choose to ignore the Oath in their legal system or outright outlaw invoking it, but it would still be there, like a weird psychological phenomenon — if not outright a law of nature.

  If the women from the [Judgment of Solomon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgment_of_Solomon) made an oath setting the penalty as something happening to their supposed son, would that Oath take? If yes, then people are a type of potential property in a moral system that can not be ignored, disputed, or changed. Similar consequences should be expected regarding owning animals of various degrees of intelligence.

  Another ultimate litmus test for countries would be whether they require from their politicians, governmental workers, and citizens to take certain kinds of Oaths or not. A standard argument against mandatory Oaths could be made through concept of “free will”. This argument could also be abused to a degree to allow political corruption, nepotism, crime cover-up, etc.

  In countries, where citizens are required to take certain Oaths, there would always be the looming risk that an agent from within or without would be able to [hijack](https://torrentfreak.com/eztv-shuts-down-after-hostile-takeover-150518/) their entire government by finding a loophole in the currently used version of the mandatory Oath set.

  If the Oaths can be used to make someone do something, people would be perceived as functionaries, to a certain degree. An Oath could be arranged this way to make a person be literally unable to stop working on a certain task until they are finished. If a company specialises on this kind of Oaths (let’s call it an Oath-factory), it’s reasonable to assume that it would care about the health condition of its functionaries because they are a valuable asset to it. The penalty section of a typical Oath used by an Oath-factory would resemble a programming code. 

  On a personal level, Oaths could be used to improve skills and character, to get rid of bad habits (“I swear to stop wanting to smoke if I break this Oath”), to forget things and maybe to share memories and knowledge with others. Oaths made by amateurs would also be more likely to backfire and cause harm to involved parties.

      >I'd say the baby is not explicitly 'owned' by either woman, it is it's own soul

      *(Opinion:)*

      It’s perfectly fine for you-the-writer to use WordOfGod for establishing and defining laws of the setting, because that’s what sci-fi and fantasy are largely about — changing basic aspects of *our* reality to investigate how such changes would affect the human society and using the narrative of adventure to deliver investigation results.

      However, the same doesn’t hold true for using WoG to define certain *social* behaviours (unless [psychological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invention_of_Lying) [characteristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiocracy) themselves are what you’re changing as a basic aspect). Not only does that defeat the whole purpose of social inquiry, but you also have to consider that your audience will be reading the story while holding certain expectations. They’d expect, for instance, for people in your world to have psychological characteristics similar to people from ours. And if people in your world act differently without any explanation for that difference, at best it would be making your audience frustrated by their illogical actions.

      >The only way I can see it happening is if ...

      This is the point where you should start to change\broaden your opinion on the matter instead of continuing to bend the world’s laws to conform to your opinion. 

      Especially if the Oath system is not a new phenomenon, there would have been at least some countries in its history which decided to use the Oaths for one reason or another. And at least some of them would’ve survived to this day because a country without corruption would be much more efficient in going through the [technology levels.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyLevels) Some of them would’ve self-eliminated for various reasons (e.g. getting hijacked, having crazy dictators, etc), yes, but as with any kind of evolutionary system, the ones that survived would be the more durable and balanced ones. So: your world would have had at least some powerful countries that have Oath-powered political hierarchies.

      >As for the Oath factories, what incentive could such a place have to entice people to want to work there?

      Well, this one you *can* tweak out to a certain degree depending on how your story’s background canvas is painted. For instance: [in your world there is no philosophical analogue to [Free Software Movement](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-intro.en.html)] → [there are at least some poor strata and countries (safe Oaths for self-improvement are expensive and scarce)] → [they get economically abused by their more developed counterparts]. And akin to how sweatshops are a thing in our worlds, employee-abusive Oath-factories would be a thing in yours. 

      On the other hand, I’d think that even if *everybody* had their [basic needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs) covered, at least some people would find working through an Oath factory more effective. In this case, of course, the factories would be more interested in caring for not only the well-being of their employees but also for their rights.

      >any Oath with it's harm as the consequence would require it's permission.

      That still allows a loophole.  The age at which someone understands X and is free of outside influence isn't a yes/no thing; people gradually get more and more independent as they age.  What's the highest level of dependency that's still independent enough that someone can take an oath?  Can a 5 year old or 10 year old take one?  Clearly they can never completely understand things like an adult can, but they surely have some understanding.  And it obviously wouldn't make sense to say that you can't take an oath unless you have 100% understanding and are under 0 pressure.

  Will Oath-System accept a language of your own invention that uses same words that common language, but have different meanings? Then, when you're giving Oath with witnesses present, you're mentally notifying Oath-System that you're giving it in your own language, in which it means something harmless. If this works, potential implications are endless.

  Can consequence include giving up any object to another person? Can this be used to teleport objects? Can you consequence away your dumbness? What about hunger, or thirst? What about waste - unlike previous examples, this is actually your own physical thing, but losing it may be highly advantageous.

  Can you consequence away knowledge? Can this be used to induce highly selective amnesia? 

  Can you use Oath to derive knowledge? For example "I'll now tell the city where my nemesis currently resides, or my left pinky experiences mild pain for 3 seconds. It's City ABC". What is the result of such Oath, assuming you don't know your nemesis whereabouts.

  Can Oath be conditional? "If you do anything my son, I'll do my utmost to make you suffer for eternity, or I die." Will you feel this Oath activation when condition is triggered, or when you learn that condition is triggered?

  Btw, If Oath can be conditional, it may be possible (I'm not exact expert) to craft "Computational Oath" - sequence of logic that brings some output (in Morse code of weak pains to your pinky, for example) depending on some input. I assume calculator can be done easily enough (at least for some near-immortal superbeing).

  I think Yudkowsky had the right idea on how to balance such a system - namely, it doesn't do anything physically impossible nor does it cause any consequence if it is broken - it simply compels the oath-maker to complete the terms of the oath to the best of their ability.

  If the first person to get access to the oath system is extremely ambitious and somewhat clever I can see this playing out as invasion of the body snatchers.
  First the "Master" oaths himself to psychologically give up his ability to  be deterred from his goals by laziness. Next being super motivated he kidnaps a few powerful people. He forces them to agree at swordpoint to something they can't possibly do, then when they fail they forfeit their ability to desire things other than what aligns with master's will, or through another method they effectively become a thrall of his. Now that Master has forced many powerful people into thralldom they will then go on to kidnap *more* people to thrall... You get the point, and that's without even getting into the spell's abilities to potentially transfer skills and information, even over great distance. 

  Basically depending on how things go when oaths are first discovered this could play out like invasion of the body snatchers on roids.

  "I agree to aid any person or people who have also taken this Oath when doing so is substantially more beneficial to them then it is costly to me, and not to harm any person or people who have also taken this oath unless doing so is substantially more beneficial to me then it is harmful to them."

  Phrasing could use some work, but hopefully it's good enough to make the point. 

  Taking this Oath will, on average, be beneficial - the only actions it requires are positive-sum, and the only ones it prohibits are negative sum. (It wouldn't be in your interest to take it if you knew that you would have many easy opportunities to help others but almost never be in a position to receive help, but that's not a usual situation.) If you have taken this Oath, it's in your interest to persuade more people to take it as well.
