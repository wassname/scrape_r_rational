  Hot damn! An excellent chapter; one that delivered an uncomfortable combination of long-awaited justice and stomach-churning cruelty. 

  And as always, I feel like Catherine has probably overlooked something and am waiting for the other shoe to drop. She herself said she was waiting for Creation to retaliate against her and I feel the same. Some things that drew my attention:

  >“You’ll surrender the standard controlling your demon to Apprentice before a bell has passed.”

  Granted, Apprentice is the most knowledgeable mage in Catherine's camp. But he's also one that is quite possibly corrupted by the very same demon whose banner her now gets to take into his possession. This seems like it was not a great idea on Catherine's part until she's SURE that he is not corrupted. Warlock's OK on the matter was suspect, to say the least. 

  I am skeptical about Masego's intercession on Fasili's behalf for the exact same reason.

  >“After the war, I will petition to be granted governorship of Liesse,” she said. “You will support this petition in court.”

  Heiress is a Name; she is now going to become a governor of a part of Callow. Catherine just finished a ritual where the Angels agreed that she should be the ruler of Callow. Now, who would be a good person to inherit the country if the ruler is, say, removed from power? A governor might be a key choice as an Heiress...

  >Apprentice could, say, rot off your eyes. He did it to the Bumbling Conjurer’s face in Summerholm. Nasty as all Hells to look at, let me tell you.

  Maybe I am missing something, but why wouldn't Catherine do exactly this to Heiress?? She had no problem methodically breaking many of the bones in her body; why not pursue some eye melting too? 

  >Another round of threats was exchanged, but with Aisha whispering more diplomacy in my ear I eventually got what I wanted. Oaths were given on both sides, the exact wording already prepared by Masego.

  Well, this sparks my curiosity...

  >I’m not a monster, Akua.

  I'm not so sure that's true any more. Black has no problem accepting that he is a monster. But Catherine seems to deny that she has become one. Despite her talk about refusing to betray her friends and soldiers, I think she still see herself as doing good. That's not the same as being Good, but it feels like a self-deception - one that could be exploited eventually and may prompt her to abandon Evil (and thus her soldiers). A person who methodically tortures someone, rips out souls, and gives control of a city of her countrymen over to an extremely evil creature like Heiress is exactly the kind of person I'd describe as a monster.

    > long-awaited justice and stomach-churning cruelty

    Or perhaps "stomach-churning justice and long-awaited cruelty" depending on your perspective. :)

    Great point about Masego's potential corruption. You make a compelling case. Perhaps Catherine will end up having to use that exploding amulet she gave Masego.

    >I'm not so sure that's true any more.

    Every one of those flaws except for one were guilty of active participation in a plot to murder 1000 allies, and set as many demons on a city. (Not to mention servants of someone who set a *corruption* demon on a captured city for political reasons alone.) It may be monstrous, but it doesn't make you a monster, not when the only other options are worse. 

    The only compromise that I see as truly monstrous, rather than just brutality of necessity, is the support of Heiress, and I can't blame her too much for that. She has her own plots at hand, to mitigate the damage, and it really could have been *do that or die*.

    Well, and letting the Heroic equivalent of Heiress go on the day she became squire, rather than slitting his throat and mutilating the corpse, but that didn't seem quite as evil at the time... Which really isn't saying much.

    >But he's also one that is quite possibly corrupted by the very same demon whose banner her now gets to take into his possession.

    I never believed that, I assumed the delay was, quite simply, from the fact that when your child has grown up with your devil lover, it's a little harder to check for a demonic corruption.

    I believe that Catherine rejected the offer of becoming Queen of Callow. It wasn't the angels "agreeing" that she should rule Callow, but a trap to get her to trade the name of Squire for a heroic Name. Had she accepted, I think she would have become an agent of contrition like William was. Since Catherine rejected the offer, I don't think it's possible for Heiress to inherit the position from her.
    ```

  ```
  So the pattern of three must have broken when the name Squire was taken from Catherine- or later, when Squire was led to her death at the hands of an Nameless individual due to Heiress' machinations.

  Or something's going to turn up from Akua's plots to ruin Catherine's day as badly as Akua's has been.

  Maybe I'm giving too much credibility to the patterns, though. It's easy to believe in rules like that, but the harder you try to abuse something as faint as "victory, draw, defeat", the easier it is to break it.

  Actually, can anyone else model their approximation of the pattern's points as of this point?

    ```
    I read the part where Cat mentioned one of her Aspects being lost being admission that she had been defeated at Marchford by Heiress, where the Heiress had thought it was a tie at most.

  (The protagonist's violence-tinged hints of perverse sexual lust towards Akua always warm the cockles of my heart.)
