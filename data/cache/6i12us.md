  I really like this feeling of unquestionable out-of-your-depthness this chapter creates; this is *exactly* what should happen when untrained people are trying to barge into some evil plot, Harry Potter-style.

  >“He’s working on that machine again. Convinced it will lead us to her killers. I have a terrible premonition that it will and then where will we be?”

  That said, the All-Mother of demons, the High Father of dragons. Coincidence? I wouldn't be sure.

  So, what's going on with the nonexisting visit? Nic indeed hallucinated it? Unsatisfying. Someone modified his perceptions for the duration? No important reason to do so that I could think of. Dizzy and Fanny and Davo are lying? No likely reason for them to cooperate on this that I could think of, let alone so competently. Someone modified memories of Dizzy and Fanny and Davo? For what reason? Arcanum poisoning causes overlap with alternate timelines? Now that's unlikely.

  Fine, what did it *accomplish*? Simole was the one who handed him the pen in the other version of events, and that version didn't have Fanny and Davo visiting him. I don't see a useful angle here.

  Nic decided that Delzina cared about him enough to visit him. Was it was done so he would seek her help with infiltrating the library? It still seems pretty inconsequential. Alternatively, was Fanny-and-Davo-did-it version of events fabricated to make Nic believe Dizzy didn't care for him as much?

  If latter, it could've been arranged by Dizzy herself. If former, some yet-unnamed precog would be the only one with the motivation.

    Regarding the nonexistent visit, I guess the natural question to ask is whether Dizzy herself has the abilities to fabricate Fanny and Davo's memories. And if she did, why not Nic's?

    A related fact that might answer the last question is this tidbit from Chapter Nineteen:

    >“...The other thing such a large dose of Arcanum does to a person, apart from killing them, is shield them from prying eyes. There’s no way to look inside Nic’s head to see if it’s really him. Or if he’s alone in there.”
    >
    >“You can do that?” asked Fanny, blushing hard. “You can look inside people’s heads? Can you read their thoughts?”
    >
    >“No,” said Simole. “I’m not a carnival sideshow. But I can sense presences. People tend to have a specific… feel to them. I’m not sure how to explain it.”

    Admittedly not much has been established about the mechanics of Arcanum yet. If it *is* possible to alter people's memories, then presumably the skill would be related to the one Simole is describing above. It also stands to reason that the Arcanum in Nic's body would have prevented attempts to edit his memories. Perhaps the person who was changing people's recollections wasn't aware of this fact. If it *was* Dizzy, then her surprise at Nic's recollection might have been genuine. Even if she was able to play it off convincingly this chapter, we know that Nic isn't good at reading people. He might not be a reliable narrator for that matter, with all the people poking in his head.

    To be honest, I find it unlikely that Dizzy has the skills to alter memories. I think it's more likely that Simole is the source of the anomaly, even if her motives are unclear. Maybe Nic *was* hallucinating Dizzy, and Simole stumbled upon the scene when she tried sensing Nic's mind?
    ```

      Good point about Arcanum shielding.

      No, whoever did it must definitely have planned for Nic remembering everything: Fanny and Davo's version of events includes him "rambling like a loon", which would convince him he hallucinated everything but which is unnecessary if his memories were supposed to be edited as well.

      Whether or not Dizzy has the skills personally matters little: she has her father's resources to call on if absolutely necessary, and albeit she firmly subscribes to "the only power we have is the power we take for ourselves", it doesn't mean she can't use henchmen or call in personal favors. She could've gone as far as arranging her *own* memories to be edited, to sell the act.

      >Maybe Nic was hallucinating Dizzy, and Simole stumbled upon the scene when she tried sensing Nic's mind?

      Interesting idea. Yes, maybe.

    Possibly Simone did visit him, but not in a physical form.

  He literally cannot stay out of trouble to save his life. 

  Trip to the library: Pseudo!Quirrel is there.

  Trip to the Pagoda: arch mage of the fucking country that just broke out of prison is there.

  I shudder to think what going to the cafeteria will entail.

  I am really enjoying this story. I can't wait to learn more about the world and see where the characters go.

  Hmmm the pace of progression in the story seems a bit to high... also everything in this chapter is sooo dramatic. I really hope the story will slow down a bit again and goes back to the world building and his school life.Right now it feels very rushed, one plot after the other.

  And i feel like theres a huge amount of missed potential in this chapter : so Nic talked to the Minister and tells him about the doorway (wish we can be sure he knows exactly what he means) , now why would Simoles father then turn up at night and ask about her body etc.? first of it would be quite rational to assume that the minister and the former archmage know each other quite well as both of them are probably 2 of the most powerful man in the kingdom, and that the minister knows exactly why simoles father betrayed the kingdom and wanted to erase all magic (after all its actually his job to know such things) . So heres a guess wouldnt it be thus very rational to assume that the minister after talking to nic would guess that simole is probably still alive and secure her body and then rush of to talk to simoles father? after all he should for one know that simoles father is not truly powerless and bound in prison, and secondly think about it 2 of the most powerful man both basically in the same position trying to protect the kingdom or humanity from the darkness, most likely having a past of encounters with each other interwined with interesting events of the past that chaped the country, both of them having strong and independent daughters etc.  First of it would have made absolutly sense for him to talk to simoles father thus not only slowing down the pace of the story , but also giving us a huge chance of seeing more of the character of both of them while they interact with each other, even giving a huge chance of hinting at events in the past adding to the worldbuilding. Right now both the minister and the archmage seem to be very 2 dimensional , and I would have loved to see them react and talk about this, and about their daughters...  also ensuring simoles father that her body is safe, would have given the whole story time and room to breath and would have lead to a less rushed version of nics story. Not to mention the whole plot is now centered around nic, which feels a bit like lazy writing.

  Amazing chapter.

  My favorite part is the new professor talking about the reactions of soldiers on the subject of war crimes and rape... and Nic immediately applies the lessons to Ransom.

  Prediction: the Minister of Instruction routinely implants suggestions into the minds of those he is close with. When Dizzy came of age, he did everything in his power to make her strong, smart, and independent -- she has been influenced by Arcanum for a decade (and the more time she spends with Nic, the more she'll become the woman he loves.)

    Then Dizzy applies it in practice, by "assassinating" the charismatic leader in the form of Third Duke's heir with a bucket, which quickly dissipates the bullying attempt or whatever it was supposed to be. Noticed?

      That scene is what convinced me that she's under a suggestion because she's been acting in a very protective way that she hadn't before. It was reminiscent of Simone's tactic with the other bullies though, saying "this guy needs sick bay" after hitting them really hard.
