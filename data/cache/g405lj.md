## Help finding a specific RatFic with mind control and sex?

### Post:

So, I know this is a weird request, but I was at a Rationalist meetup many months back, and somebody mentioned a RatFic with mind control and sex.

I can't remember more than that, and thanks to the lockdown I can't talk to the person and ask them what its title was again. Does this immediately bring any stories to mind for anyone?

  Might be [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid) 

  In future, please ask in a monday request and recommendation thread.

  Is there a game overlay and a girl named Starry Starr?

  There's the [Romance in Rational Fiction](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/valentinesromance) threads. If it's rational fiction to do with sex, then it probably was recommended there at least once.

  If you are wondering why there isn't a thread for 2020, I don't think we did one this year. I think everyone forgot about it....
