## Unordinary LitRPG

### Post:

 

Hello!

I posted this on r/LitRPG and I figured... why not post it here too? It's got some crossover with this sub's usual topics, I think.

I’m  a bit of a fan of the LitRPG genre. It’s a strange but new sub-genre,  and one that I think deserves to be explored a great deal more. I’ve  been reading my way through all of the ‘classics’ (insofar as we have  those) and I’ve noticed a trend.

One  of the things I really like about LitRPGs are the mechanics. They’re  this clear and obvious system of progression that... well, that I like.  Worlds with magic in them, or strange technologies, have always  fascinated me.

Star Wars has the  Force, Brandon Sanderson’s books had all sorts of clearly defined magic  systems, and games have their own mechanics to learn and play with.

LitRPGs take what would be a single element in another story and make them the focal point.

I  guess you could say it’s like someone who discovers that they like  stories with romance in them stumbling upon the romance genre. Suddenly  the tropes and themes that were always just secondary become the core of  a story.

Which is why I’m a bit disappointed in the lack of variety.

It  feels like most LitRPGs I look at have the exact same system as the  next. I’m generalizing, of course, and there are plenty that twist and  turn the familiar system until it’s something new, but I find that a lot  of stories have the same familiar ‘system.’

Hell, I’m guilty of that myself. My first LitRPG (some mess of a story called *Cinnamon Bun*) has a pretty typical system in it, with large parts cribbed from the likes of *Azarinth Healer*. (Sorry Rhaegar-sempai!)

When  I do stumble upon a well-executed and well thought-out system that’s  different to anything else I’ve encountered I always get really excited.  It brings up so many new questions, and I’m eager to explore the  system, to see how it works and how it can be broken with a bit of  creativity.

That does mean that sometimes I find new systems that are absolutely *awful* too.

So... yeah, I guess the point of this rambling mess is to ask what you guys think.

* Do you prefer new systems, or the same ones you’ve seen before?
* How different can a system be before it’s no longer a LitRPG at all?
* Are there pros and cons to being different?

I’m  not looking for recs, by the way, just discussion because it’s Saturday  and I’m stuck doing editing and literally anything is better than  editing.

  One thing I really like about Worth the Candle is that the system is completely unique and thematically significant. In general I like novel solutions to/optimizations of systems, and while I'm more likely to find those in stories with unique systems, a story with a unique take on a well-known system can be just as interesting.
  ```

  - u/Amonwilde:
    ```
    I also like that in Worth the Candle the main character is a connoisseur of systems, and the system is clearly a bit jank in parts. I do tend to like when the system has some rough parts, as long as that's acknowledged.

    Something I also like is metasystem, or the system acknowledging the system itself. (Can you tell I'm a Lisp programmer?) A story I've enjoyed, though it's hardly the most polished, is Paragamer, in which the main character makes great use of cheesable game mechanics such as free camera, volume, and "in-game" music. The more he cheeses the system, the more levels of specific game-related skills he gets. Delve has done this to some extent with the modification of the system interface. Erogamer probably has a little too much of this, in that the system is a little too flexible and powerful, to the extent that the system precedes reality, which forestalls munchkinry except insofar as the system indulges the main character.

      >  the system is clearly a bit jank in parts.

      [negligible spoilers]

      The magic in Worth the Candle has canonically *always* been janky, and it requires periodic hotfixes in the form of "Exclusions".  For example, they discovered nukes...and then they got excluded to one location, so everywhere else is fission-free.  Same with dozens of other technologies, magics, etc.
      ```

- u/groon_the_walker:
  ```
  One of the things I learned by writing [Erogamer](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/) (tagline: the porn quest with way more depth than you expected) is that the LitRPG system I liked from Ryuugi's *The Games We Play*... is actually way more cumbersome to run in a quest than I would have liked.  You have to keep track of X% progress in everything.  LitRPG should be different for quests, and maybe should just be different period, especially if the QM doesn't like doing lots of bookwork.  *Delve* does bookwork great, so nobody else should have to do it, just *Delve*.

  If I was doing Erogamer over again from scratch, I would have all skills work the same way stats do---leveling when somebody performs a significant feat with the skill, or pushing it further than before.  In other words, all skills would work the same way as the Title Skill mechanic I introduced for *Tease Mistress* only near the story's endpoint.

  I wouldn't have perk points and stat points awarded for LVLing.  Instead, there'd be gold, silver, and bronze coins, and a Shop.  Coins would expire after a certain time, which would incentivize the character to actually spend those coins.  This would also allow late-game goodies to be introduced later, without incentivizing the character to save up all their coins for late-game goodies.

  With coins as a reward for completing quests, and skills that advance for story-significant feats instead of by grinding, and no more stat points or perk points, there might not need to be any such thing as XP and LVL.  Quests could just award coins.

  Some of these are features that I've noticed in more recent webnovels, and contrast to the way that LitRPG worked in *The Games We Play* or in D&D-derived works before then.

  So I think my message is "The state of the art in LitRPG is still advancing and people shouldn't be afraid to play with it."

    Are there any other stories similar to yours you'd recommend? I quite enjoyed Erogamer! (and still hoping for some epilogue of sorts)

  ```
  >Do you prefer new systems, or the same ones you’ve seen before?

  >Are there pros and cons to being different?

  I'm going to roll these together, because the pros and cons are what would determine my answer to the first question.

  A good story involves exploration of themes.  If, like u/JusticeBeak said, the system has thematic significance, then you can use the system to explore some really cool ideas.  So, if the uniqueness of the system is for a purpose (beyond "I want to build a new system!"), then that's a really cool way to add layers to your story.

  On the other hand, if there isn't that resonance between the story and the system, then going too deep into the mechanisms etc. of the system just grinds the story to a halt.  So, if that's the case, then either a familiar system or a dead simple one is best, so that you don't have to spend much time explaining it and distracting from the thrust of the story.

  >How different can a system be before it’s no longer a LitRPG at all?

  I've played in several pen-and-paper RPG systems: GURPS (d6-based), Härn (d100-based), Pathfinder (d20-based), and even more freeform gaming, and they all work very differently.   I've also played single-player RPG computer games and MMOs, which are different again from both each other, and from the pen-and-paper variants.

  And I think that any system that I've played, online or off, would make for a story that was recognizably a LitRPG, if you threw a character into it with awareness of the system. Okay, not the freeform ones (although "attacks only land if the defending player agrees they do" would make for an interesting story, in itself), but all of the others certainly would.

  I would say that LitRPG is really more about the style of writing than about the system.  You could probably write a LitRPG that took place in the real world, where "advancement" happened through grades at school, performance reviews at work, improvement in your skill at [insert leisure activity], popularity within social group etc., just by quantifying those things and using those quantities, rather than any subjective qualities, to define growth as a character.  Heck, some self-help techniques even encourage this kind of gamification of real life (see: step counters).

  So, I would say that there probably isn't a limit on what systems will work for LitRPG, as long as the system can be presented in a LitRPG style.

    This sounds like the Looney Toons model of gravity; you're only in danger once you realize you're supposed to be.

    I think you've got some great points. There's actually a clever story by the name of [Capo: Rise of a Gang Lord](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31963/capo-rise-of-a-gang-lord) that just started book two: it's a Grand Theft Auto-ish LitRPG, but cash money is the only metric for advancement in levels and skills. Did you make money doing it? You get better. Do you want a better class? Better have that cash.

    It's far outside of what you'd expect if I said "LitRPG", but it is still very recognizable and is a lot of fun to read.

      I haven't read it. It says: book 1 complete at 516 pages, book 2 on the way.
      ```

      - u/MimicSquid:

        The author just started releasing book 2. I'll ping him on the fact that the front page needs updating. :D
        ```

      - u/MimicSquid:
        ```
        I recommend it. In my opinion it's quite well done, and treads a different path from most LitRPG's, though you can feel the GTA influence really strongly in book 1. If you like the games, you'll like the story.
        ```

    - u/lysogeny99999:
      ```
      In addition to changing how experience is gained (which is really cool), I also like the "Street Cred" stat. I think stats that depart from the standard straight forward physical/mental/magic stats have a lot of untapped potential.

  - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
    ```
    >  just by quantifying those things and using those quantities, rather than any subjective qualities, to define growth as a character. 

    To qualify as a litRPG I would expect that quantification to have some mechanical effect. Skills might be oddly broad, if you lean Computer V by only using Windows you're as good on Linux as someone who got Computer V on Linux.

    Or maybe you unlock points based on your overall term score, so that A in maths earns you points that could be spent on improving your football instead of maths. Can you balance short term needs (next year's math class is harder) with long term needs (you need a lot of social skills to achieve your dream of becoming mayor)

  Did a double take at this part and had to scroll back up to check your username.

  Fancy seeing you here Mr Raven! hahahah

  &#x200B;

  Tbh the systems tend to be more of an afterthought to me. Doesn't really matter if the systems themselves are that unique or well worn, but rather how they're used/what they're used for. What I focus on is always the characters and character interactions, or how the setting at large changes, that's what always makes or breaks a story in my eyes.

  Obviously, seeing the characters heading towards unusual paths tends to be quite hooking as well, or anything that fundamentally shakes the world and such.

  Like, I'm not a fan of the ol' formula of *"haha MC punch baddies. Is strongest there is. Much OP"*; but I really enjoy the formula of *"MC & friends shake the very foundations of society and the world. Nothing will ever be the same"*, y'know?

  [Abiogenesis](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/33378/i-became-a-biologist-in-a-fantasy-world/chapter/511524/abiogenesis) is a pretty good example of this, if you're interested.

  There was another pretty decent one I haven't read in forever that had an interesting system, good characters and interactions, but can't quite recall the name of. It was about a guy who got isekai'd and became an affliction specialist, got a colony of eldritch flesh eating worms which he named Bob as a familiar, and helped heal people at a doctor's clinic. Would be appreciated if someone could remind me the name if they know it

    Hi <3

    I think the story you're thinking of is He Who Fights With Monsters.

    The story has a very neat system to it, though I dislike the main character and after catching up I never kept up with it.

    I enjoy stories that weave the system into the story, as a source of conflict or an adversary. Just tacking it on feels kind of cheap now.
    ```

    - u/Gooey-:
      ```
      Ahh, I see!
      In that case, 2 examples of such systems come to mind, both of which are wildly different stories compared to one another.

       Worth The Candle, which I'm sure you've heard by now the folk here really enjoy (it's p good ngl) has a system that, without delving too much into spoilers, sorta has a will of its own, and actively fights against people trying to get too OP. 

      The other one is Solo Leveling, which is more along the lines of a cliche wish fulfillment OP protagonist (I do have to say, however, that while the writing is mediocre, the art and monster designs are absolutely incredible). Although I dropped this one a while ago (I can only read people reacting dramatically and crying out in shock every time the protagonist moves a finger for so long before it gets really fucking old), as far as I remember, the system was implied to have an agenda of its own, one that didn't bode too well for the MC.

    [He Who Fights With Monsters](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26294/he-who-fights-with-monsters) by Shirtaloon

    It started out pretty good, but the author has really doubled down on the MC being edgy for no reason lately. Like, at first it was a tactic used to throw his opponents off and get people interested in him because he was crazy/eccentric (depending on which side they fell on) but lately it's like the guy just decided to be ~zany~. It's like the MC is crying out for attention, except that people are already paying attention to him because he's important.

    It suck because there was some genuine character growth, but then that all fell away and it's like the MC goes from 30 to 13 whenever someone says "hey, what's up?"

  Apocalypse: Generic System has a nicely minimalist system, a stat each for body, mind and magic, people can get a single simple yet open ended skill with their class such as set trigger, raise dead, heal or so on. Beyond that it's all practice and ingenuity. It really helps it work as a support for the characters and story rather than as a focus or crutch.

  Street Cultivation calls itself "a modern wuxia/litrpg hybrid" but that doesn't really sum it up. The litrpg aspect comes in with how standardized and numeric modern cultivation assessment has become but it's purely descriptive rather than prescriptive so I don't think it really fits with the rest.

  I like both of those because they aren't an excuse for oversimplification like most litrpg systems are.

  I do think you're a bit unfair to Cinnamon Bun, it's system is definitely generic but I'd hardly call it a mess.
  ```

- u/lysogeny99999:
  ```
  I am really hoping that litRPG starts to experiment and branch out in the future. In addition to what has already been mentioned, 99% of litRPG protagonists start at LVL 1. Exploring the system with them and determining their build can be a lot of fun, but it restricts variety quite a bit. 

  Could a heist story where the team recruits our LVL 30 \[Wardbreaker\] protagonist be interesting? I think so. Or a high level \[Detective\] whose build is outdated compared to his younger \[Divination Mage\] collogues. I'm excited to see where the genre goes. Also as a side note I really liked cinnamon bun, although I think the story's "System" was probably one of the weakest parts of the story. I'd love to see something more experimental.
  ```

  - u/RavensDagger:
    ```
    Yeah, Cinnamon Bun's system is a bit... vanilla. It was never the focus of the story, really.

    I've been trying some new things with Stray Cat Strut (A literal pay-to-win system) and Fluff (a morality system pushed to its extreme) and I think if I continue to write new LitRPGs, I'll be doing so while trying new ways to explore the mechanical aspects of the genre.
    ```

- u/GlimmervoidG:
  ```
  I think I definitely like unusual systems and, generally, I like those that emphasise skills rather than stats. Stats are just arbitrary numbers. Skills you can see being used and you can have all sorts of interesting synergies. 

  Two examples of good systems - 

  Wake of the Ravager by Macronomicon 

  People undergo 'breaks' when they are near large amounts of warp. Warp is released by things dying, so you can get your first break from the slaughter of some animals, but subsequent breaks require more death like large battlefields.

  While undergoing a break, you can learn skills. Skills can be magical (like duplimancy - the ability to duplicate things) or just enchantments of normal likes like (like sneak - the art of, um, sneaking). Once skills level up, you get perks or mutations that let the skills do new and interesting things. There are also stats but they're less important.

  This story is all about the main character maximising the synergy in his skills to do broken things.

  The Sins of Cinnamon by Questingdragon

  This story makes stats at least somewhat interesting. They're tied to classes. Each class gives you a number of stats, though they can be weird things Truth or Seduction not just Strength and Constitution. This story has a really interesting idea with class evolution, with branching classes, which open up new stats and new skills. This story is rather NSFW by the way.

  > Do you prefer new systems, or the same ones you’ve seen before

  I'm highly flexible but I do want my systems to get the basics right. It should have verisimilitude for someone whose played RPGs.

  As a rule of thumb that means three things: No defeating people too many levels ahead of you. Trade offs are everywhere, nobody is good at everything. A well planned build is the key to success, characters who wing it will hit their limits.

  In other words. Do what Delve does.

  (Intently that second one is why I think mixing cultivation and litRPG is a bad idea. One has a heritage of solo heroes fighting duals, the other has a heritage of synergistic parties. If you mix them something has to give)

  > How different can a system be before it’s no longer a LitRPG at all?

  Very different IMO it's a lot easier to make a bad litRPG system than a system that's not litRPG.

  > Are there pros and cons to being different?

  Uniqueness is good IMO, stuff like Draw of the Unknown is great.

  Same one

  >How different can a system be before it’s no longer a LitRPG at all?

   Litrpg is vague enough genre without sharp boundaries, but I'd say the common part is the power is adequately represented by numbers and gained (directly or indirectly) mostly from experience.

  >Are there pros and cons to being different?

  Pro: Obvious. Readers generally like fresh settings.

  Cons: Author need much more expositions and infodumps.  More easy for author to miss inconsistencies in the text. Some readers would disagree with author what constitute inconsistency.  Some readers will be repulsed by new settings for whatever reason.

    I’m curious, by these standards, would Worm be considered a litRPG fic? It has names for qualities of power and numbers for their quantity, and during the course of the story the MC gains knowledge of the system and thus how to exploit it for maximum utility.

      > , would Worm be considered a litRPG

      Nop

      > It has names for qualities of power and numbers for their quantity

      It's explicitly  shown in Worm that number don't *represent* power. It's just estimation of combat aspect of power done by PRT.
      I mean here *represent* in mathematical, not metaphorical sense. There should be unambiguous function from power to number, not dependent on human understanding, and number put hard limits on power.

       > gains knowledge of the system and thus how to exploit it for maximum utility.

      Experience don't universally translate to power increase. Most of para stagnate despite experience accumulation and for most of para biggest part of their power is hereditary, not gained step by step.
      ```

      - u/DuplexFields:
        ```
        That number=power is about as narratively unsatisfying to me as always meeting the murderer during the first post-open segment of a police procedural (NCIS, I’m looking at you.)

        In Worm, Taylor’s power ratings should be increasing every time she figures out a new use of her powers, as a consequence and not as a cause. Talking through her swarm? Stranger 1. Multiple swarm-silhouettes while she’s hiding inside one? Stranger 3. Parahumans stagnate because they rely on their basic understanding of their own powers; she boosts the stats of the Chicago Wards just by teaching them tactical thinking.

        Anyway, thanks for helping me figure out I’m not interested in by-the-numbers litRPGs.

  ```
  * Do you prefer new systems, or the same ones you’ve seen before?

  New, definitely new. A lot, probably even most, LitRPG is trash and will be considered unreadable in a decade. I think the genre is very new and needs improvement and some of that improvement may be in the form of new systems.

  * How different can a system be before it’s no longer a LitRPG at all?

  Fairly different, I think. Does The Wandering Inn count as LitRPG? (Yes, it does!) It barely uses levels or RPG mechanics, except when it does. One of my favorite aspects of TWI is that leveling is optional and leveling carries an opportunity cost, e.g leveling as a mage closes you off from non-mage-like thinking and ways of acting. (The entire Ryoka storyline hints at this basically.)  I think the entire reason there is so little innovation in-universe before the Earthers arrive \_because\_ leveling forces you entire very narrow fields of focus and narrow strengths are antithetical to innovation. 

  Also consider that you can have systems without it being a LitRPG. Orconomics features a DnD-esque world, classic fantasy races, adventuring, loot, etc and yet is \_not\_ a LitRPG. And this is fine, it's a great story without needing RPG-logic included.
