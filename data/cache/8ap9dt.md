  Predictions, under spoilers as requested:

  * [Microwave](#s " Goku and Bulma did not bring the Dragon Balls to the castle. Bulma built some kind of an electromagnetic shield to conceal their presence on radars, then hid them somewhere in the wilderness.")

   [Microwave](#s " On second thoughts, they may have *one* Dragon Ball on hand, in a capsule, to take advantage of the radars' low resolution and make Pilaf's faction think they brought all five. Smart.")

  * [Handshake](#s " Bulma asked to shake Pilaf's hand to shoulder-surf his passwords.")

    [Microwave](#s "I'm assuming she used the microwaves' emitters to create fake dragonball signatures while using the shielding to hide the real dragonballs.")
    ```

  ```
  Chapter 4 is up! Note: in this one we start going a bit into the endgame of this arc, which means you could start piecing together more of what's going on than is said explicitly. If you do, please write any guesses in spoiler tags. Thanks!

  I was honestly worried about how a Pilaf in a rationalist fiction would work but you managed to make them more competent and still hilarious.

    One thing:

    [Clarification](#s "Shu does not have the passwords written on his hand. Only Pilaf does. I was worried about this coming through as confusing, but when Pilaf says it, he uses the royal *we* he keeps using throughout his conversations. It's just him, Shu isn't that stupid and that's why he's horrified at hearing it, he's an engineer who's taking care of the system so of course he thinks that's a horrible practice, he just doesn't want to say it to Pilaf's face.")
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  [Prediction 1 80%](#s " Team Pilaf will get locked out of the castle.")

  [Prediction 2 60%](#s " Bulma will take the castle over and/or make it unusable. With the password.")

  [Prediction 3 20%](#s " Bulma will trick Pilaf in wording his wish wrong.")

  [Conditional Prediction](#s " If Bulma can spoof the DB signals, she will get the other ball and make it look like the ball didn't change location. Also she will but a fake signal into a drone and send it into a different direction.")

  [Just complaining](#s " Bulma shouldn't be able to fake the radar signal. The first thing she would do is hiding the dragon balls. Which would be easy. Just feed them a dog. Of course a faraday cage would be better, like the ones microwave ovens have just for a different frequenzy.")

  [serious complains about chapter 3](#s " Goku shouldn't have killed the Rabbit Boss. Just deal with him like in the serie. His prediction is also flawed, since the staff can stay extended without thought. It is quite out of character for the anime Goku AND this Goku. I think that should only show us Goku will do some immoral stuff in the future and is a different character than in the anime. Which would be okay, but his actions are stupid in this case. And this Goku should be a little smarter.")
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    [About this chapter's complaints](#s "Not going to say anything until a few chapters from now when all is going to be made clear, but I'm not sure why that would be. We don't know the frequency of the DB signals, she doesn't necessarily know eating it will mask the signal - in the show it's said when the Pilaf gang masks the signal during the Red Ribbon arc, but then, it's unclear how instead they can detect them just fine when they're, like, in an underground submarine cave or something. There's no consistency. Personally I'm going with my own idea for what kind of signal it is, and how the radar works, but it's not going to be able to reconcile everything from the original, so you must assume that a bit of retconning here or there is necessary anyway. Also consider that this is a universe with no conservation of mass-energy, that was said as a throwaway line in Chapter 1 but it's painfully obvious from *anything* that happens in it, to begin with capsules, going on with fighters able to store in their body enough energy to annihilate multiple planets without undergoing gravitational collapse, so electromagnetism probably doesn't work exactly the way it does in our world. My handwavey explanation at the moment is that there are additional quantum fields that are coupled with the ones we know about in ways that allow transformations that do not conserve mass or energy.")

    [Clarification about chapter 3](#s "As he says later, he knows there were other solutions, but at some level, he *wanted* to pick that one. The problem is that his original fall made him smarter by virtue of Zenkai power but what it did NOT do, unlike the original, is erase his destructive Saiyan instincts/preprogramming. So when he's really pushed to the limit, or under extreme stress conditions, he tends to fall back to a much more animalistic and violent kind of behaviour.")
