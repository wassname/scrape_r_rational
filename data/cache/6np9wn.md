  Hmm.  If they act as Maxwell's demon to purify the two sides further, that could very well start a war in its disruption of the status quo.  I can't imagine the protagonists would willingly leave others like them.

    Agreed. If their goal is to free all the humans on the plantations, that wrecks the whole terms of the truce because it leaves the demons without any humans to eat.

      And if they leave the world entirely, they're going to draw a heck of a lot of attention to the fact that it's possible *and* give the demons a motive to figure out how to lead a war party across.

      I can't see a way this doesn't end badly for at least one side (demons, captive humans, free humans). If nothing else, a significant portion of the free humans will probably be totally okay with returning the captives in order to prevent war.
