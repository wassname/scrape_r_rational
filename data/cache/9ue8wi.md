## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  Suppose quantum immortality is true. Does this make buying lottery tickets a good form of alternative-self care, in your opinionÂ¿
  ```

  - u/causalchain:

    Short answer: no.

    Every action you take is to maximise the probabilistic benefit to all of your future selves, and winning a lottery will only benefit a vanishingly small proportion of your future selves, while costing all of the others. The net effect is still negative. In general, considerations based on quantum immortality should produce the same results as classical probability theory. The only difference is if you pre-commit to killing yourself in unfavorable situations, with the confidence that other versions of yourself will succeed.

  Sorry, does anyone remember that short story about a guy who could send himself data from the future? IIRC >!he received a file of the perfect movie by searching the whole possibility space at once and became a star director, and (even bigger spoiler) the story ended with him fucking over past!Himself because he'd explored a path that induced paranoia.!<
