## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  [Shadowrun 5e, notable setting divergences. Tl;dr: You have intelligence beyond the limit of normal humanity, and limited precognition. How do you break out of your illusory world or stop the spread of the Necronomicon in the cyberpunk future?]

  Your alias is Redline, and you are thirty years old. Long ago, you were seized by the unshakeable sense that your three-layered world - Matrix, Meatspace, and the Astral Plane - was entirely fake. Drawing on the teachings of Gnosticism, your terminal value is to discover the true nature of reality, and break out of the illusory imitation you find yourself surrounded by. For the past 8 years, you have been running the shadows, performing deniable criminal activities for the megacorporations and other powers that be, ever since the fateful car crash that took your left arm and promising career as a concert pianist. Until recently, this was in order to pursue illegal cognitive augmentations, hone your skills, and to seek the one secret that could finally allow you to make sense of everything.


  Two years ago, London fell to madness, and the rest of the UK shortly followed. The entire island was cut off from the outside world, all access prohibited by order of the Corporate Court. Two of your occasional colleagues, a rigger and a pixie, made it out before the interdiction was fully enforced, and they claim to have previously worked with the person responsible, an anarchist elf adept that the rigger speculated was not entirely of this world.  

  Supposedly, a Deep Run into the foundations of the Matrix went horribly wrong. Everyone survived, but in the process the elf made a bargain with a simulated elder god. They woke up with a physical copy of Al Azif beside them, an apparently impossible occurrence. By all accounts, this tome insidiously corrupts all of its readers. For a short period, this was limited to the elf, the pixie, and a dragon the elf offered the tome to on a whim. Then the elf died, revealing they had set up a dead man's switch to send a digital copy of the book to everyone in range. 

  By now, it has become clear that the containment has failed. The Black Lodge, the most powerful secret society in Europe, has already been completely compromised. On your previous mission, you discovered the tome had spread to the Seelie Court, a metaplane subject to accelerated time and with hidden portals across the globe. 

  Your team is split between going down fighting, or fleeing somewhere the corruption will be unable to follow. You are currently gazing out onto the Berlin sprawl from the cramped confines of the coffin motel room, pondering your next move. 


  You have a newly installed, custom-designed cybernetic left arm, illegally overclocked for precision and power. Hidden behind its armour is a prototype cyberdeck, a reward for hacking the e-ghost of the dragon ex-president of the UCAS. These alone make you a formidable opponent in the Meat and the Matrix, even without all the other gear and gadgets waiting in the smuggling compartments of your tankcycle, thirty stories below. 

  In addition, you are a mystic adept, capable of channeling mana into spells and into your body. You have focused on enhancement and are currently affected by almost a dozen permanent spells. Through a combination of this magic, nanotechnology, genetic optimisation, and tailored nootropics, your logical abilities are at the limit of what is possible for anything but an AI or a dragon. You can even outsmart most of those. 

  Lastly, you have discovered that, by performing an hour-long ritual and crushing 8 magic 8-balls in your metal fist, you can achieve limited glimpses of the future. It seems to be affected by what resembles the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics: vague questions covering a month into the future receive mostly helpful, unambiguous responses, while very specific queries or those relating to the immediate future are cryptic and barely better than chance at the best of times. 

  What do you do?

  You've discovered a genie and wished for reality-warping powers. Unfortunately, in typical genie fashion, it has twisted your wish, and your powers are now limited to fictional realities. You now have complete control over the canon of every fictional universe.

  This control is not retroactive, so you can't significantly change real-world history through changes to influential books, but the physical books, and any other record of the stories involved, will be altered to match. How do you best take advantage of this power under the following two scenarios?

  **A:** The "any other record" stipulation includes everyone's memories. No one notices the change, but if a historically significant work is changed, this does cause some confusion when people notice that the rest of history doesn't seem to line up.

  **B:** The aforementioned stipulation does *not* include anyone's memories. People *do* notice the changes, but most chalk them up to faulty memories, because all records point to the new canon, including hard-copy ones. A few people count the changes as more proof of the "Mandela effect", but generally aren't taken seriously.

    Jesus, Mohammed, various Jewish Prophets, Zoroaster, Confucius, Laozi, Buddha, the Saptarishi, etc. now advocate a system of values much more closely aligned with my own. 

    More aggressively, since real-world history is not altered, I can use this to trivially modify consumer demand for certain products, and, by seizing control of supply before exercising my ability, become fabulously wealthy. Suddenly, all the aforementioned figures, along with Harry Potter, Luke Skywalker, Batman, etc. yearn for the possession of, IDK, rocks from a very particular quarry that happens to be in my possession. Hell, make it a holy site, and me its rightful heir, and also there's a very strong taboo against counterfeiting these rocks or taking any actions to harm those who own the land. 

    Then I can sell/donate the rocks for immense profit (rinse and repeat for any similar good).
    ```

    - u/Nulono:
      ```
      The first idea is more or less what came to my mind, though you'd have to be careful in Scenario B, since the "Mandela effect" crowd might interpret the changes as trickery from Satan, which could just end up sparking yet more religious sectarianism.

      The second idea is genius, though you might want to diversify the goods and run the businesses through a number of shell companies to obfuscate things. If you make it too blatant, you could end up with accusations of paying off various authors to advertise your product.
      ```

      - u/phylogenik:
        ```
        I think maybe if you were subtle about it and didn't change anything too strongly at once in the first case, people would write off historical inconsistencies as motivated thinking/hypocrisy, and the semi-universal nature of the changes would potentially help there (if all these great figures agree on some important truth, then surely it must hold some merit!)

        In the second case, "inorganic" advertising/product placement might be tricky/suspicious, but I think if it's sufficiently un-commercial I could still make a killing -- e.g. buy up the art of some old, dead, obscure painter, and change fictional works to extol their immense skill and revolutionary ability. Then, after revealing that I've miraculously found a hidden collection of their paintings I can sell them off for some obscene amount of money. If art is more about signaling than "objective" quality it shouldn't be too suspicious, compared to Jesus loving the refreshing taste of Pepsi or whatever.

        Since the power is limited to fictional realities, it must have some way to distinguish fiction from non-fiction, right? If I write a non-fiction book, and then introduce a detail about some unknown event or principle, does the book become classified (according to the power) as fiction if that detail does not correspond to (nonfictional) reality? If so, I feel I could use this as a way to divine hidden truths, e.g. by writing two books consisting of:

        "The sky is blue. P = NP. My hair is brown."

        and

        "The sky is blue. P =/= NP. My hair is brown."

        Since my hair really is brown and the sky really is blue, I can try to alter the propositions relating to color in each book, and thereby see  whether P=NP by virtue of which book's canon I can manipulate.
        ```

        - u/Nulono:
          ```
          The fiction/nonfiction dichotomy is based on the intentions of the author, not a direct comparison to the real world. If a speculative science fiction story happens to get the future right, it doesn't become nonfiction. So both of your examples would end up classified as "fiction", since both "P = NP" and "P â‰  NP" came from your imagination, not your knowledge.
          ```

          - u/phylogenik:
            ```
            Hmm, in that case it could potentially be used to enforce truth-telling and read minds in e.g. contract negotiation, or hostage/ransom notes. If contracts can qualify as works for the purposes of this power, you can have all parties write them out and add "The sky is blue and I fully intend to abide by all the terms in this contract" at the end, and then check to see whether you can alter the contracts afterwards.

            Also, changing religious texts might not work in a lot of cases like in my first suggestion, since presumably the authors writing them believed them to be true.
            ```

  - u/vakusdrake:
    ```
    I'm surprised no-one has given the obvious answer of creating a fictional text taking place inside an eternal hypercomputer which is running a FAI that is aware that it exists in a fictional universe. Then most of the story would consist of the FAI monologuing about how you would instantiate it in the actual world or otherwise doing things to pass information to you.         
    Hell while you're at it you could write in that the FAI has knowledge of every single quantum event that happened in your universe's past and gains knowledge of any new quantum events in real time (obviously you can't give it perfect future knowledge because that would require making the real world's quantum events non-random). So the directions would go from general directions on making a FAI to effectively a fairly accurate path to victory.

    Given the stuff about how the story progresses naturally you said to Noumero I can't see any way of realistically getting rid of this exploit, without making it so fictional characters are incapable of knowing that, and without also not allowing the power to generate any new information.

    If I introduce a change at one point in a story, does its future follow from my premise or do only my manual changes take effect? If the former, I can conjure an AGI to break into reality. (Conjuring genies wouldn't work, but one needs no magic to influence our world through what's written in a record of their world.)

    What happens if I alter a book to become longer? Do the copies gain mass?

    What counts as fictional universes? Can I edit all copies of an image, video, computer program or even change every 10011011 byte in the world's digital memories to a 11011011?
    ```

    Hold up, before any of these other questions: you made a wish and the genie twisted it? Why then, would you continue to use your wish? Don't use that power in any way, because it's likely to also be twisted by the genie.
    ```

- u/Nulono:
  ```
  You now have the ability to accurately measure anything in your direct perception. For example, you can look at something and immediately know how tall it is, or hold something and tell how heavy it is, and so forth. These measurements are guaranteed to a high degree of accuracy, but the precision is limited to the granularity of your natural perception; you can't measure something down to the microgram if you couldn't tell a 1 kg rock from a 1.000000001 kg rock by holding both of them.

  **EDIT:** On a second reading, I don't think I explained the power well enough. The object to be measured and the property to be measured *both* have to be in your direct perception. So to weigh something you'd have to hold it, and to tell what chemicals are in something, you'd need to taste or smell it. The power just puts numbers to what you can already perceive.
  ```

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    Have you tried holding your pillow and bottle, deciding which is heavier and testing it with scales afterwards? It's hard. I'm not sure how this power differs from not having it.

    Can I tell at a glance how many stars I can see, and how far away they are?
    ```
