  StarKid musicals are [sometimes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-77cUxba-aA) [popular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmVuNlu0LCk) here, so I thought I'd link this one to let everyone know it's out (although it is not especially rational, it does deconstruct two genres). Happy New Year!

  “Have you ever thought how existentially terrifying it would be for the world to turn into a musical?”
  ```

  ```
  I watched it forever ago, and yet I still have the songs stuck in my head XD
