## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Does anyone have any recommendations of fics that get you in the autumn/Halloween mood? I'm looking for something semi-serious with touches of comedy.
  ```

  - u/lucidobservor:
    ```
    Have you read [OCTO](https://zalbert.net/octo/)? It's more Lovecraftian than autumn or Halloween, but it think otherwise matches your requirements, and is an _excellent_ story regardless.
    ```

      +1 for OCTO

      Absolutely underappreciated, it's really really good, and solid ratfic to boot.

    A Night in the Lonesome October
    Novel by Roger Zelazny

    All the iconic Halloween monsters go to battle.
    Sounds generic, but it is written by a surprisingly good author.
    ```

    - u/Swimming-Membership5:
      ```
      Zelazny was an incredible author. Hugo and Nebula prize winner, friend of George R. R. Martin (they often edited each others' work). Creator of the post apocalypse car genre (Damnation Alley directly influenced all the Mad Max movies). His Amber Chronicles are a fine read, and his short stories are sublime. The Last Defender of Camelot even became a "new" Twilight Zone episode.

      Many modern authors (Brust and Gaiman I've personally heard gush about him) were inspired by him prior to becoming authors themselves.
      ```

  - u/netstack_:

    Maybe [The Northern Caves](https://archiveofourown.org/works/3659997/chapters/8088522). Really hard to explain without spoilers, beyond the blurb of “a fan community struggles with their author’s bizarre last work.”

    Definitely [All Night Laundry]() if you don’t mind the mspaintadventure format. It’s incredible in art and writing, and at times both hilarious and tense.
    ```

    - u/NTaya:
      ```
      *The Northern Caves* is kinda like "Benedict_SC (author of Cordyceps, Dave Scum, The World As It Appears to Be, ...) writes *House of Leaves*." The mood and subtle r/rational callbacks are right about B_SC's, and the format is, well, not nearly as confusing as HoL, but definitely has its moments. Seconding this one.

      (Couldn't get into *All Night Laundry* but that's more of a me problem.)
      ```

  - u/ThePhrastusBombastus:
    ```
    [The Friendly Necromancer](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-friendly-necromancer.86419/) sounds like it would fit. It's a Pokemon fic with a good deal of original worldbuilding. At times it's quite dark, and at other times it's fluffy. The MC trains ghosts, and is in fact a ghost-type pokemon themselves, so the fic is suitably spooky.
    ```

  It's been recommended here often but I've only recently started reading [Lord of (the) Mysteries](https://www.webnovel.com/book/lord-of-mysteries_11022733006234505) and it's quite good! I would describe it as Isekai Cultivation meets Steampunk Europe meets [SCP](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/). The author and the protagonist are Chinese but the story takes place in a Europe-inspired fantasy world.

  As the name suggests, the protagonist investigates a lot of mysteries which is usually well written. As is common in these stories, the protagonist gets a cheat power (in addition to their knowledge of the modern world), which annoys me slightly, but the author still manages to keep tension and it never feels like it's too easy for the protagonist.

  The English translation that I read is pretty good for the most part, except maybe for a few words that appear too often and don't seem fitting to me (for example, "subconsciously" and "lampoon"). The names of the characters are also often pretty wild which might be a problem of translation because I saw that in the original, the names are transcribed phonetically as Chinese characters, so it's maybe not so easy to transfer them to English. It reminds me of the situation in One Piece where the English translators always have to guess what the English word was that the original author transcribed phonetically into katakana.

  Anyway, I recommend this story!
  ```

  - u/TyeJoKing:
    ```
    I have yet to find a translated webnovel that I can bear to read. The way it's directly translated just makes the prose and structure so alien, even though the grammer and spelling is technically fine.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Sounds like a good incentive to learn Chinese, Japanese, and/or Korean.
      ```

  - u/megazver:
    ```
    *vigorously rubs his glabella*

    Anyway, I've tried reading it but the first dozen chapters were pretty rough, IMO. I'll try again someday because it does sound interesting.

  You've probably seen this one already, but what happens when an average salaryman inexplicably gains all the power and responsibilities that comes from...being able to use the powers of Football Manager (the game) IRL? 

  For those looking for lazy, well-written laid back progression fantasies, give [Player Manager](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/58187/player-manager-a-football-management-progression) a shot. Features very well written, realistic and likable characters.
  ```

  - u/Revlar:
    ```
    It's fun, but has a weird habit of ending every other chapter with a really dramatic declaration that doesn't go anywhere in the next one. That alone makes it read like a prototype. Like the author isn't sure where to stick the big dramatic turning point, so he puts it at the end of the chapter and then goes back on the promise because it might fit better later on.

    Near the current cutoff, the main character's powers start to break suspension of disbelief a little much. Kinda wish it had stuck with the scouting stuff instead of introducing the in game GUI

    There are lots of stories set in the present day, but this one takes it a bit more literally than most: some of his plans get derailed when >!the Queen dies!<.

    ```
    Enjoying it! FYI for those other comment readers, there seems to be a fair amount of non-described sexual encounters that imo detracts from the story. But very keen to see the story progresses

  Hi, I recently got Kindle Unlimited. I read through the Cradle series already. What are some other good books on there? Preferably sci-fi or fantasy.
  ```

  - u/CaseyAshford:
    ```
    I am a big fan of the works of Ilona Andrews. She has an excellent take on urban fantasy in a near-post apocalypse world with the Kate Daniels series. The early books are somewhat similar to the Dresden Files but it later takes on a more epic format. It is also complete which is a pleasant change to all those series that peter out before a satisfying ending.

    The Menocht Loop has four books out and is a lot of fun. Lots of escalation, fun world building, and pretty rational adjacent in terms of characters.
    ```

    - u/YankDownUnder:
      ```
      Disrec for Menocht Loop: the author has no idea how to write male realistic characters, descriptions are vague and contradictory, distances change arbitrarily, the whole thing needs some serious re-editing. The first book is mostly okay but it goes downhill fast.
      ```

      - u/chiruochiba:
        ```
        I agree that the series has some issues. I enjoyed the first three books when they were on Royal Road, but pacing issues made me drop it a short ways into book four. That said, this statement of yours comes across as rather sexist:

        >the author has no idea how to write male realistic characters

        What even is a 'realistic male' to you? The personalities of the main characters could be close to plenty of 'males' in our world, but you deem such people 'unrealistic' because they don't match what you think all men must be? For the record, I found the characters enjoyable to read and better written than those in many professionally published novels. I get the impression you wouldn't have criticized the character writing if the author had been male.

    I just finished a couple month period where I got it for a super cheap price. I didn't renew because it was too hard to find good material. Amazon seems to offer up deals periodically, so I may sign up for a month or two again in a while if there is a specific book I want to read.

    I asked a similar question when my period started and the only answer I got was for Perilous waif.

    It seems to be the first book in series (no sequel yet) and it was....fine. I didn't mind reading it on KU, but I probably wouldnt' have wanted to buy it on it's own.

    Andrew Rowe's fourth Arcane Ascension book just came out. I haven't finished it yet but I enjoyed the first three. I think his entire works are all on KU, although I personally bounced off his other series (even the ones tangentially related to AA)

    If you liked Cradle, maybe you'd like some of Will Wights other series? Although I also bounced off of those way back when I tried them.
    ```

    - u/Dragongeek:
      ```
      *Perilous Waif*

      I swear I've written a review on this somewhere but I can't find it. Regardless:

      Overall, there's a lot I think this book does right, especially when it comes to worldbuilding. Sure, it's not completely seamless, but a lot of authors struggle immensely to make a Suspension-of-disbelief compatible Sci-fi setting *work* without just brushing questions about AI and general transhumanism aside. In fact, it's one of the few books that I can list off the top of my head that truly makes a decent attempt at showing how wild a world with the full transhuman spectrum is and doesn't shy from the topic. Everything from augmented humans to full blown infomorphs, it's all in there. 

      That said, the plot isn't anything groundbreaking and it gets rather mary-sue-y.  The protagonist never really fails hard and most of the conflict is driven by the fact that she grew up on a cultist backwater planet and thus doesn't have a lot of "street smarts". 

      My main issues with the story are that the author's -ehm- proclivities shine through occasionally which is uncomfortable since the author is a middle aged dude and the protagonist is a naive prepubescent girl. It's a dash of "menwritingwomen" with another sprinkle of "age is just a number" and the writing style made me develop the sneaking suspicion that the author writes a lot of fucked up porn (which, as I later found out, he does do on QQ). 

      So, in summary, I found the worldbuilding and general setting brilliant, but the creepy aspects of the story make it something that I hesitate to recommend.
      ```

      - u/chiruochiba:
        ```
        Many of these criticisms (particularly, the mary-sueness and 'proclivities') apply to the author's Daniel Black series as well.
        ```

    - u/Watchful1:
      ```
      > It seems to be the first book in series (no sequel yet)

      There are 6 chapters of the sequel [posted here](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/merciful-troubleshooter.15081/), but read at your own peril since it's been abandoned for over a year now and he seems to be working on other projects instead.
      ```

      - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
        ```
        If it's abandoned then I'd probably change my "eh" rec to a de-rec. It's not good enough to justify reading a likely never to be finished story in my opinion.
        ```

        - u/Watchful1:
          ```
          The author is usually super prolific, he often posts multiple chapters a week of whatever he's working on. But he jumps between projects all the time. I've been waiting on a 5th book in his Danial Black series (which I also recommend) for like 4 years now.

          He also apparently had some illness and didn't post for 9 months. So maybe he'll pick his old series back up. I'm more optimistic about the ones he's selling than his other series I had bookmarked.
          ```

    Someone had a similar request last year, here's [my answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/mfq6cq/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/gtjcclf/?context=3). 

    I'd also like to add [Timberwolf by Dominic Adler](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52693586-timberwolf). The setting is an alternate world version of 1930's Weimar Germany, with diesel punk, magic and warring gods. It's balls to the walls original and dynamic, I highly recommend it. Huge shame it's gotten so little attention. 

    Also check out the Self-Published Fantasy Blog-Off which happens every year. The finalists and winners are usually pretty good and are usually all on KU. I liked Sword of Kaigen and Orconomics, for example. Also, several of the books in the list I linked were SPFBO submissions.
    ```

  - u/LeanLew:
    ```
    The first two books in the Three Body Problem series are on Kindle Unlimited. Quick overview, someone on earth pinged a distant, more technologically advanced alien civilization and they've sent a space fleet towards earth. Humanity has 400 years to solve this problem before they're likely destroyed. It's an interesting read and seems like a good fit for /Rational.

    The first five books in the Murderbot Diaries are also on Kindle Unlimited. They're definitely not rational fiction but I think they're fun little reads. It's actually nice to read something shorter on occasion, most of them are only around 150 pages long.
