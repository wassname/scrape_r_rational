  At last, my obsessive checking of /r/rational has paid off!  /u/cthulhuraejepsen, you know we love you, right? Don't listen to the idiots with poorly formed criticism. :)

    ```
    I certainly echo your sentiment but I want to also acknowledge the fact that the author did just put out four lengthy chapters. Some of the criticism has effected output but the output is still high. I think the choice of delivering these four chapters at once, even with the longer than usual break, was the right choice too.

          Huh. No idea how to help you with that other than maybe giving a little insigt on why some people read your whole story and then seemingly only project a superficial and negative opinion.

          Personally, I'm not good at analyzing a story to explain why exactly I like it. So when a story is very good in general (as yours is) then I often just give some generic praise after reading the last chapter, if even that. Other times I just feel good about having read what I read but immediately move on to the next thing to scratch my itch.

          But when something small is out of place inan otherwise perfect story/chapter it stays with me and I want to share it, either in the hope that I actually help the author improve on and perfect something that in my opinion is worth being as good as possible, or (and I'm not proud of this) to have an easy way to discuss an aspect of this thing I generally enjoy with others. And especially if the imperfection is jarring (something that never happened to me with Worth the Candle) I may become passionate in a negative way.

          But all that is only possible if there is something keeping me interested in the story in question in the first place. A great thing with a (real or perceived) flaw can be much more frustrating that something that isn't worth my time.

          tl:dr ~ Your story is great. Please don't stop.

          I read through that whole thread. Man I'm sorry it's so emotionally draining to write for an on demand audience. I really like your work with wtc, It's become the highlight of my weekly reading. I think the effort you've put in has created something with great thematic integrity. Wtc has even made it onto my re-reading list alongside Dresden files.


          The story just works on a lot of levels and I find my self showing up in these threads every week to make predictions and argue with my co-workers about where the plot is going.


          Next on my rational reading list is likely to be metropolitan man since brodski audiobooked it. I generally don't like Superman as a rule, but I trust your ability as a writer and want to hear the story you tell.

            Metropolitan Man is one of the best and, more importantly, the single most accessible piece of rational fiction. It's something you can give to someone to show them what the genre can be.

    I think this has been the best stretch of WtC produced thus far, which is really saying something.  Lots of payoff from the rest of the novel in this stretch of chapters, and the already-interesting mysteries and problems surrounding Arthur, etc. are becoming really urgent, fascinating, and scary.

    The popularity of your post hopefully speaks to the author of the goodwill from the bulk of us readers and that outspoken dissent is still a minority (and perhaps shouldn't be weighed as heavily!). 

    However, I'm with /u/RMcD94 in that I'm against name-calling and this type of public shaming for people with dissenting opinions. I don't believe that fosters a healthy and fun discussion forum like /r/rational ideally is (and has always been, in my opinion). I mean, I even had a very heated discussion with a critic where the word 'stupid' may have been thrown around, but at the end of the day I hope he continues thinking about the story and offering controversial criticism because that's far preferable to a comment circlejerk where only "safe" opinions get constructive attention. There may be criticism that gets stuck in the author's mind, for better or worse, but I'd like to think this whole episode has been a learning experience for everyone. And maybe there will be less frivolous criticism now?

    tldr; readers, don't get discouraged from posting criticism!
    ```

    - u/dalitt:
      ```
      I think I agree with you about public shaming -- in particular, I object to the use of the word "idiots" in the original post.  But I don't think it's off-base to call out aggressive, mean, or bad-faith criticism (or just unkind behavior in general).  Also, I think it's worth noting that as far as I can tell, no users critical of commenters on past threads have actually mentioned them by name here -- instead, they have only been mentioned obliquely, or by their defenders!  So any public shaming that's happened has been of a pretty mild sort.

      That said, if /u/mojojo46 feels like moderating their tone, it would certainly be consistent with the enforcement of norms of niceness.

      My guess is that much of the disagreement on this thread comes from people talking past each other.  It feels to me like the argument has been "this post isn't nice" vs. "you're trying to quash any and all criticism." But, at least in my view, its perfectly possible to be both nice and critical.

      The norm I would advocate for is: all criticism is OK, but also all posts must be *nice*.  Probably the subjectivity of that last word is where the problem lies -- it seems that my views of niceness are more rigid than some of the other commenters here, and that my sensitivity to tone is much greater.

  Loving these chapters. 

  Really glad that they are taking the isolation seriously now after Amaryllis jumping in on her own at first. Her having a session with each of the others gives a good opportunity for character development. I still tihnk they're rushing things too much, given they don't have much in the way of external time pressure iirc, there's now reason they couldn't take a day between sessions 

  Interesting to see our impressons of Adult!Arthur  fleshed out, with him interacting with his party and the house. [spoilers](#s "The interaction between him and the Kuma Duna intelligence (I keep wanting to say AI) made me uncomfortbale in the best possible way.  He was clearly going through some sort of crisis while there and in the pit. I feel like giving KDAI more entads justifiable, even if it didn't want it at the time, because it was making it more intelligent and self aware. Similar to how parents might do things their children find unpleasant for their long term good. Though he could really have gone about it in a better way. Having sex with the Tiff avatar with unsettling, and the reactions of the characters to it were really good in terms of processing it. ")

  [spoilers](#s "I really liked the dialogue between June and Amarylis. Really impressive to see characters discussing their feelings in an open way, but with it also not suddenly fixing everything or leading to any deep revelations.")

    This was actually addressed in the chapter: They know that the locus is dying, they don't know how much time they have to save it, and they know it's not a lot of time.

    > “You’re talking about adding another day on, minimum,” said Amaryllis. “I didn’t come out here to retread that point, we don’t know whether we have a day to spare. If there’s a five percent chance that adding an extra day on causes the locus to die, that’s not a risk I’m willing to take.” She was speaking fast, more emphatic than she usually was.

    - u/CouteauBleu:

      Agreed. I feel like realistically, Joon would be closer to, say, Sander Seaborn in terms of maturity. But having be steady and emotionally mature definitely makes the story more enjoyable and enlightening for me!

  I started reading this story like 4 days ago, blazed through it all, and today I read the final few chapters available. This story is incredible and I was sooooo sad I'd have to wait for more now.

    Wait, so you haven't started MoL?

    I highly recommend the story, but just be aware, it has a few months left to run. Depending on your tastes, you might prefer to wait six months or so and read it in one go.

    Or you can jump on the "augh now I have to wait another three weeks" train with everyone else :).

    - u/water125:

      Yeah, I've heard lots of good things. It's probably the most popular story on this sub, and I do like loop stuff, so I'm for sure gonna try it. I doubt I'll wait six months, and in fact will probably start today. Gotta read _something_ while I wait for more WtC
      ```

- u/ceegheim:
  ```
  Very nicely resolved all the critiques I had on Amaryllis going in alone being a stupid plan.

  Also, I'm rooting on Amaryllis taking over the world. She feels like the natural protagonist, for quite some time: Where Joon, Fenn and Grak are mostly going with the flow, she actually has an endgame she is working for. And handing the world-breaking super-powers not to her directly but rather to a companion, who is also the narrator, is pure genius. 

  edit: With this, I mean that Amaryllis is the character with most agency in all of the story, so far. Adding in that she knows that she and her personal history were retro-causally created for the sole purpose of appealing to Joon makes it even better, since she copes pretty well with this potential existential crisis.
  ```

  - u/ceegheim:
    ```
    Post-script upon reconsideration: Wow, mentally reframing the entire story with Amaryllis as the protagonist makes me like it even more. Pretty late to make this click, and not sure whether /u/cthuluraejepsen actually intended this, but that's my headcanon now. I should re-read it with that framing.

      Alternatively, taking over the world is also *very* attractive. How much is the DM? How much is the author writing an interesting harem? I feel slightly bad for this line of thinking.
      ```

- u/JiggyRobot:
  ```
  Wow. I was hoping for a new chapter soon, but wasn't expecting to get 4 at once.

  A lot of information about Arthur in this update. We have had hints that Arthur may not be as perfect as Joon sees him for a while now, but this really doesn't paint him in the best light. 

  It sounds like Arthur had been extremely worn down by the constant conflict during his time on Aerb. Given what had happened to him and his family during that time, I think that seems fair enough. What most stuck out to me here was that Arthur apparently didn't know his children that well. It honestly gives me the impression that he still didn't consider his time on Aerb to be his "real" life; especially when combined with the Groundhog Day discussion and his willingness to just arbitrarily spend a few months exploring the pit.

  Also, unrelated note but Amaryllis development of technology during that time is to be honest kind of terrifying. They are going to absolutely destroy the economy if they introduce all of this stuff at the same time.

  Edit: Also, important question but what happened to all the Cats that Amaryllis creates every-time she reads a book?  Is there a tidal wave of cats every time the time chamber opens?
  ```

  - u/WarningInsanityBelow:
    ```
    It wasn't mentioned, but I assume the cats disappear when the book that summoned them is closed.
    ```

    - u/nhdaly:
      ```
      ... do they die? :'(
      ```

      - u/Nimelennar:
        ```
        It's a Tome of Cat Summoning, not a Tome of Cat Conjuring.  Assuming that descriptor is accurate, the cats aren't created, they're brought from another plane of existence, and if they're killed or the Summoning spell is otherwise disrupted, they get sent back home to their own plane, completely unhurt.

        So, no, they probably don't die.
        ```

        - u/xamueljones:
          ```
          > the cats aren't created, they're brought from another plane of existence

          And now my head canon is that whenever Amaryllis is opening a book in the time chamber, cats all over Aerb are teleporting to and from their homes at really quick rates. It's going down history as one of life's biggest mysteries of why for five days in year XXXX, cats all over briefly disappeared for a few seconds.
          ```

            > It's going down history as one of life's biggest mysteries of why for five days in year XXXX, cats all over briefly disappeared for a few seconds.

            ... You've never owned a cat, have you?

            I've had cats teleport into locked rooms, and my only reaction was to sniff the air to make sure they didn't leave any presents while in there.

            A few moments' disappearance would be delightfully mundane.

              ```

            - u/xamueljones:
              ```
              I have, but they were fairly lazy cats and rarely moved from their spots on the couch for anything other than food or bathroom. As a child I liked to follow them and as I grew up, I often followed them into locked rooms with me getting stuck behind as the door shut behind them without an adult noticing. I've figured out how they do their teleporting trick a long time ago. ;)

      ```

      - u/WarningInsanityBelow:
        ```
        Of course! The book only exerts a mind control effect on already present ambient cats to come out of the cat dimension when opened and return when it is closed. This is a much simpler explanation than actually creating them since no violation of conservation of cats is involved.
        ```

    - u/1337_w0n:
      ```
      I also assumed this.
      ```

- u/xamueljones:
  ```
  I bet that despite Amaryllis' statement that she would kill Fenn if they spent a month together alone in a small room, she and Fenn will likely attempt doing so for at least one of the remaining months if only because Fenn doesn't want Amaryllis to spend more time with Juniper.

  I also have to comment on how Juniper comes off as a teenager in the last chapter during the conversation with Amaryllis rather than the young adult he's been earlier in the story. There's nothing too obvious, but it feels like he's having trouble dealing with the emotionally charged issues in a way that feels very teenager-like rather than adult-like and I have no idea why I have this impression. Something, something about not being very good at keeping things at an emotional distance?

  As a general impression, Juniper has seemed fairly mature and competent when in dangerous situations and dealing with the game-quests. However, he has often fallen short and frequently stumbles when dealing with the social aspects of interactions which is only partially mitigated by the rest of the group being older, more worldly, and are aware that he's trying. I'd be curious to hear if anyone has a different understanding of his character.

  Edit: Expanded on the first paragraph and grammar corrections.
  ```

  - u/Makin-:
    ```
    I just think Arthur is his weak point, so it makes sense if he can't really deal with issues related to him. He never could in the past.
    ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      Some of it is because it's about Arthur, but it feels like he's similarly emotionally compromised when it comes to romantic relationships as well. Although, one could say it's the same thing again, just replace Arthur with Tiff.
      ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    I feel like something is foreshadowed in this chapter.

     Prediction: Joon spends the whole month in the room and manages to resist temptation. But then Fenn goes in next, and she and Amy do go at it. Awkward.
    ```

    - u/Clipsterman:
      ```
      Funny, cause I was thinking that when she would go in, he would joke that she shouldn't have sex with Amy. If they actually do have sex, then that would be *fucking* hilarious.
      ```

  - u/Sailor_Vulcan:
    ```
    He IS a teenager. At the start of the story he's a 17-year-old, alternate universe version of the author. And he's been in Aerb for less than 9 months, if what Amaralyis said about being in the time chamber longer than she'd known Juniper by the time Solace is born is any indication.
    ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      I agree, I'm just saying that it's particularly noticeable in these four chapters compared to earlier in the story.
      ```

      - u/akaltyn:
        ```
        Previously we've been seeing him in his element, dealing with D&D style quests and optimisation problems. That's something he's really good at, vs the skillset of dealing with emotional issues he hasn't really developed.
        ```

  - u/WalterTFD:
    ```
    I don't think Fenn should be in the chamber, no matter who they put her in with.  A static room for a month might break her.
    ```

  I read this update with rapt attention, and time flew by. I was sad when there was no more, but I'm so excited to read this arc through. I also really love how your story doesn't cast itself into a particular mold and stick there, it really feels alive.

  Also, I loved how tangible the interpersonal tension (as well as his inner conflict) felt, and found myself both rooting for Fenn and Juniper and Amaryllis all at the same time. 

  Thanks for the chapters. :)

  Fenn is my favourite character but yet I’m on team Joonaryliss. And, well, from a narrative standpoint it feels like if they don’t hook up in the time chamber (which it doesn’t seem like they will) then they won’t ever. Sad times. I hope the ill informed criticism that would follow were that to happen had no influence on that outcome.

    Polyamory seems like the obvious conclusion to me. 

    If she's been there for two months and hasn't fallen out of love even with explicit rejection I don't think it's going away soon. Most people can't cling to a love with complete contact cut
    ```

    - u/water125:
      ```
      Totally agree on the polyamory thing. Amaryllis even said she was into girls, didn't she? With Joon being the exception? I mean, that's 2/3, assuming that Joon wants her (which is at this point dubious) and Finn... well, I dunno about Finn. It's what I hope happens, though.
      ```

      - u/sicutumbo:
        ```
        She gave a non committal agreement that she was into girls, but said "You knew before I did?" when Joon said that she was asexual. I would read the engagement as her being a stressed and confused teenager regarding her sexuality, leaning somewhat heavily towards being not being interested in sex in general. I think she wants companionship more than anything, and she's latching onto the first person who likes her as a person rather than due to her heritage. It doesn't get brought up much, but she's an orphan, and definitively did not have a happy childhood after her parents died.

    >And, well, from a narrative standpoint it feels like if they don’t hook up in the time chamber (which it doesn’t seem like they will) then they won’t ever.

    I think they may very well hook up in the next chapter.  It seems to me that if either one had made their desire explicit in this chapter they would have, and they still have a month together.  Obviously I hope not from a character standpoint...

  ```
  So did anybody notice the mild parallels between the protagonist in Uthar's Ground Hogs day rip off and the man himself.  I'm doing a lot of reading between the lines here but I can't help but wonder if he's acting the way he is because he thinks if he makes himself irredeemable the DM might leave him alone. His relationship with his wife and children is distant and given how things seem to go around him I can't help but think that's for their protection. 

  Also, anybody notice Uthar is diving into a bottomless pit and presumably staring into the abyss for weeks on end ... I wonder if he's seen it staring back. The symbolism is strong with this one.
  ```

  - u/dalitt:
    ```
    My read was that he feels like he's been fighting for years to make the world a better place, but that the dreaded narrative keeps finding ways to torture him, or to destroy what he's built.  I don't know that he's trying to make himself irredeemable -- just that he feels that since his actions have no consequences (in the long term), they have no moral weight.  So he might as well act without regard to moral considerations.

      I actually tried it both ways, and when said aloud, "sentient square mile" sounded too alliterative - like it's almost, but not quite, a tongue twister. Or maybe off in some other way, like it was violating some intuitive aspect of adjective ordering. I've changed it to "square mile of sentient forest", which reads better, since you're technically correct (the best kind of correct).

I maybe should have had her do it for this current batch of chapters, which was ~26,000 words, meaning that editing basically takes an entire night of writing away from me.

      I really do appreciate the typo corrections, it's just one of those things that I would automate away if I could, because it's basically data entry. (Well, maybe 90% data entry for the stuff that's obviously wrong when it's pointed out to me, and 10% mildly fun stuff like learning new language rules or searching out etymology/usage.)

      For example, the form of the idiom "worse for the wear". I can find cites for it both ways (though mine is definitely less common), so I'll probably keep it, since I don't want to just scrub out absolutely all of my idiolect. (Funny enough, you can see [one winning out over the other](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=the+worse+for+the+wear%2C+worse+for+wear&case_insensitive=on&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cthe%20worse%20for%20the%20wear%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cworse%20for%20wear%3B%2Cc0) in Google's n-gram viewer back in the 1820s.)

  Oh wow, what a couple of chapters!  A few thoughts:

  * Wow, Arthur is messed up.  He's clearly in a bad place, and has done wrong by both his wife and Zona. The DM said that Arthur would be changed.  I think we're starting to see the scope of that.  As u/NoYouTryAnother said, it's quickly looking like Arthur is going to be the final boss.  Since he's been gone for the last 500 years, it seems like their first priority should be **not looking for arthur** in fear of waking him up.  This principle applies to all of the nasty exclusion zones -- they're not getting worse and they're not going anywhere, so it's a good time to power up before taking them on!
  * Speaking of which, we just learned a bit about how entads bind to owners -- it looks like you have to be in their presence...or something... in the first time period after it is created, and it will be yours forevermore.  So it's not, say, that the maker owns it or something.  That makes sense, I guess
  * Related, I wonder what will happen when Arthur comes back?  All of those entads which are held by Amaryliss might become his!  They would be well-advised to prepare for this eventuality, and do some research into what might happen.
  * Don't see a way for them to get out of this keeping the anyblade.  Hopefully they can convinze zona to come along -- she would be a huge asset if she got a bit more socialized.
  * On a related note, it's super important to be defensive of Ropey.  Although feeding him to zona is tempting, it's definitely in their best interest to convince zona that entads are people and have rights.  Feeding another sentient entad to her is a good way to lose trust.
  * That said, there's a great partnership between Zona and the crew.  They already have plenty of entads for zona from the Prentiss saga.  I think they all have Zona's name on them.  You could trade her hanging out with them for a slow but steady flow of entads!  That would likely be more than worth the loss of the Anyblade, I suspect.
  * I bet you a flying fortress would make travel through the Glassy Fields exclusion zone much easier.  I bet dragons are not inclined to patrol that area, and I wouldn't be surprised if a fortress-turned-ring could travel by teleport key (or by bulk teleport?)
  * I still think that most of the magics should still be extremely easy to unlock.  A sufficient bribe to a revision mage, combined with the promise that it's not THAT much knowledge, would probably convince the mage to give a tip or two, all you really need to unlock the magic.  With such a huge world, they only need to find one mage who is desparate for money and they'll be good to go.  In the case of Skin Magic, Joon didn't even need a tutorial to unlock.  It sounds like a brief description from a book was enough for gem magic.  The bar for most magics should be very low indeed.
  * I agree with amaryliss.  The social and magical skills are much harder to come by, and pushing those to the teammates has considerable advantage.  Also, who would expect you to be a mage 14 times over, all with ~level 30 skill potential.  That would be a powerful element of surprise
  * In a real sense, writing rational characters just got somewhat harder for our fearless author.  Now that Amaryllis has spent nearly a year in the time chamber planning, every contingency and every concieveable plan should be pretty much figured out.  This sets the bar very high!
  * I'm pretty surprised that the technology gap is so large on Aerb, now that I think about it.  All these dream-skewered, they should have picked up an engineer or five.  One in 100 or so americans are engineers, and there were 1000 or so skewered individuals.  If they're all from america, we'll get 10 engineers or so (but probably somewhat less if we sample from the whole world).  That should be enough for the academics to jump-start modern technology.
  ```

  - u/akaltyn:
    ```
    Re engineers, you have a starting infrastrucure problem. Knowing modern 21st century technology isnt going to make you able to rebuild it all from scratch. An electrical engineer probably doesn't know how to mine and refine copper and mass manufacture wiring for example. Whereas Amarylis can look for specific bits of knowledge she needs to bridge the gap

    Also, dreamskewered are generally believed to be mentally ill iirc. So getting people to take your advice might be difficult.

  The character interaction in these four chapters was really enjoyable; characters becoming aware of their problems due to introspection, and then facing them, is probable the greatest impact this story will have on me personally.

  For something completely different: As someone who worked for a long time as a part-time projectionist in movie theatres, I want to point out that these devices are *loud*. Modern digital projectors are loud due to the many fans and ventilation required to keep the projector cool, and analogue projectors are loud for to the mechanical interactions; shutter, sprockets, wheels, and simply the clatter of jerking through the reel. Due to the slack before and after the aperture the preceding and following reel is moving at constant speeds, but around the aperture it's start-stopping 24 times per second. On the other hand, my experience is biased towards professional big screen projectors, I never had to deal with small, home-scale projectors likely used here.

  So it's loud.
  ```

  - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
    ```
    I *very nearly* included a bit about Grak having put up a standing sound ward in the specific place where the film projector sits, but couldn't *quite* find a place where it didn't feel out of place, and since it didn't really push characterization, I left it out. But yes, film projectors are loud enough that if you were sitting next to one (which you'd almost have to be in a room that size) it would be uncomfortably loud. Presumably the sound is then wired to a speaker that's outside the sound-cancelling ward.

    (I'm hoping that I don't make many mistakes with this, but might, since film is more of a hobby for me than an area of expertise.)

          Reddit's late announcement of the details API changes, the comically little time provided for developers to adjust to those changes and the handling of the matter afterwards (including the outright libel against the Apollo developer) has been very disappointing to me.

    Teleportation key. Maybe find a spare before doing that. Sable would also be useful — it would be inconvenient to have to unload all furniture from Zona every time she wants to turn humanoid, otherwise.

  What's (arguably) wrong with Kinsey's work?
  ```

  - u/Izeinwinter:
    ```
    Kinseys research was mainly based not on surveys, but on a huge body of interviews, which is both good - in that the lizardman constant is a lot lower when giving bullshit replies means you have to lie to a well trained interviewer to their face, and bad in that it put a lot of selection pressure on his data.

    By the nature of the process, he got information about the sexual habits of people willing to sit down and tell a grad student about their sexuality, which is.. probably not a very representative sample of the population as a whole. 

    It also has not been replicated much, but that is mostly because people doing follow-up research just did not generally have the funds or the disciples to do in-person interviews by the thousands. So they used surveys instead. 

    What this means is that Kinseys numbers on how common various things are, are almost certainly wrong, due to sample bias. 

    That is not what Amarylis used his research for, however, and on things like "These are types of human sexuality that exists" Kinsey is a magnificent source. Because, well, he and his grad students talked to one heck of a lot of people. 

    Note that there *are* no good data on how common various sexualities or kinks are - We have a hard lower bound (1.3 %) based on the rate of same sex marriages in jurisdictions where it has been legal for a long time - marrying someone of the same sex is a statement that says "I am queer" with a whole lot more credibility than any survey, and the numbers from year 10 though 15 after legalization sampling the entire population fairly without any 
    "we have been living together for 20 years and it is legal now" effects. 

    However that number is unlikely to be even close to the real prevalance, because it only gets those members of the queer community who settle down into long-term monogamy and want to make that a legal commitment, which given the subcultures, uhm, yhea.

    Surveys return answers all over the map, depending on how they are phrased. The highest numbers come from surveys that simply ask what gender your last sex partner was. These are the ones that sneak into double-digit percentages.  Apparently there are a whole lot of people having same-sex sex without considering themselves anything other than straight.

  Are there sufficiently large fixed startup and cooldown costs to using the time dilation chamber (either in units time or magical energy?)? If there aren't, why not use it for periods of a day (or two), alternating companions each day? From the perspective of everyone but Amaryllis they’d be spending ~3 months straight cooped up with her, though that’s easily solved by having each of them spend a day in the chamber alone every so often to recuperate (Amaryllis, meanwhile, would have to wait for 1-2 minutes outside; you could occasionally even pair up e.g. Fenn and Juniper for a day, I doubt they'd mind the opportunity). The transitions could be dialed in to reduce friction and unless the chamber needs substantial real-world time to start, it doesn’t seem like it would delay them substantially.

    > “Time to cycle up and down?” asked Amaryllis.

    From "Face of the Place"

    Using it for a day at a time would give you a little less than 4 days per hour if you don't spend any time at all swapping people. Drastically worse than their current average of over 30 days per hour, although we don't know the precise amount of time spent when Amaryllis is outside the chamber. It's not an efficient use of time comparatively. I would say that using it for a week at a time is the lowest you should go for effective use.

    I don't think that they need to be super strict about swapping in order to avoid interpersonal conflict. Anyone can end the time dilation at any time from the inside, so it's best to just keep it running until there's a problem. The only reason to limit it to a month at a time is to do check ups.
    ```

    - u/phylogenik:
      ```
      ah, there we go! figured it might have been mentioned earlier, but couldn't recall. At ~4 days per hour you get the 40 week pregnancy done with in ~70 hours (or 280\*(1+15)/60 = 74.7 hours, with no friction) -- too bad they're on such a time crunch or this might have been more easily manageable, and bought each of them several months of R&R too. A weekly rotation puts them at 40\*(7+15)/60 = 14.7 h, vs the 10\*(28+15)/60 = 7.2 h it's taking them now. Though I suppose they might need several years if the dryad emerges altricial (which would further cramp the chamber if companions tag along).

      I wonder if the time dilation chamber works on the locus/bottle? Could help with their limited space problems in the future if so (or if there are other, generalized magics that could shrink them or expand space). Also, can the time dilation chamber slow time for its contents? They might have considered chucking the bottle in if so and buggering off on other quests, though that would not have been without risks.

They might have considered chucking the bottle in if so and buggering off on other quests, though that would not have been without risks.

        I guess it depends on whether the space inside the bottle counts as additional area for the time dilation chamber. It seems like it's limited by volume, otherwise it would have been made bigger, but it's kind of unknown at this point. They can't test it until they have Solace back either, because the whole point is that the Locus is dying quickly.

        I rather doubt that it can make things go more slowly in addition to the function we see here. It seems too powerful for a single thing to do both. In addition, I don't think it would be a good idea to do that even if they could. So far, they've had one party member killed and a few nearly so in the course of a few months. It isn't likely that Amaryllis could carry a baby to term even if the Locus wasn't a concern.

    we dont know if the "npc" characters are full simulated human brains, like Joon seemingly is, or if they are simpler AI. (The former would require ridiculous amounts of processing power given the size of the world, but who knows.) The DM has already been shown to be able to implant information into minds, as with Joon's acquiring new knowledge and skills, so the forge frenzy would simply be that taken up to 11, with a single overpowering desire incorporated into it. If they're something more like the AI we make with modern techology its pretty trivial.

  These chapters were just so...crushing...

  I think it's kinda cuz like...Joon and Amaryllis *didn't* do anything. That they *didn't* succumb. Cuz if you did, you could say "ha it's just that typical trope" and like...you're accustomed to that stuff already. But now it's just like...like Amaryllis. There's this emotional suspense that just isn't gonna go away.

  And that's all, like, after Arthur turns out to be kind of a deranged self-destructive deeplier-than-expected flawed individual.

  > “Many things,” said Amaryllis with a nod. “It’s unbelievable how much Uther brought over from Earth. I’d thought, when I started, that I’d find a few places where he’d been obviously influenced by what he’d grown up with on Earth, but it’s almost overwhelming how many parallels there are. Even his name is taken from Earth legend, did you know that?”

  Oh my god, I just realized this was a callback to this line in chapter 7:

  It's been a while since I've posted long obsessive stream-of-thought feedback. Well, wait no more, for I am tired and I have nothing better to do! (well, that was the case when I started writing it; turns out those take some time, actually)

  > "She reminds me of him, [...] Headstrong. Fearless."

  Is that a disguised insult? We know from Zona's story that she has no love at all for Uther. Maybe she's saying that she sees the same arrogance in his great-granddaughter.

  > some of it was the tint of unreality that still sometimes seemed to hang over everything like a fog

  Yeah, I think it hasn't quite sunk in how many times they avoided death by pure luck in the last few weeks. I'm probably gonna make a count of it at some point.

  > "Usually I would leave one alive, or two if I could separate them without too much trouble, then appear before them and make them answer my questions about the state of the world."

  >  “Oh, certainly I’ve done things like that,” said Zona. “A door slams shut, trapping one member of a party away from the others, and I go to work making a display of their death to whatever extent I’m able, so that when the main group comes to the rescue of their fellow, he’s a macabre display of arteries and organs. You’ll have to clean up a few of those, they’re scattered around the rooms, which is another point in favor of my having permanent residents again, I suppose.”

  The more Zona talks about the people she killed, the more I wonder: did she let anyone leave? I don't know how many adventurers made their way in the fortress, if she was taking her time and being dramatic, there must have been at least a few who tried begging for their life or negotiating? Someone could have offered to fetch an entad for her in exchange for the release of a hostage, or something similar. I don't think that's likely, because if people had survived Kuum Doona, then they would have spread the word, unless Zona had some way to swear them to secrecy.

  It's interesting that the group is considering the possibility of living in Kuum Doona, even though the fortress has shown both the ability and the willingness to kill them all at any moment. It draws a lot of parallels with Fallatehr, who they were unwilling to have such an arrangement with. I wonder how much of it is the insidiousness of soul magic, how much of that is that Kuum Doona already had an opportunity to kill them and didn't take it, and how much is that Zona looks like a cute girl.

  > "but I kind of wonder what would happen if we had a sentient magic item to give to her"

  > “Here, if this entad were intelligent, if it were a thinking thing, you’re saying that there would be no legal repercussions for me injuring it?”

  Joon isn't being very subtle about Ropey. I think he gave the game away, but I don't think Zona wants to try eating a sentient item anyway.

  > “He was dream-skewered,” said Zona. [...] “It doesn’t make any sense.”

  Mary said at some point that Uther being dream-skewered was a widely accepted theory among scholars. If nothing else, it would have been pretty hard to ignore once the other dream-skewered started to notice "Hey, this guy just copied over Star Wars and Lord of the Rings and stuff". That suggests that her information about the outside world is at least somewhat limited.

  > "Whenever you open up a book and read from it, a cat will appear, sitting on the pages."

  How do the Tomes of Cat Summoning work? Does a cat appear every single time you open any book, even a backpack-summoned book? Do they disappear when you close the book? If you open and close a book multiple times, does it keep spawning cats, or does the same cat appear and disappear every time? If you open a book, injure/kill/give a ribbon to the cat, then close the book and open it again, is the cat still injured/dead/dastardly fashionable? WE NEED ANSWERS!

  > And that was when Uther Penndraig entered the picture.

  He gave the man just enough funds to build his fortress, went there once and used it mostly as an underage sex slave, then proceeded to never talk about it to anyone ever again. The End.

  But seriously, did Omar Antoun even get any money out of his deal with Uther? The chapter only mentions materials and workers. Presumably he was at least fed during the building process, and he probably got a reputation boost to his business (assuming he got it back) afterwards, but still. Poor guy.

  We still don't know why Mary had bad intel about Kuum Doona not being sentient; but it looks like the answer boils down to "Uther was ashamed of it", which would be why the place was abandoned in the first place.

  > Things flowed more smoothly once Uther joined in the work; the King of Anglecynn and Secretary General of the First Empire did menial labor on the orders of a man most people thought was insane.

  "Secretary General"? Wow, Mary was not kidding about Uther stealing a ton of stuff from Earth culture. Which... makes sense, honestly, because if you have this immense comparative advantage, why not exploit it? But it suggests that Uther wasn't a very imaginative person; or at least, that he didn't feel the need to stretch his imagination muscles. Also, we know that he wrote a few books on literary theory, so maybe he was more of an "analysis" kind of guy?

  > It was one of his spare weapons, one of many, the Butterfly Knife, capable of creating butterflies as it swept through the air.

  "Never did they realize the true power of the Butterfly Knife, which was that it could kill anyone, anything, in one stab, provided you stabbed the person in the back while they were looking away from you." Nice pun though!

  And I really like the picture this paints of Uther, of this guy who spent so long adventuring, and has collected so many items, he's basically treating most of them like trash by now. He has a dozen magic knives and swords, what's one more or less?

  > “We could make this place mobile,” said Vervain. “Feed it the portal ring?” asked Raven.

  I assume they did give it some teleporting item, probably the ring. So why is it stuck in the Boundless Pit? Is it because the fortress was built in the pit and is fundamentally tied there? If so, I wonder if they could give it some sort of remote hologram projector to interact with the outside world.

  > "Uther had solved that problem in the space of a free afternoon by coercing the senators into temporarily reinstating the monarchy with supreme power vested in prisoner set to be executed, a task which he accomplished while the ink on the law was still wet".

  That must have been an interesting afternoon for the citizens of Palmain. Also, you kind of have to wonder what kind of life Uther lived that he found time to do stuff like this, but none to talk with his wife or children.

  The magic sword had limited intelligence, while Zona became smarter over time. I wonder if this is a result of her expanding the effects of the magic items she eats, or if she had to eat multiple sentient items to get there.

  > “I met with Omar Antoun, my creator, a few years after Uther had abandoned me,”

  I wonder how that meeting went. Was he proud of her? Bitter? Curious? This would have been before she started murdering everyone who tried to enter.

  > "The ability to shrink, or otherwise adjust my shape, possibly enough that I could disguise myself as one of the mortal species."

  Companion quest hook! I'm split. One the one hand, I really like Zona and I wouldn't mind her as a permanent character. On the other hand, I feel that she has very similar character beats to [Null Pointer Exception], and adding her as a character would take some spotlight away from Null.

  > “But with every passing day, I care less about how the truth pains you.”

  > <I am a house,> replied Kuum Doona. <For living in.> Uther kept looking at his book, not deigning to respond to that.

  > It had been instructed not to speak with Uther unless they were having a conversation

  Okay, I wanna give Uther the benefit of the doubt, but wow. If the narration is accurate (and it would be kind of a cheat if it weren't), then the guy became really callous after all these years of adventuring.

  > Uther returned after a month in the Pit. His portal opened in the study, blasting wind, and he collapsed to one knee as soon as he was through it. He was bloodied and gasping for air, but eventually found his feet.

  WHAT WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BOTTOMLESS PIT?

    >  “But if you can’t stay stuck in a room with Amaryllis for a month without fucking her -- if I can’t let you go into a room with her for a month without flipping my lid -- then yeah, I’m going to choose to believe the best of you, her, and myself.”

    I love this part, and this chapter in general. I think this crystallizes what I was thinking about the speculation last thread, where people were saying that Joon couldn't go in the chamber with Mary because then he'd totally have sex with her.

    > “Pregnancy hormones must be getting to me.” I pulled back from her. “You’re not --” “It was a joke, Juniper,” said Fenn, laughing.

    Jackass.

    > “Is there … some variation in pancakes across Aerb?” “They’re crepes,” said Amaryllis. 

    That made me laugh. But speaking as someone who eats crepes every so often, and ate pancakes a few times in the US... yeah, there's no comparison. Pancakes are just sooooo much better.

    > The multitude of species on Aerb are also a problem -- sorry, not a problem, but a possible explanation for why we’re progressing so slowly

    I love how politically correct Mary is. I guess that's something she had to worry about a lot, working with the Empire of Common Cause.

    > This was a slower method of distributing technologies, but it would reap us greater personal rewards, some of which would funnel back toward the ‘adventuring’ side of things, if we still had cause to do that (which we both assumed would be the case).

    "But if we bring the world to a new technological, cultural and political revolution, we'll become the *best murderhobos ever*!!!" I like Mary's thinking here. So long as they don't stop meeting new people and almost getting killed in stupid ways. It worked for Uther!

    > “The backpack doesn’t allow me access to a computer, lap computer, or intelligent phone, but it does allow printouts of websites.”

    Oh wow. Is there anything the bagpack can't do? Doesn't affect the plot my ass.

    (eheh, intelligent phone)

    > "I’ve been in this room for longer than I’ve known you. Most of my time as a member of this group will have been spent waiting for the pregnancy to progress."

    That's an interesting point, and something they usually don't consider when writing time-travel stories. I remember reading a summary of a game session of a time-travel RPG; and at one point, one character needed gun skills for a combat encounter, so she time-travelled out of the fight, spent two weeks on a range learning how to use a gun, then time-travelled back to the fight scene. I remember being really... I don't know, amused by this scene, and the fact that these two weeks were treated as a ten-seconds parenthesis and "now you have combat skills!". One of the players told me "well, that's the principle of the game, you can leverage your time powers", but I'm not sure he really got it; and that he got how *long* two weeks are. Like, after the fight scene, the character would probably have forgotten any conversation they were having, would probably be a little hazy on the progress of their quest, they'd probably be dressed differently, etc.

    > I’d have liked to believe that if Amaryllis had tried to seduce me, I would have pushed her off and left the time chamber early, but the more I thought about it, the more it seemed like I was just fantasizing instead of worrying.

    Oh, so Joon likes to fantasize about attractive young girls trying to seduce him and him maturely rejecting them? That is very weird! And I've never fantasized about it!

    >  “It makes me think,” I said, frowning slightly. “It makes me think about the choices that Arthur was faced with, and how he dealt with them.” I let out a shaky breath. “The thing I’m really worried about is that this is the tip of the iceberg. That it’s a single grain of sand on the beach, that the further we probe, the more we’re going to see, and I’m going to find that he was destroyed by this place, back from the dead but then scrubbed away.” I swallowed. “Or, maybe, something worse. I don’t know.”

    You know, I feel kind of weird speculating about Uther. My understanding is that, this being a SI story, Uther is at least somewhat based on a deceased childhood friend of the author. It's mostly fictional and all, but it's still kind of awkward to say "This guy is callous" or "This guy will probably turn out to be the villain" or comment on the stuff he ripped off from Earth culture, knowing that at least some of the personality I'm commenting on is based from a real person.

    Also, I'm not sure what to say about the "Uther had sex with Zona" part that isn't obvious. It's... a creative way to introduce sexual exploitation in a story, I guess. Bleh.

    ---

    Moving on, one thing I really like about this story is how big the world is.

    Alot of fantasy and science fiction revolves around one community, usually a reintepretation of some aspect of American society that inspired the author. In Demolition Man, the world is Los Angeles; in 1984, the world is made of three variations of an uniform totalitarian dystopia; in DC and Marvel (and if we're honest, Worm), the world in changed by the rise of superheroes, 95% of which are American; in Stargate, every planet only has one town of relevance, within walking distance of its gate.

    And that's fine, because all these works want to deliver their message or their escapism, and it's easier to do that with a narrow scope; but it also feels like something is lost on aggregation, like writers are collectively saying that the world is simple, and there's only ever one aspect of it that matters. Which makes me wish for works that say "no, the world is diverse and complicated, and you can't make broad statements about it because different places have different cultures".

    I think this is something alexanderwales really nails in his works, and this one in particular; the cultures feel varied, which is reflect both in the exposition, and the fact that the protagonists can spend months going in a new country every week, and still remain continents away from the Empire that's after them.

      A bit political correctness, maybe a bit capital-P Precision.
