## Super-Intelligence and Children in fiction

### Post:

So, I was thinking, as someone who writes "special children" (in the spec fic sense) and has consumed a lot of media involving that trope, are there many stories that handle the idea of super-intelligent kids *well*? Usually they tend to either read like the author has never met a child (gifted or otherwise) or a bad stereotype of a spectum kid.

  Ender's Game does it well, but then other books in the series fall back to the lazy tropes you're complaining about.

  Miles Vorkosigan is another good example in the books where he's young

    I'd say Orson Scott Card is reasonably good at writing clever, arrogant, yet self-conscious thirteen-year-olds.  This is because Orson Scott Card is basically a clever, arrogant, self-conscious thirteen-year-old at heart.

        I suppose it's subjective.  Most of Card's heroes seem to be pretty sure that they're far smarter than all the adults in their lives.  You could argue that this doesn't constitute arrogance since Card makes it (rather implausibly) true much of the time.

    Ender is six when the series starts. Do six year olds really act like that?

    Kids younger than seven still haven't entered the concrete operational stage of development, so I'm not sure they can act as war generals.

        Lots. Gobs. It was a going thing well before that.

        I got on the ARPAnet in 1978 and by 1983 was providing free tech support for this guy who knew a guy at a local hospital to get a full Usenet feed piggybacked on their feed. There was also Fidonet and local bulletin boards in the ‘70s. The earliest SF I can think of with online flame wars was mid ‘70s.

        Most techy SF writers were already on the Internet and fa.sf-lovers on Usenet by the early ‘80s, because people already online were happy to provide them free connections. I’m sure that included Asprin. It was so straight from actual online discussion. Except so enlightened because he turned Ender into a mary sue.

  Ender’s game gets held up as both a good and bad example.  As a kid up till high school, I would have said it was a good example, now as an adult I have more mixed feelings.  I think part of the problem is that as a gifted kid, even though your own internal world feels rich, complex, and complete, you aren’t aware of the blind spots in your knowledge and the way your lack of life experience can bias your internal perception of yourself.  Thus there is an inherent contradiction in writing super intelligent/gifted children.  If it’s a first person POV or a 3rd person limited POV it will either come across as unrealistic because it is true to the perspective of the gifted child and thus shares the biases of the child, or it will be “realistic” at the expense of not capturing the child’s internal narration properly.

  So Ender’s Game feels true to the experiences as a gifted child, even if the overall premise and the extent Ender’s ability is unrealistic.

  Thinking of stuff I read as a kid, I really think Ender’s Game is the best example.  Ender’s thought processes, social isolation, and (in hindsight) pressure from adults were all things that were true to my experience.

  In Ender’s Shadow Bean’s life experiences felt too far removed from mine and his intelligence translated to hyper competence in a way I couldn’t relate to and that undermined the main series.

  I read 5 or 6 Artemis Fowl books.  I didn’t empathize with Artemis the same way I did with Ender.  Artemis Fowl’s genius tended to be in the form of inventions and research done off screen in a way that couldn’t be replicated in my own thoughts.

  Dune introduced me to a lot of interesting concepts, but the abilities of Mentats and intuition of the Bene Gesserit were super powers and not things I could relate to.

  I’ll confess I read Billy and Howard and Duumvirate (I know you know what these are because you started a let’s read before giving up in disgust).  The way Howard has a simplistic but edgy explanation for how the world works felt true to my teenage self even if I disagreed with the actual details of his explanations.  In hindsight, these stories were a way of transgressing against my fundamentalist religious upbringing.  It’s kind of funny how the perspectives of an edgy nihilistic atheist who wants to be a world controlling Illuminati master overlaps with that of a fundamentalist Christian who believes Satan is controlling the world through the elites...

  Anyway I think the answer of “good” changes if you are writing for gifted children or Young Adult audiences and are trying to be true to their perspective (in which case those outside this demographic might perceive it as inaccurate, going so far as to say that the author “has never met a child”) compared to if you are trying to be accurate about how the rest of the world perceives them (in which case it might seem like a “bad stereotype of a spectrum kid” as you put it)

    Oh, a fellow *Billy and Howard* survivor! And my God, you actually read that let's read? Back when I was trying to do the "reviewer character" thing in text? I apologize in advance.

    Also, *Billy and Howard* reminds me of another good point: age groups are a thing. Billy and Howard don't act like ten year olds, or even preteens, they're more like sixteen year olds. A lot of authors treat childhood and adulthood as some kind of binary switch rather than a process. A nine year old will behave a bit differently from a twelve year old, that sort of thing.

      Sorry if this is getting off topic, but this is my first time running into someone talking about Billy and Howard...  So some background on my reading of Duumvirate and Billy and Howard: I was in the 9th or 10th grade (can't remember for sure), I had just discovered TV Tropes, and I was a Fundamentalist Christian.  Like a Young Earth Creationist, the Rapture is imminent, Satan is real and active in the world, America is fundamentally good but not Christian enough, Republicans are good but not Christian enough, Homosexuality is a choice and a sin, Fundamentalist Christian.  I still read and enjoyed things completely outside my rigid worldview... I guess I believed that untrue things couldn't really hurt me.  I would just kind of mentally sort it out and label what I thought wasn't acceptable to my worldview and and try to filter it out.  So for a book like A Wrinkle In Time I would mentally label as new age heresy. (This book had the gall to suggest that Jesus was equivalent to Leonardo Da Vinci or Buddha, which I viewed a subtle trap to trick the reader into accepting a diminished view of Jesus).  

      So Billy and Howard was interesting because it was so direct in violating what I considered "right" and my worldview that I could read it without putting much effort into filtering it.  It's also interesting because of how much it aligned and confirmed my worldview.  Like obviously all non-Christians are just a hair's breadth away from being violent cannibalistic rapists, Slicer is just being honest about it unlike all the other non Christian authors.  (I wouldn't have literally said this or consciously believed this, but subconsciously the sentiment was there).  It also lines up with the cynical sort of a view a teenage can develop when they believe Satan is manipulating everything in the world and that all non-Christian media might be a trap or manipulation.  Slicer's world-building puts forward a world in which that is true in the literal materialistic sense in the form of the Illuminati using Barney as a brainwashing tool for the masses.  

      For all that it served to fuel confirmation bias in my Fundamentalist mindset, in a way, I think Billy and Howard might have helped me... in it's directness it bypassed my filters.  It kind of shows how a worldview like what I held is nihilistic and empty for all the purported joy I was taught to believe Christianity was full of.

      So I found your let's read later in life when I revisited Billy and Howard and I was looking for a critical analysis.  Despite its well put together TV Tropes page, I couldn't find any analysis or discussion of it.  Your let's read, as short as it was, pointed out stuff I had missed because I was distracted by the shocking edginess of it.  For instance, the low-key and not so low-key racism (in my high school years I was dumb enough to buy the right-wing idea that MLK had already succeeded and thus racism was mostly dead), the flaws in world building, the logical fallacies in Howard's exposition.  My head canon for it now is that Howard was the puppet of the technocratic faction within the Illuminati and that the the Operator intentionally allowed for flaws such as Howard's over-sensitivity to stimuli and tendency to sunburn in order to make Howard biased in favor of his "wipe humanity out plan".  The Wizard as a character was kind of stupid, but I actually enjoyed your Mark Fictus bits and your take on Sarah.  Mark's adventures as he tries to unironically make the best TV shows possible and navigate an insane organization sound interesting.

      Back to your main topic... The age groups divide is an interesting point.  Like HPMOR Harry would be pretty reasonable as a 14-19 year old, Draco makes sense to me as a racist 12-15 year old who has been taught shoddy life hacks by his racist father and is being confronted with the problems in his world view for the first time.  I think that is something a lot of authors miss in their child characters.  

      Another thing you got me thinking of now is that many authors fail to capture the changes in perspective with age that child characters go through.  Like it's possible to swing from one perspective on life in elementary school to a more nuanced, but still flawed, opposite perspective in middle school and then back again in high school.  I'm having a hard time thinking of children's books outside coming of age stories that do this well...  I guess Katniss's perspective in Hunger Games shifts around a bit from just protecting herself and her family, to thinking of the district as a whole to thinking of all the districts.  And her development of a more nuanced perspective.  Thinking of Susan Collins, I guess Gregor the Overlander has a bit of development of perspective in how he learns about the different under land races and goes back and forth on how meaningful the prophecies actually are. 

      I thought of another book series for your consideration.  The Animorphs characters aren't marketed or portrayed or meant to be super-intelligent, but given that they engage in guerilla warfare against an alien race and keep trying things and disrupting and plotting, I think they actually do partially qualify as super-intelligent at least in the narrow area of morph-based guerilla warfare...  So I guess the lesson there is that if you write several dozen books you can gradually and smoothly develop your child character's abilities until they are hyper competent and it feels natural and earned.

        I think I might be the last person on the English speaking internet to have not read *Animorphs*. Ought to sometime. Thanks for the rec.

        And Mark Fictus is the one thing from those reviews I'm still a little proud of. Or maybe just affectionate towards. I did honestly consider writing him an actual story, but aside from finding better uses of my time than writing hate-fic for obscure web-serials, the amount of world building it'd take to make things vaguely make sense would be enourmous.

        ...Actually, maybe that's a reason I *should* do it.

        Just a note, I admire your honesty. It was years before I could even begin to acknowledge my dumbass creationist kid phase.

        (My otherwise lovely student's aid gifted me a stack of Creation Magazine back issues, another things authors should remember about kids, they're eager as fuck to believe what nice seeming adults telll them)

        Actually, you know what characters I was consistently engaged with even as I was hate reading Duumvirate? Sarah and Paul. I bet there's a timeline next door where the book was called *Sarah and Paul* and was some great dystopian satire.

        Wait, Billy and Howard ended with a supposedly universial plague being unleashed on the Earth...

        Did Mark bribe the Operator to bump it down to Covid 19?

          > Ought to sometime. Thanks for the rec.

          I'll qualify the rec... a lot of the books in the middle of the series were ghost written, to the point that some characters are completely out of characters or exaggerated.  Some of the spin-off books with time travel are completely superfluous, while others of the spin-offs are among the best books in the series.  There are probably good reading guides out there, but off the top of my head... I can personally recommend as good the first 20 or so books and the last 2-4 of the main series, the Hork-Bajir Chronicles and Visser.  I never got around to reading them but apparently The Ellimist Chronicles and the Andalite Chronicles are good.   The Megamorph's have some interesting worldbuilding for fanfic writers but I'm not sure how good they are.

          >  I did honestly consider writing him an actual story, but aside from finding better uses of my time than writing hate-fic for obscure web-serials, the amount of world building it'd take to make things vaguely make sense would be enourmous.

          The setting is generic enough you could file off the serial numbers and do some world building and you'd have an original setting.  It worked for 50 Shades author and it worked for the Mortal Instruments author, and those both started as fanfic writers for major series (Twilight and Harry Potter).  The Illuminati is a staple of a lot of fiction, so you can keep that.  You can put your own touches by playing up or down the hidden technology, figuring out what the Illuminati actually does and intends to achieve,  maybe add in some occult magic... you'll have an original setting in no time.

          > Wait, Billy and Howard ended with a supposedly universial plague being unleashed on the Earth...

          It was multiple simultaneously plagues, the Operator mentioned he had a hard time balancing fatality rate and spread...  Maybe Paul actually did put together a plan to betray Billy's and Howard's plan together with Sarah and Mark.  But... the operator wouldn't be bribed, he was the one to suggest the idea in the first place.  But plenty of other Illumantis, as evil as they are, recognize they need normals in their supply chain, enjoy lording it over the normals, or actually have some faint trace of morality.  So together they release a less lethal plagues.  In response the global population goes into quarantine, preventing the Operator's ultra lethal super plagues from spreading.  Paul and Sarah avoid blame by making sure the existence of their secret Chinese lab that produced COVID-19 is labeled as 'normal-directed misinformation', and thus Billy and Howard automatically disbelieve any of the evidence brought to them about Paul/Sarah/Mark's treachery. With COVID-19 disrupting the release of new video games and movies, Billy and Howard realize they need "the normals" after all, "Illuminated-only" media doesn't exist in sufficient quantity (or if we are being honest, quality) to satisfy Billy and Howard's needs.  Billy and Howard put the plan on hold onto Illuminated entertainment catches up, the Operator and his faction stew in misanthropic hatred, and Mark races to further raise up the quality and quantity of "normal" media in order to stall Billy and Howard's doomsday plans almost indefinitely.

            *Game of Thrones* entirely exists to keep Howard sastiated, I swear. 

            I'm still amused by the daughter of those retrovial servants from *Duumvirate*. Whose considered a tragedy because she's... nice. Because of self administered electroshock. Because that's the only way a child of Northberg wouldn't be a little shit. Even if they're being raised to be a servant.

            Maybe I'll give the Mark Fictus thing a try after *The New Humans*... and a bunch of other projects.

    I've always thought that Ender's game is very good writing, but very bad in terms of the morals and lessons it teaches, and what you wrote here is a good start for putting into words as to why.

    My previous explanation of why I thought so was sort of vaguely gesturing towards the degree of wish-fulfillment and glorification of killing your childhood bully (maybe it's just me, but I know that when I was a kid, I would *often* fantasize about the day when my childhood bully would finally do something that would *justify* bashing his head in without moral censure...that wasn't a *good* part of me, that wanted that, but it is a part that loved Ender's Game) and the benevolent sexism treatment of valentine and petra, but that explanation is more just pointing out gotchas than really tackling the fundamental issues.

      Are you sure it wasn't a good part of you? I worry that, even though it's ugly, you'd have been worse off not having it. Pride and ego and self-righteousness are important to have in moderation. Fantasizing about violence doesn't seem necessarily bad. You've got those instincts because they were adaptive for your ancestors, throwing them away, rather than wrangling them into check, would probably have unfortunate side-effects.
      ```

      - u/GreenSatyr:
        ```
        I guess the problem in my eyes was that I was just waiting for the right excuse to unleash the violence. What my bully would do is "accidentally" hurt me by slamming into me or kicking when my teacher was close enough to notice any retaliation. There was always just enough plausible deniability that I wouldn't really be _justified_ in gauging out his little eyeballs. I can see an alternate timeline where one or both of us was seriously hurt. Had that come to pass, I think we'd be worse off for it. 

        I actually did hurt someone, once. He had made a (to him, harmless) joke about my mother but there were cultural differences that I didn't fully understand at the time, which made me interpret it as a serious offence. It was definitely wrong of me to do that. Why did I hit him and not my bully? He was actually bigger and stronger than my bully. Because he crossed a (to me) clear line whereas by pretending it was an accident each time, the bully kept his actions just ambiguous enough to keep me confused as to what the right response was. And also because talking about my mother seemed like a worse offence than hitting me at the time. I had not really integrated into American culture at the time and I processed things in a way that made that insult very deep.

        I don't think the _entire_ instinct is wrong (like if a _real_ scenario where I needed to defend myself or others were to occur) but I think there's something wrong with the mindset of "once there is sufficient cause, release maximum and lethal force" and that's Ender's game's lesson.

      > My previous explanation of why I thought so was sort of vaguely gesturing towards the degree of wish-fulfillment and glorification of killing your childhood bully

      That's definitely part of it too.  For me it was more that I wished I had the aggressiveness to lash successfully out at all, not necessarily that I had the excuse to escalate to lethal violence but that's part of it, yeah.  Another aspect is that key authority figures know about the bullying and intentionally allow it to happen for ambiguous purposes... that felt true to my experiences as well, even if the adults weren't literally watching on a monitor they would still say stuff like school is necessary for socialization or boys will be boys or other crap...

  The students in David Foster Wallace’s Infinite Jest are pretty good.  The main character is a hyper-literate tennis phenom that has a marijuana problem; however, his classmates aren’t slouches either, and there’s a lot of interesting interactions at their tennis academy that happens to have a comically stringent academic curriculum.

  That being said, the reason all the children sound smart in Infinite Jest is because they’re a reflection of DFW’s authorial voice, who himself was a kind of young-gun literary genius.  So I guess writing interesting super-intelligent children is easier if you’re pretty super-intelligent yourself, heh.

  I always thought of Ender's Game as a better written twilight for teenage bookish boys

  It's basically a wish fullfillment character.  Despite being a child, he  is one of the most intelligent and thoughtful people in the series.  Other people are unconsciously intimated by his genius and are uncomfortable around him.  

  To be honest, I don't like super intelligent protagonists, even less when they are children.  Since the author  isn't super intelligent themselves it always comes across as silly or cringy to me.  

  In the fiction I read(rational or otherwise), I like smart characters but who are believed smart.   Character thought processes should be grounded in reality.

    >I always thought of Ender's Game as a better written twilight for teenage bookish boys

    Side note, I feel people are a little harsh on wish fufilment. It serves a purpose, especially for kids. It can be problematic, sure, but done right, it can be both inclusive (in the sense that it bouys more than *one* kind of reader, and not to the exclusion of others) and genuinely uplifting.  


    ...Will say Ender's Game misses the mark a bit.

      Just read your username, are you the guy from spacebattles who did a lets read of HPMOR?

      Anyway, I don't think there's anything neccesarily wrong with wish fullfillment.  Every story has at least some level of it, at the end of the day we are reading stories to be entertained.

      I just think that it has to be balanced by other elements as well.  The reason I don't really like super intelligent protagonists is because the story often treats intelligence like magic.  It makes conflicts often too boring for me.

      Same thing goes for superintelligent children protagonists.  Combine the difficulty of writing super intelligent characters with the difficulty of writing children characters and you don't often get a great result.

      There are some examples though.  Wildbow's fantastic Ward, Twig, and now Pale have really well written child characters, some superbly written child genius characters even.

        Yes, I am. Still stand by most of what I said, but I have nothing against rational fic as a genre. 

        I've always felt one way to try and write characters more intelligent than you is spend a great deal of time working something in your story out, preferably with the input of others, and then compress the "groundwork" for the character.

  Depends on how you define doing it well. My favorite super-intelligent children story is probably **The Promised Neverland**. It is absolutely not realistic, but it does do a couple things well.

  First, we see the thought processes of the kids from time to time, and I consider this to be one of the most important parts of writing intelligent characters in general. Seeing the reasoning process of supposedly intelligent characters is important to lending the depiction a degree of authenticity, in my opinion.

  Second, different kids have different *types* of intelligence. This is something I tend to find sorely lacking in terms of depicting intelligent characters in fiction in general. In most books, intelligence is treated as binary, whereas in the real world there are often people who have different characteristics that could be defined as forms of intelligence (e.g. memory, spacial reasoning, arithmetic, verbal intelligence, etc.)

  Third, the kids are still fallible. They're out-maneuvered both by other kids and adults on multiple occasions. Also, in terms of the kids, it's not like one kid is always the "winner" in their schemes - different kids come out on top in different situations.

  That being said, there are still some tropes of Hollywood intelligence in there that I find grating, especially in terms of some of the ultra-young kids outside of the main cast being way too aware for their age (Phil is probably the worst example of this).
  ```

  - u/tjhance:
    ```
    One thing to note about *The Promised Neverland* that makes me really appreciate its intelligent children characters where I might otherwise roll my eyes is that it actually has an in-story reason for the kids being super smart, and even better, this reason is intrinsically tied to the plot rather than being bolted on after-the-fact. (anime spoilers) >!The kids are selectively bred for their intelligence!< (manga spoilers) >!and this has been going on for like 1000 years or something!<

    Also, besides being really smart, they still behave like, you know, kids. They like to run around in the field and play tag, and so on.

  It is a very subdued example, but I think **Hatchet** qualifies. The protagonist is a young boy who survives in North American wilderness thanks only to his thinking skills as young rationalist/pragmatist. He is not a super-genius, but I would consider him "peak-kid rationalist", because the problems he defeats with clear methodical thinking would defeat most adults.

  I'd rather say that the point of those fics is to portrait a special super-gifted child which reader has never met. Potraying gifted children in those fics like the common real-life gifted children would defeat the purpose.

  The whole point of fiction is to write about something that would most likely won't happen in real life.

    You have a point, but there is something to be said for the tying of the fantastic to the mundane. I mean, I'm sure there are perfectly valid stories about beings who are basically adults in childish bodies, but I think it's useful to be able to model human child behaviour. Know the rules to break them and all.

        Admittedly I view those books through inch thick rose-tinted glasses (Even with Rowling's rapid descent into a nastier George Lucas) but I think she grasped the "inner voice" and behaviour of kids pretty well, and aged their perspective appropriately. Harry in particular I think is a lot more distinct than people give him credit for.
