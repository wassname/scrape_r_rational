  I like many things about this story, but I don't like the "True Ending." I genuinely don't understand why we are supposed to consider the murder of fifteen billion people an acceptable sacrifice in order to...retain the ability to be unhappy? Preserve our right to allow our children to suffer? Avoid desiring to kill and eat things that look like babies but aren't even sentient?

  What rational reason is there to refuse the Superhappies' compromise? It seems like the entire line of thinking is "there's something intrinsically valuable about the way humans are--and particularly, our capacity to suffer is intrinsically valuable for some goddamn reason--so we can't allow ourselves to be changed, even for the better." Which seems irrational as all hell to me, and inconsistent with the rest of EY's work. Since when do rationalists value suffering for its own sake?

  I mean, in the epilogue the Confessor--the guy whose entire role is to be the story's purest rationalist--straight up says that he thinks murdering fifteen billion people accomplished something so valuable that it made up for him raping and killing an underage girl. And I don't see anything in the "facts" of the story to justify that.

    The murder of fifteen billion people allowed humanity to retain control over itself.

    It wasn't about what the SuperHappies were doing to people. It was about the SuperHappies not giving people any choice in the matter.

    And yes, the fact that the heroes basically abandoned the Babyeaters to have their preferences overriden by the SuperHappies *is* extremely hypocritical...
    ```

    - u/CeruleanTresses:
      ```
      Really good point about the hypocrisy. 

      I disagree that the characters' opposition was primarily about the lack of choice, though. The emphasis is consistently on retaining the capacity to suffer. The Pilot's last words in the True End chapter aren't "To live free," but "To live, and occasionally be unhappy."
      ```

      - u/CCC_037:
        ```
        To *live* - the rest is details. How is having your entire being overwritten by the SuperHappies any different to dying? (How is letting the SuperHappies loose on the BabyEaters any different to genocide?)
        ```

        - u/CeruleanTresses:
          ```
          I don't think we can just handwave it as "details." It's *significant* that the focus of the characters and the story is specifically on retaining humanity's capacity to suffer. If the point were "to live, and the rest is details," the Pilot would just have said "To live."
          ```

          - u/CCC_037:
            ```
            I think that that significance is mainly in order to bring into sharper relief the hypocrisy of the main characters - they themselves are doing it with a kind of self-aware, very dry humour, but it also serves to highlight that aspect more to the reader.

            It's significant, but not because suffering is being presented as somehow *right*. It's significant because the continued ability of the human race to suffer is a part of the price that the protagonists are willing to pay.
            ```

            - u/CeruleanTresses:
              ```
              I don't think it's consistent with the text to interpret suffering as the price, rather than the reward, of retaining humanity's autonomy. In the "bad ending" we see Akon grieving his imminent loss of the ability to feel pain. He doesn't merely lament the loss of autonomy, but *specifically* the loss of the capacity to suffer.
              ```

              - u/CCC_037:
                ```
                [](/twishrug) ...you may be right. It's been a while since I read the story.
                ```

                - u/CeruleanTresses:
                  ```
                  For what it's worth, I'd have enjoyed the ending a lot more if it used your interpretation! I don't know if I prize autonomy *quite* highly enough that I'd have thought the 15 billion murders were justified, but it wouldn't have given me the same "what the _fuck_" reaction.
                  ```

                  - u/CCC_037:
                    ```
                    [](/twiponder) Here's a question one could hold a lively discussion about - which is worse, fifteen billion near-instant painless murders or allowing human suffering on several other planets to continue indefinitely?
                    ```

                    - u/CeruleanTresses:
                      ```
                      Depends how many people are on the other planets, I guess, as well as the nature and severity of the suffering. I'm sure there's some threshold sufficient to justify the 15 billion deaths.

    The Superhappies' compromise reminds me of [Failed Utopia #4-2](http://lesswrong.com/lw/xu/failed_utopia_42/), in that in each there has been an attempt to satisfy human values, but in each there have been other factors at play. I think on the sliding scale of utopias, while the Superhappies' offer is much better than #4-2, in each there have been controlling influences very clearly orthogonal to human values affecting how people live their lives and how, which of, and to what extent their values are satisfied.

    Like the Gandhi that doesn't want to eat the pill that will turn him into an unstoppable murderer, I think it is not unnatural to front resistance to changing your core values. Is it not possible that humanity, if unaided by Superhappies, may bring to fruition a future more closely aligned with human values than the literally compromised utopia offered unto them? If so I think it's possible to make an argument that the 12 billion people is an insignificant number compared to the unimaginably significantly larger number to come in the far future. 

    The question I think is how well have the superhappies captured human values. If you think they've basically done enough, and the value in both fast-tracking and securing their version of utopia is worth the compromise necessary, then I think that's fair. But I think it's also fairly reasonable to suggest that humanity could eventually produce a future for themselves that better and more purely satisfies human values without capitulating to alien influence.
    ```

    - u/CeruleanTresses:
      ```
      I'm certainly not arguing that it's unnatural to resist changes to one's core values; my objection is that the story frames that resistance as rational. 

      An argument could certainly be made that murdering the 15 billion is the only path to the "golden ending" where humanity optimally satisfies its existing values, and therefore the actions of the characters were rational. However, I have a couple of objections to that interpretation. 

      First, this is a lot more of a gray area than the characters imply. If it were a straight trade-off of 15 billion lives for an optimized human utopia, their absolute certainty that it was the right choice would make sense. But in reality the cost is (15 billion humans die + our opportunity for alliance and cultural/technology exchange with two advanced alien species is lost + we continue to satisfy our core values less optimally than the Superhappy compromise would have for god knows how long), and the reward is (perfect human utopia for some unknown length of time x the probability that we ever achieve such a utopia). The story treats this dilemma as a hell of a lot more black-and-white than it is. 

      Second, the particular human value that the characters most emphasize is our capacity for suffering. In the "bad ending," the last thing Akon does before being re-engineered is to pinch himself and regret that that's the last time he will feel pain. In the true ending, the Pilot's "triumphant" final words are "To live, and occasionally be unhappy!"

      I argue that the story portrays it as rational to hold suffering as a core value, and I also argue that it's *not* rational to do so. I've never seen any other rationalist work endorse the unfortunately common human habit of fetishizing unhappiness.
      ```

      - u/HeckDang:

        >I argue that the story portrays it as rational to hold suffering as a core value, and I also argue that it's not rational to do so. I've never seen any other rationalist work endorse the unfortunately common human habit of fetishizing unhappiness. 

        I'm pretty sympathetic to the basic gist of what you're saying, but I do think that it's not unreasonable to take the view that human values are often more complex than pure hedonism, and within that complexity there is space for things that are not necessarily easily or precisely mapped to happiness. Like, not too many people think of the lotus eater lifestyle as necessarily being the ideal - there are features and possible experiences of existence and consciousness that it is possible to value over maximally efficient pleasure, and to what extent it is possible to want to retain those values instead of converting to a lotus eater there is also an argument for the desirability of attempting a first and foremost human-value based utopia without superhappy values crowding them out. 

        Maybe you thought that the story didn't make any such arguments effectively enough, but I guess as someone unsure I can say I found it sufficiently plausible and perhaps correct. For what it's worth, if I can remember right, the first time I read the story I think I was more or less on board with the superhappy solution, and although I haven't read it in a while I think I would probably still take it.

        [Relevant SSC post](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/01/28/wirehead-gods-on-lotus-thrones/). Like Scott, I'm pretty okay with this future, but many people (like in the comments) aren't, and I am sympathetic to their point of view and do think I have some understanding as to why.
        ```

  - u/narfanator:
    ```
    I also do not like the True Ending. I don't really like either ending. I don't like this story so much because of what it says, but because of what it gets me thinking out.

    How would I try to convince the Super Happies not to modify humans in the way they want to? How can I argue for our current state given such radically different priors?
    ```

    - u/CeruleanTresses:
      ```
      How different are their priors really? To me it seemed that we largely value the same things, and they're just better at actually enacting those values. The only really critical difference is that humans have this weird thing of clinging onto suffering like it has some kind of intrinsic value.
      ```

- u/wren42:
  ```
  a pretty amazing read, yes, though as has been brought up before the legalized rape thing is a really odd non sequitur that throws off the thread of the story a bit.
  ```

  - u/narfanator:
    ```
    I disagree that it throws the story, or is a non sequitur. In the same way that from within their perspectives, both the Super Happies and Baby Eaters are moral and sensible, the nonconsensual sex is moral and sensible from the perspective of the modern humanity in the story. Since the story is more or less about such differences, it makes sense.

    There are three alien cultures in the story, and our viewpoint character is the Confessor, not the other humans. There are three worlds colliding, and we are spectating - not participating in that collision.
    ```

    - u/wren42:
      ```
      the confessor doesn't treat it neutrally, and I disagree that he is a mere spectator or that there is anything objective about his perspective.  EY is portraying an "enlightened" perfectly rational "weirdtopia" (as he puts it) and injects some of his personal opinions around rape fantasy culture in a way that is pretty off putting.  

      this is coming from someone who studied Nabokov extensively, and can fully appreciate the artistic use of rape, incest, and other taboo topics to push social norms and exert a reaction from the reader -- EY fails to do that here.
      ```

      - u/LeifCarrotson:
        ```
        I chose to read it as less of a personal projection from the author's idea of a weirdtopia/utopia and more as an example of something that highlights the Confessors' non-interference policy. 

        What other examples could you give of a social or cultural change that would be thoroughly confusing, repulsive or shocking to current sensibilities, but embraced by future humans?
        ```

        - u/wren42:
          ```
          weirdtopia was EY's own word, this is how he talked about the topic. 

          using another example is easy: make the human Civ anti-abortion.  This opposes most modern liberal values and laws, and the expected direction of human culture, and would provide the same "twist" to the reader while being something that could appeal to their ethical instincts.  Additionally, it would be more apropos thematically and give the humans even more skin in the game with regards to the baby eaters, and the final solution proposed by the happy people.
          ```

      - u/DCarrier:
        ```
        A weirdtopia is not his personal opinions that we find weird. The point of a weirdtopia is that whatever utopia we create is going to violate his sensibilities, so he creates something somewhat plausible that does so. If it were his personal opinion that he'd find himself at home in but the rest of us would find crazy, that would just be his utopia.
        ```

        - u/CeruleanTresses:
          ```
          I don't think we can ignore the fact that the "legal rape" revelation comes immediately on the heels of a list of ways in which this future society is super progressive and wonderful by just about anyone's standards.
          ```

          - u/HeckDang:
            ```
            I mean isn't that the point. It isn't completely super progressive and wonderful, it's weird. Values drift happens. Cthulhu may not actually always swim left, or maybe it does but there's some weird shit in that direction. Things considered abhorrent and abominable in society one year might be considered normal and inoffensive 100 years later, this is something that happens and has happened and will happen.
            ```

            - u/CeruleanTresses:
              ```
              I understand that the point is that value drift results in things one generation thinks are abhorrent being acceptable in another generation. What I take issue with is the specific way that EY framed this example in-universe. I don't think he took enough care to avoid implying an endorsement of this particular value shift.
              ```

              - u/HeckDang:
                ```
                Maybe, but I feel like rape is an act so consistently reviled that it would take a particularly uncharitable or careless reading to assume its endorsement by the writer. Note that most people tend to take issue with it here for example only do so out of the the mere potential of association with such an idea rather than any actual misunderstandings.

                In any case, it is a sensitive topic and I understand your concern.
                ```

                - u/CeruleanTresses:
                  ```
                  Where we disagree is that I actually think it takes a particularly charitable reading to avoid seeing this as an endorsement. I certainly prefer not to read it as an endorsement, since I otherwise like most of the story, but it skews closely to one in ways that make me uncomfortable. In some of my other comments here I've gone into more depth about why I think so. I appreciate your understanding my concern.
                  ```

            - u/General_Urist:
              ```
              I'd say it might actually be "super progressive" from THEIR perspective.

              Ask a guy from 300+ years ago what a "super progressive" society would be, and they would not describe anything similar to a European welfare state.
              ```

          - u/General_Urist:
            ```
            It does NOT help that there is an earlier line (Akon's "I've just been cyber-raped. No, I'm being cyber-raped right now." when he realizes how the Superhappies talk to him) that is written in and preceded by a tone that implies to the viewer that this future society *does* hold the same taboo towards rape that we do in the present.

            So there's mixed signals.
            ```

      - u/narfanator:
        ```
        I don't know of Nabokov, but I'm betting it's some form of violent rape...?

        I've been studying, thinking, and discussing a lot about consent recently (a group I'm part of has grown to sufficient size that it's necessary). One thing that's becoming apparent is there's something like three categories: consensual sex, nonconsensual sex, rape. 

        It's the middle category that's interesting. The classic example is a girlfriend giving into their boyfriend's pressure for sex before they're ready; classically, the boyfriend has no idea. I met someone once that had this happen to them (as the guy), and it fucked them up royally.

        This seems pretty clearly of a different category of thing than the classic violent rape.

        What is actually, directly described in the story is also not that. It seems much closer to the first situation.

        The confessor - meant to represent us, as the modern human - does not treat it neutrally because *we* do not treat it neutrally. They remain a solid viewpoint character for the audience.
        ```

        - u/wren42:
          ```
          Lol I was going to give you grief for not even googling nabokov but if you thought it was some class of unsavory act I suppose it can be forgiven. 😁

          Vladimir nabokov was a Russian American author, best known for his novel Lolita, which dealt with a predatory wealthy englishmans "relationship" with his adoptive preteen daughter.  It was highly controversial at the time, but is now widely regarded as one of the great works of English literature.

          I brought it up merely to indicate that I am not opposed to the use of taboo topics in art categorically.  I merely think it was done poorly here - and EY himself has admitted it was shoehorned in from an entirely different story.

          On the other point, I never once associated myself with the confessor or his perspective.  If that was the goal, it failed as well.  I would also object artistically to your interpretation that he "represents" the modern human. I don't find it so blandly allegorical as to demand a Everyman who represents anything.  The counselor is a character, like the others, and represents neither the narrator nor the reader.

    If I recall correctly EY later was asked about it in a [video Q&A](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1lq/less_wrong_qa_with_eliezer_yudkowsky_video_answers/).

    In [the video](https://youtu.be/Cy0QOTt9ajg) he (roughly) says:

    > "it may seem grafted on, which it was. It was grafted on from a different story where for example theft, is well not so much legal, as they don't have a strong centralised government, but something you pull off by being clever not a serious crime. [...] It develops out of a more organic thing where duelling, theft, non-consensual sex, etc. is governed by tradition not by law. 

    > Why did I put this into 3 worlds collide? I wanted to introduce a culture clash between their future and out past, and that was what came to mind. PArtially to see what kind of reaction it got, to see if I could get away with putting it in to this other story. 

    > [...] You can try to explain what happens in a society where people are less afraid and not afraid of the same things. **They are stronger than we are, in some senses, they don't need as much protection, the consequences are not the same consequences we know and the people there generally have a higher grade of ethics and are less likely to abuse things.**

    I'm not aware of him tlking about it anywhere else since then
    ```

    - u/wren42:
      ```
      Yes, he's also responded in some less wrong threads.  

      It *is* grafted on, it *does* feel awkward, and it didn't work well in the story.  

      Post narrative authorial meddling to explain background that wasn't in the story itself doesn't absolve these things.   The bolded text above is not in the story, so it can't be used to justify things in it. 

      If you are merely meaning this as an excuse for EY's *character* then sure, that's fine.  However he has talked elsewhere about "rape fantasy" from a social norms standpoint.
      ```

      - u/scruiser:
        ```
        I like your alternative proposal of the future society making all forms of abortion illegal.  It's more understandable, but nevertheless a divergence from modern liberal values, and it adds to the conflict with the baby eaters.  Unfortunately EY seem prone to avoiding certain kinds of criticisms and to revisiting past complete works, so this probably won't happen... unless someone writes a near identical fan fiction of it that contains only this minor alteration.

      I don't *quite* get it either, but I think the idea is that the old Reddit euphemism of "surprise sex" is literally how all the future-people see it, the entire connotation that the R word has for them; it's basically a more extreme, ubiquitous version of polyamory. The Confessor, who's from our own time, tells Akon "No, you don't get it, that word meant a very different and *horrible, horrible thing* in my time", but Akon is too many centuries removed from the horror to grasp it.

      It does make me uncomfortable (though that's mostly of the "I hope no one who doesn't understand the above paragraph finds out I like this story/author" persuasion), but the whole point is that their society is *so different* that it makes us recoil a bit, just as is discussed in the backstory in the Confessor chapter. It's about a difference in the *word* "rape" over 500 years, not a difference in how the reality of rape *today* is perceived.

        Like, to be clear: an otherwise shareable story is *effectively* ruined by this. If it didn't have this in it, it would be shared with my friends. It does, so I don't. Still a good story. I enjoyed reading it a lot. I understand what EY was thinking, I think, when he wrote that bit in and I believe he had the best of intentions.

        That's still some jacked up shit though and it means I don't share the story.

          ```
          I'm honestly considering rewriting that scene and sharing it 😜 I don't want to get in trouble for violating an author's work though
          ```

      - u/CeruleanTresses:
        ```
        But if it's only a shift in the meaning of the word, what's the point? If there's just some other word for what we now call rape in the future, and the word "rape" changes to mean something else, then legalized rape is basically pointless as an example of shifting societal morality. It might as well be the same culture, just one that uses a different combination of mouth-sounds to represent a specific abhorrent concept. 

        Plus, it wouldn't be at all difficult to explain to Akon, since the Confessor could just say "in our time the word 'rape' meant what we now call 'someotherthing.'"

        The only way this works as an example of shifting morality is if somehow what we now call rape just *never happens* in the future, and that's hard to believe without a good explanation.

        Edit: I've been going through the story again, and Akon does actually use the word "rape" to mean nonconsensual sex in his internal monologue. When he realizes that the Superhappies communicate through sex, and that therefore their end of the interspecies communication involves one of them having sex with an avatar representing Akon, he thinks: "I'm being cyber-raped." This seems to contradict the interpretation that the meaning of the word "rape" has changed very much.

        Edit 2: In fact, when discussing legal rape, Akon specifically uses the phrase "nonconsensual sex." The Confessor is the one who calls it rape. It seems pretty clear here that it is, in fact, nonconsensual sex that was legalized, and not some alternative definition of the word "rape."
        ```

        - u/DCarrier:
          ```
          It's not a shift in the literal meaning of the word. It's a shift in the culture, and in the connotation. Slavery meant the same thing in the 1700s as it does today, but it didn't carry the same weight. It wasn't considered a horrible thing, horrible thing. Heresy literally means the same thing now as it did in Old French in 1200, but it doesn't carry the weight today as it did then.
          ```

          - u/CeruleanTresses:
            ```
            Yes, I think that's a more plausible reading than the "it's only a change in the meaning of the word" interpretation that I was arguing against.

            So let's say we conclude that in this futuristic society, which is described as extraordinarily progressive and utopian by our standards, "rape" has the same literal meaning as it does in 2017, but is no longer considered abhorrent. And we also see that the Confessor, the story's purest rationalist who is framed as the wisest and most "correct" character, uses the fact that he once opposed legalizing rape as an example of why really old people are too inflexible/too caught up in the morality of the past to lead. 

            How exactly are we supposed to interpret this, with respect to its potential function as social commentary? I don't know for sure what the intention was, but the scene sure seems to imply that finding rape abhorrent is some kind of backwards, irrational characteristic of our society that will fade out as we become more enlightened, and that those who cling to the idea that it's *bad* to violate someone's bodily autonomy for sexual gratification are on the wrong side of history. It's not a pretty implication. 

            The obvious counterargument is that EY wasn't rendering a value judgment here, and was merely presenting a characteristic of this fictional society that is unpalatable to us. However, that whole scene really *does* seem to be framed with a built-in value judgment, for the reasons I've described. It's a sour note for me in a story that I otherwise enjoy (except for the ending).

              You should first imagine a future world where nobody can get emotionally traumatized by rape, anymore than most people nowadays won't be emotionally traumatized by e.g. unsolicited telemarketing, or unsolicited waving.

              If being waved at somehow became deeply traumatizing, it would of course (and rightly so) be utterly illegal to wave at you without your consent.

              If it stopped being traumatizing, then waving-at-people-without-their-consent would again lose its automatic illegality status. You'd then need a court injuction to say that no-I'm-disallowing-these-people-to-phone-me-without-my-consent-or-to-wave-at-me.

              In their future society, nobody can possibly be traumatized by unsolicited sex, and it's hard for the Confessor to explain why it was ever different, the same way it'd be hard for us to imagine someone who is deeply traumatized by unsolicited being-waved-at.

                Thank you for this interpretation; it got me thinking. 

                It seems plausible, but it requires a lot of reading between the lines. There isn't much in the text to establish why rape should no longer be traumatic. There's also no explanation in the text for why, for example, it's apparently legal to hold someone down and imprison them against their will (in the process of raping them). This is an area in which the "waving" comparison doesn't match up well--when you wave at someone, you aren't *detaining* them. Even doing my absolute best to look at it from this hypothetical future society's perspective, I can't imagine that there are no cases in which it would be seriously upsetting for someone to be raped, even if not because of the actual sex. 

                Akon seems to imply some kind of mutually sexy "consensual non-consent" scenario, but what's the logic in not allowing people to opt out of that? Legalizing rape might mean it's legal to act out that kind of scenario--which is *already* legal anyway--but would it not also mean it's legal to hold someone down and rape them while they're thrashing and screaming "no, I am absolutely serious, I don't want to have sex"? For this society to permit such breaches of bodily autonomy implies a value shift that goes far, far beyond a mere change in attitudes toward sex, and makes it a lot harder for me to buy their visceral opposition to having their autonomy violated by the Superhappies.

                And of course, if people in this enlightened utopian rationalist society are no longer traumatized by rape, then that carries the unsettling implication that enlightened people *should* not be traumatized by rape--that the experience of being traumatized by rape is a silly overreaction that we'll eventually move past. If that wasn't EY's intention, then I think he could have handled this passage a lot more carefully to avoid giving that impression.

                  But "holding down someone, or restraining their movements, against their expressed wishes" could indeed be a crime that's unrelated to whether rape itself was a crime. Hell, even *touching* people who aren't your friends might be a crime, and it'd be consistent with rape itself not being one.

                  Let's use the example of hugging rather than waving. In our current world hugging someone without their consent is not a crime, but hugging someone *against* their consent is (probably, I'm guessing) a crime. But the crime description probably doesn't include the words "hugging-without-consent" at all, because hugging-without-consent is not by itself a crime.

                  Akon is told by the Confessor the equivalent of: "It used to be illegal to hug someone, even your friends, or your spouse, if they didn't explicitly clearly and soberly agree to it in advance. If your friends were drunk they couldn't consent to being hugged and even if they initiated the hug, you should try to stop them from hugging you. Even if they were okay with being hugged in the past, you should always clearly get consent first every time you moved to hug them."

                  Currently, in the real world we don't treat unsolicited-hugs like we do rape, and that makes perfect sense. But it only makes perfect sense because of our current context and culture, where rape is much more traumatizing than unsolicited hugs.

                  > then that carries the unsettling implication that enlightened people *should* not be traumatized by rape

                  What does it mean to say that someone "should" not be traumatized by X, for any X? Hopefully, in an ideal world, nobody would be traumatized by *anything*, no matter what, because being traumatized is a bad thing that we don't want to happen to anyone. (Greek sidenote: trauma is the Greek word for 'injury')

                  This most definitely doesn't make it a "silly overreaction" for someone to be traumatized by things in the actual world. It doesn't make it their fault. It doesn't mean they can stop being traumatized by an effort of will. I don't think the phrase 'should not be traumatized' is meaningful in the way you mean it. It's like saying "should not be injured". When one is injured they don't get a say in it, and neither do they get a say when they're traumatized.

                  > If that wasn't EY's intention, then I think he could have handled this passage a lot more carefully to avoid giving that impression.

                  I do certainly think he *should* have handled that passage more carefully. Specifically I think that such topics that provoke strong emotions should be handled in focus or not at all, as it ends up counterproductive and distracting from the rest of the story.

                    As you said, hugging against consent is a crime, while hugging without consent isn't. But there's nothing in the story to suggest a legal distinction between "sex without consent" and "sex against consent." If it were made clear in the story that unsolicited initiation of sex is permissible but you still have to stop immediately if the person says "no," I would read it differently.

                    There are two possible meanings of "You should not be traumatized by X." One is the meaning I intended: "X doesn't warrant feeling traumatized." The other is the meaning you gave: "People would suffer less if they could not experience trauma as a result of X, so this is desirable." The same words can be used to express both concepts, but that doesn't make them interchangeable. My argument is that if we interpret the future-human society as being incapable of being traumatized by rape, then the story seems to imply that being raped doesn't *warrant* feeling traumatized.

                    > Specifically I think that such topics that provoke strong emotions should be handled in focus or not at all

            If so, this should have been made clearer in the story. But even then, now that I think about it more, is that really an example of shifting morality? In this interpretation, the society hasn't actually changed their perception that what-we-call-rape is abhorrent; they've just succeeded in eliminating it.

            In order for the legalization of rape to serve its apparent intended story function--which I believe is to drive home that this future human society in the story has morals alien to us--it really would need to be the case that future-humans no longer think it's abhorrent to force sex on someone. Which would honestly be a pretty off-putting characteristic for EY to write into a futuristic society, regardless of his intentions. 

            I don't mean in the sense that it merely makes the fictional society off-putting, but in the sense that it would make me side-eye EY. When an author makes a point of describing a society that is largely utopian by our standards, then immediately has a character from our near-future use *the fact that he once opposed legalizing rape* as an example of why he's too old and inflexible to lead, it comes across less like an effort to portray this society as alien to ours and more like an endorsement of legalizing rape. Even though the Confessor implies that rape in their society--for whatever reason--doesn't cause the immense distress it causes now, it's difficult to interpret this passage charitably.

              For example, not too long ago (and still in some countries today!), a husband inserting his penis into his wife forcefully and against her will isn't considered rape. So, in said time/place, you couldn't really say "Her husband raped her." and have the impact you may have today.

        I think the best description I saw related it to kissing. You probably don't imagine someone kidnapping someone to non-consensually kiss them for fun. That's more or less how they see it.

        I also find the gender role reversal interesting when he assumed it would be the woman initiating, an unfortunately easy part to miss. It wasn't too long ago that men were seen as the ones who must be virtuous and stand strong against all the women who want to get them into bed. Where in modern culture, men only care about sex, and it's up to the women to hold them off.

          It actually is sexual harassment today, so it is illegal.  

          On that note, if future people radically altered themselves psychologically, I could imagine they might view rape as less bad, but it seems like any reasonable set of legally-enforced personal boundaries would make rape illegal to at least some extent (grabbing and holding someone down, or pressuring them to do something they don't want would be illegal even if this bizaro future culture doesn't think the sex itself is a big deal).

          Maybe if Eliezer had the person from the 21st century try to explain to the captain how he is completely removed from not only historical context but the very psychology of baseline humans, the point would carry through better, but even then a lot of potential audience for the story is going to be lost.

            Wait, where did it say *that* was legal? Because my entire understanding is that they don't even think about "grabbing and holding someone down" when they think about "non-consensual sex". I assumed that assault and/or forcing someone to do something in general is a crime, along with things like harassment. 

            Another way to put it would be if someone in the story's universe did all of what you consider rape, except the sex, they would still have violated the law. The non-consensual sex doesn't need to be the illegal part.

              I mean, how do you think rape works?  Physical violence, threat of physical violence, inebriation with drugs, illegal social pressure, along with the actual sexual contact.  While it's true that the "physically attacked by a stranger" isn't the majority of rape, somewhere along the line, there is going to be something illegal to get around the lack of consent.

              > Another way to put it would be if someone in the story's universe did all of what you consider rape, except the sex, they would still have violated the law.

              How does the rape happen if there isn't something illegal to make it possible?  Why would the captain act as if rape was legal, if in practice it is impossible to force involuntary sex without violating some other law?

                Another another way to put it would be that what you think of as rape is illegal, but the non-consensual sex happens in a different way in a different part of their lives. It's not associated with rape to them, they can't even think of it.

                Factors like legalized prostitution or any number of things could make rape a rare occurrence to begin with. Then if there's a large enough facet of culture that that has integrated non-consensual sex into their dating, possibly made more likely due to elimination of STDs, unwanted pregnancies, etc. then it becomes one of those antiquated laws that gets in the way.

  This is a bit of a cop out when it comes to the moral dilemma in this story, and I'm not sure if Yudkowsky did it intentionally, but to me both endings were really awful and unrealistic. Actually, I find it difficult to understand how the Super Happy People and the Baby Eaters could be the result of normal evolution. [When it comes to the Baby Eaters, someone in TV Tropes explained it well:](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Headscratchers/ThreeWorldsCollide)

  >How come the Baby Eaters' life cycle didn't turn them into the ultimate backstabbers? The story claims that "cheaters" which tried to spare their own babies would be found out and ruthlessly eliminated, thus selecting for compliance with social dictates at one's own expense. But that sort of selection happens at the very end of the life cycle, among breeding adults. Selection pressure is always much, much stronger when it's applied to the early stages of life: if you don't survive your infancy, it doesn't make a damn bit of difference what survival-strategy you might've pursued as an adult. And the Baby Eaters' method of preying upon their own offspring - chasing groups of them down in pens, where only the fastest and most elusive escape their parents' maws - would tend to encourage betrayal as a way of life, i.e. babies tripping up other babies so their siblings will get eaten in their stead. If anything, the Baby Eaters that survive should be the ones who are quickest to shove their fellows into the path of danger; by rights, they should all be "cheaters", and should be pouncing on and killing each other, not their own young, when resources are limited.

  And even they were realistic, I don't think real humans would make the kind of decisions the crew made in either of these scenarios. My biggest gripe is that people don't commit suicide that easily.

    What do you define as "easily?" There exist people who jump on grenades spur of the moment to save their comrades. There exist people who willingly choose to undertake suicide missions to stop nuclear reactor meltdowns after careful consideration. Extreme circumstances often bring out not just the selfishness, but the altruism in people.  

    With the fate of humanity at stake, I think it's sufficiently extreme for pseudo-military leaders to make choices like those in the story.

If you taboo "suicide" we find that what happens could be described as "sacrificing oneself for the greater good" or perhaps "martyrdom" rather than our traditional view of "suicide" in modern times. And believe me, humans are [totally willing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks) to [sacrifice themselves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion_of_Jesus) for what they think are the [right reasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Guangzhou_Uprising) and have been for a [long time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae).

      I think OP was referring to the billions of humans who commit suicide (and filicide!) when they learn what fate awaits them, in the bad ending

        Ahh, that makes more sense. But I also think, upon being told that aliens are coming to transform you and all your loved ones into baby-eating blob-like versions of humanity, quite a lot of people would rather die. Whether it's as many as the story cites (I don't remember exactly what portion) is less knowable.

    The babyeaters were a reference to an actual experiment where insects were put under artificial selection pressure to have small brood sizes. The way the insects evolved to have small brood sizes was to eat  most of their young.

    > The story claims that "cheaters" which tried to spare their own babies would be found out and ruthlessly eliminated, thus selecting for compliance with social dictates at one's own expense. But that sort of selection happens at the very end of the life cycle, among breeding adults.

    Not if you kill the children they "cheated" for too. Hence ruthlessly.

    >And even they were realistic, I don't think real humans would make the kind of decisions the crew made in either of these scenarios. My biggest gripe is that people don't commit suicide that easily.

    Yudkowsky did quite a bit to give the impression that this was a completely different culture from yours. There are cultures where people would definitely die for their country, or maybe their entire species.

  Reread! Damn, I forgot how much I love that story.

  There are definitely issues; the situation was highly crafted, but I still find it amazing.

  One of the things I've been thinking about it whether it's possible to derive a more universal morality given [entropic life](https://www.quantamagazine.org/20140122-a-new-physics-theory-of-life/), [causal entropic forcing](http://math.mit.edu/~freer/papers/PhysRevLett_110-168702.pdf), and other things I've encountered. If there's interest I'll try to take some time tonight to write up more of my thinking.

  Big fan of this story, I think it was a very intuitive way to explore the concept of values. It is still among my favourite EY pieces as well, along with Sword of Good and Trust in God.
