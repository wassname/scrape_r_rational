## [D] The “Oops, better late than never” Romance In Rational Fiction thread

### Post:

I was distracted on Valentine’s Day for reasons, and forgot to make this thread. So I’m making it now.

As is often the case in these discussions, there has not been a large of amount of romance in rational stories this past year. The best by far is [*Worth The Candle*](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126) by cthuluraejespen, which contains a variety of romances people of various species and fantastical mind or society-altering abilities.

  I think rational fiction has a more general problem with (or at least a tendency toward) characters with inhuman motivation. Most are community/society/world-optimizers rather than satisfaction-pursuers - they're bent on changing the world and institutions around them (and willing to make heroic sacrifices to do it) rather than evaluating the options for how to live within their current society most enjoyably.

  The biggest departure from that I can think of is Pokemon: Origin of Species - Red and Leaf want (relatively) mundane lives as a researcher and journalist, Blue is admittedly more ambitious, but level-sets his ambition against the achievements of his grandfather and other Champions. None of them, say, thinks that the whole League system is a corrupt pile of bad incentives that needs to be swept away and replaced with a new paradigm for how humans interact with Pokemon in the way that Harry did with Wizarding Britain in HPMOR. Compare/contrast the Practical Guide to Evil where Catherine seems to continually seek out new and better ways to give up her humanity in order to keep her ambitions alive. In Mother of Learning where Zorian uses a variety of methods to allow his friends to transmit research data and memories through instances of the Loop, but uses the Loop more to avoid emotional engagement with potential romantic partners at least in part because it would distract from optimal use of the loop.

  It'd be interesting to see a rational fiction written about a protagonist who is rational and exacting in pursuit of their goals, but those goals are selfish and amoral - a satisfying love life, high status, power and resources,
  ```

  - u/Green0Photon:

    Definitely. Though, I still like the society changing ones, because there's a dearth of (good) ones in general. They're very satisfying, but it's hard to write a global plot while focusing on characters (the interesting part) at the same time.

    There should 100% be more rational fics about love. Maybe a fanfic of Kaguya-sama? As far as I know, that more deconstructs/parodies anime tropes rather than remaining rational.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      I got up-to-date on the (translated) magna a week ago. It does a fair bit of deconstruction, but the characterization *mostly* remains solid, and pretty firmly centered around the core concept of "two people want the other to confess". I'm not quite sure what rational fanfic would look like, except perhaps one or both of them understanding that they're in a deadlock (which also kind of happens in the manga?). The biggest sin the manga commits is hitting the reset button a few too many times, or having interruptions that stall out plot development, but they're not that egregious about it.
      ```

      - u/meterion:
        ```
        I actually think kaguya-sama did a fairly decent job at avoiding the romcom reset button trope. I was originally planning on writing a quick blurb about it but it turned into a character analysis through the entire series, so I'll put it at:

        While the reset button is hit situationally to keep their relationship from changing too quickly, their characterization and dynamic does not stop evolving and makes what look initially look like a typical reset actually have significant differences in their attitudes towards each other and the "goal" of their mind games.

        The pace being slowed by the other StuCo members having their own chapters and arcs is a valid complaint, but it helps keep the story well rounded and the rest of the cast from being a plot device to help/hinder their plans.
        ```

    I'd actually like to see a rational fiction written about a protagonist who is rational and exacting in pursuit of their goals, but those goals are only partially selfish and also remain moral - a satisfying love life, high status, power and resources, but only to use them for good, without totally sacrificing anything enjoyment wise. 

    Or someone who goes for total life optimisation, that is to say that the protagonist thinks "How can I gain utmost power and utmost enjoyment, AND do it morally? Surely if I am creative enough, the solution exists!"
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      Yeah, in real life you don't need to be taking over the world to be rational.

  It's less on the "rational" side of things, but *The Dark Wizard of Donkerk* at least partly centers around a romance; it's one of the things that people tell me I did well on. Only read if you can handle finished but unpolished and unedited things, [here](http://www.alexanderwales.com/darkWizardNaNo2016.html). (I wrote it, so take a rec here with a grain of salt.)

    Hey, man. Just binged your story over the last day and have to say well done. Romances are often badly implemented but I'd say you did a pretty good job. I have slight complaints about it seeming to happen a little too quick but overall, pretty top tier. I definitely have to praise the usage of point of view you've done. In a bunch of web fictions, there is the issue where POV changes result in the same voice being expressed in different characters but the thinking style and personality that you expressed in each POV worked well to fit with each individual character.

    Agreed, P:OoS gains a lot from being a rational fic starring 12 year olds in this sense. They try hard to grow rationally, but can also make exactly the kind of dumb mistakes kids make on romance that creates fun romantic stories. And hopefully they actually address them and grow!

          Considering Blue doesn't even have 3 badges yet, I would be very surprised if it's anywhere near completion. Especially since Blue is probably going to >!spend a not-inconsiderable amount of time as a member of Surge's gym!<.

          That said, I do expect it to speed up a bit as Blue gets the latter half of his badges. That's just a guess, though.

      Lots of magical systems use love. E. G. True loves kiss. Maybe a character has to cultivate true love to cure a curse
      ```

    - u/xavion:
      ```
      The True Love’s Kiss idea was mentioned, but there is another potential option.

      The Harem Anime, the rational protagonist somehow becomes aware that if they don’t get all their paramours to cooperate bad stuff will happen, so you’ve got a story where navigating relationships is the means to success. Any hook works, gotta get the kids working together to stop the capitalist business owner demolishing a park, party of fantasy heroes who will need to cooperate to have a chance to defeat the dungeons, crew of a sci fi ship you’ve got to stop breaking in chaos. There’s lots of ways to require people working together to get a goal, while having the goal such most of them aren’t motivated enough to put aside their disputes. The protagonist has to figure out how how to develop both romantic and non romantic relationships with a group who all want something to keep it going.

      The real issue with any premise is that romance just isn’t that rational friendly, you can’t so easily optimize others emotions so it’ll be less friendly to the kind of stories more popular here.
      ```

    - u/dinoseen:
      ```
      I don't think it would really be romance at all at that point. It's essentially just logic motivated brute force PtV. I don't think you can really have a romance story that takes away from the emotions too much, because emotions are too important to romance to go.
      ```

    bit of an aside, but I watch a show called the Magicians (currently in its fourth, excellent season) that recently introduced a situation where romance (or at least a love life) did have significant stakes.

    One of the characters gets infected with sexually transmitted lycanthropy. As a consequence of that, during an event called the Quickening, he must have traditional sex with a currently uninfected partner, or he will 'wolf-out' and rape/murder the first person he finds. Furthermore, if he does something like lock himself in a cage, he will 'wolf-out' and murder himself. The Quickening also causes him to have increasingly violent/sexual thoughts as he gets closer to wolfing out. 

    As he was currently single, didn't want to coerce or infect anyone, and had several other very important (as in 'the lives of him and his friends hang in the balance' important) things going on at the same time, this was a significant problem. I think the situation would actually be ripe for a rational exploration in securing romantic success that would have actual stakes, since one of the better ways for him to solve the problem permanently would be to secure a nice, stable, long-term relationship. Extremely contrived, true, but also one of the more interesting takes on werewolves I've seen in a while.

        It seems like doing something as simple as using a condom is enough to prevent transmission in this setting, so werewolves aren't all ruthlessly killed (especially since magic can probably make 'protection' even more air tight). Plus the whole thing was presented as an allegory for aids/other STDs when it was first introduced, so there are now limits on how 'rational' the show can get on the issue.

        And while letting yourself die would be 'reasonable' in the bigger picture, I don't think it would really be rational for most characters. Rationality is all about pursuing your goals in the best possible way, and 'staying alive' is a pretty important goal for most people.
        Still, that would add a bit more depth and moral nuance to the plot of this hypothetical story.

        It is kind of addressed in the story however. In the setting, magic is a secret kept by magicians (who are implied to be the top 1% of the population, brains wise, because magic is absurdly difficult to use/understand properly). Most magician werewolves we see manage the condition with relative ease, because of how magic can alleviate most problems. It is the non-magicians who get infected, and so don't know about magic/the wider magical world/what the fuck is going on during their Quickening, who are presented as a major problem, and I wouldn't be surprised if the setting introduces a squad of magicians who roam the world killing/capturing those poor suckers, despite how whimsical the show can be. As whimsical as the setting is, it is also one the spent a good deal of time presenting fairies as the classic, human-hating, ethereal beings we're all used to seeing... and then later revealed that faires only hate humans because, since fairies are literally made of magic, magicians used to hunt them down, kill them, and grind their bones into a magic enhancing powder (fairy dust).
        It's one of those weird shows that tends to have its irrational elements actually have been vaguely rational all along; the world is just so secretive/layered that the protagonists were operating with incomplete information the whole time.
        ```

      - u/Argenteus_CG:
        ```
        To be fair, assuming the description given is complete, there doesn't seem to be any prohibition against using condoms.
        ```

    - u/Kishoto:
      ```
      I read the trilogy that this show was based on and, even just based on this short description, it seems like there've already been quite a fair number of departures from the source material. Lycans don't even exist there.

      That being said, this may be one of the few times I'm in support of departures. The Magicians was overall a rather depressing series for much of its run and I can't imagine that translates well to TV.

      *Thinks about Game of Thrones' many, many depressing moments*

      Then again, I could be wrong.
      ```

  - u/elysian_field_day:
    ```
    I think there is another reason why rationality features little in romance, beyond the lack of stakes; while a smart approach does increase the odds of success in reality, the success or failure of a romantic move in a story often has very little to do with prior odds of success, and much more with the requirements of the story - while we on this subreddit share a dislike for unlikely, against-the-odds successes and approve of our protagonists using their intellect to achieve their goals, common romance tropes are basically the inverse of that. Applying rational thinking to romance is probably rather difficult to write if the romance is supposed to have tension and be narratively satisfying. That is not to say it isn't possible, as others have noted, WTC and other works have done it, but it seems pretty difficult to me.

  After a couple of successful months of publishing[ Vampire Flower Language](https://archiveofourown.org/works/13710744/chapters/31496223) on schedule a year ago, shit hit the fan in my coauthor's personal life that culminating in her quitting the project, I went on holiday, and it all kind of went by the wayside. I'm hoping to revive it - it *is* in my google docs almost complete bar some infill that needs to be done - but I need it to be edited properly, and have my coauthor run her eyes across each chapter and give me her blessing (I feel like the writing quality will be irreparably harmed by not having her write it "properly", but the perfect is the enemy of the good, so here we are). 

  That said, I'm going to be moving to Paris for 6 months this year, so realistically expect one or two chapters total. Maybe 2020 will be the year for it to work out :|

  I missed noticing that the thread for Valentine's Day was posted, so here I am posting all of my romance/sex positive recommendations two days late. At least I'm living up to the "Oops, better late than never" part of this thread's title.

  I'm too lazy to write up summaries for each rec, so I'm just copy-pasting the summary descriptions even if they aren't the best.

  These are all of the stories that I can find or think of where the characters deal with romance and sex in intelligent and reasonable ways (even if they don't necessarily do the same outside of relationships).

Everyone gets a career class once they start working, but Artificer became more popular than Adventurer years ago. There are dungeons, but they've been sealed. There are dragons, but they were nearly hunted to extinction and now the nature preserves are well guarded. Prostitution isn't illegal, which is good, because Cinnamon Wallace likes being open about who and what she is. The gods left the world years ago, it is said that they will never  return, not until all the world is dust, and the stars rain like fire from the sky. And so, when an Oracle prophesied that Cinnamon Wallace would one day meet a god, and be judged for her sins, the Oracle's words were dismissed. Surely, if the world was going to end, someone else would have also foreseen it?

  Speaking from experience, it's a challenge to blend rational fic tropes with romantic ones. Rational fic is usually focused on a character's ambitions, intellectual gains, and social machinations. The type of style that favors that tends to be more detached and focused on the plot, rather than the emotional arc of the characters. The tension comes from the characters solving complicated problems while the odds are stacked against them, and seeing them pull it off in a clever way is usually how the story resolves.

  Romance as a genre has a different conflict/resolution scheme. The characters are usually struggling with something (loneliness, ugliness, fear of intimacy) and they have to find healing/happiness through the romantic relationship. A romance will also have an immediate, close writing style, because that helps us relate to the characters and build tension.

  To somehow blend rational characters with romantic storylines, you really need to develop skill in building romantic tension and making the reader want the characters to be together, because they need each other. The romantic conflict should dovetail with the rational fic conflict, so that one affects the other. For example, the character winning an intellectual challenge will either lead to progress or regression in their romantic goals, in a way that fits naturally into the storyline.

  In all likelihood, you'd have to choose whether or not you want the rational or romantic plot arc to take take center stage in a particular scene or chapter. Not just because the writing style will be different, but also because sometimes you have to switch mental gears to go from reading one or the other.
