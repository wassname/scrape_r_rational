  A whirlwind of concepts, not really rationalist, but shows what a Hanson-eque singularity-drawn-over-years could look like.

  I was reminded of it when I started playing around with ethereum smart contracts. Thought it could do with a re-post.

  Great book, nowadays a tiny bit aged but still very high on my recommendation list. What most resonated with me is first quarter of the book, with the extremely high concept-density stross so liberally uses sometimes. 

  Also of note, Stross is on reddit as / u / cstross and frequently comments in /r/printsf.

  Couldn't finish it. Thought I would enjoy it a lot with how popular it is around here but the lack of rationality of the characters and the world just annoyed me too much. Like all the super extra processing power and upgrading and stuff yet everyone/everything seems just as dumb as normal. Sadly all the cool stuff would probably have been enough for me to enjoy it if I had read this long ago, wish I had read it then.
