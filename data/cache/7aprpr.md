## Request - are there any rational post-apocalyptic 'rebuilding society' stories?

  Parahumans 2 is shaping up to be one of these. Requires that you've read Worm.

  while the primary theme is uplift https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War fits this as well
  ```

    That's not post-apocalyptic
    ```

      ```
      [minor spoiler:](#s "It is, actually. It's just that the apocalypse happened a few centuries ago. There's even a zombie outbreak the characters have to deal with.")
      ```

        But that was so long ago it's like saying 450 - 300 B.C. Egypt is post apocalyptic (early bronze age) Egypt.
        ```

          Do you view Fallout as being "post-apocalyptic"?

          Being post-apocalyptic is more about the atmosphere of the setting than its history. Admittedly, the atmosphere of A Hero's War isn't *that* post-apocalyptic, but it is somewhat post-apocalyptic.

            It has much stronger vibes of "the forerunner race with great mastery of nature" even if said race did mostly blow itself and the world up. The evidence of that apocalypse is fairly rare and inconsequential to the main plot of the story.

  There's a worm fic called Setanta which might just barely count. Characters are not rationalists, but the setting is pretty well designed and realistic. Side stories go into decent depth about the process of building a town using a "flat-pack" building kit and a chemistry Bible created pre-apocalypse specifically to enable the reconstruction of society.

  David Brin, _The Postman_.

  Vernor Vinge, _The Peace War_, _The Ungoverned_, _Marooned in Realtime_.

    Thanks!

  S.M. Stirling's *Emberverse* series *may* qualify.
  ```

  - u/Marthinwurer:
    ```
    Yeah, I was just going to say that "Dies the Fire" would definitely count.
    ```

    On the other hand, it goes downhill after the first book when [](#s "the author's favorites become implausibly good at war, and the Wiccan religion starts spreading implausibly fast"), and then a lot farther down after book 3 or 4 when the [](#s "Alien Space Bats actually show up and start dispensing quests and crowning kings").  The first book's probably worth reading, but anything else is debatable.
    ```

  ```
  the anime/novel *From the New World* by Yuusuke Kishi fits pretty well.
  ```

- u/somnolentSlumber:
  ```
  Which fic are you reading?
  ```

  Localroger has covered this a few times. If you'll forgive spoilers, the much-panned end of the novella Metamorphisis of Prime Intellect is a very "close up" view of this (an Adam and Eve sort of thing), while the entire series of (very) short stories *Passages in the Void* details that from a "wide angle" view (robots seeding humanity on a new planet). 

  Both are good reads but I highly recommend *Passages in the Void*.
