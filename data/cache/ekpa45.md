  The PGtE will have a different update schedule from now on, for those unaware. New chapters will be on Tuesdays and Fridays, though they should be bigger to make up for 1 less chapter a week.

    Probably for the best, EE seemed very close to burnout on the last book.

  Welcome back. And how I missed the Black Queen actually well, being a Warlord.

  And a Prince is now Named. Cool.

  Edit:  
  > Hanno had also called on the memories of the legendary founder of the Valiant Champion’s bloodline to learn his delicious garlic lamb roast recipe, which admittedly some might consider an abuse of his powers. Not that any of his companions had ever complained when it was his turn to cook.

  There's an extra chapter for the beginning of the month as well.

  >Cordelia Hasenbach had wrought some sort of financial wizardry that’d greatly lessen the debt burdens incurred defending Procer. Something about bundling together the debts of many principalities and slicing that mixed greater debt apart before selling the slices to the Merchant Lords and banks of Mercantis, and promised yet more aid to come.

  LOL @ this CDS liquidity crisis in the making.

  Woooh Killian is back on-screen ! I had feared she'd get the Ratface treatment...

    ```
    It's not like real estate prices could collapse in all of Procer at once, right?
    ```

    - u/GeeJo:
      ```
      Turns out that if the walking dead move in next door and a combination of famine and war has left your village with more houses than people, your property suddenly isn't worth all that much.
      ```

    - u/JJReeve:
      ```
      It's fine, the debt isn't backed by financial assets, it is backed by Procer's willingness to use their warm bodies to prevent the Dead King from flooding the continent with his cold ones. The thing is that if they default on that everyone loses whether or not they bought the debt, so you might as well pitch in.
      ```

    - u/vimefer:
      ```
      And it's not like this will give every recipient of those loans an incentive to over-expose because they plan to default anyway, right ?
      ```

    - u/Iconochasm:
      ```
      With the massive population losses, real estate prices will probably tank anyway.
      ```

  - u/ATRDCI:
    ```
    In terms of worrying about lending from Mercantis, I think once things settle they aren't going to be in as strong a position as might be assumed. Presuming that Black ends with some sort of success in his coup against Malicia, literally every country on Calernia that Mercantis can realistically do business with (ie. not the Golden Bloom or Bellerophon [or Ashur in its current state]) will have fought against the Dead King in some capacity (disparate portions of the Free Cities nonwithstanding). They clearly work with those across the ocean, but basing themselves solely on that isn't sustainable. Certainly not at Mercantis' current size.

    &nbsp;

    The rest of the Grand Alliance isn't going band together to push for Procer to not have to pay Mercantis back anything, but if they wanted to they just about could. Especially since what ever mercenary pool Mercantis might hire from is going to be all but bled dry in between pushing against Keter and the bloodbath that will be the overthrowing of the longest reigning Dread Empress to ever live.

    &nbsp;

    Who knows what the final deal will be, but Procer and Callow aren't going to be bent over a barrel at then end of it. Hell, if things go extremely well, maybe it can be parlayed into a funding of Cardinal.

  > Farmers and miners and shepherds, innkeepers and drapers, scribes and carpenters and a hundred other things. Yet Lycaonese all, so they came wearing the steel handed down families since the days of the Iron Kings and there would be no talk of *retreat*.   
  ...  
   Their numbers had swelled with every band of volunteers, to almost one hundred thousand 

  I feel like this is a bad plan against the Dead King when every dead ally has the chance to become an enemy.

  > savagely fight their way through two beorns and a crippled Revenant merely to snatch the banner carried by the latter. It’d emerged three days later as a dishwashing rag in the Ostenhaupt kitchens, for the Alamans were making a game of finding the most insulting use possible for the Dead King’s banners. 

  Oh man, Robber would love these guys!

  > “Special Tribune Robber,” the goblin introduced himself, malevolently grinning. “I’m told you folk could benefit from a little sabotage of the opposition. As it happens, I’m not unfamiliar with-” 

  YAASS!  


  >“And what conditions would these be?” he asked.  
  >  
  >“*Is this going to be useful*?” Sapper-General Pickler grinned

  Heh, that's our Cat talking for sure.  


  > Something about bundling together the debts of many principalities and slicing that mixed greater debt apart before selling the slices to the Merchant Lords and banks of Mercantis 

  Uh oh. That sounds familiar... 2008 US anyone? Still, I suppose financial collapse is better than literal collapse.  


  > “You have corpses wandering your lands, Unicorn Prince,” General Rumena continued, its Chantant eerily good. 

  Uh oh... who'd he steal that from? Hopefully nobody that will be missed or that would be just terrible for public relations.  


  > Given how the drow were rumoured to learn such things, the fact that the old monster had a distinct Bayeux accent was distressing. 

  Yup, there it is.

  Well-written cavalry charges always have this indescribable quality to it that always make me feel giddy. I feel as if you can hear that thundering momentum and sense the weight behind the couched lances when I read those passages.

  Glad to see this back.

  Wait I though book 5 was supposed to be the last? I haven't caught up but that what I was told when I was reading it a while ago

    Book 4 was getting too long so it got split in half.

      ```
      Good to know. I prefer to read completed series, so I’ll wait for this book to end. Looking forward to it, I’ve heard great things about it.

        2nd book is a little slow, but it really picks up steam after that.
