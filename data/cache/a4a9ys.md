## Recommendation for a modern day human from earth is transported to another world fiction

### Post:

I have been  recently binge reading Release that witch , and was hooked to the idea of a 21st century guy transforming a society. Though I have seen some varients of the question, they are little old and seem pretty specific to CN/LN and not wider literature.

&#x200B;

Books which fall under similar category which I have read :

&#x200B;

1)  A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthurs court

2)   Nantucket Series by RM Stirling

3)  Cast away under an alien sun

4)   How a realist hero rebuilt a kingdom

5)  A Hero's Journey

&#x200B;

Have not read :

1) 1632 ( Was not able to get in)

2)  Cross time engineer ( Gathered from reviews the protagonist is kind of Mary Sue like character)

&#x200B;

I liked the technological advancements described in these works which I could relate to , also how the hero though knowledgeable needs other people for starting industrial revolution.

I am open to suggestions from CN/LN or fantasy

  Can't find a book by the name of A Hero's Journey, did you mean [A Hero's War](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329)? If not, then that's a recommendation from me.

  Here on Reddit, there's [Oh This Has Not Gone Well](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/61ya08/oh_this_has_not_gone_well/), a story that started strong enough but kinda... changed its mind on where it was going multiple times, and every turn made it less appropriate for this topic. I mostly lost interest around chapter 80, but keep reading out of habit and because the chapters are really short.

  More stories of similar quality are listed in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/6amn32/meta_looking_for_stories_like_this_has_not_gone/) post.

    >changed its mind on where it was going multiple times

    Given the title, maybe the author was just being very clever on a meta level?

  * Dr. Stone: The main character is a very precocious teen who has to rebuild civilisation from the ground up, with plot arcs running in parallel with the completion of different projects. This definitely meets your criterion of having other people involved with their own skills, and I enjoyed how they presented the ways different technologies are interlinked, but you may find the larger-than-life personalities, rapid pace of development, and strokes of good luck off-putting. First chapter spoilers: >!This doesn't strictly count as transport to another world, because the characters are instead petrified by a mysterious cataclysm and reawaken after millennia.!<
  * How to invent everything: Subtitled "A survival guide for the stranded time traveller", this book by Ryan North is nonfiction but might still appeal to your tastes

  Also, you might want to take a look at the TvTropes pages for [One-man industrial revolution](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManIndustrialRevolution) and [Giving Radio to the Romans](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GivingRadioToTheRomans), which have a lot more examples that I haven't read

    What should I search for finding "Dr Stone" , author reference would be great
    ```

    - u/Flashbunny:
      ```
      It's a manga, googling "Dr Stone manga" should get you it.
      ```

    - u/AurelianoTampa:
      ```
      If you haven't looked it up yet, Dr. Stone is written and illustrated by Boichi. Uh, be careful if you search just by author name... He has done a lot of NSFW stuff!

  Not quite "modern human transported to alt earth," more "extremely competent and well-trained modern humans try to bring back magic using time travel": *The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O.* by Neal Stephenson.

  A professor of ancient languages is recruited by a secret branch of the US military to translate scattered fragments that seem to point towards magic having at one point existed in the world. Also written as an epistolary novel which is great fun.

    Actually I have read the first 2 books of the series, still the MC seemed fixated only with guns and doesn't do much for other development.

  Medieval Tale by Lina Potter - modern Russian woman reincarnated into medieval type world

  Safehold series by David Weber - more advanced than 21st century, heavy military focus, but does try to address all aspect of uplift

  Belisarius series by David Drake and Eric Flint - 2 competing advanced intelligences come back to Byzantine empire and India, again heavy military focus but does address wider scope

  Destroyermen series by Taylor Anderson

  Raj Whitehall (The General) series by David Drake and S M Stirling

  older one is Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen by H Beam Piper

  David Brin's The Practice Effect may be interesting. It starts looking like what you ask for, but there is a bit more going on then that.

  Isekai, is the genre you're looking for.

  Destiny's Crucible series.
  ```

- u/dysfunctionz:
  ```
  The Lost Regiment series is this (I’ve only read the first book). An American Civil War Union regiment gets transported to a world populated by similarly-transported medieval Russians and starts uplifting them to 19th-century technology.
  ```

- u/JesradSeraph:
  ```
  Most books by Eric Frank Russell could kinda qualify, starting with Wasp.

  I see Dr Stone has been recommended already. If you like it you might also love The Blue World by Jack Vance, it is a short read, about descendants of spaceship-wrecked humans figuring out science on a world with no land at all (no obvious, mass mineral resources whatsoever).

  And then there is the Tschai series (Planet of adventure), by Jack Vance too, where a near-future human astronaut ends up stranded on a multi-sentient species alien world and works his way towards going back home. Not spoiling it but he ends up having a huge effect on the present civilizations.

  The webserial The Wandering Inn is both great and a decent fit for your desire, the uplift is slow and not very intentional. Fantastic story though.
  ```

- u/turtleswamp:
  ```
  I like the Wandering Inn [https://wanderinginn.com/](https://wanderinginn.com/),

  Though a lot of what I like about it puts it at the edge of your category as most of the impact the main character has is relatively local rather than world warping, and is social/cultural not industrial. 

  &#x200B;

  The Schooled in Magic series [https://www.goodreads.com/series/128629-schooled-in-magic](https://www.goodreads.com/series/128629-schooled-in-magic) is also good and more directly what you described.

  It's not an uncommon theme in fan fiction. Some of it's even fairly well-written. Are you looking specifically for original works?
  ```

  - u/user19911506:
    ```
    I am ok with both , I would prefer original works but would not give a well written fan fic a pass either
    ```

- u/Bowbreaker:
  ```
  Does anyone have a recommendation for the exact oposite?
  ```

  - u/SignoreGalilei:
    ```
    "The Ugly Little Boy" by Asimov is kind of the opposite

  What I really wanna see is that theme in cultivation novels. In those, it's actually realistic to be a one man scientific revolution, since you've probaby got at least a few centuries to work with.

  ~~Worth The Candle is kind of this, the 'other world' in question is an amalgam of RPG campaigns he has run.~~

  &#x200B;

  Missed the part about uplifting the receipient world.  Need to read better.

  - u/mbzrl:
    ```
    Yeah, it’s close, there is technological advancement but it comes from direct-from-Earth manuals and mostly happens offstage
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      I'd clarify that A) someone else already came and did as much uplifting as they could, but that was five hundred years before the story starts and B) the present-day of the story is roughly equivalent to 1930s in most respects, so there's just less room to uplift and C) most of the uplifting that's left to do hasn't happened in story yet, since what's left takes longer, there are unique circumstances, and the focus is on leveraging first-mover advantages rather than generally improving society and D) yes, so far most of it is off-screen.
