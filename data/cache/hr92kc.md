  Painfully realistic psychology here. I think most of the people who frequent this sub probably have some idea what it's like to be _really_ into something that people who are important to you just _aren't._

  There are experiences which I just kind of can't really share with anyone. Even if somebody was interested, I might have to give them _years_ of context just to get them in the neighborhood of understanding, and _I hate_ talking about myself and I _hate_ the sound of my own voice, so I empathize with Mira powerfully. Sucks to have something that's important to you, someone that's important to you, and no good way to connect the two.

  And I've been on the outside too, seeing that something is intensely important to someone, and realizing I'd have to cross an ocean of context before I could start to understand, with no guarantee it'd speak to me the same way.

  Well done. Great character sketch. I love the pro wrestling version of Beyblade tournaments too.

  ***Luke's girlfriend drags him to a Beyblade tournament.***

  a while ago I saw the phrase "rational romance" on this sub and haven't been able to get it out of my head since. This ended up not quite being that, but it focuses on a conflict I haven't personally seen in fiction before and it's heavily rooted in the thought processes/biases of the protagonist. Some other notes:

  * [*Worth the Candle's*](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25137/worth-the-candle) relationship-centric flashbacks were a big influence on this thing, but I think I drew more inspiration from AW's short fics, which always make interesting parallels between some aspect of a fictional word and a seemingly-disconnected theme. The story "[Sivad's Question](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13635237/1/Sivad-s-Question)" posted here the other week did the same with an even more ludicruous premise. I'm hoping this can scratch that itch for some of you
  * my experience with Beyblades is effectively nonexistent, and I deliberately avoided researching it. I wish there was a word like "nonfanfiction" to describe what this thing is. Of all the early-2000s-collectible-games that TV put in front of me as a kid, I think Beyblades was the one I understood least, so I hope that this story manages to communicate why someone might like *some* version of Beyblades - even if it's not *our* version of Beyblades - and how a game like this might work in the real world
  * a behind-the-scenes commentary explaining the writing process behind this thing ~~will hopefully be up by next month~~ can be read [here](https://wadapan.wordpress.com/2020/07/13/revolutionary/2/), which some people might find interesting

  That was nice, though I can't explain why other than that it's cute. Much like the other stories mentioned by the author, I may have to mentally chew it over a bit.

  I'm really confused by the ending, why does it end mid sentence?

  &#x200B;

  I've got to say the last part of it is really good.  Well done on the mixing of the interesting banter between buzzkill and roo with the protagonists' discussion on their relationship.  It felt really tense and exciting.  I felt like the main character skimming through what she was saying as I strained to pay attention to the match.

    I'm loathe to say "this story is about x", because it's about a few things, but in part it's about >!the act of being a spectator, both of the world around you and of your own thoughts. Luke spends most of the story stuck in his own head, but towards the end of the story the stream-of-consciousness gives way entirely to (two) external conversations. As the Buzzkill/Roo argument finally lets him start to understand the point of Beyblades, Mira basically absolves him of the need to understand in the first place. The final jumbotron beat is about Luke seeing himself from the outside. The story's "outcome" at the relationship level is no longer in question, and its outcome on the Beyblade level no longer matters, so there's no more story to tell, and the camera cuts away!<

    (I hope this explanation is good enough until I release the story's commentary. Also, it's fascinating to me that you skimmed Mira's dialogue in favour of the Beyblade stuff; the conflict for attention there was deliberate, but other readers that have commented on this were more invested in Mira!)

          I did consider various devices like these, and they'd definitely serve to eliminate the possibility of "wait, did this load correctly?". But with every one I tried, it felt like I was *easing* the reader out of the story, if that makes sense? A lot of how I wrote this thing was in service of putting the reader in Luke's head, and the last beat was an attempt to force the reader back out into their *own* head, making them conscious of their own thoughts on the final conversations. I have no idea how effective that was, but I think that ending on a full stop would just leave people like "yep, that was okay," and ending on an ellipsis would read a little too much like "too be continued..."

      I was definitely much more invested in the beyblade dialogue, too despite it being framed like I should be more engaged with the relationsip.

      Thank you!
      I think I latched early on to this mystery around why people could get so invested in what seemed to be a pointless game.  Then in the climax when this answers were coming together, mira's speech to Luke seemed less relevant to me.

  A good piece, feels close to home for some reason but I figure out why.

  I enjoyed this story a lot.  As somebody with a tendency toward anxiety and introspection, I often have difficulty enjoying stories told from perspectives like these, with a narrator very much in their own head.  It often rings false or too contrived. But your writing captured that particular kind of stream of consciousness in a way I found very satisfying.  Thanks, and I'm looking forward to working through whatever else you've written or will write.

  I am tempted now to nerd out on a closer critical reading of various things about this that I found tasty, but I don't know if that's something anybody would enjoy and it sounds like you intend to cover a lot of that ground yourself in a behind-the-scenes post.  I'll at least wait till that's posted.

    I mean, I'd definitely enjoy hearing your interpretation! The primary reason I annotate the things I write is that they rarely get that much discussion, so I kind of just... discuss them myself? It'll be a snapshot of my intent going into the story, not the definitive reading by any stretch!

  I think the weirdly good epiphany moment with Roo's take near the end elevates this. Good work, seriously. That take somehow made Beyblades cool.

  It reminded me of playing Digimon World with a cousin, strangely enough. The multiplayer for that game was a VS mode where you could pit two digimon saves against each other, and if the digimon wasn't trained in a particular stat, you had no real control over it. It was a lot like one of those wrestling staging games, with COM vs COM tournaments. Slotting beyblades into that category made it make sense again. I no longer need to wonder why my friends and me ever wasted money on crappy knockoffs when I was in elementary.

  This is definitely not the main takeaway of the story, but it was a surprisingly good bit of it.

    been thinking about this comment all morning. Somehow, despite including multiple child characters in this story, and implying Mira got into Beyblades as a kid, *and* writing the Roo dialogue that you're talking about, I gave very little conscious thought to the idea of Beyblades *from the perspective of* children, rather than in retrospect as an adult

    I like that you talk about Digimon here, because Digimon was something I neither understood nor had any first-hand experience with as a kid. So it reminds me that, past a certain level of obscurity, everything means something to someone, if that makes sense?

    my friends got me really into Pokemon when I was a kid, and I think the point where I lost interest was the point where it stopped being about me and my friends pitting our faves against one another, and became more about competitive strategies, and I was leaving my DS on overnight using a hacky way of levelling up Pokemon in day-care. When I was older, I inadvertently got a lot of friends into MTG, and years later many of them are at the point where they're spending lots of money on competitive cards and interesting combos, while I still like collecting commons and playing lots of beefy creatures. Maybe it's a self-fulfilling prophecy, but I've never considered myself particularly *skilled*, and I think that's why Beyblades as a skill*-less* sport makes sense to me. To this day, I enjoy rock-paper-scissors far more than the average person
