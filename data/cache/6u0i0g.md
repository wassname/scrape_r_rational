  ```
  Next time, open a gateway above a Summer Court City, and dump the Goblin Fire.
  Close gate.
  ```

- u/MoralRelativity:
  ```
  Well, I wasn't expecting that sensible decision from Cat. 

  She hasn't struck me as the sensible sort.
  ```

  - u/melmonella:
    ```
    Not sure what her goal was in making this excursion. It was rather obviously going to end in pain and lives lost.
    ```

    - u/DTravers:
      ```
      She was the vanguard of a larger train of troops that was going to use Arcadia for transport. Since they would be a ripe target for ambush as they came through, Catherine wanted to check the route for hostiles...and found them.
      ```

      - u/melmonella:
        ```
        Why go that far from the gate though?
        ```

        - u/DTravers:
          ```
          Because she had to open an exit gate somewhere else in Arcadia, and that meant marching through unfamiliar territory,so she was teed to scout ahead.
          ```

    - u/MoralRelativity:
      ```
      Yes, it seems a bit careless. Maybe some influence from her Winter Court energy/powers?
      ```

- u/None:
  ```
  >  rumours went around the camps about my temper, nowadays, but I doubted even Black would have been able to handle this level of futile squabbling with a smile.  

  Unreliable narrator thy name is Cat.  

  I wonder how she's going to get here force where it needs to go now.
  ```

  ```
  Honelty I'm not really interested in fairy politics. I want to know how the war with procer ends and so far we are having pointless delays.
  ```
