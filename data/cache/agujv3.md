  Brief summary: Chicago is a Madoka Magica fanfic that is a sequel to the author's previous fanfic [Fargo](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11228999/1/Fargo). Both are fairly dark and gritty stories about magical girls fighting against monsters and the machinations of Kyubey.

    Okay I'm a big Madoka fan with a long reading list, pleas forgive me, but can you tell me how Fargo & Chicago are rational?

      It's not particularly, it's just good reading with a protagonist who clearly identified their goal and works to fulfill it with reasonable actions.

        If everyone else is resonable for thier motivation and the magic ass pulls are at lest Madoka consistent I think you mean it's rational (AKA good consistent non tropey fiction) by the sidebar. 
        Thank You.
