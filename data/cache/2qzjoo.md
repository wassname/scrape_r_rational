## Happy New Year Everyone (if you go by the Gregorian calendar that is)!

### Post:

It's a brand new year upon us and I have decided to issue a challenge!

Make a New Year's resolution about anything and use your skills in rationality to keep it.

Don't forgot to share your resolution and how well you maintained it.

  Happy New Year to all of you who don't actually know [the New Year started in late September.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosh_Hashanah)

  I "resolve" to finish my Bayesian stats textbook, and start into my textbooks in Algorithmic Information Theory and Probabilistic Models of Cognition.

  Technically, I've started the latter already, and was already planning to do the former.  Aren't *rational* resolutions so easy?
