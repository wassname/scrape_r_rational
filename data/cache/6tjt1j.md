  Before anything else, have you checked this subreddit's [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index) yet?  It includes many of this genre's defining works and other works more alike rational fiction than unalike.

  Special recommendation out of the stories there is [The Waves Arisen](https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/about/), a Naruto fanfic in which Naruto is clever and in a unique enough position to exploit the system and skyrockets in power as the threats he has to face escalate just as fast.

  Alongside The Waves Arisen I can draw special attention to [The Two Year Emperor](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3xe9fn/ffrt_the_two_year_emperor_is_back_and_free/), a story about a Rules As Written D&D setting where a country's system of government involves summoning random people from the multiverse to be a dictator for two years.  The kingdom is under threat from a large foreign army, and the new king happens to be a D&D player from Earth; exploits ensue.  Like The Waves Arisen, the power levels skyrocket pretty quickly on both sides and it is very satisfying to read.

  Similar to Two Year Emperor, I can recommend [A Hero's War](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War).  The Inath Federation is under attack by zombie hordes, so the queen uses a powerful ritual to summon a hero to lead the quest for a fabled sword that will save the Federation from the hordes.  The ritual works and the hero begins his quest, but our protagonist is a materials engineer the ritual dragged along for the ride and dropped at the edge of civilization.

  To diverge from things from the wiki, I can recommend two stories with a remarkably similar premise given that neither was made knowing about the other.  [I'm a Spider, So What?](http://blastron01.tumblr.com/kumoko-contents) and [The Snake Report](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSnakeReport/comments/5xh4o7/chapter_0/) are both stories about a human dying and reincarnating into a fantasy world as a weak monster and having to draw on every resource they can just to stay alive.  I could go at length about in what ways they're similar and different, but suffice it to say that they're both very fun and you should definitely give them a look.

  Happy reading!

  If you're into Gamer type stuff, I think you might like [Worth the Candle](http://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249?view_full_work=true), which I'm currently writing.

  I assume you've read the [sequel to Luminosity](http://luminous.elcenia.com/story.shtml), the [various HPMOR recursive fics](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/3f9gly/list_of_stories_similar_to_hpmor/) (scroll down), as well as [Animorphs: The Reckoning](http://archiveofourown.org/works/5627803/chapters/12963046)?

  Since you've mentioned one MLP fic, I'd recommend anything by [Forthwith](https://www.fimfiction.net/user/173607/Forthwith), especially his (sadly abandoned) [Seeking Power](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/174671/seeking-power).

  You might like Eric Flint's first novel [Mother of Demons](http://baencd.freedoors.org/Books/Mother%20of%20Demons/index.htm).  Its plot definitely shows that it's his first, but the setting, crisis of survival, and kingdom-uplifting problem are still very compelling at least to me.

  Also, David Brin has a number of good books that partake of rationalist themes.  I'd especially recommend *Glory Season* and *Kiln People*, as well as his excellent and chilling short story "[Thor Meets Captain America](https://web.archive.org/web/20120712170314/http://www.davidbrin.com/thor1.htm)."

    Another great short story by David Brin is 'The Giving Plague'.
