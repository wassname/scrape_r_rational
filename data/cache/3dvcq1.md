## What are examples for extremely small probabilities?

  Odds of winning the jackpot at the Lotto: 1/13,983,816.

  Odds of winning the jackpot at the Lotto every draw for a year (the draws are twice a week): about 10^(-745).

  Okay, that's a bit low. (Edit: I dropped a logarithm somewhere, so this comment used to give a slightly more humanly relatable result. It's correct now.)

  You could always conjunct independent events till you get the right prob. For instance, the probability of flipping 70 heads in a row on a fair coin is about 10^-20
  ```

  How about quantum tunneling at the macroscopic level? There's a finite non-zero probability that all the atoms making you up would suddenly end up a foot to the left of their current position. Or a light year.

    And a much higher probability  (though still very small) that they end up in a configuration that isn't "you" at all.

      Oh geez thanks for terrifying me

    there's a fun short story called gravity mine. Civilization during the degenerate era. Eventually the protagonist finds a naked quantum singularity, slows herself down, and just waits. Given enough time, complexity will emerge from the noise.

    Drabblecast podcast gravity mine.

    Also, royal flush = 1 in 40 million, or something like that.

  I don't have the math. But you. Your existence. Is the result of an extremely small probabilty. And I don't mean that in the "You're a special snowflake" way. I mean that in the "Holy shit, the number of variables that had to coincide perfectly to give rise to the human race is ridiculously huge" :)

    Evolution is an optimization process.  The probability is only ultra-low as a *prior*, *before* you take the optimization into account.  Once you do that, the probability of *something roughly like us* existing somewhere, somewhen in the universe is... pretty high, I'd guesstimate.

  XKCD examines the odds of there being a literal tie in the US election. It's worth reading the last few lines at minimum.
