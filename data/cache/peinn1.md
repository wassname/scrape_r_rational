  I finally gave *Project Hail Mary* by Andy Weir a read. 

  After reading/watching a couple of pretty bad sci-fi recently (looking at you *Stowaway*), I was a bit hesitant to start/invest into a new story, but it turned out to be a pretty fun book. As far as rationality goes, I would say it checks off all the features of highly rational fiction in the sidebar (to varying degrees). Though I liked *The Martian* (and *Artemis* and even *The Egg*) more, if you liked *The Martian* you'd likely enjoy *Project Hail Mary*.

  The premise is pretty straightforward; the sun is dimming and Earth is in danger of an eternal ice age. A group of scientists is dispatched to find the reason for the former and a way of preventing the latter. The MC, Dr. Ryland Grace, is one of these. They find a possible solution to their problem is on another star, and so Dr. Grace and two other astronaut-scientists are sent in a newfangled spaceship to the Tau Ceti solar system, 12 light-years from Earth, to obtain said solution. Because of the length of the trip, they're placed in cryo-sleep, from which only the MC awakens, but has lost their memories. They're now on a spaceship in another solar system, all alone, and need to science their way into ensuring not only their survival, but all of Earth.

  Like *The Martian*, the story focuses on the MC being an intelligent person finding intelligent and realistic solutions to their problems. It puts heavy emphasis on their thought process and their examination of the world (ie spaceship) around them.

  The story is told exclusively from the MC's POV, with chapters alternating between their current state and flashbacks that flesh out the character, the problem and the setting. I actually found this pretty enjoyable, since it allowed for the gradual build-up and reveal of the MC while the story progressed.

  With all that said, there were a few things I didn't care much for (mild/major spoilers):

  * The tone/style of the book. It seemed to be always joking. This kinda makes sense given the main character's personality, but I felt Weir should have toned it down a bit. I felt it took away from the severity of the situation a lot of times.
  * We don't see what happens >!on Earth while the mission is underway. It would have been interesting to see what happens to society as the suns dims. There were a few predictions during the flashbacks (rising sea levels, food shortages, falling temperatures, food/climate wars), but we're left not knowing for sure.!<
  * Stratt (the woman put in charge of the science program to save Earth) was my favourite character, but we learn very little about her. >!Once the ship launches she disappears (with everyone else on Earth. I would have liked to see what she's up to at the end of the story.!<
  * Tons of mental math and "back of the napkin" calculations. Just bring a calculator with you.
  * I wasn't really satisfied with the containment problem. **(major spoilers)** >!A single-cell organism evolves in such a way that it can slip through a container that is airtight, and it's handwaved away since it's too complicated for the MC to understand how it's made.!<

  All that said, it was overall an enjoyable read. If you're a fan of someone solving their problems using sience! the this one is for you.

    Generally agree with your recommendation. *Project Hail Mary* gets a +1 from me.

    That said, if I had to come up with some criticism, I'd say that it's clear that Weir is heavily leaning on the template that made *The Martian* so successful. I wouldn't quite call it formulaic, but the protagonists are rather similar and the major story beats are predictable from light-years away. 

    Still, I'm excited for more in this universe, as Weir has hinted at. Astrophage is a marvelously thought out plot device and the aliens are refreshingly different. Also, there's a distinct dearth of slower-than-light space settings, which I really enjoy.
    ```

      > Weir is heavily leaning on the template that made The Martian so successful

      I got that sense too. Lots of the same beats in both stories.

      That said, MGM bought the movie rights for $3 million, and Ryan Gosling is going to produce/star in the film adaptation. So it is working for him.
      ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      > I wouldn't quite call it formulaic, but the protagonists are rather similar and the major story beats are predictable from light-years away. 

      I agree, but it's a formula I *loved*, so I'm honestly happy to read 3 more books in the same formula if they hit the same quality, y'know?

      I mean, there's a reason why reality shows have basically the same formula for their entire run: people like watching it, and why change it? Or, y'know, old school detective novels. Romance novels. Thrillers. "Scientist uses science to solve all his problems one after the other" is a damn cool formula, and it's not like it was invented by Weir.

      The setting of PHM was *very* different to The Martian, which helped. Even though Grace was basically Watney, the fact he wasn't *literally* Watney made a huge difference.
      ```

    - u/Weerdo5255:
      ```
      I've heard the argument that it's a reskinned version of the Martian, and I agree. I wouldn't call it a bad thing though, Weir's break from the formula he established on 'The Martian' with 'Artemis' was not nearly as good and I was afraid he was a one hit wonder. 

      If the snarky scientist in a bad situation is all he can do, I'm going to keep reading them. It's got a nice blend of rational and accessible, something I'd recommend to a ten year old cousin, and my own father.
      ```

      - u/Dragongeek:
        ```
        Imo the problem with Artemis was that Weir was too ambitious in the character department. Going from writing a character like Watney to a young Islamic woman who literally grew up on the moon is one hell of a leap. Also, the fact that she was unlikeable as hell didn't make it better. 

        The worldbuilding, science, and general plot was fine though, if driven by idiocy a bit too often.
        ```

    - u/sprague-grundy:
      ```
      I thought he did a pretty good job of exploring the neighborhood around his first success.

      The Martian was great, then Artemis was kind of meh, so it makes sense that he want back to the basic formula from the first book.  But he added some mystery notes and a second main-ish character.  Hopefully he works his way up to a whole cast eventually.

  ```
  Though it's hard to point to a single aspect that makes it so, "[Dungeon's Pet](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/43346/dungeons-pet)" - Royalroad, about a scholar studying a dungeon, from scholar PoV - seems written to a higher standard of intelligence than average.  4/5.

  For those of you who track everything I write, "[mad investor chaos and the woman of asmodeus](https://www.glowfic.com/posts/4582)" - a dath ilani in a D&D world - continues to update occasionally.
  ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    I also rec Dungeon's Pet. It feels like Humble Life of a Skill Trainer but with a better skill system. Instead of the plot railroading into politics it's more of a slow paced slice of life with a lot of time spent on exploring how skills work and upgrade. The protagonist is also likable, if a bit (too?) innocent. She's not that proactive though, and it seems like it's more external pressure that gets her to change rather than any internal convictions, which will make it un-enjoyable for some people. The writing is descriptive and a bit formal, pretty different to the usual Royalroad fare. Overall it's a good read, maybe even great if the plot reveals are good enough.

  Are there any Pokémon fanfics where game mechanics / synergies are exploited to munchkin / cheese implausible battles or other scenarios? Thinking things like [FEAR](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Appendix:F.E.A.R.) or whatever set-up was required for this [Magikarp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PArgnvqQ4) sweep. Potentially even a one-shot / omake -- just think it would be hilarious to see some mountainous, impossibly powerful legendaries towering over some elite collection of one-shotted pseudo-legendaries, only to fall to a flailing Magikarp zipping about lol.

  - u/jaghataikhan:
    ```
    Not in the game mechanics sense, but I rather enjoyed the tactics in A Game of Champions (apex of the fandom IMO, but warning- abandoned) and Olivine Romance (not the focus of the story however)
    ```

    - u/JohnKeel:
      ```
      Be warned for Olivine Romance that the focus of the story is soap-opera melodrama on a level beyond what you’d expect. I cracked up reading it a few times because I couldn’t take it seriously, even as the author is trying to make you feel bad for the characters.
      ```

    - u/--MCMC--:
      ```
      I remember quite liking and reading A Game of Champions back when -- does anybody know if the fourth ending synopsis was ever released? [Apparently](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ed2huy/the_game_of_champions_ending_synopsis_part_3/),

      > Lamora (the author) said the 4th part should be out before the new year, with a possible new year surprise.

      But I can't seem to find a P4 anywhere.

      Haven't heard of the latter title, will check it out!
      ```

      - u/jaghataikhan:

        Holy shit, I had no idea there was any plot elements shared by the author - in fact, I thought he'd even deleted the fic!?

            Damn, it's still so evocative even after all these years. Loving the slow assembling of the team vs. various foes (the kaiju battle vs Kronus is basically an Endbringer fight from Worm haha, down to the decay aura), and the leadup to the final showdown is giving me goosebumps
            ```

      - u/Phenoxx:
        ```
        Wow this is crazy. I had never heard of this author or story. But this tale of it being deleted and uploaded by someone else saying they didn’t want to let the authors great work disappear into oblivion is really compelling. I think it’s also very cool that there is closure to the story being given (one of my main reasons for being picky about reading mostly completed works) 

        I saw one comment mention that a “postmortem critique would be in bad taste” and another saying that it seemed the original authors notes were getting sparse at that point based on the chapter. 

        Am interpreting this correctly? Are they saying the original author is no longer alive? Or am I just tripping? I originally just thought this meant the author just stopped getting on whatever forum
        ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Do you mean regularly, or on occasion? For the latter, there are a few examples; one that comes to mind is ashes  of the past, where forex a fear Rattata is used to take out a Charizard, or a lot of mileage is gotten out of a moody Bidoof, but the vast majority of the screentime is not focused on that.

    On the other end of the spectrum, there's some competative match commentary I can link you on youtube, or some war stories (ie, a written account with explanations, thought processes, etc of battles) on smogon I could link you, although they're less common these days so there'd be old gen content.

    I'm not aware of much stuff in the middle. The closest I can think of is, like, learnset, but that one's been dead for a while.

    - u/--MCMC--:
      ```
      Mostly I was hankering a written, narrative description of some unassuming Pokemon exploiting the wonky game mechanics according to which the universe is run to perform implausible feats of battle prowess. But in a universe where those game mechanics are mapped as realistically to something resembling our own as possible -- so not as much "pokemon Y had 7 pp left on it's 100 base-power attack, which with a STAB bonus caused 413 points of damage, given this IV and EV spread". The raw physical laws would have to be obscured from view.

      I guess more broadly, I like the reversal of expectation that takes place in works like /r/onepunchman or /r/irlsmurfing. Where some arrogant foe resoundingly falls to a much weaker-seeming opponent.

  A few of my friends from the Bayesian Conspiracy Discord are doing readthrough podcasts:

  [2 Rash 2 Unadvised](https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/1755988.rss) \- a readthrough of *Too Like the Lightning* (and probably the rest of *Terra Ignota*). They've finished the first book, and are presumably moving on to the second.

  [Shaping Exercises 101](https://gorkyr.github.io/ShapingExercises101Podcast/shaping-exercises-101.rss) \- a readthrough of *Mother of Learning*. It just started, so they're only one episode in so far.

  Okay, I've recently re-read *Luminosity* and *Radiance* and was a big fan of both. Should I read *Effulgence*? It seems to be glowfic and not really in the same universe. I write glowfic, but I consider it low quality so don't publish it. Just wondering if anyone has read Effulgence and has comments on it. It seems hard to read as well which worrise me.

  - u/churidys:

    Not sure, but in general I would recommend [every Alicorn short story](http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/stories.shtml) and [Goldmage](http://goldmage.elcenia.com/about.shtml) for anyone who might have missed them until now, they're my favourites of hers.
    ```

      ```

  - u/DoubleSuccessor:
    ```
    Effulgence starts strong, so I would recommend at least reading the first couple arcs if you can stomach the format.

    You will however not get as much action with the Lum/Rad characters as you will want, though you will get some, mainly Elspeth. It's the problem of any truly great fanfic; it kinda ruins the rest of the fanfics in the fandom, because they are all merely fanfics of *canon*. You can get a little bit of a L/R-fanfic hit from Effulgence but it's not like, a full sequel, even added up.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Effulgence, relative to Luminosity, is:

    1. Less polished. It's written in the style of a back and forth, so you bounce between authorial styles, and even within the stuff that's just alicorns work it's less edited / etc. I think Luminosity / Radiance did a very good job of avoiding stuff like plot cntrivance, but effulgence has a fair bit more of it.

    2. More self indulgent. Luminosity had moments of this, but few enough that they were imo a positive; effulgence has significantly more.

    3. More content. More words, more characters, more varied setting(s). 

    Nevertheless, I enjoyed a lot of it. It might not be as good as Luminosity - or, honestly, even later alicorn glowfic - but it's still good, and it was much easier to read on and off as I had free time rather than in large segments like I prefer luminosity in. I will note, though, that I think the individual stories are much stronger before Pealing (ie, groups of bells), or at most in small groups of them, so on my reread I skipped a lot of those bits.

  Has anyone been watching the Apple TV show See?

  It’s about basically a degenerated society where everyone is blind. 

  I get thinking about worldbuilding in this type of medieval combat world they have and there are a lot of interesting things to think about in a fully blind human world. In the show they do have some pretty ingenious ways they’ve shown society has adapted such as hanging ropes above paths that can be used as guides using walking sticks. Another is that warrior helmets are just a full face dome without eyes gaps since they can’t see! Don’t need visor or eye gaps! Why didn’t I think of that

  One thing I’ve been thinking about is what type of weapons a blind warrior society would come up with. I feel it makes sense people would still be at medieval/melee combat since they don’t have eyes to aim. In the show it seems the default weapon is swords. I think it’s visually cool, but find it interesting to wonder what novel weapons do you think would be developed in blind on blind combat?? I feel like it might not be realistic for blades to be independently developed like that
  ```

  - u/SpeakKindly:
    ```
    There might be a lot of grappling. In that context, a sword wouldn't be very helpful, but you'd really want something stabby that you can shove through the gap in your opponent's armor once you know exactly where it is. 

    That's assuming you and your opponent are both heavily armored. If you're both mostly unarmored, you'd probably want something light and sharp that you don't have to swing with a lot of force. I can imagine something like a spiky tennis racket - as likely as possible to connect if you're waving it around with only a rough idea of where your opponent is, and sharp enough to hurt even if you only land a light, glancing blow. Poison might be involved.

    Ranged weapons wouldn't be crazy in situations where you're aiming at an area anyway. I doubt bows would be developed by the blind to begin with, but if they were, then a volley of arrows before a battle would work just as well for the blind. Especially if the area between your army and theirs is filled with traps that wouldn't fool someone who can see them for a moment, and maybe wouldn't even fool a blind person going slowly and waving a weapon in front of them, but would make a blind army hesitate to charge in.
    ```

    - u/RetardedWabbit:
      ```
      Bows seem unreasonable to me. Lack of vision, by everyone, drastically reduces both training, practical use, and upper limit benefit. Shooting targets would be grueling, there would be no intermediate training(hunting), and for little payoff(even massed fire uses a lot of "aim"). Especially if armor is more widespread.

      Javelins and other thrown weapons seem more reasonable. Before your lines of combat meet there's a short range where you generally know where the opposition is by sound and they can be more piercing. Or crossbows, but that's a lot of technology and craftsmanship for more armor penetration.

      Edit: My initial thought is that I have little idea how combat would function, but traps, armor, and fortification's power would be astronomical. Fortification's were already incomprehensibly powerful in our world, easily a 100x force multiplier, they would be even stronger without vision.
      ```

  - u/pldl:
    ```
    I would imagine that this would have to be low tech, correct?

    Most unique developments would be sound related. The more distracting/deafening/misdirection you can employ (that doesn't affect yourself) the better. Looking at the fight scenes on YouTube, there was some of this.

    On a more fantastical level, an extremely skilled person who uses modulation of frequency to somehow set up false expectations of location.

    Developments that exist but are far more effective are things that are sight-based. Caltrops (and similar) + thick metal shoes. Mobility and stealth will decrease, but you greatly restrict the movement of your enemies.

    Ridiculously shaped weapons. Random spikes out of a sword reduce durability and are delicate, but what if you don't know they exist?

    Spikey armor. Just for grappling. 

    Some weapon/device/armor that creates a cacophony of extremely high-pitched noise that groups of older warriors wear. This allows them to retain an advantage on the youth that can hear it.

    Whips. Can maybe deafen somebody?

  Last week, /u/PeridexisErrant posted a link to [Life's ending, life's beginning](https://www.tthfanfic.org/wholestory.php?no=14121) in response to a request for Buffy / Angel fanfics.  I quite enjoyed what there is, and it is sad that it won't be finished due to the passing of user becuzitswrong.

  Spoilers for the "worse than a cliffhanger" that it ended with, and speculation on what could have come next:

  >!Cadet Buffy Summers (nicknamed "Cali") is taking the Basic Airborne Course (jumping out of planes) on Army base in Georgia.!<

  >!During what would otherwise have been a routine training jump, Cali's main and reserve chutes have been destroyed, due to deliberate sabotage by some unknown agent that infiltrated the base. The chapter ends with Cali in free fall.!<

  >!Assuming this is the standard 1250ft jump, and the main failed, it would take a second or two to observe that, and pull the reserve. That would take around 400ft to fully deploy, at which point it failed. So Cali might only be a couple hundred feet above the ground. Worst case scenario is that she is still up at about 300ft AGL, falling at 30ft / sec. The good news is that she's unlikely to terminal velocity, the bad news is there is only a few seconds to react before hitting the ground.!<

  >!If the jump had occurred much higher, I could imagine someone early in the jump stick looking up to see her peril, and then detach his reserve chute, and with perfect timing and reflexes by all parties, Cali would catch the reserve chute, clip it on and pull it before hitting the ground. But that too has problems, mainly the horizontal separation between the jumpers of the stick, and someone early might be as much as a mile from the last to exit the plane.!<

  >!Anyone have clever ideas for Cali to escape this situation relatively uninjured, *without* giving away her Slayer toughness? As it is, a freefall from 300ft might be be survivable for the Slayer, and even if survived, she would suffer grievous injuries.!<
  ```

  - u/FireCire7:
    ```
    There’s nothing she can do without arousing some suspicion. People don’t typically survive dropping out of airplanes. The few cases with survivors are mainly due to having a cushioned landing (i.e. landing on a bush/fence/tree/water/fellow person). She may be able to glide or throw something to shift her trajectory slightly into something and then roll out of it. Alternatively, someone on the ground might notice and deploy a cushion somehow. This seems like a major setback for Cali, regardless of the details.
    ```

  - u/Izeinwinter:
    ```
    Given someone just attempted to murder her, discretion is pointless. 

    The logical implication is that her cover is already blown. That is actually a separate problem, because it means there will likely be a followup attack, since nobody who is in the know would expect a fall to be a sure kill. So cover maintenance is not the priority, exiting the fall in a state to either fight or flight is.
    ```

  - u/PeridexisErrant:
    ```
    I was expecting her to survive (a [cover-blowing superpower](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoverBlowingSuperpower) if there ever was one!), which would move us into an *interesting* phase of the story as some secrets start to come out.

  I've read some glowfic and enjoyed it, but now I could really use some kind of vague order to read things in, because it looks like they're crossing over existing glowfic with each other - which is fine, except they don't come with helpful links to the original stories, so I'm kind of struggling to figure out what I should read.

  I would appreciate recommendations, either for how to approach this or even for individual glowfic that don't assume I've read other specific glowfic.

    There's a few good choices for structured reading.

    The "official" work-in-progress [guide to Glowfic](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1_4Z2zdRKaSwZPm3S0X14DYoo7w46U_MZ4En6oOediNQ/mobilebasic) linked to on the flowfic home page.

    The wiki's suggested [reading list](https://glowficwiki.noblejury.com/books/glowfic-guide-compendium/page/reading-list)

    Finding a story you like and following the links at the top of the page to read everything else in the continuity. If it's a sandbox story, or one-shot or you're done and you still want more you can click on the characters name and read and their stories starting from their first.

    Personally after acclimating by reading a bunch of fun sandbox stories I read large amounts of efflugence, incandescence and silmaril to expose myself to as many of the common continuities and characters as possible. After that, when I came across an unknown character, I just read their introductory stories as necessary.
