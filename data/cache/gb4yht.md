## Nanocultivation Chronicles: Trials of Lilijoy - A rational take on Cultivation, Apocalypse, Virtual Reality, and A.I

### Post:

[Nanocultivation Chronicles: Trials of Lilijoy](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28254/nanocultivation-chronicles-trials-of-lilijoy) by Aetherial, is a story that is currently ongoing on Royal Road.

I recently started reading it and after catching up and following it for a while, I think it is a perfect fit for this sub.

As I said in the title, the series is a rational take on a whole suite of different genres and themes.

It creates a rational form of cultivation through a Sci-fi implementation of nanomachines, given cultivation themes intentionally by the creator.

It portrays a rational version of the apocalypse, caused by human greed, selfishness, and lack of communication.

It portrays a rational depiction of virtual reality, something that impresses me even more than the others in some cases as the genre is rife with wish fulfilment and power fantasy, by making the virtual world every bit as important as the real world, but without diminishing the importance of the real world at all.

Finally, it depicts a rational take on Artificial Intelligence, as something almost entirely alien and undefinable by the human mind, and how the existence of such a being would change the world as we know it.

I think anyone looking for a rational take on any of these genres should give Nanocultivation a shot. It also has some great characters that are incredibly unique (especially the MC), and worldbuilding that is incredibly interesting without taking up half the story.

    I don't know what you are talking about, plenty of people treat insiders as normal people, Lily is not unique in that, and if you are talking about the people from the academy village, then they *aren't* NPC's they are outsiders who have been oppressed and lied to, that MC and friends are trying to help.

    Also why can't a trope be rational when executed according to the rules of the world and in line with the goals of the characters involved? That is a core part of PGTE.

        She got a powerful teacher because ~~"reasons"~~ she did well on the trials, and Guardian (his subsets) like (to make use of) people with Tao systems.

        The reactionary part is true, though for me it's one of the very few cases where I didn't find that annoying.

  This looks cool! I'm going to have to see if there is a royal road app for ipad though, otherwise I'll have issues (I prefer reading offline a thousand times more).

    Sadly there is no Royal Road app at all, if you want to read an RR story offline, your best bet is using the browser add-on 'WeptoEpub' which when used on the contents page of a fiction, downloads it as an EPUB file. I use it a lot.
