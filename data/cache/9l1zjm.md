## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  How would *you* create a rational Avatar world? The mechanics and spirit of the bending powers is all you need to keep for this prompt (i.e. they're partly spiritual, firebending is about the concept of Fire rather than oxidisation), in as much as you need to do anything I say. 

  Keep the Lion Turtles? Have prehistoric cavemen like in the real world, only with bending? Etc etc. 

  Love to hear what you can come up with :)

    Bending is divided into four elements, with distinctions between benders of the same element largely being a result of training and aptitude. Bending is hereditary, but also somewhat tied to geography and spirit, meaning that two fire benders who have a child born in the Earth Kingdom and indoctrinated under Earth Kingdom cultural values will have a strong chance of their child expressing as an earth-bender. (We can think of the hereditary aspect as simply allowing a binding site for the element, with some kind of spiritual "Sorting Hat" element that takes into account expected personality, cultural background, parentage, and geography. It would allow benders who are 'against type', but they would be rare, and some people who have the binding site get a null binding, meaning that they're non-benders.) Most fire benders are aggressive not because that's their culture, but because those are the people who tend to get the bending power.

    All the other disciplines are an outgrowth of the four elements, either being adaptations of a secondary element's style/ethos, or a deep dive into what an element conceptually is. Blood bending, energy bending, healing, vine bending, sand bending, glass bending, void bending, lightning, ice bending, metal bending, et cetera all fall under "technique" which have variable difficulty to learn, being easier if you have a good teacher and approaching nearly impossible for some if you don't have the right aptitude/training.

    ----

    Practical consequences of this:

    1. Benders will most likely be of a specific, pre-determined ethos. Since benders are more powerful than non-benders, they'll tend to have disproportionate power, which means that culture and society will have a pressure in that direction. If the Fire Nation ever started to shift away from the pre-defined ethos of the fire benders, there's a good chance that they would face a coup (at best, they need to accommodate the benders).
    2. None of the nations can really have other benders in great quantity. There are a few strategies: hire benders from other nations, establish cultural enclaves within their own nation, or take territory from another nation and attempt to occupy it while still retaining their culture. All these come with costs and pitfalls, especially since there's a decent chance of fomenting rebellion or losing benders to emigration.
    3. It's hard to hold territory outside of your own designated environs. Even if you manage to wrest control from another nation, you're never going to get the kind of homogenity that you want, and you'll *still* get benders who are ideologically opposed being born there, albeit without much in the way of training.
    4. Since fire bending polities can absorb other fire bending polities with relative ease, the result *should* be that all the fire benders will eventually become unified, assuming that the civic technology exists to make that happen. Same goes for the other nations, except perhaps in the case that there's a large geographic separation.

    I don't really think there's *that* much that needs to be rationalized in the series/setting; it's relatively well thought through.

      How would you write a rational *Legend of Korra* then?

        You can keep a lot of the same stuff. Republic City is a culturally unified city that's meant to have equal representation of benders, and it's chiefly composed of immigrants. I don't think that the show dives deeply enough into politics to get at stuff like "Fire Nation is overrepresented in the populace" or "different national ethos cause frictions", but that's good fodder for exploration of some themes, especially since they're essentially the same themes as the "bender vs non-bender" core conflict of season one (which got undercut by how they handled it and didn't have a satisfactory resolution).

        If second (or third) generation immigrants are much less likely to have powers (since Republic City isn't of prototypical geography and culture is a mish-mash), then you get benders as foreigners and hardliners, which underscores and layers some of the bender/non-bender tensions, since it's not just "why should the benders have all the powers" but also this separate issue of "what do the powerless do against the powerful" and "what do you do when your ethos is disadvantaged by the facts of the world in spite of its moral correctness".

        Of course, if you really wanted to, you could change the rules between series, which would have its own effects. Since bending is partly spiritual, the "who gets to bend" issue could be "solved" by the Avatar at some point, especially if they realized the systemic/political issues with what's outlined above. IIRC something like that happens in Korra anyway, with the air benders coming back.

    Make the bending techniques secret, the same way China kept silk production and porcelain a secret for thousands of years. Have the four nations speaking different languages (or dialects) and using different writing systems to make it difficult to spread information from place to place. Use a feudal society where most people are bound to the land and their family, not free to travel elsewhere, so the spread of ideas is painfully slow, and information (like Greek fire) can be lost to time provided the secret is well-guarded.

    The world is just a place created by some lion turtles to keep their pets? Cause why would spirits separate from their property/territory/home willingly?   


    I don't know what else to change. The hybrid animals make no sense, except if some spirit created them. But it would be a different world without them, even if they are mainly fluff.  


    Maybe try to get avatar powers for everyone (you like)? There should be a way. Or use light bending to gift bending powers.  


    Find better martial arts that can be used by all benders (like the redirecting lightning is inspired by the water tribe martial art) or is specific for the avatar.  


    What do you find irrational? People trusting the avatar will fix things?

      Mostly this is inspired by the recent Avatar nitpicking thread.

      Probably what I'd do as make it so everyone has the potential to learn all bending styles, they just have different levels of ability. Some people would practically be non-benders, though, they have that little ability.

      I'd keep as much of the rest as I can, I like the flavour of the world.

  In a fantasy world where the technology is at about the renaissance level from us and (10% of the) people can summon temporarily material from (ectoplasm from) a different dimension/plane [(with some limitations detailed here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9g25b6/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/e619qk1/) and telekinetically move the summoned stuff. (Personally I want the power difference from magician to warrior be like tank to soldier)  


  What monsters could there be? And what powers do they have?  


  They should have an evolutionary path and be somewhat plausible (in that world). Also if possible their powers shouldn't be too different.   


  For example, some dragon species can summon flames from the dimension/plane that destroys someone elses ectoplasm (material). But they aren't the big apex predators they are in other fantasy settings. They have big wings and light bodies. The biggest species should have a main body about the size of a horse (+ wings). There are cat/dog sized species used as pets (or guard dragons).  
  Pigeon sized dragons (without flames) replaced pigeons.   


  Fairies can hide temporarily in the other dimension/plane. And are intelligent hand-sized insects with humanish proportions (google winged praying mantis). There are other insects that can do this.  


  Dryads could be bears/apes that can summon plants.  


  Goblins are... smart lizards/salamanders/sharks (on land)  
  Also, what type of state should there be? Or you find interesting and would fit the setting? Kings/Queens and Lords/Ladies? Democracies and dictatorships? Just city states like in ancient greek? Communism?  I don't plan to write about political stuff or mention it (more than once), but I dislike that all of fantasy has kingdoms as default...   



  Anyone has ideas how Chimeras, Manticores, Satyrs, Wolpertinger and similiar creatures could happen? I want them, but can't really find a way how to make them without saying a wizard did it. Maybe two creatures got fused using a portal in the other dimension... and somehow survived... and their genes combined (so they can have kids)... somehow... with the help of a wiz- f##k..  


  Anyhow I'm thankful for any input. Maybe you think they have a different technology path than us. (I just don't want too much chemistry aka explosives or steam power.) Or there should be vulcanos throwing out ectoplasm from the other plane/dimension (that vanishes before it gets back down). Or you have suggestions what the inhabitants would call the ectoplasm/material, creatures, other plane/dimension or I should call it to make clear what the ectoplasm/material does. (Cause all used terms are just placeholders for now.)  


  Thanks for reading, even if you don't comment :-)

    How about metal monsters that are pissed at the exploitation of their cousins? (ore)

    I think sticking to biological creatures only is needlessly limiting in fantasy.

    P.S. I think ectoplasm needs a shorter name. Ether, Pysche, Soulsomethingorother(soulmass? doesn't matter if it's not actually soul related, they don't know that!), but ideally no more than 2 syllables. It's going to be coming up a lot in whatever story features it, and 4 syllables is too long for it not to get annoying in my opinion.

  Under what circumstances would it be practical for kingdoms and empires with access to both guns and magic to still do much of their fighting with primitive weapons such as swords and bows?

  I'm specifically trying to rationalise Ivalice from Final Fantasy XII, but any other settings or original universes are welcome too :)

    Dune has a good take on the sword thing: most everyone worth assassinating has a personal shield that deflects stuff in proportion to its kinetic energy. So something moving very quickly, like a bullet, will be deflected away, but something moving slowly, like a sword or dagger, will get through the shield. It's a kind of classic sci-fi trope; Stargate SG-1 copied it, for example.

    To make it to a "guns and magic" thing, the magical charm that has this effect is very easy / cheap / long-lasting to cast. Bows travel significantly slower than bullets so you can just specify a cutoff above arrow!speed but below bullet!speed.
    ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    There is a simple magical means to protect against attack. It stops any object of sufficiently small volume that is going to strike the warded person.

    Now, the power requirements with volume go up exponentially. So, it stops a bullet easily; an arrow if you've got a really expensive charm, and a greatsword never...

    Or perhaps, instead of the volume of the missile, it's keyed off the distance to the enemy, so the closer you are the less effective it is. Something along those lines.
    ```
