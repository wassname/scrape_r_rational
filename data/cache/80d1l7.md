  This has some good bits, but overall I can't agree with the methods of the post... at all. This is pure guesswork not based on any conclusive evidence, and (in)conveniently not explaining some critical issues. For example, why is Tetra deemed a smokescreen and Abnazia the culprit? There is no solid evidence for ruling out the former.

  Similarly, 

  >  It is pretty clear that imperial artifact was used

  No, it's not. It could be a function of the marker, that RR had the know-how to use. Then, it could be another artifact, since we have 2 more unknown to us. But that's nitpicking. 

  The real issue is that this theory ignores a major factor: divinity. The gate and the 5 relics are divine artifacts made by the gods themselves, and later most likely entrusted to the angels. Evidence for that? Apart from being a mythical feat of magic on its own (recreating the world and running it for thousands months), we know now that the gate is feeding on the power of a primordial. Only the gods had the power to transform their foe's body (so to speak), into something really useful.

  This brings us to the *purpose* of the gate. It is not, as you may think, to train lucky individuals. The gods get a lot of shit in the story, portrayed as capricious and fickle, but if you look at their major accomplishments, they are clearly on the good side: created the habitable world out of initial chaos (whether the Dragon below is a mythical allegory or was an actual being is not really relevant), then proceeded to eliminate extinction threats until none was left (the primordials). Now, we know that these accomplishments can be undone. Primordials can be released back. So it is probable that gods also knew this and tried to devise mechanisms to prevent such major fuck-ups. Enter Sovereign Gate. Yeah, it can be activated only once in 400 years. Not a coincidence that the primordial jailbreak window *also* happens once in 400 years.

  Why the loop controller is a human? That's trivial! The spirit realm doesn't work in the gate, duh! Also if the gods foresaw their silence, double duh. In order to *prevent* the jailbreak the gods have to choose a champion, put him in the gate and enjoy their champion getting buffed AF and never letting the catastrophe happen. Any benefits the champion has afterwards are, well, a proper reward for saving literally millions.

  The divine factor is confirmed by the latest chapter. Zach has a divine blessing. Zach's family was in possession of the Gate. I can not agree that some rando shmuck activated the gate nilly-willy for his personal **destructive** goal. The gate was activated for Zach, by a (largely) benevolent divine force. Zorian and RR are unexpected noise in the system.

    I feel the same way. The gate (and its required artifacts) seem like an automatic failsafe to prevent Primordial incursions. The royal family had no clue how to activate the gate, and it hasn't been activated since Shutur-Tarana founded the Ikosian empire, which was at least 2000 years ago.

    There have been multiple planar convergences since then, but no godlike mages. 

    >"The Controller is marked by the Key, by the Maker, or by its agents," the Guardian said. "I am not aware of what criteria were used in choosing any particular Controller. It is ultimately irrelevant to my purpose to know such things."

    >"But the Key is lost," Zach said, frowning. "Scattered across vast distances. And if the Maker is a god like you suspect he is, well… the gods have been silent for centuries. That only leaves his agents. Who would that be?"

    The maker has to be a god (given the gate was made out of a primordial), the key was separated and unusable before the time loop, and the agents are likely angels.

    I'm pretty sure it looks into the future before a convergence, detects whether someone will try to release a primordial, then picks someone who has several traits.

    1) Large mana reserves (which it then amplifies), which the time loop provides enough time to gain more control of. (but a divine blessing likely helps with control, as well.)

    2) General good nature (unlikely to want the world ended, anyway.) Zach tried to get to know almost everyone at the Cyorian mage college, and generally hates being alone. 

    3) Locally based (so they know where to start looking, and have more reason to prevent the primordial being released.)

    The major problem with this theory is that the gate triggered early, resulting in fewer loops.  That was confirmed by the Guardian of the Threshold. If it's designed to detect and prevent a primordial being released, why would it be designed to trigger on the actual day of the planar convergence? That leaves too little time to loop, especially as the biggest expenditure involved is ending and restarting a loop, not keeping it going.

    I guess that could be due to an angel trying to do the work of a god, and messing up. The max time the gate can operate at is capped at a month (due to ethical reasons), so I suppose the gate could copy the state of the world a month before the planar convergence, and use that state when triggering later, but maybe that requires a god to do, and the gate/angels are more limited?
    ```

    - u/Xtraordinaire:
      ```
      Yup, pretty hit the nail on the head here about divining what happens during upcoming planar alignment and activating the gate if something suspicious shows up. 

      The premature activation may be not a mistake but intentional instead. Sure, it cuts down on the number of available restarts (how much, by the way?) but on the other hand it allows the controller to be buffed as early as possible. Suppose the gate was activated 1 day before the aligment. Sure, Zach now has, let's say, 10,000 months inside the loop. But he has **one day** to fight the invasion in the real world, and that is all that matters. One day is simply not enough to persuade and mobilize anybody, to craft golems and steal whatever artifacts you want for the mission and so on. It is clearly sub-optimal to activate the gate that late. Given the choice I would definitely take the option with less restarts, but more time to prepare in the one timeline that *actually matters*.

It is clearly sub-optimal to activate the gate that late. 

        Except the main expenditure of the gate is recreating the world. The thirty day limit is purely for moral reasons, not anything else.

        >"Wait," frowned Zorian. "So the time loop spends power per iteration, not according to how much time passes?" "Yes," the Guardian confirmed.

        The total amount of time in the loop is based on the **number of restarts.** 

        Having a one day loop would result in far less time available in the loop. A two day loop would be slightly better, a three day loop better than it, and so on.

        So it doesn't make sense that the loop was activated "early" if it's intended to stop the primordial. "Early" is the only way you'll have time to do anything! 

        But the Guardian of the Threshold **said** it was activated early. The **intended** time was the planar convergence. 

        >"The time loop is normally supposed to be initiated at the peak of planetary alignment," the Guardian explained. "Unfortunately, something seems to have gone wrong and the time loop has been activated one month prior to it. This made everything more costly, causing the time loop to degrade far more rapidly than it is supposed to."

        Given what we know of the gate's mechanics, that makes no sense if its function is to stop primordials being released.

        Which means one of three things to me:

        1) The gate isn't meant to stop Primordials.

        2) The main function is just to "create an uber mage" to whoever activates the gate (likely with the full set of keys), and the automatic "stop primordials" feature is just backup. The guardian is too stupid (or designed not to give away info, as we've seen), so it doesn't mention this.

        3) The gods used to be able to copy the state of the world 30 days before the time loop, then wait until near the convergence to activate the loop using the saved state. The angels can't do this, so they activated the loop early.

        The problem with this idea is that it would leave almost no time to prepare once the looper left the loop--they'd leave near the time the primordial was being released.
        ```

        - u/Xtraordinaire:
          ```
          Good point, but there are more possible scenarios:

          4) The efficiency of the loop rises quicker than the amount of days left until convergence drops, so the number of days spent may still rise. Maybe the loop is capable of millions of restarts at its peak.

          5) The simulation is not technically bound to end with the primordial release, so the controller can train after the release. Inconvenient but doable and the inconvenience may be worth extra 700 years of training for some controllers. 

          > The intended time was the planar convergence.

          The gate is a tool. The intended time of activation is when the Maker decides it serves the purpose best, and the guardian specifically stated that he has no clue as to what the purpose is. That is "between the Maker and the Controller".
          ```

          - u/None:
            ```
            I would also focus on the why of the Gate's existence. Maybe the Gods created the Gate to periodically drain the energy of the Primordial who was turned into the parallel world. The fact that the Gate creates an ubermage could be a honeytrap to ensure the Primordial stays weak. An interesting feature is that all Primordial prisons are connected to the parallel world. Maybe this means that all the restarts are doing is draining all the Primordials of energy. I mean resetting an entire Universe several millions of times would take an enormous amount of energy.

            This assumes that skipping a few Gate activations is fine as the last one must have been 4-5 missed ones before this. Although the last ubermage stayed inside 11 lifetimes which would turn a lot of people insane. Maybe the the last few branded individuals only stayed 1-2 lifetimes. As QI is 1000 years old (about 11 lifetimes at 85 years per lifetime) and still only a demigod means that there are some diminishing returns on molding exercises/spell research.

            I agree that someone with access to the Sovereign Gate in the real world is needed so that Zach could have initially entered the Gate. But that could just be the entity that gave Zach the blessing sneaking him in.
            ```

      - u/distrofijus:
        ```
        Your argument is a wishful thinking/assumption as much as is mine. We know for sure, that 400 year alignment is the best time for both summoning and both activating the gate.
        You base your argument on assumption that primordials can escape dimension permanently? It hold less ground if primordials at best can escape jail temporary during the time then dimension walls/anchor/whatever is holding them least, but they are back in jail. If the gods bothered enough them to jail, they might have as well bothered to jail them permanently so they don't have to do the same stuff ever again. 

        Also, as very well pulled a lot of the relevant facts by SpeculativeFiction: gate can be activated by controller who either:

        has full key (which is impossible)
        is either marked by maker (god) or its agents - angels. Marking here is the divine blessing. 
        Yes, Zach has got that blessing, but he had it already when he started at academy - so it quite a long time ago. Saying that divine agents forecasted/divined this situation couple years ago and chose Zach as one of the agents is.... thin. The counter argument might be that they blessed couple people just in case in advance might hold some water, but is very thin as well. According to the QI, pretty much the only people with divine blessings are the high tier priests/etc. If there's divine intervention, why put some immature boy, why not put high profile priest with huge weight to remediate situation during the loop? 

        When gate is activated, controller gets soul marker and is put into loop. 

        It is my argument why Zach was used as an anchor because the conspirator prince was lacking the key, he was not sure he would be able to manipulate any other high priest after getting him into starting the gate - Zach was a very convenient solution for his problem.
        ```

          > but he had it already when he started at academy

          Not true. 

          Or rather it can be true, but you can't have data on this. Mana magnitude is measured in magic missiles. Zach (and Zorian) did not measure their mana before their first class in battle magic (or whatever that class where they got to fire magic missile rod was). Zorian did not know his mana reserves before chapter 2, and there is no indication Zach did, especially considering his lack of academic success.

          > If there's divine intervention, why put some immature boy, why not put high profile priest with huge weight to remediate situation during the loop? 

          Why does it matter if the controller has 1000 restarts (80 years!) to mature in the loop. Unless you throw in an old geezer, the time within the loop outweighs all prior experience. And that's not to say that Zach is nobody. High nobility, wealthy, high natural mana reserves, not evil or corrupt, friendly and outgoing. He was a shitty mage, but that's exactly the flaw the loop can eliminate.
          ```

            chapter 62, exact quote:
            "Ha. Well, it's not just that," Zach said. "The fact I was able to keep up with the academy curriculum at all, even before the time loop, pretty much shuts down the theory I'm just lucky. I'm magnitude 50 in terms of mana reserves, but I can shape my mana as if I was magnitude 25 at most. That's too… convenient to be natural."

            if the SG is started at correct time, most likely it would have 10000 restarts. This, of course would help mature. But it's like hoping that each and every child would mature in nice manner  (especially within environment with no  consequences). 


            And you are telling that (im)mature child has better chances to overthrow conspiracy than high respected priest according to divine intervention? I'm not much impressed by such conjecture. What the child lacks (which is very well illustrated why they use Xvim to get knowledge from other mages) is weight and he can never get it during one month.

  I guess I'll post my own dumb theory again. I'll copy/paste, because I'm lazy, so my apologies in advance for that. **SPOILERS**, obviously:

  > Well, I guess it's time for my pet theory. I don't think it's Veyers the fire-guy. He was, by all accounts, an underachieving twat and he had no obvious connection to the whole loop business. We also haven't met him at all, so if in the end it's him going "HA HA! IT'S ME, GUY YOU'VE NEVER MET" it's going to be fairly mediocre storytelling - and the author, so far, has been really good at this shit. Also, he's the guy who's been propped up as the most obvious suspect, so by unspoken rules of mystery writing, he's the red herring.

  > We got a lot of foreshadowing about how simulacra can go rogue after a while if their originator isn't especially responsible and moral, and so far Zorian I believe has had his copies running for more or less the entirety of the loop with nothing worse than them pulling pranks on him. Zach is a nice dude but he also strikes me as someone with less resolve and self-control than Zorian and that foreshadowing, I feel, is more than just something to keep us on our toes. EDIT: Since I wrote this, Zach has actually learned to make them (again?) and they're already showing signs of this.
  > 
  > Then, Zach mentions there is an odd discrepancy between his abilities and his mana supply. You know what does that? Having a simulacrum out there. Admittedly, he mentions he has MORE mana than his 'magnitude' would entail, which is definitely not how we've been told it works, but once we're in weird self-empowered simulacrum territory, who knows what fuckery has happened? The anomaly doesn't match anything we've been told, but it's still a very suspicious anomaly in that specific area.
  > 
  > Zach doesn't know the simulacrum spell, sure. But he's also been thoroughly mind-scrubbed and, if my theory is true, that would be the number one thing to edit out. And, y'know, Zach might not be a huge-ass nerd like Zorian, but he's still someone who's spent his decades in Zero-Responsibility Groundhog Month Land grinding obscure powerful magic instead of just kicking back and pounding pussy for thirty years, including getting pretty good (if not as good as Zorian who kinda had to by necessity) at the boring ass Xvim-style shit just for the fuck of it, and him going "oh I guess I don't have a prereq to learn this incredibly powerful and useful spell, guess I'll just throw it away and never bother with it again" strikes me a bit off, if not entirely out of character.

(Although, have we actually seen Zorian keep one going up to the point of reset and then verify that?)

Except if they manage to survive the reset by taking over/riding in/doing other soul magic fuckery on someone else's body. (Poor Veyers, perhaps?) Except if, in last ditch effort, they try waiting the reset out in the Guardian's room. Except if they bind themselves to a phylactery by doing what liches use the simulacrum spell for.

  ```

  - u/SpeculativeFiction:
    ```
    I had this theory for a while. As soon as we heard about simulacrum going rogue, and Zach being entirely uninterested in the idea of simulacrums, despite his reserves making them perfect for him, it seemed like a good fit. Especially as Zach could easily have developed into an entirely different, bitter, hateful person with his origin.

    It has three HUGE flaws though.

    1) Creating a simulacrum requires immense shaping and soul magic ability.

    2) He'd have to have created the simulacrum fairly early in the loop.

    3) Zach has spent years with Zorian and Alanic developing his shaping and soul control enough to create a simulacrum, and he can barely do it now.

    Red Robe's mind magic is crude, and can barely work on Zach anyway. I don't even think Zorian could remove someone's shaping/soul control on a regular person (without killing them), so there's no way Red Robe could manage it on someone with Zach's protections.

    Edit: Also, Red Robe created a simulacrum of his own during the fight against the Aranea.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      There's another problem with the simulcrum theory, all simulcrums share the same soul. Zach's soul shouldn't be here anymore.
      ```

- u/None:
  ```
  It could be partway of the explanation of how Zorian ended up with a marker as well. Either RR modified the way the temporary marker works at the start, or modified Zachs such that soul merges produce jailbroken markers. Or RR spent most of his time trying to jailbreak his own marker, and that change is permanent, creating markers like Zorian's.
  ```
