## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  Mine is a writing question. I am working on a web serial that is still a ways away from being ready...but when it is, I am hoping to submit it for "rational review" so to speak.

  Is it acceptable to post it here a single time to ask for opinions on if it should have a "rational" tag on it? Alternately, is there any kind if writing review group that checks out works for that purpose?

  Ive worked fairly hard at making it a rational story, but I dont want to just declare it a success at achieving that without any input.

    Pretend it's rational, post it here every time you update as if it is, and if people complain that it's not rational then it's not rational.

    If you've worked hard on it, it's probably rational enough that people here will like it. And I've definitely seen people whine in the comments section when a posted story isn't sufficiently rational.

  The setting of [*The Unincorporated Man*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4025200): At birth, every person is "incorporated"&mdash;divided into shares (which grant voting power over the person's major decisions and a portion of the person's earnings) and put on the market.\* Automatically, each parent gets 20 % and the government gets 5 %. (Usually, a parent refrains from selling stock in his child, and wills such stock to the child upon death.) Primary+secondary education typically costs 10&ndash;15 % of the student's shares, and college 5&ndash;10 %,\*\* leaving the graduate with self-ownership of 30&ndash;40 %. In order to prevent situations where a person owns so little of his own stock that his cost of living exceeds his retained earnings (forcing him to rely on shareholders for room and board, and making him effectively a slave), minimum self-ownership is set by law at 25 %. (If that sounds low to you, remember that the story is set 300 years in the future and the productivity-to-cost-of-living ratio has risen dramatically.)

  I wouldn't recommend bothering to read the book,\*\*\* but I do think that the setting is interesting. Does it have any glaring holes? What if there were no 25-% minimum on self-ownership, and every person started out completely owned by his parents (or a 45-45-10 split between parents and government)? Would something like this system (e. g., everyone carries around an officially-stamped share-book, and every town and village has a registered share-stamper) work in a lower-tech setting (with or without magic)? (E. g., new law: Once per year, the king must provide proof that he owns a majority stake in himself. If he fails to provide such proof, he must immediately abdicate.)

  \*If this sounds completely implausible to you: The book opens with a 1962 Milton Friedman quote that suggests a system where people could pay for college by pledging a percentage of their future earnings.

  \*\*You can get a lower rate for college if you've been working toward a particular career path through high school. A person who doesn't know what major he wants to pick and who took random courses in high school with no particular goal will be a riskier bet and therefore will have to pay more.

  \*\*\*Summary: The titular person, a 300-year-old human popsicle from the 21st century, is revived, is outraged by the proliferation of what he sees as slavery, and starts a crusade to wipe it out.

    The logistics of holding a vote on someone's decisions escape me here.

    &#x200B;

    If I am trying to buy a couch am I suppsoed to call a shareholder meeting to vote on the matter?

    Then, don't all my shareholders have to call their own meetings to decide how they're going to vote on my couch purchase?

    &#x200B;

    How does anything actually get done with that cascading series of votes?

      I actually read most of this book! (not OP)

      But in general each person is considered their own CEO. Meaning they effectively make all decisions about their life, and must report to their shareholders with a monthly earnings report and justify it, and so on. Life decisions might be put to shareholders, but not smaller stuff like buying food and furniture.

      Also the couch would probably come out of their personal stock dividends (the 25%), unless they could justify it as a "business" expense. For example as a software engineer I might be able to justify buying a top of the line computer with my (pre-dividend earnings) revenue (or like with the IRS, claim that it will be used 60% for business and 40% for personal use and split it 60% revenue, and 40% personal dividend).

      Shareholders don't have to be consulted everytime. But they do have certain rights, like requiring a psychological investigation of the person's behavior. And I think at one point, a character (as a shareholder) even forces another character (the person whose shares are held) to undergo some sort of brain re-wiring procedure.

      The book doesn't really go into the details&mdash;but I think you're overlooking the existence of [rules](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9097) that govern shareholder voting.

      Even IRL, [not every decision requires shareholder approval](https://www.hutchlaw.com/library/the-basics-of-corporate-governance). The ~~CEO~~ incorporated person has leeway to do *some* things, but what those things *are* depends on what the shareholders have agreed to. Maybe *some* shareholders want to pass judgment on your every little action before you take that action, but most are content to check on you intermittently, look back on the past few days/weeks/months of your behavior, and take corrective measures accordingly. Maybe they'll pass a rule stating that a shareholder meeting must be called before any purchase that exceeds one percent of your annual gross income and before any unusual action that poses a large risk of impairing your future earning potential by at least ten percent (worded more precisely than that, of course). (And, really, how often will you be buying a couch?)

      Likewise, to me it seems overwhelmingly likely that the larger shareholders will push through a rule mandating that no shareholder under a certain threshold (1 %, 0.1 %, or whatever) need be consulted for a vote. (Small shareholders might still be counted toward the quorum, though.)

      Under such a system, cascading votes probably wouldn't be a problem too often.
