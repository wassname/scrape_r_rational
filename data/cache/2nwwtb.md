## [META] [Q] What stories should be included in a rational fanfiction group?

### Post:

https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Reddit-r-rational-upvoted/117575/

This is the current list.

https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9399640/1/In-Bad-Faith

https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5536346/1/Inviolate

These are two potential additions. I added every story from /r/rational that had over 10 votes in total and was on fanfiction.net having searched for all top posts. I added one that was on another site and also on fanfiction, Luminosity. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for if any of these should be excluded or included? Eliezer noted an issue with Time Braid. Does anyone have any suggestions for must have rational fanfiction on fanfiction?

  It feels like we need separate collections for the "fic that is explicitly rationalfic" and "fic that felt rational to a lot of people on /r/rational".  I wouldn't mind seeing Time Braid in the latter.

  I do anticipate that a lot of authors may not *like* having their work be called 'rationalfic' without being asked about that, which is why I feel like the first collection, "Rationalfic", should be mostly authors who've expressed approval of or inspiration by HPMOR, Luminosity, and the other seminal works.  Calling the second collection "/r/rational upvoted" is unambiguous, and kind to authors who may not approve of us (you can't control who upvotes you).

    I did note in the description. "These are stories that have been posted on /r/rational and which the community sees as rational and intelligent fanfictions." so I think the community which I started more fits your second category than your first. 

    I made it more explicit.

    >These are stories that have been posted on /r/rational and which the community upvoted.

    And I changed the title to reddit /r/rational 

    Do you think that would be ok?

    I see you gave a new name later on. I combined our names.

    I added rationalising death. The rest are already on the list, bar the non fanfiction one.

  ```
  Also, Natural 20, while being classic, might not be a rational fic. It is a Mk/DC fic.

  I think it would be very useful to readers to split the list into categories Complete/WIP/Abandoned. There are many of the latter two kinds, and some people wish to know before deciding to read. What do you think?

  EDIT: (Rationale: not all authors mark their complete stories as such)
