## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  Just finished watching Locke & Key. The show itself isn’t particularly good, maybe a 4/10, but the magic was interesting enough to keep me on the hook. I don’t recommend it, but I am curious to see what this sub can do with the keys’ powers. Spoilers for the whole show ahead. 

  -

  There are 11 magical keys scattered around the world, mostly within and nearby the Locke family’s ancestral home. Anyone can use the keys, but the Locke family has a special relationship with them: if a key is unclaimed, Locke children can hear it “whispering” under certain circumstances. Only one key can be heard at a time, and they seem to make themselves known at specific moments so as to cause maximum chaos. 

  * The **Anywhere Key** can be used in the keyhole of any door to travel through any other door you’ve seen, including those you’ve seen secondhand. Video and photo images are valid. 

  * The **Head Key** can be used on the back of a human’s neck to gain access to their mind palace. While inside the mind palace, memories can be viewed with perfect fidelity from a third-person perspective. Can also be used to remove memories, which are forgotten, or to import information by leaving i.e. a book inside. Emotions manifest physically in the mind palace as twisted versions of the host, and can be removed from the headspace to throttle their associated emotion in the host. Emotions removed this way are seemingly immortal (able to survive being buried alive) and will act singlemindedly in accordance with their emotional programming (n=1, a fear monster pursued and attacked things her host was afraid of). Items can also be securely stored in mind palaces, only retrievable by entering the palace or upon the death of the host. If the host is locked within their own mind palace, they become braindead (but can apparently speak single words if they try really, really hard). 

  * The **Matchstick Key** can be used as a concentrated cutting torch, or can draw a line of cascading fire on any surface. If plunged into a person and turned, causes them to ignite and combust. The user may be able to extinguish fires created by the key at will (n=2, small fires snuffed out in ways that could just be bad TV writing). 

  * The **Dancing Key** can be used to wind up the matching music box. While the ballerina is dancing, any command you give will be obeyed. Commands can be directed at the person or at the ballerina using the person’s name. It is unclear if the Dancing Key has a range limit; all instances of use were within line of sight of the target. 

  * The **Death Key** can be used on the death’s-head doorknob in the study. Walk through the open door to leave your body as an immaterial, imperceptible spirit which can fly and pass through solid objects. If you visit the cemetery on the mansion’s grounds, you can interact with any dead Locke (or maybe anyone who died in the house) who hasn’t “passed on” to the afterlife. Spirits can freely travel the house grounds, unclear if there’s a maximum range. If the door is closed, the spirit cannot return to the body; it is unclear if this causes them to die or if they continue to exist as a spirit. While incorporeal, the body loses all signs of life (though this doesn’t appear to have any ill effects when the spirit returns). 

  * The **Identity Key** can be used on the underside of a human's jaw to physically transform them into anyone. Unclear if the user has to have to have seen the person in order to transform into them, or if it has to be a real person. Clothes are included in the transformation.

  * The **Repair Key** can be used on the cabinet in the living room. If a broken object is placed in the cabinet and the door is locked, the object will be fully repaired the next time the door is opened. Does not work to restore human ashes to a live human, but unclear if it would repair i.e. a human and their severed body part. 

  * The **Mirror Key** can be used on any mirror to witness a creepily-smiling version of yourself beckoning you through. Once inside, you enter a mirrored hallway which shatters in response to noise or impact into a hall of mirrors, seemingly impossible to escape without help. Subsequent uses of the key on the same mirror grant access to the same prison (unclear whether each mirror leads to its own prison).

  * The **Echo Key** can be used on the door to the well house. Call the name of a deceased person into the well to summon an “echo” of the person, which cannot leave the well house unless it is given the Anywhere Key. If the deceased was possessed at time of death, summons a possessed echo. Echoes are extremely strong and durable, and are unable to be killed by normal means; the only ways to deal with an escaped echo are to trap it back in the Well House or to throw it through the Omega Door. 

  * The **Shadow Key** can be used with the Shadow Crown; place the key in the crown and the crown on your head to summon an arbitrary number of shadow beasts that can move through and take physical form within darkness. Shadows are very strong, but are banished by light, and also are seemingly quite stupid unless under direct orders (fighting with each other over who gets to capture the target). Can also be used to summon a shadow-version of yourself (or maybe anyone) with pitch-black skin.

  * The **Omega Key** opens the Omega Door in the sea caves. It opens onto a blue-black void of pulsing energy which shoots out orange molten bullets; when they strike a human they are instantly absorbed and the human becomes possessed. A person who enters the door is pulled into the void and swallowed. (This is probably a gate to hell.) Demons cannot take keys from members of the Locke family unless willingly given.

  OK, that’s the keys out of the way. Here’s the munchkinry scenario:

  You and ten other people of approximately your intelligence are each mailed one key, along with a letter detailing the powers of all eleven and letting you know that the Omega Key is in the possession of the last surviving Locke, who has barricaded himself in Key House. You have 4 goals to choose from; feel free to pick which key you start with or roll for it. 

  **Goals**

  *100% Complete* - collect all 11 keys and keep them safe

  *Guardian of the Mortal World* - collect the Echo Key, the Head Key, the Identity Key, the Dancing Key and the Omega Key and keep them out of the wrong hands

  *Altruism Run* - use the keys for as much good as possible, whether or not they’re in your possession

  *Hedonism Run* - collect and use whichever keys you need for as much personal gain as possible

    On the Head Key:

    >  or to import information by leaving i.e. a book inside.

    So if I leave a hard drive containing Wikipedia inside someone's head, they'll have a *tonne* of knowledge.

    What about if I leave a cellphone with an active internet connection? Or the remote control for a small flying drone - can the drone be mentally controlled even when said drone is outside the user's head?
    ```

    - u/LazarusRises:
      ```
      Good questions. I'm going to say Wikipedia works, internet connection and drone control don't. You also might have a hard time dealing with all the info from Wikipedia--the one time this was done on the show, the guy couldn't shut up about the topics of the books he imported.
      ```

- u/siuwa:
  ```
  The following power is based on Phara's Swordbreaker, from *Senki Zesshou Symphogear GX*.

  The power destroys any and all physical objects perceived as a sword.

  Activation is upon contact with your body or an object imbued with this power, by touching the object and willing it. 

  The perception is dependent upon the wielder of the object, so the easiest way to counter this power is just to not think of whatever you're using as a sword, although truthfully believing so while wielding it like a sword could be quite hard.

  The specific wording is irrelevant; a Zweihandler is affected as much as Excalibur is affected as much as a lightsaber.

  The physical object need not resemble a sword; as long as it is perceived as one it will be affected.

  The effect propagates at c. The sword is physically erased from existence (potentially creating a 'glass half full' situation).

  Given these parameters,

  1) How would you use this power in real life?

  2) In what setting would this power be very effective?
  ```

  - u/covert_operator100:
    ```
    You could erase anything you possess from existence by getting a blind and delusional person to hold it and telling them it's a sword.  
    Altruistically, you could also apply this to radioactive waste and other dangerous substances.

    With brainwashing, you could get that person to run up to your enemies, grab them, and then think of the enemy as a sword.   

    As for things that you don't possess:  
    You could 'push' the power, always attempting to use it on the thing your enemy holds, while taunting them about how they hold their 'sword.' Even a moment of indecision, and it's gone.

    Do you have to touch something to wield it? Can a person hallucinate that they're holding a thing, then have that thing destroyed? What happens when you destroy something that only exists within one person's subconscious imagination?

  I've recently been reading some Harry Potter fanfics where the MC's just have giant piles of gold lying in vaults. A bit deus ex machina, really.

  So, my question is this: if you were transported into the Harry Potter universe at the start of the first book, how would you get rich, if, a) you could use magic, or b) you were a muggle?
  ```

  - u/Izeinwinter:
    ```
    Wealth is pretty meaningless to wizards who are not goddamn idiots (so, a handful of them)
     -Potterverse magic is powerful and versatile enough that a wand and the education to use it is a cornucopia machine. 

    However, UK magical society is also horrifyingly dysfunctional, which.. honestly, probably ultimately because of the damn imperious curse being a solvent of both all social trust and all efforts towards justice. 

    So if wealth is shorthand for "live long and prosper".. emigrate. To another magical sub nation if any of them are more functional than the UK, if not, just live in the muggle world while using magic with abandon to make your life better. That move is probably why ravenclaws dont run everything, they just study enough occlumency to make their minds sovereign, then peace the heck out to live in a magical beach house.

    ... how to make it rich as a muggle-in-the-know? Concierge service to the above crowd?  classes on "How to pass as a retired investment banker" and the like.
    ```

- u/Veedrac:
  ```
  You have a power that lets you take the result of any formal mathematical function and invert it to find its inputs. This ability works even if the function isn't bijective and if you don't know the function used, though there are some reasonability constraints here and there that you don't know the full details of.

  Assuming you know modern technology and computer science, but nobody else in the world does, what's the lowest hanging class of exploits you can use this for?

  (I'm asking because this is relevant to a small number of paragraphs in the next chapter of the story I'm writing, and I feel I'm not thinking about this perfectly straight.)
  ```

  - u/covert_operator100:
    ```
    You can get the answer to a bunch of impossible problems, but nobody else finds that impressive because they haven't even invented proper cryptography, let alone computer processing.

    You could write a bunch of papers on the subjects, and be praised for your ingenuity hundreds of years after your death.

    But as for applying it to problems during your life, we'd have to know what time period it is.
    ```
