## Rational Naruto Fan-Fiction

### Post:

I’ve decided to take the helm of a rational Naruto fan fiction story. 

So far I’ve decided that I’m gonna have Jiraya be an integral part of Naruto’s life in his youth. Naruto will not be “stupid”, abrasive, loud, mischievous yes, but never stupid. The whole Mizuki fiasco was will be handled in a way that reveals that some of the Anbu know of Naruto’s true heritage. 

Naruto will also not be hated and shunned upon. Yes, he won’t have many “friends” but people such as Sakura (who in my story is actually one of the few people that will actually have a convo with Naruto) will talk too and listen to him. His status as a Jinchūriki will be prevalent throughout the story as will the other Jinchūriki as well. Naruto’s chakra, to those that can sense it, is considered dark and corrupted.

The themes of Naruto will be more serious and some will be changed all around. 

I’m still trying to figure out how to change Chakra into an interesting “magic” system. I might take cues from Hunter X Hunter’s own “Nen”.

  In the vein of rational Naruto fics, take a look at *Team Anko*, *The Waves Arisen*, and *Lighting Up the Dark*. *Marked for Death* also features a more internally consistent world than canon, with reasons built in for why the world is like this, and how ninja are all inherently glass cannons, especially as they grow stronger. Jutsu development and seal design are both incredibly dangerous fields that will absolutely kill you and everyone near you if you are not very very safety-conscious.

  Beyond rational fiction, this concept of "Naruto but this time he is smart and skilled" has been done many many times. Feel free to completely ignore me and pursue the story you want to write, but I'd advise finding a premise or core idea that is more unique and distinctive. Doing something as simple as changing the protagonist can make things far more interesting, for both you and your readers.

    I'm about halfway through Marked for Death, and it's very enjoyable. Well written, internally consistent, good character interaction. Aside from some gripes about stuff inherent to the questing and dice rolling system, I only have two complaints about the story. One, the description of the sealing system is rather obnoxious. It's like the authors set out to write the most r/iamverysmart system they could come up with. Two, Kagome's dialogue. Repeating "stinking stinkers" and "boom, squish" is obnoxious and repetitive. The character himself is fine, but would be much improved by removing those dialogue quirks.

      Could you clarify what you mean about sealing? The way I see it sealing is intended to be a technical profession, but the quest masters don't want to have to actually design said technical profession (because spoons) so they just say one is there, which you can learn. Given the lack of hindsight and the penalty for slip-ups that the format imposes, this seems like a totally reasonable narrative choice.

      The actual game-visible mechanics and societal systems and implications seem fairly straightforward, though, so I don't see why you'd be criticising that either.
      ```

      - u/sicutumbo:

        I dislike the bits talking about "errors cascading in 13 dimensions", the initial descriptions of infusing that made it out to be some sort of transcendental experience to make simple seals, and things of that nature. I understand that the quest writers don't want to have to actually make a right system for how sealing works, but the particular way they did it seems needlessly pretentious. As far as I've gotten, this hasn't affected the actual plot of the story, aside from Hazo making a mistake and slipping into weird chakra space thing with a whale, which I found ridiculous.

        My minor gripes with the gameplay mechanics/quest system boil down to the quest participants making occasional dumb decisions that I don't think in-universe people would have, and the dice system being overly simplistic. I've only just got to the part where one of the authors talked about redoing the whole system, so my criticism probably is a little late, but I disliked the amount of variance inherent in skill checks determined solely by dice. Even if large numbers of dice will average out to a fairly consistent value,  it rankles that such a huge variance in abilities is even possible. "Oh, you prepared specifically for this opponent, and designed strategies for neutralizing them? Tough luck, your three extra dice came up to 43 points." I don't think anything like this actually happened, although I mostly just skimmed the die results, but it being possible is silly.

        (Yes, the dice part isn't really inherent to the system, but I really just wanted to skin over that part

        I also want to stress that I do enjoy the story. Just minor gripes about it that I can't forget.)

          > 13 dimensions

          For what it's worth, a dimension is just a parameter with which something varies independently of other dimensions. To quote Wikipedia,

          > In mathematics, the dimension of an object is an intrinsic property independent of the space in which the object is embedded. For example, a point on the [unit circle]
          (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_circle) in the plane can be specified by two [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates), but a single [polar coordinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate) (the angle) would be sufficient, so the circle is 1-dimensional even though it exists in the 2-dimensional plane. This *intrinsic* notion of dimension is one of the chief ways the mathematical notion of dimension differs from its common usages.

          \- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension#In_mathematics

          Saying errors can cascade in 13 dimensions just means that there are 13 orthogonal parameters needed to specify it. This likely sounds worse if you use laymen definitions and imagine the users are unfolding 13 spatial dimensions in their mind. If you just worry that it "sounds" jargony, well yes, but that's how people speak in technical fields. I find it hard to communicate at all about the technical things I'm involved in to people unfamiliar with it.

          It makes sense that building simple seals *should* be complex and difficult, because seals are much rarer than they would be if these seals could be made by the average ninja. This follows from the fact that Hazō and co. find carpet bombing incredibly effective, and the only convincing explanation for that not being the de-facto form of combat involves supply restrictions even for the simplest tier of things.

          > "Oh, you prepared specifically for this opponent, and designed strategies for neutralizing them? Tough luck, your three extra dice came up to 43 points."

          My understanding is you don't get dice but (effectively) bonus points for situational advantage.

          Quick note, the Whale thing is of questionable canonicity in my mind. That was when a prominent poster, OliWhail, became a co-GM, and they pretended for a day that he sacrificed himself and got banned from the thread in order to save Hazou.

    I’ll be sure to check out marked for death but Naruto isn’t gonna be smart but he’s not gonna be seen as the under educated kid that we know he’ll be more of an below/above average intelligent kid due to Jiraya’s influence.

      Marked for Death isn't about Naruto, to be clear.

  Try reading [Dreaming of Sunshine](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7347955/1/). The point of divergence is that the author is born as Shikamaru's twin sister. She gets put on team 7 instead of Sakura, who goes into the medic corps. Naruto is his normal self, but Shikako (the SI/viewpoint character) helps him a lot with tactical thinking, and by the time of the Chunin exams he is using clones of himself transformed into kunai for surprise attacks/duplication of kunai.

  In terms of slice of life and character interactions, she makes friends with Naruto and to an extent Sasuke early on. Naruto and Sasuke both lose their loner statuses, and they all become a tight knit team, capable of overcoming the ridiculous missions they stumble into. Sasuke also isn't the edgy emo kid he is in canon, which is an immense relief.

  There's a lot more focus on the various women in the story as well, as canon did them no justice. No major spoilers, but Ino gets a summon contract and character development, Sakura gets to study under Tsunade much earlier, and Tenten helps with developing special storage scrolls that get her praise from Tsunade.

  Lots of stuff with Shikamaru as well, and just generally a lot of well done character interaction.

  Shikako also studies chakra a lot, along with sealing. In addition to being a good chakra sensors, she deals with chakra systems a lot, and is called in to help when Kakashi's sharingan starts malfunctioning. The whole chakra system is much more defined and predictable than canon.

  Finally, yes, it is an SI fic, but the SI has a hazy memory at best of details about the world. She knows general plot points, but that's about the extent of it. There are plenty of missions and other important events that she has zero warning of at all. The fic also started before Naruto the series finished, and the author has said she thinks a number of things are dumb and won't be appearing in her story, namely Kaguya and the chakra tree thing.

  The story is around 700k words right now, updating sporadically but without any huge hiatuses (last update was a week ago), and is currently plowing through the timeskip era.
  ```

  - u/waylandertheslayer:
    ```
    I want to add a warning: this story is pretty awful at doing anything other than the stations of canon, and has very poor pacing. The fact that it's hit 700k words and isn't even in the endgame yet is a massive red flag alone.
    ```

  - u/Revlar:
    ```
    I disagree with your rec. This story is essentially just a rewrite of the exact stations of canon, with the movies worked into the timeline, with the shallow addition of a POV Self Insert.
    ```

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      And if I thought Naruto the show was less annoying then I might care that DoS heavily followed the stations of canon. As it is, DoS removes the half hour fight scenes that are mostly just flashbacks or people panting, it removes edgy emo Sasuke, it removes the stupid bloody nose arousal thing, and in general it removes a lot of idiocy. Those things alone make it at least a 7/10 to me.
      ```

    Ehh, I’ll have to warm up to it I don’t really like self-insert stories but I’ll try it out cause the description you gave was definitely interesting.
    ```

      ```
      For what it's worth, I also strongly recommend Dreaming of Sunshine.

        I’ve been reading for the past hour or so it’s pretty good so far.
        ```

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      I, obviously, recommend it. The SI bits are very minor, and the author has no intention of exploring how a real person got inserted into a fictional world. Even if the SI bits put you off, the rest of it is an extremely good match to what you said you want to write in your post.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Okay I’ll try it out and see how I like it. 

        Have you ever seen Spawn or read the spawn comics, if so, do you think that deserves a rational fic ? as a friend of mine has been asking about one for a while and wants to be sure that he’s not writing the rational spawn story for no reason.
        ```

        - u/sicutumbo:
          ```
          Cool! Hope you enjoy it.

          Haven't seen Spawn, no, so I can't say if it does or doesn't deserve the rational treatment. Sorry I can't help.

  The naruto universe is mostly interesting because it has a social structure in which almost all the nash equilibriums suck. 

  .. Explaning: You know how murders are rare and almost always solved in some european nations? This is an example of a good nash equilibrium - Professional criminals rarely kill because they know the cops expend enormous effort on solving murders, and the police can expend enormous effort on solving murders that need that because murders are rare and mostly crimes of passion, so the total resource burn is not that high. 

  Everything about the naruto universe is the opposite of this. All their social structures are at stable equilibrium points that are very, very bad because the magic that can move the world fell into the hands of what is essentially medieval criminal cartels.  

  So, the rational thing to do in this universe is social reform, except that the villages would try and kill you for it. And probably succeed. 

  I so want to read a naruto-verse fic which is all about someone trying to exfil without getting on the wanted list, or just attempting to get clear of the entire social order.

    >So, the rational thing to do in this universe is social reform, except that the villages would try and kill you for it. And probably succeed. 

    Ironically, that's exactly what Naruto's goal winds up becoming in canon. It's also what the First Hokage did, by creating the "ninja village" system, since as bad as the equilibriums were by the time the story happened, they were even *worse* back in the day.

    [Walk on the Moon](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10779196/1/Walk-on-the-Moon) has that as the long-term goal of the protagonist.

  You may want to look at the fic The need to become stronger  linkffn(12213213) its a rational naruto fic wit a rational naruto who was adopted by jiraya, people also dont know hes the kyuubi so he isnt hated, hes also on friendlier terms with sakura.

  It's an abandoned fic, but [*Konoha's Maelstrom*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9495527/1/Konoha-s-Maelstrom) is probably my favourite Naruto fic period, and I'm not sure I've ever seen it mentioned here. It has some pretty cool rationalist-esque twists

  Need to Become Stronger is very good and similar to what you are describing, sadly appears to be dead.

  Somehting I really want to see in a Naruto fic is a deeper restructurization of the ninja world.

  The inf fire forged fic, despite being abandoned, did a really good job.
