  [This one](https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Aspire-NVIDIA-Windows-F5-573G-56CG/dp/B01F5LWTX4) looks nice. Seems like it should be able to handle some games.

  You haven't really defined what you want in a laptop. Being able to run modern games just means that it has a good video card. Is this a laptop you want to keep for a few years? Should it be light so that it isnt a pain to carry around all day? Should it have a good battery life? Do you care about having an SSD or not? Budget isn't a huge issue, but roughly what price range do you consider too high? Do you want a really good processor or lots of RAM? Do you want a screen with good colors or a high refresh rate? 

  I'm not saying you need to answer every question, but as you have it now the obvious answer is a link to a laptop with whatever the laptop version of the GTX 1080 is, and I doubt that would satisfy you.

  First, specify what you want in a laptop a bit more. Second, ask a sub other than this one, something like r/buildapc, because this is a sub about literature, and largely fan fiction. Not about computers.
