  Ah, the Worm method of dealing with trauma!

  Ouch, that hit Leaf took sounded bad, I hope they get her to a hospital soon enough.

  You are really pretty amazingly good at making me care for and empathize with characters - both Seto and Karen immediately had emotional relevance to me. Their inner dialogue is so realistic and believable that I can’t help but put myself in their shoes. And of course Leaf getting hit legitimately terrified me. Excellent interlude.

  I think we know why nobody's ever killed a Stormbringer now. It's never expressly stated, but there's two points in this chapter that made me think "Ah, that's what it is".   


  My original theory was that the Stormbringers were overwhelmingly powerful. In Chapter 61, I theorised about Zapdos's capabilities: "Two dozen lightning rods and a layer of psychic shielding might hold back the lightning from destroying every last member of the defense in a single apocalyptic blast. A barrage of type-advantaged artillery attacks might send the Zapdos dodging back into the clouds for a few seconds."  


  Some of this happened, some of it didn't. One Elite trainer can actually keep the Zapdos busy for a considerable period of time, so couldn't all of them together, plus a few dozen League level trainers, actually kill one, if they fought together? That's when I realised...when Zapdos came down from the clouds, it didn't really DO anything. It didn't attack anyone until it was attacked first. This makes me think that the Stormbringers aren't actually intentionally aggressive...it's the Pressure they bring that causes all the destruction. That's why they need to be lured away from the city.  


  The other key line was this: "And their \[Stormbringers\] response when truly challenged, is always to retaliate with overwhelming force."  


  So the Stormbringers aren't trying to destroy anything. They're just travelling, and the Pressure does its thing. When the trainers attack Zapdos, they don't go all-out. (This is why Lorelei attacks it with one beam first, then three...not six.) Because if Zapdos is legitimately hurt at all, it kills people. Trainers, civilians, anything. Nobody knows for sure if they've ever seen, in history, the full extent of the Stormbringers' powers. And even if they could win this fight, half of Vermillion would get destroyed in the meantime.   


  So rather than commit all their best trainers to a fight that they might not win, with enormous collateral damage, people decided on the luring strategy instead. And they've kept it up ever since, even as technology has gotten better and better over time. Perhaps they could win right now if they went all-out. But it's far too dangerous to find out.

  When you realize you were more excited for a new chapter than for the new year

  ---

  Man, I feel so bad for Seto. That constant guilt and self hate...

  And Leaf. But I trust she will recover, as Aiko did.

  I really like Karen's way of turning fear and Pressure to a motivating force. But it leads her into danger when she lets her desire for recognition overtake her senses. Is she a drug addict, addicted to Ether? She has a higher risk of addiction if her brother was a drug addict. And I hope she has a Surfer.
  ```

  - u/ManyCookies:
    ```
    Her brother was just an adrenaline addict:

    >The woes of an adrenaline junkie, as her oldest brother used to say, before his own addiction got him killed.

    And I think this is her first-ish time using Ether, she was "more wired and alert than she can ever remember". A pretty justified use of a super amphetamine, although I wonder how much that contributed to the mania/recklessness.
    ```

  - u/I_Probably_Think:
    ```
    > I hope she has a Surfer.

    And that it's not Hydreigon!
    ```

- u/ManyCookies:
  ```
  >Cinnibar Island is in that direction, if they lure it away they'd be putting the people there at risk

  Oh *shit*, that's a Mewtwo-related disaster just waiting to happen. How would Gio handle a Pressure'd Mewtwo and/or a damaged mansion?
  ```

  - u/Gummysaur:
    ```
    I can't believe I forgot this, but I just remembered that Mewtwo actually has Pressure as well! I wonder if it just hasn't presented yet? Or maybe that's why everyone seems so unnerved by it (Mewtwo can have the Unnerve ability as well too apparently). OR maybe it only activates when he gets distressed, which would explain how it hurt the "comforters" way back in the first Mewtwo chapter.

    &#x200B;

    Are Pokemon with Pressure immune to Pressure? They aren't in the games, at least, but imagine how horrible it would be to have TWO Pressure-having legendaries in one place...let alone all 4...
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      >OR maybe it only activates when he gets distressed

      Mewtwo is sapient. I'd imagine it can consciously control its powers.
      ```

      - u/Gummysaur:
        ```
        Well, it can't control its ability to heal, but we know now that its "disease" was manufactured. Perhaps it can control Recover, but simply cant heal fast enough to stop any pain, giving the illusion that it's not working.
        ```

  - u/Lipat97:
    ```
    Wait a second. Giovanni's whole point of doing the Mewtwo thing is that he wants to use it to kill the Stormbringers. The plan at the end of the chapter here were to drive Zapdos south, which Karen immediately recognizes will put it on course to hit Cinnabar Island. So maybe he intentionally set it on this path so that he can get Zapdos to come to Mewtwo.
    ```

    - u/ManyCookies:
      ```
      Well southwest out of the bay is the only direction where they wouldn't be flying over land, and the plan was to take Zapdos hard south once they were in the ocean.
      ```

- u/DrunkenQuetzalcoatl:
  ```
  Why did Professor Oak set his phone to such complete silence that he even misses an region-wide alert?
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Even Tier 3 alerts aren't region wide, only areas in the potential danger zones, which the meeting was not :)
    ```

    - u/DrunkenQuetzalcoatl:
      ```
      The message was described like this in your story:

      "One region-wide alert."
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Woops, good point. There's some semantic confusion I need to clear up, rather than using "alert" to mean both a "Hey everyone, here's a thing that's happening," which has no reason to bypass phone silencing, and "YOUR LIFE IS IN DANGER GET OUT" which cannot be turned off.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          Perhaps "warning" or "alarm".
          ```

  - u/HeroOfOldIron:
    ```
    Better question, why is there a setting that even allows you to disable a region wide alert? I can understand having it go silent for a number of reasons, but in that case it sould have to vibrate at maximum intensity until the alert is acknowledged.

    Also wait, what about the rest of the professors and university researchers? All of them also had the alert on mute?
    ```

    - u/archpawn:
      ```
      As DaystarEld said in another comment, the region-wide alert is just that there's a Zapdos somewhere. The alerts for the specific danger zones are higher priority and can't be turned off.
      ```

    - u/j9461701:
      ```
      The professor has played too much rainbow six siege  and is afraid of a dokkaebi style ring'n'snipe.
      ```

    - u/JulianWyvern:
      ```
      > why is there a setting that even allows you to disable a region wide alert

      It's possibly not a setting you can have if you're a conventional user, but someone with admin privileges for a system has a setting for literally whatever they want no matter how stupid it sounds
      ```

- u/ManyCookies:
  ```
  I'm a little confused about where Karen ended up luring Zapdos. The Elites were leading it southwest straight out of the bay, they drifted a bit too south towards Fuchsia, so Karen was trying to course correct... south again? Anyway after she's downed, which cardinal direction is Zapdos heading now, and is it vaguely hitting anything?

  ----

  Good chapter. One thing I've liked about this fic is that it conveys a *very* dangerous and scary world, but still keeps a sense of Pokemon Adventure^(TM) and doesn't devolve into complete "All pokemon are expendable murder tools that kill and maim each other horribly aaaahh" [edginess](https://i.imgur.com/2Yni481.jpg) it could very easily slip into.
  ```

  - u/AKAAkira:
    ```
    Karen turned right first, when she and Zapdos was getting close of Fuschia, putting their direction west - the narrative suggested they weren't going to go straight over Fuschia, but it was still advisable to veer away to minimize setting off Pokemon rampages near the city. Then she turned south-west, then south proper. Then south-east, to avoid the Sevii islands, and then she was shot down.
    ```

- u/Trips-Over-Tail:
  ```
  I'm now wondering how triage works in pokécenters. The ticket system suggests it is first-come, first-serve. And of course, the stasis of pokéballs means that there is no urgency to prioritise life-threatening cases. But when they are rushed, such as after a Tiered event, even the small medium of pokéballs might push the center's storage capacity, and more to the point, lots of trainers will be out of their pokémon for longer. This is a risk to the city and surrounding area as defence will be underpowered when they are most vulnerable. An after-tier event or renegade attack would be devastating.

  It seems to me that, since time is not a concern with regards to saving lives, but *is* a concern for getting pokémon back to their trainers, it would make most sense to prioritise the treatment of injuries that are easiest, quickest and/or most straightforward to heal to ensure that the region is brought back up to readiness (or the closest they can get to it) as quickly as possible, and save the difficult cases for later during post-tiered event response. In short, the availability of pokéball storage technology perfectly inverts the rational triage protocol of human hospitals.

  This would of course require a means to quickly assessing the condition of new in-patients.
  ```

  - u/DrunkenQuetzalcoatl:
    ```
    For safety, healing priorities should also be weighted according to who is most important for defense. Champion, Elite, Leaders and Rangers/Police/Healing corps first.
    ```

    - u/Trips-Over-Tail:
      ```
      Sure, but even they may have pokémon that will have to stay for a good long while, especially if they had to take the brunt of the danger on the front lines. Is it better to get twenty badged trainers back to full complement or heal one Leader's signature pokémon? I think Surge would say the latter, especially as he can still lead them if necessary without his pokémon.
      ```

      - u/TheTrickFantasic:
        ```
        I think you mean to say "former", but overall I agree.
        ```

  - u/Lugnut1206:
    ```
    The pokeball has a good enough snapshot of the Pokemon's state it can reconstruct it - just have a medical diagnostic tool that uses that information to simulate reconstructing the Pokemon as injured in VR, and you can observe all the wounds and injuries on a cellular or better level
    ```

    - u/Trips-Over-Tail:
      ```
      I'm sure it can be done within the technological framework of the story, the issue is doing so from hundreds of pokémon in a timely manner, since the whole point is to speed up returns.
      ```

      - u/Lugnut1206:
        ```
        Well, since we can do it technologically that means we can trivially check for some kinds of ailments, like toxins in the bloodstream, and other hormone levels

        Harder things to quantify digitally might be open wounds, or mental trauma?
        ```

        - u/Trips-Over-Tail:
          ```
          Detecting toxins is the sort of thing that Oak's new Pokédex can do. Whether that's gone on to medicine yet we don't know. And it might struggle to tell whether the toxin is in a poison gland or the bloodstream. Similarly, hormones might be in the blood or they might be in an endocrine gland somewhere.

  - u/Gummysaur:
    ```
    I think this already exists. When Blue loses either the Pikachu or his Beedrill, when he scans its Pokeball, it not only says that the Pokemon is dead but also gives the cause (I think it was something like "critical brain patterns disrupted"). If the Pokeball is sophisticated enough to pinpoint cause of death then I think it could scan any injuries and potentially rank them from "critical" to "minor".
    ```

    - u/Trips-Over-Tail:
      ```
      *No Neurological Response - Brain Patterns Critically Disrupted* This was the pokedex informing him that the beedrill was dead, not determining the cause of death. Actually, it was just informing him that it was unable to simulate the beedrill's environment due to the lack of response.
      ```

  I remember there being someone who asked a few chapter discussions back why people haven't seriously tried to kill the Stormbringers before, when there's no reason to believe they're not living breathing creatures that can't die if it's hit decisively enough. Well, I guess here's the answer.

  Preconditions of needing pokemon that can fly for a long enough time to contest it. What appears to be high-grade and permanent Light Screen and Flash. Both of which, I'm assuming, was caused by so much electricity running through its body you can't even get near it without hearing a physically discomforting buzz in the air. Thunder or Thunderbolt powered up enough to OHKO anything that doesn't resist and/or doesn't have pseudo-legendary defences. Even theoretically immune things like Flygon is affected by secondary effects - wonder if that mention of heat being hard to ignore was an indication of Burn status. And with Pressure on top of all this causing emotions to overshoot, of course.

  Anything I missed? Or, conversely - anything else it could have that wasn't explicitly demonstrated this chapter? Since abilities don't have the exact same mechanics here as they do in the games, I've been contemplating if legendary Pokemon have *all* the abilities they could potentially have in games, instead of just one. Lightning Rod would fit with how its attacks are so powerful, for example, since it seems to be running so much electricity through itself it totally could've powered up its Special Attack by dozens of stages - though I guess its power could also be chalked up to it being just that powerful. Alternatively, it might also have abilities that haven't been given to it in games but would be appropriate thematically - Volt Absorb, for example, would make it plain unfair if Zapdos just running electricity through itself is enough to let it heal. Ah, the speculation.

  All this makes me wonder again, though, what exactly motivates the legendaries to get near human cities. Is it as simple as animal instincts and holding so much power it just has to move wherever its impulse takes it? But if so, what makes it stick to Kanto instead of moving west sometimes to Johto? (Though that's maybe a possibility that could've happened once or twice, so what makes it stick to that area instead of relocating to somewhere like Sinnoh, for example? Assuming Sinnoh is located relevant to Kanto how real-life Hokkaido is to real-life Kanto region.) Or, on the opposite end of the spectrum, is it some kind of intelligence that set it to clash with human culture? But if that's the case, what's the point of giving human society a metaphorical bloody nose every once in a while?

  Other than that...Prof Oak's segment kinda made me reflect on myself. On one hand, I saw him as a supremely competent man, so seeing him so plainly screw up a job was surprising...but on the other, if I didn't have a direct line to his thoughts and was hearing a recording of that conversation, I totally would've thought he was just slapping those university presidents with the cold hard truth, wouldn't I. Though I guess it is pretty much both. And I guess there's still an opportunity for a mistake to turn into an advantage.

  Thanks for the chapter.

    DayStar described abilities a bit more in the [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/88q5v3/rst_pokemon_the_origin_of_species_ch_54_into_the/dwn2epg/) of chapter 54 

    > not all pokemon that can have the ability do, like in the games, and unlike the games, even if they do have it, it's not binary, and varies in strength like any other trait. 

    So you're right that Zapdos definitely has more abilities than Pressure and those abilities are likely much stronger than what they are for normal pokémon.

    More typos than usual? but great chapter as always!

    ...

    "a Silph subsidiary that was *was* in a prolonged legal conflict"

    (Not a typo, but the little touch of drivers only being needed to run the car's defenses, not pilot, was super cool!  Makes me wonder how cars in this universe are designed/built, and how differently they would look because of that.)

    "is pretty strong stance, Daniel" needs an "a".

    "...listed experiments don't replicate." Missing end quotes.

    "might work against us tomor... Sam, what's wrong?".  I think there should be a dash after "tomor", but that might just be a style thing.

    "No fire,rock, or flying ,which means"

    "co-ordinate"  I... think this might be the British spelling?  I can't recall the last time I've seen this word with a dash in it.

    "the Elites job is to stay fresh and ready" missing apostrophe.

    "Because what is there to fear, really, from the perspective" I would switch the comma after "really" to a semicolon or something

    "Zap Canon" should have three "n"s, occurs three times

    > "With all due respect, you're on the review board for three different journals," Professor Elm says, adjusting his glasses. "How many papers have you personally looked over in the past year, out of all those that those papers published?"

    > Osamu's face reddens. "Are you questioning my integrity?"

    > "Not at all," Professor Oak quickly says. "I know you're a diligent and rigorous academic. But there isn't enough time in the day for you to be solely responsible for every paper in even one of those journals. And instead of hiring more reviewers, the names of the reviewers are what's being paid for. It's become a mutually beneficial prestigious position, not something that assures quality."

    I thought the above was a typo initially, with Oak and Elm being used for the same person. Leaving it in this thread just in case.

    On a first read, it was somewhat confusing (to me at least) why Oak reacted to Osaku's remark rather than Elm. It was not very clear to me that Oak and Elm were working together until the point that Osamu thanked them both for their time.

  A very tense chapter, and I think the multiple perspective switches we're executed fantastically. Seto's section was particularly interesting to me, a really nuanced character peice in the midst of disaster.

  >!A minor critique being that, I think that in the work read as a whole rather than serially, it will seem a bit strange/redundant feeling to have to catastrophic Magnemite/Magneton attack in back to back chapters.!<

  Zapdos definitely racked up a few "not an evil monster, just an animal" points in the scenes with Karen. It basically responded to the attacks like a cockroach bumping into a wall. "Oh, that was weird, better turn a different direction." 

  I do really like Karen as a character too. I'm sort of on the fence about whether or not her in-game existence says about the subject of plot armor in this story. On one hand, I've kind of been enjoying OtOS as a sort of, higher resolution retelling of the Kanto story, so I am totally fine thinking things like, "I know Karen will survive because she is alive in Gold/Silver." But also I like the liberties you take with the story, and the future butterfly-effect it allows. But we haven't seen a whole lot of that narrative divergence yet, like the kinds in HPMoR for example, so I don't know if it makes sense to "start now" so to speak. I know that I would mostly likely be satisfied with this story if it ends with Red fighting Champion Blue and then him running off to stoically stare at the Peaks of Mt. Silver, but I don't think that's how I *expect* it to end. Anyways, looking forward to finding out.

  Side note, game canon states that at least one person, Pyramid King Brandon, was eventually able to capture (or clone!) the legendary birds and the regis. But maybe our heroes find themselves in one of the blighted universes where the Battle Frontier is perpetually locked in development hell and Brandon was crushed in another of Team Rocket's archeological "accidents." Perhaps after he came too close to unlocking the secret of capturing legendaries for Giovanni's liking.

  Speaking of complicated game canon multiverses, I wonder what the implications are of LGPE forwarding that a version of Red, Blue, and Green!Leaf exist somehow in a time-shifted era before Oak finished his pokedex, where Fairy types, mega-evolution, alola forms, and Melmetal exist... But not baby Pokemon or happiness evolution... but after Mewtwo and Porygon have been created. LGPE are really just a mess. I think rat!Red's head would explode if he was forced to confront all of canon Pokemon's multiverses.
