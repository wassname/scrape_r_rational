  Kinda a bit of a bait with the title.

  Huh, I had honestly thought that either all the Watch had gone in and died or Velika would gone and killed them regardless. Surprising that evidently so many are still alive.

  On the "how is Rain totally overpowered" topic, not much new. Evidently he did indeed break his soul somehow, but is that just a side effect of something he did or is he going to gain some unique understanding of how is soul works?

    Yeah it seems this is introducing rain on the path if studying soul manipulation. Which I'm certain is something that'll take place over multiple books, not a quick path to level raising.

      Like at this point I would totally be down for Rain realizing that the level limit is a function of his soul he can edit and just bumping it up to 99. At least we would get some action.
      ```

        That would genuinely ruin the story by removing any real sense of reward or challenge. Numbers going up isn't action.
        ```

        - u/Watchful1:
          ```
          Just bumping the level limit doesn't remove the challenge. There still would be lots of leveling up to do and plenty of story associated with doing it.

          The numbers haven't really been going up at all for like 3 months now. He's maxed on most of his skills. I guess he could randomly encounter a higher level blue somewhere, but that's just about as challenge removing as figuring out how to bump the level limit himself.
          ```

          - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
            ```
            Not when Rain does most of his levelling up passively. 

            And, boring slog while trapped in the cave aside, there's been lots of plot with Rain trying to organise the city and associated goings on. I'd rather have interesting plot and no level ups than the reverse.

    Presumably they kept back the very weakest, both to keep up appearances while they prepped and to prevent them from getting mooked.
    ```

- u/xamueljones:
  ```
  I like the subtle implication that Ava is awakened when she didn't react to Rain's "oversoul".
  ```

  - u/EsquilaxM:
    ```
    Mlem already mentioned she's awakened in his internal monologue way back
    ```
