## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  Inspired by [this](http://nedroid.com/comics/2008-12-28-beartato-thinkingofme.gif) Beartato and Reginald comic.

  **You inexplicably gain the power to make anybody sneeze by thinking of them**.

  Your goal is to kill a high-ranking government official (pick and choose) without getting caught. The less attention you draw to yourself, the better. Mucho brownie points go to the person who can do this without relying on other people.

  I've been racking my pea-sized brain for a while now and I can't think of any way that I'd be able to kill anyone, much less a government official, with such a shit power. I'm hoping /r/rational will have better luck.

  * "Them" in this case means knowledge of their given name (first + last) and their current face, to eliminate ambiguity. Think Death Note rules.
  * If you are unable to fulfil the criteria (e.g. the name you have isn't actually their given name, the picture you have is out of date) then the sneeze is not affected.
  * You do not need line of sight to make somebody sneeze. So as long as you have their name + face, you can make them sneeze.
  * This power works at the speed of thought.
  * You can make groups of people sneeze so as long as you can keep all of their faces and names in your head as you do so.
  * There is no limit to the number of times that you can make any one person sneeze, nor is there a limit on how many people you can make sneeze a day.
  * I'm not sure if you can meaningfully quantify the intensity of a sneeze, but the first one you affect is of, uh, *average* intensity, whatever that might be.
  * The more sneezes you affect on the same person, the lesser the effect becomes - eventually diminishing to the point where a "sneeze" you affect would be little more than a few seconds worth of an itchy nose. Let's call it a threshold of ten sneezes until an affected sneeze cannot be considered a sneeze any more.
  * You cannot affect more than one sneeze on one person at a time. You can, however, affect a sneeze on somebody immediately after they finish sneezing. (So, no, you cannot affect a Graham's number of sneezes every second for the rest of their lives until they get so irritated that they kill themselves -- this would be too easy, haha.)
  * The sneezes you affect are magical.
  	* Magical in the sense that these sneezes just 'happen.' Your brain magically sends a magical signal to your target's brain, and tells the brain to sneeze.
  	* These sneezes cannot be prevented or mitigated by any kind of medication or procedure. e.g. the full-on physical removal of someone's nose and affecting a sneeze on them will result in them suffering from a "[phantom sneeze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_pain)."

  Alternatively, I'd happily take run-of-the-mill munchkinry (improve quality of life, get the girl, rob a bank, become an iron-fisted tyrant, enact planetary genocide, etc.) if you can't kill anybody with this power.  

  Also: semantic satiation is a great thing. Sneeze doesn't even sound like a word anymore.

  ---

  #CLARIFICATIONS:

  * As long as your target is not dead (i.e. complete cessation of all bodily function) they will sneeze.

  * If your target is "effectively dead" (e.g. in a coma, brain dead, cryogenically frozen, etc.) then they will still sneeze. What a sneeze would be like to someone suffering from brain death is beyond me, but they'll still sneeze.

  * The "sneeze signal" travels at the speed of light. (i.e. you would not be able to affect FTL communication with this power, although I will admit that sneeze-based superluminal communication sounds absolutely *hilarious*)

  * Past ten sneezes, the itchiness of the nose of the person affected remains noticeable (i.e. you can tell the difference between the itchiness and a natural slight nose itch) up to twenty sneezes in total.

  * Any further sneezes affected on the same person will result in a "sneeze" that is virtually imperceptible or indistinguishable from a natural slight itch.

    Well you basically have the power to partially incapacitate someone for 10 sneezes of time. Let's say 8 seconds.

    Perhaps you could try affecting a surgeon while operating on some official. However, people already sneeze regularly so I doubt it'd do much other than make them lay down their tools for 8 seconds. Same goes for pilots, construction workers, etc.

    However, this power might be useful in helping out a mundane assassination. Make every bodyguard for the person sneeze for 8 seconds, murder them with regular methods, hope you don't get caught afterwards.

    ```
    Munchkinery 101: identify what individual pieces the power consists of; figure out what each particular piece, if freed of restrictions, could be used for; figure out how to use the power to realize the full potential of the most powerful pieces.

    This power: (1) identifies when you want to use it, (2) identifies who you want to use it on, (3) checks if your information on the target is correct, (4) checks how many times the target was already influenced by this power, (5) lowers the power's intensity based on how many times the target was influenced, (6) identifies the position of your target, (7) communicates with the target at *c*, (8) influences the target's brain in a delicate manner to induce a "sneeze".

    What could be useful? 3, 6, 7, 8 look the most promising, but I indeed can't get much use out of them.

    Nothing here offers direct feedback, so (3) can't be generally used to check your information for trustworthiness or for brute-force searches; I guess you could get an accomplice to change the name/face based on some criteria, but since it still depends on the accomplice's beliefs, I don't see a way to verify arbitrary information using it either.

    (6) is mostly useless too, since it doesn't tell the target where they are, in relation to you or otherwise, and doesn't tell you the location unless you can hear the sneeze, in which case you may as well go look.

    I guess (7) could be used for covert communication — transmitting your minions commands using Morse or something — which could give you some edge in negotiations or a battle, but it's pretty slow. It would make robbing a bank or plotting a prison break easier, but not that significantly.

    (8) wouldn't be able to offer much to science, if I'm not mistaken.

    Oh my, does this power suck.

      ```
      > I guess (7) could be used for covert communication — transmitting your minions commands using Morse or something

      That's actually can accomplish a lot.

      1. Send the same Morse message once a day, every day to as many people as you can. Either choose your recipients completely at random or choose some organized group that can read Morse code.
      2. Train yourself in patience. Eventually story of the higher being that communicates via sneezes will spread out. Once it's done, abandon daily messages.
      3. After that you can finally move on to more specific messages. Find people who are willing to follow Sneezemaker. Choose some random site(s) to get answers from them.
      4. Well, now you have group of people who are crazy enough to follow you. It is very useful... I guess?

      Additional thoughts:

      * Find names of high ranking government official's bodyguards. Use your Morse sneezing powers to recruit them for you cause.
      * Change aforementioned plan so everything (language, sleep patterns, message contents, choice of people) points to that official. Then, kill someone using your power.

        Oops, I didn't consider the wider implications. That's a great idea.

        It would be rather useful for bonus challenges as well: once established as a supernatural entity, you would acquire a great deal of influence, not only on your followers but on the other random people as well. You could openly speak your mind through "chosen" people, pushing for spending resources towards the fields you consider beneficial, and threaten politicians in secret — the possibilities for psychological warfare here are *endless*, if you're willing to abuse people's religious beliefs and order assassinations. Once you have followers or blackmailees in high-ranking government or military positions, you could start playing up the "omniscient" card, and people's irrationality would do the rest of the work on its own.

        Robbing banks, starting riots and then wars is trivially easy; ordering a nuclear war/enacting an omnicide would be trickier, but if you manage to convince your government that your existence is an enemy action, or a foreign government that you're going to expand to them if they don't take drastic actions, that's doable as well. It's probably entirely possible to take over the world in a century with this. (Getting the girl is left as an exercise to the reader.)

        Damn, there's a potential for a great story here.

    Turn sneezes into dog whistles.

    Attend press conferences and speeches for a few months and make politicians sneeze at random intervals.

    Then, go and write a code book explaining that, when a politician sneezes after word 'X' they're saying 'Y'

    Since you're writing the book retroactively, you can make it sound like politicians were talking about future events.

    Next, go to a journalist, give them the code book (+throw an encrypted copy on a torrent somewhere).  As proof, make a prediction that politician will sneeze 3 times after the first question in their next press conference.

    You'll look like a loon, right up until your prediction comes true.  

    And politicians sneezes really do spell out a coherent discussion about a plan to complete (whatever conspiracy you invented) in the next several months.

    News story breaks.  Your torrent confirms that you predicted everything in advance.  Politicians of choice are discredited, and you've "proven" that a conspiracy exists.

    ...pick one of Robert Mugabe's subordinates as the target. (Or anyone who's not *quite* the big shot under a ruthless leader who wants to stay in power). Send Mugabe (or the ruthless leader, if a different ruthless leader is chosen) a series of anonymous emails describing a conspiracy to unseat him. Phrase it in such a way that sneezes in public speeches at certain points are being used by the conspirators to hide their communication. Also phrase it in such a way that the desired target for death is an important figure in said conspiracy.

    Use the sneeze power to provide apparent corroboration of the insane conspiracy theory.

    Wait for Mugabe's paranoia to make him snap (snap further?).

    I imagine it would be pretty hard to sleep if you were constantly sneezing. With the fact that being a politicians is already pretty stressful, having nearly zero sleep might cause them to get some nasty health complications. It might be difficult to properly offset your sleep schedule and theirs though.

    Huh. A sneeze note.

    You might be able to kill with a single well-timed sneeze just by making someone sneeze while they are eating. Or swimming. 

    >These sneezes cannot be prevented or mitigated by any kind of medication or procedure. e.g. the full-on physical removal of someone's nose and affecting a sneeze on them will result in them suffering from a "phantom sneeze."

    What if you make someone sneeze while they are in a coma, does that wake them up? What about full-body paralysis? Brain death? Diseases that weaken the muscles needed for sneezing? Would your sneeze note cure them in order to make them sneeze?
    ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    If I activate the power on someone, do they sneeze immediately, regardless of distance from me? 

    In other words, can I use this for [faster-than-light communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superluminal_communication)? This may or may not allow you to cause a time paradox, which may or may not destroy the entire universe and thus kill everyone, including whoever you wanted to kill.

  - u/SignoreGalilei:
    ```
    I know this is kind of late but I can't believe no one has already brought up the way sneezing already kills people: spreading diseases. Go about strategically spreading a sneeze-transmissible deadly disease into the population by having people infected with e.g. SARS sneeze on someone who sneezes on someone etc. eventually leading to a government official who is particularly old and has a weak immune system. Maybe Queen Elizabeth would be a good target? You'd have to do a lot of facebook stalking to find the right path of connected people to reach someone though, which risks discovery.  Alternatively just make a few infected people sneeze enough that the disease spreads and causes a pandemic and kills someone important in the government along with a few thousand other people.

  Suppose a homeless poor person got the power of cleaning and repairing things. It works within 2 metres of the person, it cannot repair things that have more than 1/4 of the parts missing (unless they have extras or materials out of which extras could be made). Cleaning and repairing is intuitive - you do not need to know how to repair a thing to repair it, and also you need to consider yourself to be repairing or cleaning something while you do it, because if you think you're breaking the object or dirtying it or making it worse in general, the power won't do anything. Cleaning can vanish bits of anything that is "dirt" or "dust" or "trash" in the same intuitive way and as mentioned repairing can fill in up to a quarter of missing parts of an object, by volume or mass whichever is biggest. 

  How might they exploit that to 1) get themselves a better life 2) improve the world?

  Edit: if a part of an object is a different material than the rest of an object (ex: screws in a device, gemstone eyes, etc) the power can only try to 'summon back' the eyes or screw, not generate a new one. Also, yes, this is defining "objects" to be things that are commonly considered single objects instead of random stuff taped together.
  ```

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    How quickly does he do it, and what counts as an object that can be repaired? Build an idol with gemstone eyes. Flick out the gemstone, repair, repeat.

    By teaming up with scientists, you can conjure fabled experimental materials! For example, have them build a container for antimatter (a constant negative static charge around a sphere of vacuum should keep antiprotons in its middle, as a first idea), construct an object around it that's four times as heavy in total, and insert a single elementary particle of antimatter into the container, for that's the scale we can currently synthesize. Remove the container, repair, remove the container, combine the two container's contents, insert the container, repeat. Free energy, light rocket fuel, easy doomsday device.

    Other things to conjure: Supercomputers, people (designate five parts of the body, chop each off with repairing after each chop, repair the 5 parts into a whole), and everything consumable from food to ammunition for self-sufficiency.
    ```

  - u/zarraha:
    ```
    This is terribly broken, you can summon an infinite amount of anything by:

    1) Build a compound object by taping/gluing together four/five objects.

    2) Break it by removing one object.

    3) Repair it using the power.

    4) Repeat

    Even if we disallow this by defining "objects" to be things that are commonly considered single objects instead of four supercomputers taped together, you can still summon an infinite amount of raw materials by making something like a chair made of X material and then repeatedly breaking off chunks of it.

    Rather than point out the ways this could be used to benefit yourself and humanity by reducing shortages of literally everything, I would suggest you alter the power such that "repairing" an object only rearranges existing material into a "fixed" shape, not creating new stuff.  Either by having a supply of extra material at hand, or by reorganizing the existing material effectively making it thinner to compensate.

  My uncle is starting a new D&D campaign and in his world there are no explosions. Like literally if anything would explode instead it either fails to ignite or burns slowly instead. The only exception is certain magical spells which can channel explosions.

  Anyone know how badly that would break physics or if anything is exploitable as a result of that?

  Edit: I talked to him some more and he explained the mechanic by which this takes place. Any time something would explode, the energy generated by that explosion is siphoned off by an unknown powerful god-like being. That same being supplies all of the energy to power all magic and mana in the world.
  ```

  - u/GemOfEvan:
    ```
    Depending on your definition of explosion, you could get around a few engineering hurdles. Most bombs would turn into directed energy weapons instead.

    Imagine a nuke in this world. Obviously, if we detonated it, there would be no explosion. But what if we opened a small hole on it? All that energy is being forced out that hole at a rate proportional to its size. Now you've got a safe-ish radiation/heat gun powered by a nuke. 

    I'm not all that well versed in D&D spells, but my first idea is to polymorph a fire elemental into an ant and put said ant into a metal box with a hole on one end. When the polymorph ends, the elemental is now inside the tiny box (which cannot be exploded out of) with the fire being forced out the hole.

    Basically, combusion has a rate cap? How fast can you burn things before it counts as an explosion?

    On the other hand, do non-combusion events, like geysers, volcanos, etc. count as explosions?
    ```

    - u/FordEngineerman:
      ```
      Yeah that's kind of how he explained it when I asked. Non-combustion events would still count. I think geysers and volcanoes would just seep out instead of exploding out.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Well, congratulations. If you can find a way to stuff energy into a space faster than the maximum rate cap, you can store infinite energy in very little space and create a battery that lasts an arbitrary amount of time. If the thing about "no explosions" is true, you can do that with something as simple as a pump and a glass bottle, or a windup spring and ratchet. Or a steam boiler... This a world where steampunk is viable, is what I'm saying. You can store as much high pressure steam as you want, and ruptures, boiling dry, whatever, will never cause them to explode. Gently crack, maybe. But that's much easier to fix.

        On the other hand, maybe doing that just results in the relevant mass/energy just... Vanishing.

        In which case, less useful, but you can still use it. You can easily dispose of anything you can put under pressure, just by jamming enough of it into a small enough space that it starts to disappear.

        That breaks geology, though, because you lose a lot of planet very quickly if mass above a certain pressure limit starts disappearing until it's no longer pressurized.

        Wait, do bows and crossbows not work here? Because they involve very quickly releasing a lot of pent-up energy.

      This is mostly a thought experiment, so I'd accept answers involving purely theoretical concepts like exotic matter.
      It's entirely possible that the structure I proposed cannot exist in a stable form at all for longer than it takes the shell to collapse inwards, but if it could (maybe through having it consist of charged particles) you'd have a chunk of space time that is effectively separated from everything around it by an infinite distance (from the pov of light trying to pass between) and yet I think there's a chance to access it if we permit wormhole formation to change the geometry of the underlying space time. So you'd have a structure with exactly one exit controlled by ONLY you.

      The one thing I am completely uncertain about is how time would pass there. The space time is completely flat, but any space time is flat locally except for a singularity, so it's possible that you'd still have extreme time dilation, making it a  time prison as well.
      ```
