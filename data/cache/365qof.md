  I wonder when we'll have enough economic stories to collect a Book of Economic Fables of reasonable length.

    There is one I've seen floating around on here before that is pretty fun called "The Cambist and the Lord Iron" or something similar. I don't think that is exactly it.

  >but one of the first moves by the UNICEF Official with Special Responsibility For Goats was to make the goat compensation fund self-funding by hedging much of it in goat futures

  I laughed, but I don't know enough economics to see why this wouldn't work.

    ```
    Goats are worth X price today. Planescraping a goat makes it worth 2X. Thus, the new market value of the goat tomorrow is 2X. Where does that extra X come from? From the Goat Compensation Fund.

    The Goat Compensation Fund, meanwhile, needs to avoid running out of Xs.

    But wait.

    If (goat price) = 2 ^ (days since day one) * X , then you can make much money by buying a goat today and selling it tomorrow. If you can make money by doing that, you can make money by selling that capability to make money.

    Which is what the goat fund did. They bet their money, which is where the goat-money comes from, on the price of goats going up in the future, but instead of getting that return in the future, they got it *now* by selling the future returns at future profits, maybe at a markdown.

    And so they made enough money for the next round of payouts.

    Repeat.

    Of course, it's a little ridiculous. Like Ouroboros eating it's own tail and growing *larger* from it. But that's the point. It's all false value.

    Source: I got nothin', it just made sense to me. I'm a highschool student that doesn't take Economics for chrissakes, don't trust my word.

    EDIT: Spelling and more on why not to trust me.
