## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  Gonna go with a boring question here: What web fiction is everybody reading at the moment? I'm looking for another title to add the 8 I currently have on the go, lest I end up on my commute without one of them having updated. Here's what I'm reading online:

  * Mother of Learning
  * Worth the Candle
  * A Practical Guide to Evil
  * The Good Student

  The above 4 are all regularly posted here (though Good Student is currently on hiatus) so I don't think they need any introduction.

  * [Everybody loves large chests](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/8894/everybody-loves-large-chests)

  I saw ELLC recommended in a thread about "things you would recommend if they weren't embarrassing" or something similar. As you can probably tell from the name, ELLC is slightly nsfw, with most female characters being ridiculously proportioned, erotic interludes and general lewdness. If you can get past that, ELLC is great fun - the premise takes place in a game world, and follows a dungeon mimic who is able to gain a few levels and escape the dungeon and its subsequent adventures in human lands. There's a strong munchkinry streak later on as the box becomes increasingly intelligent and powerful, if you like that kind of thing. Probably the strongest aspect of the story is simply that the author makes a really interesting game world with skills and abilities that are genuinely cool to read about.

  * [How to avoid death on a daily basis](http://moodylit.com/how-to-avoid-death-on-a-daily-basis-1-welcome-to-probet-table-of-contents/1-where-are-we)

  HtADoaDB is by mooderino, author of the Good Student, but is a radically different story. It starts with a fairly standard 'People are transported to a fantasy world' setting, but goes off in all kinds of weird directions. mooderino has stated in the past(iirc) that he doesn't plan out the story and instead just writes how he feels. I appreciate the originality that this brings, but at the same time quality can vary wildly.

  * [The Zombie Knight Saga](https://thezombieknight.blogspot.com/2013/04/page-1.html)

  Put simply, TZKS is a superhero story. The story opens with the main character dying and being revived by a 'reaper' that can give him super strength, speed and regenaration as well as a unique power and asks him to prevent more deaths, but they're soon drawn into the world of reapers. However, if I were to pick a comparison I'd say the closest is Yoshihiro Togashi's Hunter X Hunter; the world looks largely like ours, but with the addition of hunters/reapers, the main character is a prodigy but still completely overwhelmed by the most powerful and the system of powers quite closely resembles Nen, with a small set of categories that define what characters can do used in all kinds of creative ways. (also the author takes random hiatuses and the opening of the story makes no sense with later revelations). Those are only superficial similarities, but I'd say the overall quality is not far off either.

  * [The Wandering Inn](https://wanderinginn.com/2016/07/27/1-00/)

  Wandering Inn is a 'person transported to game world' story, with the main twist on this formula being the main character getting the Innkeeper class and spending her time running an Inn. What starts as a fairly simple struggle to survive in a foreign world soon morphs into a vast tale as dozens of viewpoint characters get introduced and we learn about the central struggles of the world. Despite the quiet initial setting, the author has a tremendous knack for battle scenes and the small handful of major fights scattered throughout are always a highlight. 

  I really enjoy reading this story, but I would also say it might be the least rational of the list. The two main characters both have a tendency to take stupid decisions and still get rewarded because they're important; with Erin the innkeeper this is not so bad as it's explicitly acknowledged that she is super lucky to bumble her way through, but the other character, Ryoka, can be quite irritating. She is an incredible fount of obscure knowledge for no apparent reason and is presented as extremely intelligent, but still does all kinds of things for no clear reason and just happens to be proved right later on. I would stress that this is still quite a small complaint, however, and her character is still fairly well written overall.

    Have you tried The Erogamer? It's pretty fantastic, and worth pushing through potential embarrassment to recommend despite the lewd subject matter. If ELLC is anywhere near as good, I'll definitely be checking it out.

  Out of curiosity, what *is* the cost of living in portugal?

    Make it a bit more difficult: if it’s not a destructive cult and it aligns with your worldview, why *shouldn’t* you join it?
    ```

    - u/Gurkenglas:
      ```
      It's easy to be tricked into thinking the cult isn't destructive and aligns with your worldview, but it's hard to be tricked into thinking it's not a cult when you know how to recognize them.
