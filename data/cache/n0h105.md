## [RT][WIP] The Flower That Bloomed Nowhere, part 44

### Post:

Whoops! Forget my every-other-update posting of this here last time. It's like I hate getting new readers!

For those seeing this for the first time, this story is a whodunnit-style mystery about a group of magi-in-training being invited to a conclave of people trying to discover the secret of immortality. It is dialogue heavy and slow paced, so it's not for everyone, but consider giving it a try!

We are very close now.

  Delivering that warning is probably what Kam was desperate to do here, but is she being forced into it or is she a true believer? She's had several lines that seem anthetical to being a willing supporter of a death cult, but she also seems capable of keeping up that appearence for the years she's been in the class. I believe Utsu has clocked a few things she's said along those lines  as coming off as rehearsed, like her professed reason for getting into healing. Maybe there's more to it?

  Or, this is completely unrelated to why Kam is desperate and she's just having an *incredibly* bad start to her weekend.

  Anyway, the message. Yeah, I'm with Utsu on this one, the flippancy of that message makes the death threats more chilling and not less. Why were those bits at the beginning and end even left in? Was it even intentional? The speaker is almost coming across like an actress, does she even know that this message was going to be delivered?

  And the last thing... Utsu has been having those deja-vu moments that are probably memories from previous loops. I'm pretty sure this is the first direct indication that we're off of the normal version of events, but I'm not sure what could have happened to make this loop so dramatically different. The only thing that comes to mind is whatever Utsu's request might have been back in the initial chapter.

    What's got me scratching my head here is that the chapter 1 opens with "SCENARIO CONCEIT: Control. No variations." Makes it sounds like this _is_ the "normal version of events" or at least, that it's meant to be. I wonder if deities (or whatever they are) running the scenario screwed up or something? Or... maybe 'control' just means that the initial conditions are normal, and ghost-Su (or something else) is allowed to make additional changes?

    Hmm. Do you think H.'s ask for a stop right as it would keep the sheaf being revealed is a red herring, or do you think somehow Utsu's vision or something like it tipped H. off?
