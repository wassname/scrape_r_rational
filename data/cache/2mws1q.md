  UPDATE:

  It's irked me for a long time that I put the rules notes in Chapter 10 instead of in a separate document but I can't do anything about it now without renumbering all the chapters, which would mean updating all my source HTML to match.  Immediately after posting this here I found myself thinking:

  "Hey, maybe I should avoid making the same mistake twice."

  So, now the contents of this chapter have been moved to [a separate document](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10838202/1/Not-a-story-FAQ-for-The-Two-Year-Emperor).  Chapter 72 will be replaced when I post on Saturday.

    Upvoting for visibility. Or something.

  This is just Q&A of things that I've been asked a fair bit, no story.  Much of it has already been discussed on here.

  20 days?!? TWENTY DAYS?!? That's a shit-load of stuff to happen in 20 days. Wow.

    Yeah, I know.  Still, I've got the timeline written out.  I tracked all the events based on day and hour and it really does work.

    Put it down to "the D&D rules are *ridonkulously* abusable."  If the gods hadn't been stepping on Jake's toes basically constantly he would have ruined the world a lot faster.
