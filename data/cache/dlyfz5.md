Chapter 22 is out bringing the listening time up to 17 hours. Have 12 and a half thousand downloads of the podcast so far and people seem to love it.  Thank you so much for the support from this sub as you were the ones who really got it going in the first place.

  ```
  Thank you for putting, “Chapter 22” before, “Mother of Learning”. 

  Almost got unreasonably excited. 

  Close call.

  ```
  Didn't the matriarch screw up her understanding of what a primordial is?

  That you can't "summon" them at all because they are native to our plain of existence?
  ```
