  ```
  Suspension is one-time-only? Then how does she have a gem that reflects mana? Does she infuse it anew each time? But then why would she need to restore it daily? (Oh, I guess degradation extends beyond mana in either case.)

  Superposition sounds like it could make for mana-cheap explosions or, if correctly controlled, projectile firing/telekinesis. Can you superpose magical materials with nonmagical ones, or nonmagical ones with each other? Maybe this gets around the no-nonmagical-abjuration rule. Probably not.
