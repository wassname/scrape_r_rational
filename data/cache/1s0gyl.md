  100,000 people across Japan receive a mysterious package containing 
  ¥100M ($100,000) and a note.

  The note informs them that they're now entered into the "Liar Game Tournament" and provides the identity of one other person who received the same package. The only rule of the first round of this tournament is that, in 30 days, each person has to return their starting sum. If you can steal any cash from the other person, you can keep it. Of course, the other person will still owe ¥100M...

  A detailed exploration of psychology and game theory. Throughout the tournament, the anonymous organisers introduce increasingly complex scenarios for the "contestants" to act out. The solutions are all discoverable if you want to think them through for yourself (though the optimal strategy is, after the first one or two, often incredibly non-obvious or counter-intuitive at first glance). Or you can just sit back and enjoy the protagonists solving it themselves.

  I love this story. The later puzzles are really stretching the average reader's ability to think in Game Theory. Well, either that, or I am dumb.

  I highly reccomend this. In most games, I've been able to predict moves before they're revealed to the audience, but rarely able to catch the full gambits being worked. None of Akiyama or Nao's opponents are stupid. 

  Part of what I love about the Liar Game is that there's strategy and tactics. The tactics are how you win in the individual games; the strategy is how you achieve your goals and acquire allies throughout the rounds of the Game.
