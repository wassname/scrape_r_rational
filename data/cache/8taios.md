## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  What's some interesting stuff you could do with earthbending/geokinesis?

    depends on the limitations... I guess avatar limitations?

    > Ideally any power to be munchkined should have consistent and clearly defined rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.


    * from breaking and entering through walls, to making areas only accessible with earthbending

    * finding minerals deposit

    * using it to make electricity [(with a generator)](https://gravitylight.org/) maybe moving a generator wheel with your earthbending

    * make sculptures (probably needs special earth)

    * built tunnels

    * farming

    * earth bullets/spears instead of earth disks or bolders

    Depends on power and finesse.

    **Low power, high finesse**

    -Lift clouds of very fine dust off the ground to create dust bombs.

    -Cleaning museum pieces and such without breaking them.

    **High power, low finesse**

    -Crush a whole bunch of matter into a small area. Depending on specifics and range, you could create explosives or armour.

    -Tilling large fields.

    **High power and finesse**

    -Mass construction of basic housing.

    -Atomic manipulation for science and fun.

    And, of course, lethality for opponents is large. After all, bones could be considered minerals.

    If the power is well known and unfeared by the population, then you could make money as a one man construction team for foundations/landscaping. Also maybe if your power is detailed enough, you could sort different minerals or metals out of the ground. Like panning for gold or cleansing an area of a chemical spill.

    Bore holes. Mining. Undersea tunnels. Tunnel from Japan to Korea? No problem, won't take decades, just a few months.
    Edit: Mars/Moonbase made out of rock tunnels? If you can get there somehow, that is.
    ```

    So long as you're capable of levitating pieces of earth heavier than yourself, you could use smaller pieces of rock as platforms (or rock armor idk) for flight.

    On a weirder note, vibrating the ground beneath someone's feet at specific frequencies could cause a number of symptoms (bone/joint damage, nausea, visual damage, basically anything sound weapons can do).

    You might also be able to create something like a rail gun with a large group of Earth benders standing in formation.

    Using grains of sand to scratch someone's cornea or other soft sensitive parts of the body like those within the ear.

  [Borrowing from Marginal Revolution](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/06/what-if-sleep-was-a-commodity.html), what if sleep was a commodity that could be bought or sold?

  e.g., I sleep for 15 hours and then sell 8 of those hours to you. You get all the benefits of having had 8 hours of sleep (and therefore get to go a full night without sleeping, without costs) while I get the benefits of having 7 hours of sleep.

  Anyone can buy or sell sleep at any time; it's a fungible commodity. More details at the link.
  ```

  - u/vakusdrake:
    ```
    I think the obvious consequence is that nobody in a developed world would sleep except as a luxury and nearly all sleeping would be outsourced to third world countries.
    ```

  - u/munkeegutz:
    ```
    Well, if you further suppose that we have the same work/play split of 8h/8h, then anyone making over 1.5x minimum wage will likely pay someone to sleep for them - that will effectively be their job full-time.  If this can be performed at a distance, I foresee some low-income country like inda/china establishing a "sleep farm", providing the high income citizens with sleep surrogates.
    ```

    - u/Gurkenglas:
      ```
      The painless injection or drink can surely be shipped around the globe. Note that newborns are much cheaper to the unscrupolous sleep farmer than humans raised and taught to no good end.

        Well, that got even more horrifying fast.

    > Even an “around-the-clock” sleep-worker could only net 16 hours of saleable sleep per day. The other 8 hours would have to go to meeting their own sleep needs.

    This implies some kind of "safe coma" which would be a pretty amazing trick on its own.  And you could probably set up a 'dorm'-style living arrangement that's suitable for sleep-sellers.

    One option might be a weight-loss spa.  People could sign up for a 3 or 4 month stint.  Then they'd spend 22 hours / day sleeping, with a couple hours for hygiene, food and exercise.  University students might do this over the summer and get back to their university thin toned and rested.  Depending on the costs, you might even have some extra spending money.

    Something similar would be good for long-term care facilities.  If I'm recovering from a car-accident, I'd be OK with a facility that let me sleep most of the day while i waited for my bones to knit.

  Munchkin a hive mind in human bodies

  Say one day you become a North Korea hivemind. All current citizens of nk are a single entity, any new ones born from the womb of a current hive mind will also be hive mind

  Do you hide this? What do you do? What are some things you can do that you wouldn't be able to otherwise (get rid of inefficiencies like multiple houses, everyone eats together, etc)
  ```

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    Emigrate. Western machines are better at food, I am absurd at skilled labor.

    Work for upkeep, research AI safety for technological victory.

    Political defense: "I didn't ask for this! I'm just trying to make the best the world can of the situation. I will happily let the South Korean citizens speak to what I remember of their loved ones."
    ```

    - u/RMcD94:
      ```
      I was thinking anything you learn, the hive mind learns. A tech victory is a great idea since all your coding is written as if by a single person.
      ```

  - u/vakusdrake:
    ```
    Firstly I would fake a cou and then use my massive knowledge to emigrate across the world, since all of my "members" would be skilled enough to earn work visas. People may think it's weird that such a disproportionate number of North Koreans were so incredibly motivated but it would hardly make anyone raise the possibility of a hivemind.       
    I'd also use eugenics on myself pretty extensively rom the get go to both increase the number of geniuses coming up with new ideas and to reduce the cost of health problems, plus of course all the women in the hivemind with decent genetics would have an extremely large number of kids effectively increasing our power.

    Long term many of us would arrange to end up "Orphaned" so nobody knew where we came from and then secretly use our competence to effectively take control of a massive number of institutions within a generation or two. Meanwhile we'd be using genetic engineering extensively and hiding a substantial technological lead in AI.         
    So however long AGI might have taken otherwise we'd develop it vastly sooner and have enough of a lead to take our time on safety. Once I develop FAI it will have my preferred utility function and it can probably figure out a way to use its tech to restore the identities of all the people taken over by the hivemind.

  How would you munchkin Luke Cages powers (super strength and bulletproof)?

  Seems also like he gets tougher if he gets wounded in the new season on Netflix.

  EDIT: Also how would you beat him?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I think super strength and bulletproof invulnerability, at Luke Cage´s level, aren´t necessarily that powerful as munchkin tool in a modern society, even if Luke could make tons of money in private security.

    The truly remarkable thing about Luke Cage´s powers, is that he was granted them by science, not natural mutation, and the man that gave him his abilities is dead. The science of giving normal people superpowers is still in it´s infancy because, as the Jessica Jones series shows us, it is really hard, the failures die, and the successes have a habit of breaking out and disappearing. 

    If I were Luke Cage, the way I would munchkin my ability would be to retrain in the biomedical sciences, and use the fact that I have unlimited access to one of the only successfully created superheroes (myself) to try and learn how to recreate the process in others. I would analyze my own tissue samples, run experiments, do anything and everything in order to try and find out how to make more people super, because selling that would make me very rich, and a little trans-humanism never hurt anybody.

    Marvel in general has a problem of introducing technologies capable of creating super-humans, and then just kind of... ignoring them. By the time Captain America wakes up, the US government should have entire elite squadrons of super soldiers; the lead scientist dying does not mean the entire idea is suddenly irreproducible, that\`s not how science works. It´s why I like the Marvel Netflix series, especially Jessica Jones season 2, because it explores a world where science can create superheroes (or Enhanced or Powereds), and companies and corporations are, quite rationally, trying to corner the market.

     If I were Luke Cage, the best way to munchkin my power I can see, is to try and corner that market first. 

    But honestly this is the same answer I would give if the question was about Jessica Jones, or Daredevil. Especially Daredevil. Scientifically cracking the code of his ability could potentially give who knows how many disabled people access to an alternative mode of "sight", greatly boosting their autonomy; when it comes to get-rich-quick potential it doesn´t get much better than that.
