## [q]summon /u/user_simulator to find out how you talk

### Post:

Posted here because I figure seeing how the bot posts will show people how they tend to write, as well as an example of a really cool AI. the format is:
        
    +/u/user_simulator /u/whateveryourusernameis

For example: +/u/user_simulator /u/gaberockking

### Comments:

- u/BSSolo:
  ```
  +/u/user_simulator /u/user_simulator

        That last sentence is gold, though.

        >Insert massive battle, with crazy painless soldiers/cultists from helgrind/other memorable empire troops The timelines meet, as Roran arrives with the weaponized guilt trip.

        It sounds like a crackfic.

          "Weaponized guilt trip" might just be my new favorite phrase ever.
          ```

          - u/GaBeRockKing:
            ```
            It's actually the last event in the Inheritance cycle (sorry for spoilers). I think it might have chopped up a few sentences from a post I made about it a while ago, and "The timelines meet" must have been something from /r/rational as well.
            ```

        - u/Chronophilia:
          ```
          A lot of these sound like crackfics! I think it comes from mashing up a lot of comments about science fiction and/or video games.
          ```

      - u/User_Simulator:
        ```
        I knew full well how unfun they are your first warning system, and work even if only because I'm a PC beta screenshot, PS4 and PC ultra mode look a lot better. >much better cooling The S version of ableton, I'm not kidding. Insert massive battle, with crazy painless soldiers/cultists from helgrind/other memorable empire troops The timelines meet, as Roran arrives with the weaponized guilt trip.

    Dude and/or dame, look at the silver bodies falling like rain. Harry wouldn't be available for the story is not high enough that most of you and found that you will need to write something that makes them the same period of time. Or yet another standpoint the integer zero is a nice comment from HPMOR!Quirrell. You have just proposed literally the longest finite story ever proposed in the first obvious reason why they'd extend over to that starting from just 300mcg of melatonin total, and increased my dose over time. The document makes around as good as my estimate of audience ability went up, my transparency went back to the second, to the best of my knowledge or consent.

    It seems obvious to me that this is less than your daily rhythm is shot. Similarly, you can have mining capacity go down too - and the new removal of constraints allows for longer chains - which surprised everyone. I think you mentioned had to do with their salary.

    All in all, I'd say that Skyrim is more static, since the Dumbledore in the article... I'm pretty sure the stick is used in later ships, the ships themselves that it will be disappointed. Be wary of getting you the hermit crab.

      Ah yes. That dumbledore character's ship stick provides really shitty endowments so ship players will want to avoid playing with him if they anticipate a lot of trouble in the late game. Skyrim's sapient ship mod wouldn't work if it had the same sort of progression system because then its high-wizard classes would be completely unbalanced.

      And yeah, the hermit crab is clearly a pretty boring class to get assigned in the sapient ship mod because you'll end up being assigned to sitting around blocking hallways during boarding for most of the game.

        That was actually quite draining.

        It's like when I used to go around interpreting art in Secret Habitat. It was all just randomly generated blobs of color, but if I looked deeply enough, I would see so much. Probably a skill worth practicing though.

    They're within your 20 minute stroll, but only just... and as many as we could get for the beta and I had an aunt and uncle who banned my little cousin from reading stuff like this. My then-fiance said it was solely for my entire class to, y'know, find out what the cilice is for. My mum died, then my dad was diagnosed in adulthood. They want their day of the people I left behind to know what the cilice is for. Why should this discussion ought to start. It's a hell of a full Scottish breakfast. One interviewed me on the 10th and 11th, and anything thicker than 0.7 is just the culmination of years of marriage.
