  I know this gets brought up whenever there's an interlude with the Calamities, but they are absolutely fucking horrifying. Warlock opening up a layer of hell, blowing up a flying tower, and turning the sky red, is *shaking off the rust*.

  Wekesa seems pretty cocky. Is this the battle where he dies?

  Black's made a miscalculation in thinking that the Tyrant wants to become the Hierarch. Anaxeres is already the Hierarch so how is that going to trip up Amadeus?

  Black doesn't believe the Ashen Priestess is gone for good. Will she be back?

  Stay tuned for the next exciting episode where (hopefully) these questions, and more, will be answered.

    I have a feeling that heros die like comic book superheros, that is, until it's convenient for them to be alive. And whatever bullshit needs to happen to reanimate then or show how they avoided death will turn up out of nowhere.

    > Black's made a miscalculation in thinking that the Tyrant wants to become the Hierarch. Anaxeres is already the Hierarch so how is that going to trip up Amadeus?

    The obvious issue that comes to mind - Black was expecting Tyrant to transition to Hierarch, and as such didn't worry about collateral damage in Nicae. But there's already a Hierarch, and while he's from an Evil city, he represents seven city-states that are both Good and Evil aligned. 

    Collateral damage in Nicae, a Good city, gives him cause to turn against Tyrant (whom he already hates for sticking him in this position and compromising his values) and Praes, and opens an avenue to reach out to Procer for reinforcements... which may also be casus belli for calling a Crusade. Exactly what Praes and the Calamities wanted to avoid - and which will likely delight Tyrant, who thrives against bigger challenges.

  It's really nice peeking into the calamities l' heads once in a while.    
  Wekesa sounds like the kind of guy that'll die first, though.

  I just love that everybody just misread the tyrant just the right amount off for him totally blindside everyone.

      Comment by "d_o_l" in the chapter
      >So at this point, I’m 90% sure that Ranger is already dead:

      >1. The Queen of Summer is part of Cat’s story. Ranger can’t kill her before her big confrontation with Cat, it would be too anticlimactic. At the same time, Ranger’s Name won’t allow her to retreat or give up once she’s set her eyes on a new target. Therefore, the only possible outcome of their battle is Ranger being killed, or somehow made unable to continue pursuing the Queen. The Queen has no reason to imprison her, and imprison someone like Ranger is an exercise in stupidity anyway, so the only other real option would be for Ranger to sustain a crippling injury.
      >2. Ranger has bound herself to the Calamaties, and the Calamaties are clearly on their way out. Someone last week was speculating that the way Ranger has lived for so long is by never allowing herself to become seriously involved in a story. But then she joined the Calamaties, and now she’s involved in Cat’s story as well. Even someone as insanely overpowered as Ranger can be defeated if the story demands it.
      >3. Building on that, Ranger is pretty stupidly overpowered. There has to be SOME limits to her power. If she can kill the Queen of Summer, then what can’t she kill? She becomes a walking deus ex machina.
      >4. There are some pretty damn suggestive quotes from the last couple of chapters:

      >“Let me tell you a secret, my friend,” he whispered. “She’s already won. The opposition was watching the wrong fire the whole time, and the intricacy of the trap is exquisite. She made the kill without them ever seeing her.”

      >…

      >“Even if my pretty little mages had been untroubled, the Beast would have survived. The Healer should have too, life split in half with her sister. A touching story of sisterly love, if you care for that sort of thing. She didn’t because she was a sacrifice. Her weight was stolen, because there was another use for it. With nothing you can only trade for nothing.”

      >…

      >“She’s going to kill him,” the diplomat said.

      >“Of course not, my beauteous blooming flower,” the Tyrant tutted. “Nothing so crass. She’s going to hurt him. And when the cold thing turns into a wounded animal, well, that’s when he starts making mistakes.”

      >And today:

      >“That’s the thing with invincibility. You have it until you don’t.”

      >Everyone thinks Sabah is going to die, but they thought that before, too. Black has been doing this for a long time, and he’s really good at it. He’s not going to miss obvious death flags, he knows how to avoid them. But while he’s all busy paying attention to the Tyrant and Sabah, the Bard snuck off and set in motion the events which will lead to the death of the one person he never even thought was in danger.

        Oh snap.

        Ranger also literally gave the New Crew™ their name — a symbolic passing of the torch. _Massive_ death flag
        ```

      - u/-main:
        ```
        Don't forget Scribe threatening Cat, conditional on Cat killing Black: "if Hye doesn't kill her, I will". Well if Hye's already dead, then that's one obstacle out of the way for Cat surviving the usual "apprentice kills the master" Black Knight story.
        ```

        - u/mojojo46:
          ```
          Yeah. This line in particular makes me almost wonder if Black is actually playing a deeper game than we realize and is *allowing* Ranger to die in order to be able to pass the flag to Cat without her being killed. Maybe the Tyrant is still underestimating Black?
          ```

          - u/Oaden:
            ```
            Black doesn't have that level of omniscience, he currently doesn't even know that Anaraxes is the hierarch. 

            For him to set up Hye's demise, a woman he claims to love (though admittedly he is the carrion lord) he would have to have foreseen Cat's entry into summer, and the fact that the summer queen would actually engage them. To add to this, he would have to do this from the location of the siege, since its only there that he learned of his imminent death.

            Now he isn't actually doing something to prevent it, but from his point of view, there is nothing he can do that would actually increase her odds of survival cause she's the strongest being he knows.
            ```

            - u/mojojo46:
              ```
              I generally agree that Black isn't omniscient, but maybe he knows more, at least in broad stokes, than he lets on? From Cat's internal monologue while talking to the Winter king, we know that Black's fatal flaw is that he will do *anything* to achieve a path to victory, no matter the cost. I think it's totally in character for him to consign those he most loves, and even himself, to death if it means victory. 

              I have no idea if this is actually what he's doing, but it doesn't seem completely impossible.  I also have to wonder what, exactly, he's doing battling the White Knight if he's already determined that he is Cat's narrative enemy?  What's his game? I really don't know.

              Also, Ranger is only so insanely strong so long as she doesn't get in the way of the story. The fact that she's a lone agent, randomly fighting people just cause she can, is why she is allowed to be so OP. Black should know this.
              ```

      - u/ODIN_ALL_FATHER:
        ```
        I think the biggest wrench in this hypothesis is that the Ranger doesn't have to kill. After all she has never killed the undead King and even more telling is she didn't kill the prince of winter (whose title I don't remember). All she did was steal his eye. It could be something similar with the Summer Queen where all the Ranger cares about is the thrill of the hunt and not the kill.
        ```

        - u/M3mentoMori:
          ```
          The Dead King and the Prince of Nightfall are significantly weaker than Ranger, at least in terms of personal power, while the Queen is not. I don't think the Queen of Summer will fall so easily, or allow Ranger to retreat.

          Plus, as others have mentioned, a lot of clues here are pointing to Hye dying. Tyrant's monologue to Hierarch about Bard killing someone they don't expect to die (which Ranger fits. Captain, Warlock, and the other active Calamities are, well, active. They're more likely to run into some hero who kills them as opposed to the neutral Ranger.), the chapter quote about how fleeting invincibility is (Hierophant reminisced about how Black and Warlock's plan for taking on Ranger was/is 'don't', which is a perceived 'she's nigh-impossible to kill.), and how Ranger's death turns Cat killing Black from suicide to something she can live through.
          ```

  - u/MoralRelativity:
    ```
    What's Ranger got to do with it? She wasn't even there. (Unless I missed some hint?)
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      We're assuming that the pull-away from Ranger's fight with the Queen and all the dramatic buildup surrounding the Calamities in these interludes is leading towards a sudden reveal that Ranger bit off more than she could chew and is going to die outright or be severely crippled.
      ```

      - u/MoralRelativity:
        ```
        Thanks. Now having read all the other comments above I tend to agree with the analysis. RIP Ranger indeed.
        ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I'm starting to think 3 Calamities are taken off the board here (with an appropriately named chapter called Calamity III).

  Captain is getting too old for this s*** and feels bad for the hero she has to kill. We also learn that she and Warlock are not fully on-board Black's meta-plans, they're just along for the ride. She gets got death-wise or conscience-wise via champion with maybe a First Prince assist. 

  Warlock is feeling too invincible and goes via Hedge-Wizard, Hierarch, and maybe Priestess Reborn. Feeling some Arcadia mischief in there too.

  Ranger just namesaked the next generation and is offscreen "where no one else is looking". Bard and Tyrant indirectly do her in, though it may just be a crippling as others have mentioned. 

  I doubt a single Calamity going is enough to send Black over the deep end, but 3 ought to do it.
  ```

  - u/Esryok:
    ```
    I wonder if the Bard and Tyrant are misreading Black. His major characteristics are:
        1. loyal to a fault (per Scribe & Bard)
        2. willing to sacrifice anything in the pursuit of victory (per Squire)
        3. clarity of sight (per himself)

    His enemies seem to think #1 is going to prove his primary motivating force if a Calamity dies, but we've already seen him consider turning on Malicia. It sure doesn't feel like he's told the Dread Empress that Catherine is hearing "The Girl Who Climbed the Tower." Moreover, we saw him even contemplate killing the other Calamities in the last chapter.

    Granted we saw Squire's Role force her to have an unnaturally strong reaction to rebels being hanged. Maybe Bard's genre savvy will trump everything regardless.
