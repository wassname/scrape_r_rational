Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I've read an implausible amount of stuff that was recommended here in the last week. So, collected, short reviews.

  [**Vigor Mortis**](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40373/vigor-mortis/)

  Young woman gets necromancy powers in a very unique fantasy setting. Would recommend to fans of solid worldbuilding, character power progression, or who just want a pile of well-written words to read, but not people only here for deeply rationalist themes.

  Prose, pacing, and characterization are all solid. The worldbuilding is really remarkable; it's a very unusual setting, which manages not to feel different just for the sake of being different, and information is presented as needed, without trying to create cheap mysteries by withholding things the characters already know, and without long infodumps.

  My biggest concern is that, as of the last chapter I read, it was spending an increasing number of chapters on villain interludes to build up an antagonist. It's an odd pattern I've seen mostly on Royal Road, which usually craters a story's momentum, but it hasn't actually done so yet.

  [**Hermione Granger and the Silent Country**](https://archiveofourown.org/works/27111157)

  Harry Potter AU where Voldemort took over Wizard Britain and the Granger family fled to France when their daughter was seven. Would recommend to Harry Potter fans, fans of solid worldbuilding and prose, and people who have long to-read lists where they can shove this a few works down.

  The writing quality on this really is phenomenal, and I was blown away at just how real the political tensions of the world felt, and how characters respond to them realistically.

  The only reservation I have with this is that it updates slowly and not much has happened yet. I believe the author is actually going somewhere with this, but I can't give a full-throated recommendation to something that's still deeply in its buildup phase, even if that buildup is so well written.

  [**The Last Angel**](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/threadmarks)

  2000 years after humanity lost a space war, the AI of their last best ship tries to plot revenge against the evil space empire that nearly wiped them out. Would recommend to fans of military science fiction who are running low on things to read.

  It's interesting and well-enough composed military science fiction, but after a few chapters of things actually happening, it spends another 20 of the author assuring you that something will eventually actually happen, this is all very portentous, just wait it's going to be big, the AI ship is very cool so you won't want to miss it. Meanwhile any forward progress is halted as the author inserts more and more side story interludes and advances the main plot an inch at a time.

  The writing is good enough that I got through half of it before getting completely fed up, so there's that. I may or may not finish this.

  [**An Infinite Recursion Of Time**](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/43761/an-infinite-recursion-of-time)

  Someone who has clearly read Worth The Candle has decided to write shlock. It's frequently pretty funny shlock, and it moves quickly enough that I had fun reading it, but it's definitely shlock. Would recommend to people who have read Worth The Candle and want to read some trash. Wouldn't recommend to people who haven't, both because you have something better to read already, and because a lot of the funnier bits are clearly taking the piss on WTC and sometimes rational fiction.

  Also has sex scenes with hentai-quality writing, not even eroge quality writing.

  [**Not Your Heroes**](https://archiveofourown.org/works/30983558/chapters/76526360)

  Harry Potter fanfic where somewhat shitty people get self-inserted into the places of Harry and Hermione. They spend their time pulling mean-spirited pranks on people. It's trying to be a crack fic laugh fest, but weak characterization means none of the character dialogue is that funny, and a lot of it is just lists of mean pranks. I'm not sure why someone recommended it here, or why I read so much of it.

    >An Infinite Recursion Of Time

    Enjoyed this one. Wild and outrageous. Also, prediction on the ending.  It's all a plot by the Goddess to get someone worthy of the Alpha Heaven so she can have sex. Being trapped there all alone for centuries has left her incalculably thirsty.
    ```

      Does it count as being a cuckqueen (cuckgoddess?) if you intend to eventually jump those bones and not stop until the heat death of the universe, but only after the dude's fucked his way through a harem and a half first while you watch it all?

    - u/SoylentRox:

      Seems reasonable though this is like predicting an action movie will end in hand to hand combat between the villain and hero.  (Because they nearly always do even though earlier in the movie thousands of rounds will go through firearms)
      ```

  - u/gramineous:
    ```
    Pointing it out in case it was missed, but The Silent Country is part (#14) of a larger work, split into separate stories, called There is Nothing to Fear. The author posted it here yonks back in the early days too, you can access it from the Ao3 series tag on the linked fic or on sufficient velocity. Update pace slowed with all the pandemic stuff (presumably, iirc they used to be a bit more frequent, but kinda less ambitious in length so idk), but the author posts a bunch of assorted and broad worldbuilding documents and resources for writers to use on their Patreon still (most available at the $3 tier I think). Stuff like food preparation for fantasy races, a series of "108 fantasy names/titles/epithets based on X culture/civilisation" from history, I think they're working an a interesting system of divination magic right now iirc, and a bunch of other bits and bobs I keep meaning to give the time it deserves.

    I've stalled out on The Last Angel.

    On the one hand, it was clear fairly early on with Book 1 that >!the Confederation crew on board (almost said 'Covenant') was all going to be killed horribly by Nemesis. A literal horror movie. There wasn't much suspense in that there was no question that Nemesis would succeed in killing the Confederation crew.  And so that happened.  And while it was well-deserved, it did sort of drag on for a while.!<

    I haven't gotten to far into Book 2 yet, not sure if / when I'll get back to it.

  - u/jaghataikhan:
    ```
    I finished Last Angel a few years ago (so my impressions have faded a bit), but the pacing continued to be pretty bad throughout, and the finale left me feeling a bit meh. 

    The best parts were the horror scenes of the Confederation crew on board, and I liked the vengeance well enough, but I probably won't read the sequel

      Unless I'm misremembering the author behind Last Angel also did some pure scifi horror stuff before that one. I recall it was on some strange site so you won't find it on SB or SV.

  What are some stories where the protagonist reaches "endgame" power and actually spends time using it? Feels like most stories they reach the endgame and boom story is done. Even in MoL Zorian reaches the peak and then it's some chapters of preparation before the ending. 

  The closest I've seen to it is probably Ar'Kendrythist, where the protagonist reaches almost endgame levels of power and now the focus is on research and politics, ish. Wizard's Tower also fits, although it's more of a slice of life story.

              Same. Suddenly going from the big build up of all the previous post-loop stuff to being kind of unclear in broad goals killed the momentum. "Escape the loop - > get somewhere safe - > establish self and pull some weight - > stop the ascendant/foreign country killing me - > fight a whole war alongside the country I joined (because better odds for success, the allied country see it as an opportunity for themselves, and also the power of friendship)" isn't hard to sort of boil down, but the stuff in Eternity feels wishy-washy. There's this whole new world here and I don't know what the mc wants. Returning is a goal, but then the path towards that is kinda unclear to both the character and the reader, exactly how time sensitive things are isn't clear (especially with the rate to gain power enough to do this being in-world unreliable and depending highly on risk and luck), there's this whole multiplanar world here that's kind of just a means to an unclear end as the protagonist gets quickly dragged through it in the vague hope that he's going in the right direction, and the two factions aren't really known about beyond the most broad of their goals. Maybe it'd at least work better as a physical novel, since you'd get the much more clear separation between novels to help mark entering Eternity and all that shift. Like I still read it, but I have a bunch of different stories update in the same ~6 hour window as this story, and more often than not I open them all up on my phone, then just go through the other 3/4 and go back to Menocht Loop some other time since it's not as engaging right now

                I have a similar opinion. I'm still caught up on it, but there's a very real lack of tension. We don't feel any time tension, Ian is effectively immortal, and the doom of his original world is lampshaded by it being realms away. If I were to try and suggest changes, Eury would still be getting almost as much attention as Ian.

                That being said, it was a fantastic series up till now, and I'm still relatively engaged with it. I certainly don't have experience writing at this level, so I could be entirely wrong.
                ```

                - u/gramineous:
                  ```
                  Yeah, I think more Eury interludes would be engaging and tie to (what seems to be?) the next major plot goal. Hell, throw in interludes from the protagonist's family, or the son of the Eldamari(spelling?) that had his life flipped upside too.

    Hmm. This is a very vague request, so I made some assumptions of what you meant, and then picked from works that qualified that I think would get a good reception to your average r/r reader. I'll list them here, if any of them are inaccurate lmk and I can refine this list further or expand it.

    1. The main character must be significantly above average for their setting, or at least their part of it, with probably <100 peers (exact number flexible). Something like Star Wars: The Clone Wars wouldn't count even if Obi-Wan is the protagonist for the arc.

    2. Not Peggy Sue / Timetravel. Loads of these qualify, but they're their own thing. If you do want these recommendation I have a bunch but for now I'm leaving them out.

    3. It must be essentially the last power level they reach. Something like Dragon Ball, where they achieve endgame power, are endgame for a whole arc, and then 2 arcs later there's a new endgame power revealed from nowhere don't count.

    4. The power in question is personal power, and not political power, military command, etc.

    I think the issue is that endgame stuff is just inherently uninteresting. Also why no one ever plays D&D at the higher levels.

    Lord of the Mysteries plays pretty high level for a pretty long time, though earlier bits are probably better than later bits. I Shall Seal the Heavens has a pretty long endgame. Both CN translations.

      Bad writing is just inherently unintersting. A good writer can make "endgame" stories and overpowered characters extremely exciting, it just necessitates a different type of storytelling and precludes you from using common plots that could be "solved" with sufficient application of firepower. 

      Authors who are used to writing LitRPG combat-grinders or classical hero's journey D&D style stories struggle at higher "levels" because its simply something they're unfamiliar with since they have much more experience writing a character who faces certain kinds of adversity.

  [Valkyrie's Shadow](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/39336/valkyries-shadow) is an ongoing (675K words so far) [Overlord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlord_(novel_series\)) fan fic on Royal Road. It is exactly as advertised by the author:

  > Slow buildup. Methodical storytelling with a focus on well-rounded kingdom building and character development.

  Things to note:

  * When the author says "slow", he or she means *slow*. For the most part, the slow pace and the multiple POVs worked for me, but caveat lector.
  * Many characters, including the second main character (introduced in Book Two), are non-human. Crucially, "non-human" means more than just a different appearance: they think and act in non-human ways, which results in not-so-occasional confusion and even conflict.
  * Much of the fic is about different species, whose lives were upended by incomprehensible forces outside of their control, trying to adapt to a new reality and figure out how to live and work together. Or at least to survive.
  * The author knows enough medieval history to make the human society look believable. 
  * Most characters act "in honest pursuit of their goals", although their goals are shaped by their biology, personalities, background and the information that they have. Some of their goals can be hard to reconcile with the new realities of the Sorcerous Kingdom, which helps drive the conflict.
  * Very good SPAG with only occasional minor imperfections. This is a minor miracle considering how fast the author writes.
  * The "NPCs" from the canon felt authentic and well developed.

  Things that didn't always work for me:

  * The humor, which was largely driven by "culture clash" moments, occasionally felt overdone or contrived. It didn't happen very often, but it did happen.
  * Some of the descriptions, especially early on, while technically fine, were hard to visualize.
  * Some of the dialog was on the info-dumpy side.

  Other than that, it's been an enjoyable ride. 8.5/10 as of the end of Book Two, Act 4.

  Edit: I should add that some reviewers claim that you can read this fic without being familiar with the source material. However, I would advise to read through the end of volume 11 of the light novel series first.
  ```

  - u/Dragfie:
    ```
    +1 from me too, very enjoyable.
    ```

  - u/TornSkippito:
    ```
    As someone recently trying to avoid stories with sexual content or sexual tension-based plots, how is this one? I know a decent chunk of normal Overlord is Albedo / Shalltear / Ainz tension, but can see how a story focused elsewhere could easy avoid that.
    ```

    - u/ahasuerus_isfdb:
      ```
      The tension between Albedo and Shalltear is both present and plot-relevant, but it's not central to the story. For example, when Shalltear receives new information, she frequently interprets it within the framework of the rivalry. However, neither Albedo nor Shalltear is one of the two MCs, so their conflict is mostly a plot device. It's one of the forces that propel the MCs in various  directions.

      Then there is the fact that one of the non-human characters is in immediate need of a mate due to a biological imperative, which affects her judgment for a while, but it doesn't lead to a romantic or sexual subplot.

      Other than that, there is not a great deal of sexual tension. After the Katze Plains disaster, E-Rantel nobles realize that there is a significant imbalance between the sexes, especially at the top of the pyramid. It affects their relationships, but it's a background element with no immediate impact on the MCs or the people around them.

    How much familiarity is required with the original work? Could I understand most of what’s going on by reading the Wikipedia summary?
    ```

    - u/ahasuerus_isfdb:
      ```
      The main Wikipedia summary is too short, but its [list of Overlord characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Overlord_\(novel_series\)_characters) may suffice. 

      The [Overlord Wiki](https://overlordmaruyama.fandom.com/wiki/Overlord_\(Novel_Series\)#Light_Novels) has a lot of useful info, but it may be too much to digest.
      ```

    - u/Paran014:
      ```
      There's a major event involving Shalltear that's covered at the end of S1 of the anime (end of vol. 3 in the novel). That particular thing is actually fairly important to the plot of the fic, though not so important that you would necessarily be completely out of the loop. I think you could follow the fic pretty well having only watched the first 13-episode season or read the first three novels. I think it wouldn't be as good if you're completely unfamiliar with the source material but there are pretty seriously diminishing returns after you're familiar with the characters and some of the major early events.

  The TV series [Fleabag](https://www.justwatch.com/us/tv-show/fleabag) might just be one of the funniest and smartest shows I've seen. It's an incredible mix of subtle character moments and comedy. It also manages to straddle the line between protagonist and villain that only IASIP has done, while making the main character actually sympathetic.

  It also has the talking-directly-to-the-audience bit that I haven't seen done well since House of Cards.

    I loved that video, but I am shocked that you didn't recommend starting with the "Automatic beyond believe, radiant control toaster!" video. That video was incredible. Of course, it also doesn't result in any actionable knowledge (unless you are willing to throw down a couple hundred bucks on an ebay toaster, which I'm not....quite).

    Ok the more I think about it the better your suggestion is. That Sunbeam toaster video, while being fascinating from a mechanical/engineering perspective, is also kind of anger inducing given that _literally no one_ is making a similar toaster today, despite there being high end, >$100 toasters available. It's one of the very few examples I've seen of older things being actually functionally better than any modern option (not better built or more durable, but actually superior in the functionality)
    ```

    - u/fljared:
      ```
      I've seen that video, but honestly I'm not impressed. It's a nice toaster, but it's [cost at release](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/10/who-killed-the-great-american-toaster/245542/) in 1949 was $22.50, or over $250 in 2021. That's a lot for a toaster who's main advantages over modern cheaper models is automatic browning, not needing to pull down a lever, and (to some extent) lasting a long time.
      It's got some great engineering with how it works and not needing motors to go down and up, but at the end of the day it's like finding out that the mildly faster flight also costs 5 times as much.
      ```

      - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
        ```
        That's sort of my point. I'm sure that's why it died. In the 90s when they discontinued it, not many people were willing to pony up that much for a toaster, but now, with the renessaince in home cooking, increase in disposable income, etc., people are [willing to pay nearly that much](https://www.williams-sonoma.com/search/results.html?words=high%20end%20toasters) for some toasters. And I'm pretty sure you could make it for considerably less these days. I've talked to a few people in manufacturing who think you could probably assemble it _in the US_ (ordering most parts from China) for around $100, and that's assuming relatively small scale manufacturing. I'd be somewhat surprised if the inflation adjusted price of the 1997 model (the last one before it was discontinued) was much higher than that, but I can only find the same original price that you linked, so who knows.  

        Considering that there are modern toasters that are nearly $200, and _don't_ have those features, I'm upset.

          Theoretically one would expect this to end in someone running a successful hardware Kickstarter campaign for the toaster in question.

  [Luna Lovegood and the Chamber of Secrets](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/TF77XsD5PbucbJsG3) is a meta-fanfiction of HPMOR hosted on lesswrong. It is funny and has a lot of references to antimemetics. The protagonist is Luna Lovegood so expect the unexpected.

  It has an ongoing sequel: [Tracy Davis and the Prisoner of Azkaban](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/jyqhEPACWZy8vYfGD). So far it hasn't been very rational but I expect it is building up to something.

  Isusr also has a fiction called [Bayeswatch](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/TjdhvTSptCYakw3Lc) which seems to be a spoof on police procedurals but with rogue AI.

  Occasionally, I get in the mood for some spaceships-going-pewpew Science Fiction pulpy nonsense. When that happens, I crack open some Glynn Stewart.

  Are you looking for pewpew spaceships that are about as rational as can be expected? Then Glynn Stewart is for you! (Note: still not all that rational. Contains substantially lower than the median amount of testosterone and bigotry.)

    Has Stewart improved since *Startship’s Mage* (2014)? I wasn't impressed when I read it and haven't tried his subsequent books.

    (I see that he is up to at least 54 published novels now, including 5 collaborations, an impressive pace.)

      That is a book every *seven weeks*.. is this a collective nym or does he have a hyperbolic time chamber?

        According to a [2019 Stewart interview](https://spokeonline.com/2019/12/local-author-steers-his-ship-through-the-stars-of-financial-success/?fbclid=IwAR2XIorJUFG9rdXFPub5WipXCt6_lcy_9VUmR5KRixvX_ICWCKHHRaU6Lu4):

        > As an accountant, he wrote 2,000 words a day in his spare time. Now he writes up to 2,000 an hour, two hours a day: 15 minutes on and five off.

        > “I have to have an outline to do that,” Stewart says. “… I didn’t use to. I used to try the ‘just write it and see where it ends up’ theory. But I can’t write as quickly when I do that, and the books end up feeling a little bit more disorganized.”

        > He hasn’t always followed the break-taking Pomodoro routine variant, either.

        > “I have done a lot of different things over the years to try to keep up the pace. For a while it almost seemed like changing the process every six months was almost an essential part of the process.”

        > Stewart writes one draft, though he’ll revise if necessary.

        > “I start at the beginning, I write to the end, and by that point I am so done with the book.”

        ...

        > “If (he) didn’t release a book every six weeks,” says [his wife] Giesen, “then he would get so many fewer books to work on.”

        > As to the secret of writing compelling fiction, though, Glynn Stewart is succinct.

        > “Blow shit up.”

      I've always liked the characters, so I can't speak to that, but his prose and the science side of his science fiction have both substantially improved. (Caveat: Conviction and its sequels make absolutely no sense from a sociopolitics / worldbuilding perspective.)
