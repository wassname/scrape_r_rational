## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

      Thankfully, no, but [there was a snake](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/faq-the-snake-fight-portion-of-your-thesis-defense). I was bitten a few times, but everyone agreed that it had been a "very tough" snake and that a few bites were to be expected from such a snake, so they didn't dock me any points for that.

        In my dev school we just had to present our, ahem, [warbeast](https://archiveofourown.org/works/19080127) to a bunch of committees over and over again.

        None of them ever tried to, ah, have snakes bite our warbeast to test its sturdiness, or anything hardball like that.

  After years of extremely slow progress on the book series I most want to write, I decided to try something different and just write a short Isekai. 16k words in a week.

  I kinda hate that it's been so much easier.

  It won't classify as rationalist, but it's got a typical genre savvy asshole MC who figures out how to break the system, this time with Wisdom, healing and the ability to magically see through lies. Instead of some kid nobly sacrificing themselves to save somebody else's life, I had the MC be a schoolyard bully who got Isekai'd when he accidentally put himself in danger by pushing another kid to be mean.

  I'll put it up somewhere when progress stalls or the story is done. Mostly just wanted to say 'Yay I did something' and 'I hate that this is so much easier'.
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    > 'I hate that this is so much easier'.

    Yeah.

    When I wrote my last fic I wanted to think about the economic structure of the world and I asked on a ton of economy sites about what a certain situation would look like, and nobody ever answered.

    Eventually I gave up and just improvised the economy part with 
    vaguely-plausible financiababble and in a few days I was done. Nobody noticed the difference.

    I'm realizing that I'm still a little pissed off about that.
    ```

    - u/Rhamni:
      ```
      Understandable. When you care a lot about something you make, you want to get it *right*. When you have to resort to smoke and mirrors and you get away with it, it's almost offensive.

      I studied economics, is that situation one you'd still like input on?

      Also I don't suppose you know in what order symptoms appear when you are the victim of severe polonium poisoning?
      ```

      - u/CouteauBleu:

        > Also I don't suppose you know in what order symptoms appear when you are the victim of severe polonium poisoning?

        Nope.

        > I studied economics, is that situation one you'd still like input on?

        Well the fic is [here](https://archiveofourown.org/works/23704774), technical feedback is welcome.
        ```

        - u/Rhamni:
          ```
          Well, I read it, but I don't know enough about the setting to provide much useful feedback. It sounds like the tech levels are high, but if so communications and the ability to get up to date information on things like stock ownership should be much better. There should never be a need to consult records that are days old. If markets are still running, all data should be available at the push of a few buttons.

          There is clearly some sort of major catastrophe going on, but I don't know enough about it or the world to say how people should react. I do find the lack of communication strange. Nobody ever leaves a factory to produce unwanted goods for weeks, because that costs *money*, which the economy values over anything and everything else. Similarly, short of the apocalypse, stock prices don't bounce up and down 20% outside of the very peak and bottom of market cycles, with very short lived exceptions for disasters like a major pandemic. Look at the Corona crash - -30% across the board in less than two weeks, followed by moves of only a percent or three a day. I guess there might be a more serious pandemic going on in the story, since all those deaths flew under the radar, but the window during which prices move quickly should be pretty short, or you'll need new disasters for every subsequent window of price chaos. 

          Anyway. I don't mean to sound critical. My observations are skewed by the fact that I am not familiar with the setting. Some or all of what I said may be dead wrong because there are important factors that don't exist in reality but which would definitely shape things in this world.

    That's an interesting twist.

  Is the concept of infohazards itself an infohazard?

  I ask because I've seen a fairly consistent pattern play out on this subreddit a few times that goes something like this:

  1. Person 1 mentions infohazards
  1. Person 2 chimes in saying they know of one in real life but don't want to share it because, by it's very nature, it causes harm by being spread
  1. There's a parade of comments asking to be DM'd the infohazard's details, presumably because not knowing is judged to be worse than whatever the infohazard itself is.
  1. This requires sharing the infohazard which presumably makes people worse off than if they had never heard of it in this first place.

  Just something I've been wondering about lately.  I recognize that, if this is the case, I am guilty of bringing up the topic again, so sorry for any harm this mention of infohazards causes.
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Real life infohazards are like real life superheroes: extremely mundane and underwhelming.
    ```

    - u/ozbooks:
      ```
      Oliver Sacks has a book about migraines that talks about migraine symptoms as an infohazard (doesn't use that word though). Turns out that if you describe symptoms of a migraine to someone who gets them, you can sometimes induce a migraine immediately. My partner generally gets only one kind of migraine, but she ended up having a different kind for the first time while reading about the symptoms in that book.
      ```

    - u/Amagineer:
      ```
      They're still kinda scary though, in a mundane way. It never actually occurred to me until I saw [this video (about Windturbine Syndrome/the nocebo effect) by Rare Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9ckNLI9dRc) that things like that are essentially harmful information.
      ```

      - u/CouteauBleu:
        ```
        I'm skeptical. People who want to be anxious or have pre-existing conditions will found external factors to attribute their anxiety to.

        Placebo effect is often way less strong than people imagine, and it's usually just a result of the return-to-the-mean effect. I'm pretty sure nocebo is similarly weak, and a result of similar statistical artifacts and reporting effects.
        ```

    - u/Rhamni:
      ```
      They're really cool in fiction though. I have one in my story that is super annoying for the people whose job it is to search for obscure magical threats, because every time they discover it they have to wipe their memories of it, only to discover it again soon after. It's the only low hanging fruit left for them to find, to the point where they have to start leaving messages to themselves so they can catch themselves early when they're about to discover it.
      ```

      - u/CouteauBleu:
        ```
        So basically SCP-3125?
        ```

        - u/Rhamni:
          ```
          Please tell me there is more information hidden beyond the code lock. And also what the code is.

          Having seen only the containment procedures, yes, that's about the level of noone-must-know I'm going for, coupled with the need for someone to learn about it every few weeks just to confirm that there is indeed a legitimate threat there, and extensive countermeasures are still warranted, now please wipe my memory.
          ```

          - u/CouteauBleu:
            ```
            "55555"

            See also the rest of [the anti-memetics archive](http://www.scp-wiki.net/antimemetics-division-hub).

              Cheers. So the one in my world isn't a creature-like thing like in the SCP, but it's got the same basic setup where they make it so you are most likely to discover it in a special room cut off from everything else. Though in my case the person in the room gets to communicate with the rest of the team outside to dictate what information must be destroyed to stop anyone discovering it again too easily, and then everyone has a nice long brain scrub to forget all about it until it's time to repeat.

              In my world the bad thought is realizing what destiny wants. It's not a living thing and it's not sentient, but once someone realizes what its ultimate goal is, it uses that person's brain capacity to work toward that goal. And it's not a nice goal. Someone knowing what it wants is not an instant loss condition, but it basically shifts the entire universe into Hard Mode until the knowledge is wiped out.
              ```

              - u/CouteauBleu:
                ```
                Ooh, that sounds clever.

                I feel like you could write a pretty good Star Wars story with this.
                ```

  - u/Norseman2:
    ```
    If we had SCP-level infohazards in real life, then yes, discussing them would absolutely be an infohazard. However, usually bringing up real-life infohazards in these sorts of discussions also tends to bring up information which serves to inoculate against those infohazards, and overall, in the context of a highly networked culture where memetic spread occurs rapidly, the benefits of inoculation likely outweigh the risks of exposure.

    As an example, [Bursztyn et al. (2020)](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/BFI_WP_202044.pdf) investigated the effects of Sean Hannity's downplaying of coronavirus and discovered that Fox News viewers who tended to watch Hannity more than Tucker Carlson were more likely to get coronavirus and died as a result. That's a decent of example how real-life infohazards tend to work. Antivaxxer propaganda is another good example of a memetic hazard with a significant death toll. Becoming more aware of bullshitters and ignoring them is a good way to keep yourself safe.
    ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    I kinda want to say no, because for the most part most infohazards aren't that dangerous.

    I'm going to start by stating my personal definition of infohazard. A thought or idea that results in a major, fundamental shift in your worldview which may or may not be traumatic. Some people might say that I'm just defining 'hard truths', but they are very similar things to me.

    The issue is that every person is a lock with a specific key-infohazard that actually harms them. As one can guess, due to how most keys don't fit most locks is another way of saying that most infohazards aren't dangerous to most people.

    The most obvious example is Roko's Basilisk. Most people correctly treated it as another Pascal's Mugging or just as a silly hypothetical, but there were a few who were adversely affected by it. Therefore while most discussions about infohazards don't actually have any, a few do. And while most infohazards aren't dangerous to you in particular, a few do.

    And you can't actually know for sure until it happens.

    Fortunately, infohazards are like a mental virus which means it's possible to protect against them or to inoculate yourself against them.

    * You can simply avoid all topics about infohazards as a general precaution.
    * You can be more selective and only avoid infohazards about topics that you feel deeply passionate about. For example, if you care a lot about AI, avoid Roko's Basilisk. If you have trouble dealing with death, avoid philosophical considerations about whether or not there is an afterlife. If you care a lot about winning and deeply, *deeply* hate losing anything, you should avoid >!losing The Game!<. That part is a little tricky, because it requires you to know your hot-button topics.
    * You can learn to study other people's viewpoints of the world, especially people who you strong disagree with. So if you get overwhelmed, you can fall back on re-framing your worldview in a way that helps with the existential dread. By knowing how other people think, your mindset becomes more flexible and robust.

    Personally, I think dealing with a few infohazards/hard truths are a good thing for people when it comes to maturing and expanding one's mind, but it's something that should be done only if the individual is in a healthy place mentally speaking and ready for it.

    TL;DR - Nope.

    ... I am fairly certain that there is only one Infohazard circulating here, its always the same with me being the original source. People mostly ask because they disbelieve the existence or the infectiousness of said meme. 

    The happy news is that current data makes my meme very much less dangerous that I'd previously believed.

  I'm trying to submit a game to Steam, and the process is really getting to me. I keep finding new pages of places where it wants another four sizes of logo. I think I'm nearing 20 now? They're all different enough sizes and aspect ratios that I need to re-layout the relevant bits to do a decent job. I haven't even started on its inexplicably multi-tiered process for uploading an executable.

  Itch is vastly nicer, but from what I've heard has about 1 in 500 the number of users, so I'm still stuck putting up with it.

  On the bright side, two of the prototypes I've started while procrastinating on this stuff are pretty compelling. No rationalgames yet though; I think my next focus is going to be on things that are fun during quarantine.

    I hadn't even heard of it, to be honest.

    That's probably for the best. We'll be here for a while. Best of luck!

      If you like indie games, Itch is definitely worth checking out. From the creator's side, it's vastly easier to upload a game and they get a bigger cut of the profits than Steam gives you. From a player's side, their downloadable client is much lighter and faster.

  I've been playing a lot of puzzle games lately, mostly because they slot into my schedule a lot easier than most other games would. *Filament* came out lately, and I've been enjoying it. It feels like there's been a spate of conceptually simple puzzle games that have relatively good production values, which I appreciate. *Puddle Knights* was another one. You could have done the same game in an incredibly low-fi way, but it would have lost something, at least for me.

  One of the other things that I've been enjoying about some recent puzzle games is the way that they'll break their framing device, but saying which ones do that would be a spoiler I'd think you'd be better off discovering on your own.

  Anyone got any favorite resources on pursuing eudaimonia or other similar virtue ethics stuff?

  I always leaned utilitarian when I was doing my phil undergrad. Now that I've been out of school for a while (\~5 years), I wish I'd explored virtue ethics more.  Seems more applicable to the day to day.
  ```

  - u/CosmicPotatoe:
    ```
    For me they are more related than you might think. 

    Where do virtues come from? Usually they are qualities of a person that lead to positive outcomes for themselves and society. Cultivating these virtues is a round-about way of increasing utility. You focus on the action first (likely to lead to a result) rather than the result first (likely to result from an action). There are edge cases where they do not align but they can be very similar in outcome, if not approach.
    ```

  - u/callmesalticidae:
    ```
    Natural Goodness by Philippa Foot is a great discussion on virtue ethics in modern philosophy (I'd say she was the first to get it right, but then, of course I'd say that, because this is the book that sold me on virtue ethics), and it's less a book than it is a large pamphlet.

My recommendation is [History of Philosophy](https://historyofphilosophy.net/) podcast, which have [an entire 25-episodes long section](https://historyofphilosophy.net/later-antiquity/hellenistic) dedicated to Hellenic philosophy like the Epicureans and the Stoics.
