  Ah, that smug moment of satisfaction.

  It's even better when we know she's planning on having Saint killed later anyways.
  ```

- u/swaskowi:
  ```
  I'm intrigued that Pilgrim thinks Cats soul is worse? Did he actually see her soul or just look at the sisters? All things considered it seems like it should be much improved from eldritch monstrosity to garden variety human sinner (in his eyes). 

  Can we read anything said as update about Black? Last we saw him he appeared to have been escaping, body and soul firmly intertwined and going to claim a new mantle. Him simply failing and being recaptured off screen seems too neat so I'm going to presume there was some unspoken plan there on his part (or Pilgrim is lying but that doesn't seem likely). 

  Finally speaking of plans, Catherine is totally angling Saint into trying to kill her again, either to rerun this play or for some other story.

    He got bitch-slapped by Sve Noc, all he could see was Winter and two millennia of horrible murders.  If you look at someone's soul and see that, well....

    > Him simply failing and being recaptured off screen seems too neat so I'm going to presume there was some unspoken plan there on his part 

    I'm 40% sure that the Rogue Sorcerer's soul is in Black's possession after Black body-snatched the poor schmuck when everyone else was asleep.  After all, he was put under a spell of silence at all times and chained up so he couldn't move or gesture.  How could the RS tell anyone that Black was in his body before Saint cut his soul out?
    ```

  - u/Menolith:
    ```
    I suppose they're different varieties of horrible. Winter is cold, but sterile in a way, while Night is millennia of gleeful ritual murder and enslavement thrown into the mix.
    ```

    No i dont think he got a look at her soul, just the crows, they blocked the choir of mercy from helping him peek
    ```

    - u/swaskowi:
      ```
      Nah, the choir tries to take a peak, gets blocked and then Pilgrim tries again, presumably with his own aspect, afterward. Andronike laughs at this, its unclear whether she allows it to succeed or not, there's no sensation of effort, unlike with the Ophanim, though whether that was because Pilgrim is weaker than the choir or because they didn't bother to block it, is not clear.
      ```

      - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
        ```
        I think Pilgrim succeeded but only in the way that Sve Noc let him get a glance of what they were. Which is why Andonike laughs. Cuz they are not something one should look at.

        Pilgrim was shook after seeing them. And he's been around the block quite a few times.
        ```

    He was *planning* to escape.  Then he had a portentous conversation, and the scene ends.  It sounds like he ultimately decided against escaping.
    ```

    ```
    Which chapter was Black's escape in? I feel like I don't remember that, so maybe I missed an interlude
    ```

    - u/AurelianoTampa:
      ```
      I was thinking the same thing, and went back seatching; it was the epilogue of book 4, when the Wandering Bard confronted him while he was a captive. Implied he was coming into a new Name while being guarded by the Rogue Sorcerer.

      ```

      - u/Halinn:
        ```
        Thank you. Delightful Hierarch action there. I'd already read it, but had put it aside in my mind because I couldn't reconcile it with Pilgrim thinking him contained. Guess we've another player on the board, one that only the Wandering Bard knows about
        ```

  - u/Banarok:
    ```
    about the soul, he've looked at it 3 times first time in their first negotiations, he says she's a flagellant and damage herself for her cause, her soul being scarred by wounds.

    &#x200B;

    looked at aqua before when she posed as Cathrine, commenting on how horrible it now looked "what have you done" was his line among others, not surprising considering aqua ripped her own soul out and is the Diabolist, or were at the very least, all before Cat nailed her to cloak and entwined her soul in fay magic.

    &#x200B;

    now he see Cathrines soul being full of darkness and night, so her soul should look horrible in other ways then a soul scarred or by corrupted by demon summoning does, horrifying Pilgrim.

      To be fair, [he was probably disguising negotiation for a resurrection as chastising](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/913xug/rthf_a_practical_guide_to_evil_book_4_chapter_34/e2vmcsg/).

  God damn is Cat getting good at manipulation. She just outplayed them in combat, diplomacy, and narrative all at once.

      Holy shit, the reasonable people are the DM's NPCs, while all the heroes are fucking PC's.

      This world makes so much more sense now.
      ```

- u/Academic_Jellyfish:
  ```
  How are they planning to keep Saint prisoner? Only way I can think of is having Komena or Andronike keep an eye on her when it isn't nighttime. Sedation and soul extraction would work too, I suppose, but that doesn't seem like something the drow would have developed Night tricks for. Sve Noc might know how though.

  Edit: Didn't realise she was trading for the body immediately. This is probably why.
  ```

  - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
    ```
    They only need to hold her while Blacks body is fetched, and it's only just gone night. If dawn starts getting close and Black still isn't delivered they can set a deadline.
    ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Have Sve Noc extract her soul. Trade the Saint's body for Black's body. Keep the soul until a ceasefire can be found.
    ```

    - u/dashelgr:
      ```
      But Villains extracting hero souls isn't a story that ends well for Cat. Besides she's planning on killing the Saint anyway
      ```

  - u/PrettyDecentSort:
    ```
    The way that Name is presented, seems like disarming her would go a lot farther towards actually defanging her than it would with most Names. Unusually high power levels are supposed to come with counterbalancing weaknesses, and if your Name is Sword Saint and you ain't got no Sword..... ?
    ```

    - u/ch3rryredchariot:
      ```
      Sounds like that kind of situation would trigger one of those ‘anything is a sword if you’re skilled enough’ tropes though
      ```

- u/Allian42:
  ```
  Why, in the name of all that is sensible, is the Saint here?? Does she not have an unholy abomination to gleefully fight against up north?
