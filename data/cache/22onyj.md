## [HF][DC][WIP] I would like to show you something I've been working on for a long time...

### Post:

Hello, r/rational.


( Allow me first to apologize for rambling - I do that when I'm nervous and want to cover my bases - if you want, you just go for the TL;DR and then click the link if you're interested: kinda-sorta "rational" Naruto heavy AU fanfic I've been working on. Sakura is the main character and it's written in first person except for interludes which are in 3rd person. This is me posting the first chapter for feedback and to see what kind of reception there could be. )


I've been working on a Naruto fanfic for quite a long time. I've never quite seen anything completely like it before in the Naruto fandom. The fanfic is heavily AU, the primary "gimmick" being a very, very extensive lore rework for consistency, believability, scale, history and so forth. I hesitate to label it rational-fic, as while I do my best to hit most of the bullet points in the sidebar here (I consider most of them must-haves for good stories), it's not *explicitly* such a story, though a lot of common rational themes are definitely heavily present later. Still, I hope that an audience which enjoys rational-fic would enjoy my story as well, and if others want to label it rational later, I won't protest.


In short, I think of it as being a mix of what To the Stars did to PMMM (https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7406866/1/To-the-Stars) and what HPMoR did to Harry Potter (http://hpmor.com/). The closest other Naruto fic I've seen is Black Cloaks, Red Clouds, which, like the other two examples, is quite good, I think, and also contains a fair amount of worldbuilding (https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8654967/1/Black-Cloaks-Red-Clouds). I can only hope I might approach something similar to these in my own work. My story consists of three volumes that are each planned to be like a large book in size, each of them split up into several arcs.


Main features in short bullet points:

* "Rationalist" / "Common Sense" reinterpretation of the Naruto universe.
* Sakura is the main POV in 1st person.
* Sasuke is completely gone. Instead there is a female character. This is weird, I know - please bear with me. Read below for details of why this is so, if you care. Have no fear of a Mary Sue. This is very much not the case.
* Land of the Wave arc and so on is completely gone. There is a different plot instead. The main feature that persists from most other Naruto fanfic is the bell test early on, though I hope that I am handling it in a somewhat novel fashion.
* Bullet point introductions from rambling author.


Here's the link:

https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10263221/1/In-Fire-Forged

[Edit] Replaced the link with a link to the fanfiction.net version instead, where the first two chapters are now posted.


Now that I've given you that, I feel a bit more free to ramble in closer detail.


This is my third (and final) attempt at a Naruto fanfic, and the one that I will definitely finish, however long it takes. The first one I started on a casual exploratory whim based on a discussion with a friend (what if Sasuke had been a girl (you can perhaps extrapolate the nature of our discussion from that idea) *and* befriended Naruto early on after the massacre?). It developed into a 140.000 word story which I broke off when inconsistencies in canon began to really get in my way and I wrote myself into a corner, plot-wise, because I hadn't planned ahead well enough. During this story it became apparent that Sakura was definitely my main character, largely (I think) due to the influence of me having read Time Braid and absolutely loving it (https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid).


I started on another fic with the same basic premise, intending to be a bit more sensible about things, changing the parts of canon that just didn't work, and with a more refined and pre-planned plot. This quickly tanked about 20.000 words in, when I realized that it simply wasn't enough. So I sat down and started thinking and planning for real. The overall plot I had in mind had grown from a small hunch of "something-like-this-I-think" to a rather huge construct that I wanted to see through, even if it was just for my own sake. I *wanted* to write that ending, and the story which preceded it.


Half a year later, I've written 40.000 words of the core fanfic, which is about 1/4 or 1/5 into volume one. I have arc and chapter outlines for all volumes, so I have a fair idea of the size of the thing, though these things tend to change fluidly as I write. I predict a total word count of around 500.000-600.000 words, but don't hold me to it. Before I ever start releasing (if I do), I want to write ahead a bit more so I know I could keep a decent regular update schedule for at least the first volume. I also want to see if people even like it.


If everybody hates it, I'll still write it for my own sake because I love doing it and I'm having great fun and learning a lot, but I might not release it to save myself the hassle. At least not before it's entirely done and people can't discourage me any more. As a complete novice, my writerly self-esteem is perhaps more fragile than I might like it to be :P I care more about people's opinions of my work than I should.


This is in addition to the close to 50.000 words of lore and worldbuilding and plot I sat down and wrote before I even started this time around. These are things like various character backgrounds, thoughts on how the "magic/chakra" mechanics work, thoughts on the history of various parts of the world, how the political systems function, how technological development is progressing and how that changes things and so on and so on. Some of this will feature in To the Stars-style skippable intro blurbs at the start of every chapter, featuring excerpts from various books and documents in the world.


I'm not pretending to be perfect - there are going to be stupid mistakes, I guarantee it. But I'm doing my best. I've written a lot of different stuff before, to very positive reception in my own social circle, but I've never released any of my work publicly and I don't trust that my social circle is not completely biased in my favor.


I would greatly appreciate any critique and/or praise from you guys. I always strive to improve.


Cheers, everyone!

  Haven't read yours yet, but I just wanted to say you should definitely check out [Lighting up the Dark](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9311012/1/Lighting-Up-the-Dark). It's based off the HPMOR Naruto omake and seems to stick closer to canon.

  You should _definitely_ release yours as well ([Release Early, Release Often](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often)), if only to build a habit of releasing unfinished stuff, which is valuable for early feedback (tighten those loops!) and community building (social reinforcement helps commitment and enthusiasm!).

  [edit] Wow, full realism along with keeping the element categories for chakras? You don't believe in easymode, do you.

  [edit] Halfway through. Enjoying it so far!

  [edit] Agree with the other commenter. I want moar.

    >__Release early, release often__ (also: __time-based releases__, sometimes abbreviated __RERO__) is a [software development philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_software_development_philosophies) that emphasizes the importance of early and frequent releases in creating a tight feedback loop between developers and testers or users, contrary to a feature-based release strategy. Advocates argue that this allows the software development to progress faster, enables the user to help define what the software will become, better conforms to the users' requirements for the software,  and ultimately results in higher quality software.  The development philosophy attempts to eliminate the risk of creating software that no one will use.

  There is an excellent Rational!Naruto fic called [Lighting Up The Dark](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9311012/1/Lighting-Up-the-Dark), but it rarely more is always better anyway.

  It would be worth a read, I think, more for the rationalist battle tactics than specific divergences from canon. 

  -----

  I read the first chapter you supplied, and it's actually rather good. Seems all that preparation was worth it. 

  The sidebar bullet points don't matter as much as you think they do. Rational fiction is mostly just about creativity and idea density and lacking idiocy and plot convience. 

  Honestly, the real first test of this as a rational!fic would come in the Bell-test itself and the problem-solving process the characters undertake.

    I have, in fact, read Lighting Up The Dark and am subscribed to updates, but I thought Black Cloaks, Red Clouds was a more apt comparison since I'm not explicitly emphasizing any rational aspects of the story. At least not at first.

    I'm basically reading whatever Eliezer Yudkowsky suggests in his updates. The Two Year Emperor is also quite good if you're into DnD Munchkinry (https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9669819/1/The-Two-Year-Emperor).

    I haven't read LUTD, partly because I disliked the Naruto omake. I mean I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't really want to read a Naruto story with the central concepts (the ninja, the demon fox) so altered. I think the original universe is interesting enough that you could make a rational fic out of it without making the ninja all about intelligence and the demon fox have a gigantic brain. That wouldn't even be Naruto, so why write it in that universe? After all, we all liked HPMOR, and wizards there aren't suddenly all rationalists -- quite the opposite,  in fact, magic seems to reaist scientific analysis.

    I like what OP is doing much more. Some subtle (well, maybe not so subtle sometimes) tweaks, upgraded characters and a different storyline that attempts to follow real logic rather than story logic.

    Do you think someone with that mentality should give Lighting Up the Dark a try, after all?

  There's something about this I find intriguing even though I don't really know much about the source material, maybe because [I'm writing something not entirely unlike it myself](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9939806/1/Harry-Potter-s-Time-Traveling-Sister-Who-Is-Best-Friends-With-Naruto), featuring, among other things, a super-smart Sakura and a protagonist who attempts to understand the fundamental rules of the worlds she finds herself in. I'll offer some extensive comments on the writing. Don't take them personally; just try to extract what value that you can from them.

  > On the outside of it

   "On the face of it?"

  > the nature of chakra seems downright absurd.

  This a flaccid hook. It doesn't sound like a sentence from a "Science Illustrated Magazine," which sounds like something for kids. None of the excerpt seems appropriate for the title of the magazine or the specific article, "The World of Chakra," which again sounds like something introductory.

  > as far as is known,

  You use "as is" in the previous sentence, and this would be better as an active phrase if it's for kids. 

  > (cutting winds, lightning sharpness, and so forth)

  I assume these are references to the source material, but I feel like a more involved description of the sorts of properties the elements can produce would be interesting.

  > The reason for this dissonance is not known, but may, strange as it sounds, be bound to commonly held preconceptions in society a millennium ago, when these abilities first began to appear in the historical record

  This is awfully heavy-handed. It's reasonable to expect that folk physics/chemistry would persist across long time periods. They're based on human intuition.

  > There are further chakra sub-elements, consisting of

  You have a lot of unnecessary commas that slow the sentences down. I tend to do that too by reflex, but it's something you need to look over when you edit your work, since it's a problem consistent throughout the piece.

  > Come with us in this special issue, as we explore the strange contradictions and wonders of the world of chakra.

  See, this sentence sounds like something introductory for laypeople unlike the rest of the article.

  > Summer, 1021 AS (After the Sage)

  This doesn't mean anything because I have no context. You could have picked any date and any name and have the same effect.

  > it took a few moments looking at the angles of the sunlight 

  I think your character is realizing what time it is, but this is an awfully strange way to put it.

  > I turned in the bed and looked at my clock. A quarter to eight. It should have gone off more than an hour ago. The alarm must have broken. And then the hard realization struck me.

  This is a bunch of short sentences all in a row. I feel like the broken alarm clock is a missed opportunity. Why did it break? Did she forget to put in batteries? Do machines not work well in this world? Or did she forget to set it--e.g., is she lazy/forgetful? It's a characterization/worldbuilding chance.

  > I tore up out of bed,

  This whole paragraph is really unnecessary. We're not learning anything about her other than that she wears clothes and brushes her teeth. This scene shouldn't be focused on at all unless there's actually something relevant happening. It's much more interesting when she puts on her ninja gear even though the style is the same. 

  > I instantly felt bad.

  This should be the start of a new paragraph. Like the overuse of commas, the problem of not knowing when to begin new paragraphs is pervasive throughout this piece. It's something for you to work on.

  Also, there's a lot of sentences all near each other starting with "I" that continues for a while. 

  > Yesterday. The genin exams had been yesterday, 

  This is both very cliche yet entirely unrealistic, and it makes all the stuff she'd done before seem pointless. Why couldn't you just start from her getting the note if that's really where the story starts?

  > I remembered it now, a long and grueling day of the examiners pulling out all the stops:

  It sounds interesting. I guess I'll take your word for it that it was. I really don't know anything about this world yet, so it's not like I can fill in the blanks here. This passage throws a bunch at us in a rush, yet at the same time it really doesn't have much meaning.

  > I’d stumbled home and received a mercifully

  This is too clumsy. I can feel the author hurrying to fill in unnecessary background information as if trying to justify the choice of the misleading beginning. It's not important information at all, so you can just skip it.

  > I was going to be late.
  Damn.

  Oh, so this is why you started the story in that way. But it doesn't work because the beginning was so unnecessary and unjustified that it feels like the only reason it happened is to set up this mirroring at the end. You should try to find a way to have the initial setup contribute to the story or character.

  On the scene with Sakura and her parents:

  Is this necessary? Will it prove to be important? It feels awfully forced. I'm not sure if that's a problem with the writing, or because it feels like it's exactly the sort of unnecessary scene an amateur writer would include. It's just something for you to think about, whether Sakura's parents really need to be in the story at all taking up time and slowing things down.

  > Drawing chakra together and shaping it,

  This is sort of interesting and the first time it's been explicitly mentioned that the character has superpowers. It's worth making it its own sentence. It's also worth slowing down here and describing what that feels and looks like. 

  > I landed running, and laughed out loud. The feeling was exhilarating. I’d done this before, in class with instructors, but doing it on my own to actually get somewhere in a hurry was an entirely different feeling.

  This would be more effective if you had established what this would mean to Sakura *before* she did it rather than after. The way it is now my reaction is, "Oh, so *that's* what I was supposed to be feeling."

  > When I neared the campus of the Konoha Ninja Academy, I had to go back to running down on the streets

  Try flipping the order of these clauses around. It puts the focus on the appearance of the ninja school.

  > The lecture room was almost full. It could hold fifty people, and there were around forty in here.

  You could set the scene better by including details that would be present like the noise and chatter of a group of people before a ceremony.

  > eligible young ninja in Konoha

  Aren't these characters all like 12 years old?

  > I awkwardly smiled back

  Third time someone's smiled in a single paragraph.

  > Izanami was without a doubt the most eligible, and also the one who was the farthest out of reach, if only because she would probably castrate anybody who even suggested anything of the sort and people could tell that about her. 

  Maybe try breaking this up into two sentences. It's too long for the final clause to have the impact it's supposed to.

  > who had carried out the Massacre

  This speaks to a weakness in the writing, namely the character's limited voice, that is also a problem running throughout the piece. For such an interesting sentence, this is remarkably mundane. There's got to be a more interesting way of stating Itachi's crime.

  > I frowned. “Don’t rub it in.” “What took you so long?” she demanded.

  You make a very common amateur mistake here which is to think you need to change how you tag the characters with each line of dialogue. With dialogue, less is more. For whatever reason, "said" as a dialogue tag is invisible. The audience can read it over and over without noticing it. Furthermore, once you've established who's speaking, you don't even need to tag the dialogue lines at all. E.g. "Hi," I said. "Hey," she said. "What's up?" "Nothing," is just fine, albeit rather dull dialogue.

  Finally, description as a dialogue tag (e.g. "Sure," I nodded) should be kept to a minimum. Generally the audience should understand that a joking character is smiling, a sad character is crying, etc. If you've established the characters and scene properly most of this description should be redundant.

  I'm not sure that all the exposition about the three jounin team leaders. The exposition is both unnecessary at the point it's given and it doesn't really mean anything to us yet. I mean, I realize these are familiar characters and concepts from the source material, but simply taken the story as given it's just an info dump

  > Bla bla bla shameless flattery bla bla bla obligatory speeches bla bla bla, I thought drolly as he droned on about our virtues and our indomitable will of fire.

  Is this how you want Sakura to be characterized? Honestly considering how much exposition Sakura was dumping out just moments ago, I would have expected her to listen a little more closely or at least not be so dismissive. Also, no one describes themselves as thinking drolly. You shouldn't have to tell yourself that what you're thinking is funny.

  > A woman clad in the standard issue green armored vest with twin tanto strapped to her back and her forehead protector worn around her right arm stepped forward from the rest of the jounin. 

  This is a lot of description. Will she be an important character? If not, this is all unnecessary. If she will be important later but not for now, you should either skip it anyway because it's irrelevant for now or you should have Sakura take greater notice of her to indicate that this character will in fact matter.

  Although there's a bunch more nits to pick and a major problem to address (too much telling not enough showing), I've said enough for now. Although the writing is amateurish in a lot of ways, there's something about it that's easy to read and enjoy nonetheless. Don't mind the criticism above; it's intended to be friendly, so take from it what you can. I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of the story.

    Wow. Thank you so much for taking the time to write all of that. Stuff like this is pure gold, and I will definitely take it in the spirit that it was intended.

    Another real gold nugget is the fact that you don't know much about the source material. An incredible amount is actually stuff that's meant to illustrate and implicate the many, many differences that there are between this story and original canon, meant to subvert expectations and cause interest in what *else* has changed. As such, I think they will be taken differently by people who are more intimately familiar with Naruto canon.

    However, this says nothing about how much exposition is needed, and this is a very valuable different perspective. I realize the pitfall of editing back too much, but going back over this chapter with all of this in mind will definitely help me in the future.

    Thanks a bunch! :) Wish I had more upvotes to give.

  Hey, I quite enjoyed the start to your story.

  I want to second what the others said; it's better to regularly release what you have, especially if it's the first story of that size you're writing.

  Some points on the story itself: "Freeze, motherfucker!" is very inappropriate in a Naruto setting. At least in my opinion. It sounds very American.

  I'm also not sure why you've changed the characters to such an extent. Sakura and Naruto seem like *already* developed characters. Naruto in the manga was kind of a dick in the beginning. He changed quite a bit for the better through meeting Haku and Sasuke sacrificing himself for him, for instance. Sakura wasn't very serious about being a ninja until she was confronted with monsters such as Zabuza and Orochimaru. On the other hand, your Izanami seems to be a bit more antagonistic than Sasuke actually was at the beginning. (Before he was broken by Orochimaru and Itachi.)

  But the worst character change is Kakashi being on time. ;)

  I'm not saying the changes are bad, I'm just a bit surprised.

  Anyway, I'm eagerly awaiting further chapters. Are you going to release on fanfiction.net?
  ```

- u/loonyphoenix:
  ```
  Wow, this is really good. Please don't keep this to yourself :) I'll definitely subscribe to your story.

  I can't say anything meaningful about the plot by these two introductory chapters, besides the general feeling that this story is bound to deliver. But I liked the atmosphere, style of storytelling, and pacing.
  ```

  - u/loonyphoenix:
    ```
    Oh and that was one of the best bell tests I have read. I was unsure about Kakashi revealing right at the start that whole teams managed to pass this test in the past, and demonstrating his willingness to lie about the conditions of the test. That seemed like you were making it easier on this bunch of genin to actually figure out the real reason behind the test compared to canon. However, Kakashi managed to make it work, and I think your team 7 managed to pass more convincingly than the canon team 7, who had the meaning of the test explained to them explicitly and given a second chance. I mean, honestly, what kind of stupid team wouldn't guess what was expected of them the second time around, even if they didn't agree with the whole "teamwork is good" speech?

    Edit: I also liked that you made genin graduate at 15 instead of 12. Makes it easier to relate to them for the intended adult (presumably) audience. 12 worked in canon, because it was close to the intended demographic, but it didn't seem logical without sufficient suspension of disbelief (the kind you almost automatically assign nowadays to shonen anime without even having to think about it...).

    Edit2: Also, I liked the change that Naruto isn't a pariah anymore. Honestly, the fact that he was a pariah despite the Hokage's wishes spoke about the Hokage's incompetence. Why the hell would he even release such information to general public in the first place? As far as I understand, supposedly he expected that the villagers would view Naruto as a hero. Such gross misunderstanding of his people (and his inability to present facts in an auspicious light, even) is a BIG failing for a supposedly competent and experienced leader.

    I don't even care how you did it -- made the supposed secret actually secret (most likely), or made the Konoha population more reasonable (though that's unlikely), or made the Hokage more competent at presenting information... the situation was designed to make the reader sympathize with Naruto in canon, but it really didn't make much sense.

    So these are the biggest changes that I noticed and agreed with. And I didn't notice anything big to criticize. So that's all I can say so far.
    ```

      I always wondered about the fact that Naruto was considered the village pariah. It didn't make any sense to me on a lot of different levels. You'll find that jinchuuriki in general are handled very differently in this universe, in a lot of different ways that I thought seemed more sensible and realistic.

      And yes, making them 15 makes things a lot easier. I've found out that I'm generally very bad at writing children convincingly. They always seem too adult. Eliezer Yudkowsky said something of the same nature, I believe. Children are difficult.

  I would like to really thank all of you for your feedback (especially writingathing for his very long and extremely helpful post). I'm definitely going to post the story. However, that won't happen just now.

  I still want to write ahead quite a bit more, at least getting the second arc (10 or so more chapters) close to done before I start posting, so I can keep a regular update schedule. I also need to fine-tune the first chapters a bit, touching up on a few issues that have been highlighted here, though I'm aware that I shouldn't do that too much.

  I do feel a little paranoid suddenly, though! As it is now, the pace drops a bit after these first two chapters meant to hook people, seguing into a more sedate introductory arc with a lot of character interaction and a few interludes from other character POVs, then starts ratcheting up with the next arc after that. I'm hoping that decision wasn't a mistake.

  Meanwhile, as for when it can be expected, I'm hesitant to make any promises. However, in three weeks I'm heading to Tahiti for a month on vacation. I might very plausibly get some writing done there, in quiet peace. We'll see. I'd say within the next two months, very likely.

  I'll post here in this subreddit again when it goes up on fanfiction.net, of course. You can also send me your email privately here on reddit, if you want, and I'll send out a mail when that happens.

  And if anybody still feels like giving feedback, criticism or sharing their thoughts, please do so!

  I like it. I think it's well written. I kind of like the changes from making Uchida female, makes things more interesting than just reiterating the interpersonal conflicts from the original. I don't think I could stand reading a Sakura POV story when she keeps fawning over Sasuke. My impression after the three told their ambitions: I like Sakuras ambition, it makes her (to me) a sympathetic character. It's kind of naive, but that promises character growth. As I remember, the ninjas in Naruto aren't really about helping people, so, how will Sakura react when she comes to a similar conclusion? And about Naruto: your Naruto promises to be less annoying than the canon one, that's good. On the other hand, right now, he seems to be the most boring of the three. I would expect to learn something about what motivates him, soon.

  About the worldbuilding: I think trying to make sense of the world in Naruto is going to be challenging. The canon-world seems to be based more on bullshit than on rules. I don't doubt it's possible to make sense of the politics and magic (even if you have to make most things up from scratch). What I'm wondering about the most is: how do you make sense of the genin being essentially child soldiers? I would expect to read something about that in the TTS-style worldbuilding-blurbs. I can think of three ways to handle that (of course, they are not mutually exclusive).

  The first: The society in your world has values that are very alien to us, which is why they are okay with child soldiering. I think I wouldn't like that approach, reading about a world of evil people. I think the canon-world, because it doesn't seem to address the problem at all,  jumps in my impression very inconsistently between an evil society and a society very much like our own.

  The second: There is some reason that they have to use children or teenagers. That's what happens in to the stars and evangelion. Aside from saying that you have to start training ninjas early, there doesn't seem to be much justification for this approach in the naruto-verse.

  The third: They actually are treated as children. Any dangerous situation that the genin will be in, will mostly be a failure of the adults to protect them. That's the way HPMoR, the original HP and any child-detective stories do it. I think that's the approach that I like most. Something I really like about Full Metal Alchemist is that the protagonists are sometimes treated like children and the adults try to protect them. What *seems* to contradict that approach in your story is the fact that Kakashi graduated the academy early to help the war efforts and Kakashi telling the genin that, them having graduated means that they are adults now.

  Another worldbuildning challenge are the anachronisms. The canon doesn't make any sense in terms of what technology there is. If there are digital watches, I'd expect there to be tanks, airplanes, and bomb, too, and keeping around ninjas seems to me equivalent to keeping horses in the modern military.

    You touch upon some topics which I've been giving a lot of thought. I believe, from what you've written there, that you will be quite satisfied with the overall approach I've chosen for the topic of child soldiers. There are both TtS-style blurbs dealing with the topic, and the story itself will definitely also touch on it.

    Now, the anachronisms, I've got the general core ideas but I have indeed had a hard time dealing with them, and had to make a few choices here and there. Overall it's a part that *might* require a tiny bit of willing suspension of disbelief, though I'm doing my best to have things make sense.

    However, generally I've tried to justify the few cases of major differences in tech level in a few different ways. Mostly either that the fields are separate enough that they could plausibly have developed in a skewed fashion, or that the technology is being imported from different parts of the world that are more technologically advanced. There are also other reasons in more specific cases.

    We'll see if it all works out, I suppose.

  I have released the first two chapters on fanfiction.net. Here's the link:

  In addition, I've decided that I'm going to start updating the story on June 1st, as I work best with a "deadline". There are more details in the author's note of the first chapter.

  [Edit] Also, if you leave reviews on ff.net, you make me a happy person.

  So, let me start by saying that I've read and subscribed. I like your style of writing, I love authors who can update frequently, and I really like people who make the Narutoverse more women-friendly (for instance by making Sakura the main protagonist).

  What I do not get is why you decided to turn Sasuke into a girl. I think it works out in a kind of curious way, but I see no reason for it yet. You mentioned in your original post that you'd explain why you chose to make the change, but you did not really go into it. I'm curious, partially because I really like the Naruto/Sasuke pairing, and Sasuke as a girl kind of ruins that for me. I'm curious what kind of implications intrigued you in the gender-swapping.
