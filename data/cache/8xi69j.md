## New Web Serial: Dynasty’s Ghost (Hello, r/rational!)

### Post:

After a long time appreciating work associated with this community ([“Instruments of Destruction”](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11685932/1/Instruments-of-Destruction) is a favorite), I’m serializing an epic fantasy web novel called [*Dynasty's Ghost*](https://www.royalroadl.com/fiction/19159/dynastys-ghost) that I think the sub might like.

The story grew from the following idea: What if a (difficult) goal of the main characters is to stay out of the politics of the Climactic Battle Between Armies ™ as much as possible?

Stage right is Mai, a princess whose entire world took a plunge with her father out the window, who is now a liability for the factions battling over the carcass of her father’s empire.

Stage left is Broken, an arrogant swordsman who becomes Mai’s self-appointed bodyguard because he seemingly has nowhere else to be. And he’s skilled enough that he *should* have somewhere else to be, which means he might be on the run for entirely separate reasons.

You can take a look at [*Dynasty's Ghost*](https://www.royalroadl.com/fiction/19159/dynastys-ghost) by clicking on the title, or the following URL. New chapters every Tuesday and Thursday, queued far in advance. Thanks for checking it out!

  I'll take a look! Can you give me a rundown on Instruments of Destruction?

    To add to the other comment: it's basically a parody, lamenting the project management failings of the second Death Star, with particular focus on the unrealistic expectations coming from above.

    "Instruments of Destruction" is *Return of the Jedi* as reimagined from the perspective of the project manager on Death Star II. It's a relatively short piece from r/rational's Alexander Wales.

    Thanks for taking a look at *Dynasty's Ghost*!

  Looks interesting so far. There isn’t enough written yet for me to really make a judgment wrt its quality, but I am interested in reading more.

  \*climactic

  climatic : climate :: climactic : climax
  ```

    ```
    I wish you weren't right about that... Climactic is such an ugly word.
    ```

  - u/ThisStoryNow:
    ```
    Typo is changed.

    Alternatively, 'climatic' has a secondary definition that is similar to 'pervasive,' so I suppose I could have meant what I wrote.
