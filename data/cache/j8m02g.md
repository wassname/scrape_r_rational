## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  Say you have manton-limited (other than the user) telekinesis able to lift a few hundred lbs and let you fly around. The crucial mechanic to exploit however is that you have [speed superintelligence](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/semvkn56ZFcXBNc2d/superintelligence-5-forms-of-superintelligence) and are thus able take subjective months carefully applying an application of telekinesis within a fraction of a second. One can also generate complex algorithms for controlling ones actions including telekinesis automatically, and while you don't have the know-how to improve your qualitative intelligence you can still reprogram your mind quite a lot.

  * The telekinesis grants you a precise tactile sense of the resistance exerted by matter when telekinetic force is applied to it up to a resolution a fraction the width of a human hair. This is also what limits your precision (without using microscopes) because without seeing what you're doing you can't say manipulate individual microscopic molecules. 
  * The range on the telekinesis is a few miles.
  * The telekinesis can lift say 400 lbs, but without limits on speed you could also in principle lift something [*by firing small supersonic objects at it*](https://what-if.xkcd.com/21/).

  **What are some unconventional ways to exploit telekinesis with that kind of precision?**

  I have a few physics based ideas, but I don't have the know-how to really explore them:

  * Compressing a microscopic bubble of telekinetic force could likely be used to to create tiny amounts of fusion, with many applications depending on the specifics of how the math works out. One could also shield oneself from radiation with telekinetic barrier (though not massless radiation).

  * Applying essentially a relativistic slap to a *minuscule* mass of air ought to allow the generation of considerable radiation.

  * Obviously against entities not resistant to absurdly fast projectile and radiation this power-set could be absurdly lethal.

  * This could be used to image ones surroundings by applying minuscule amounts of telekinetic force to a massive area.

    Assuming you could apply all of that force onto a square with sides the width of a hair, 400 lb/(100 um)^2 = 1.8 * 10^11 Pa, *barely* enough to rip graphene (UTS = 1.3 * 10^11 Pa with perfect construction), and *easily* enough to rip through structural steel (5 * 10^8 Pa).  

    That's if the force is applied proportional to area (or volume).  What if it's distributed based on mass?

    The obvious munchkinry is to divide by zero: apply some force to a location in near-perfect vacuum, and channel all 1818 N of force into a single 1.6 * 10^-27 kg hydrogen atom, for an acceleration of 1.1 * 10^30 m/s^2 (1.1 * 10^29 g).  I'm not quite sure what you could do with that, but it's *something*.

I'm not quite sure what you could do with that, but it's something.

      Physicists have detected cosmic rays with [the individual energy of baseballs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh-My-God_particle). Not sure what good that would do beyond creating a cone of radiation though (which would be highly penetrating and thus a very inefficient weapon). A near perfect vacuum is also probably unnecessary as you could create a microscopic tube of force that would accelerate individual gas molecules when they happened to fly into it. The real limit for most application like this is your telekinetic feedback precision. Since you can apply the force to a very specific point but would need expensive bulky equipment to ensure the microscopic thing you want to manipulate is in that exact spot.
      ```

      - u/CaramilkThief:

        From some rough calculations, you can also do some neat stuff with more macroscopic objects. You can throw baseballs at around mach 4.5 or example (with 400 lbs of force). 

        If you scale it down enough you can in theory make a rough rpg esque weapon. By crushing down on metals you can make a stream of hypersonic molten metal, which can go through pretty much anything. 

        Keep scaling it down and you can squeeze materials into plasma (and maybe shoot it out?). It'll be a working plasma weapon. 

        Keep scaling it down and it becomes hotter plasma. There's some neat physics stuff happening but not sure it's gonna make much of a difference in terms of destructive potential.

        I'm not sure you can scale it down much more from now, since even the best microscopes can't see inside atoms, so forming really small black holes probably isn't possible. If it were though, it'd be a nearly perfect way to convert a really tiny mass into pure energy, giving off a bunch of radiation.

        Some more thoughts:

        Since you have speed superintelligence you can probably manipulate air currents into tornadoes or hurricanes. It'll be a slow process with the amount of telekinesis potential but it'll definitely be possible.

        You can probably form massive air lenses, or at least large ones. Might be able to burn people and buildings like ants with a magnifying glass.

          Wouldn't a solid projectile have much more penetrating power? It seems like molten metal ought to tend to splatter on impact imparting only a fraction of its energy to the target, instead of penetrating much. Weaponized plasma seems like it would have this problem even worse because of how rapidly it would expand once you weren't crushing it with telekinetic force. 

          As for mini-black holes the idea is that you'd create a microscopic bubble of telekinetic force and then crush that down. The feedback from the power wouldn't give you precise feedback at that scale, but you don't need to trap a *specific* bunch of air molecules for shrinking the bubble until you can't anymore to work.

          I'm not sure how this would work; 400 lbs is obviously not in the right ballpark to compare to the direct power of any tornado. All this power is going to be able to do is provide a small "nudge", but given weather is the definition of a [chaotic system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp8wGQW-Y48) having lots of processing power doesn't *seem* like it would let you control the weather any more effectively than existing tech which is pretty lackluster.

    Carry a bunch of microscopes around.

    On a sunny day, your superspeed intelligence will let you calculate refraction angles such that you can telekinetically position your microscopes to focus the sunlight onto a single point, setting it on fire. With enough speed, you could rotate your microscopes quickly enough to keep that point on a moving/dodging enemy.

    Not as effective as a real laser weapon, but very cheap. Especially if you have the power to pull out glass windows and reshape the glass into a lens.

    Would it be enough to trick-create a tiny blackhole which would then expand on its own?

    This is a very dangerous power, such a blackhole could be only created by you once, because... you know, after that, you'd be dead.
    ```

    - u/Valeide:

      Is there any reliable way to engineer a black hole that won't instantly dissipate due to hawking radiation?
      ```

      - u/vakusdrake:
        ```
        The issue here is the mass of the black hole, you would need orders of magnitude more power than this telekinesis can provide to create a stable black hole.
        ```

    - u/vakusdrake:
      ```
      Microscopic black holes of the mass this power could create will dissipate due to Hawking radiation in a fraction of a second. That being said this is still really good thinking because it gives you a way of turning (microscopic) amounts of matter directly into energy. Essentially by creating microscopic black holes you could make explosions of energy similar to creating an equivalent microscopic mass of antimatter.     

      Notably because of the tremendous pressure required I don't know whether black holes would be able to output as much energy as compressing a much larger (microscopic) mass to induce nuclear fusion (because of the massive difference in how much mass you could compress this much). Fusion doesn't get you very much of the fuel's mass-energy, but it requires orders of magnitude less pressure than compressing that fuel into a black hole.
      ```

  - u/Valeide:

    This definitely falls outside the intended range for this power, but using your speed superintelligence you could e.g. manipulate particles of sand into the form of the code you'd need to run an aligned artificial general intelligence, no?

    And similar- you could use your speed superintelligence to develop the strategies necessary to do basically whatever you want.
    ```

    - u/vakusdrake:
      ```
      In principle you could create AGI much easier by just running algorithms inside your own mind, but the hard part is making the breakthroughs necessary for AGI (even if you have lots of subjective time and processing power). However there's a limit to how much subjective time somebody is going to want to spend in isolation doing AI research. Plus unless you were an AI researcher to begin with it would take absurd amounts of subjective time to make progress, if you could at all.

        But, once you develop the General Sand Intelligence that’s pretty much the pinnacle of your life’s work and you won’t have to think as hard again so with virtually limitless thinking time it’s probably worth it.
