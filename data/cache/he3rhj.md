#####New Directions for Operation Diegetic Nudibranch

As you are surely aware, Operation Diegetic Nudibranch has long been criticized for its underperformance and high costs. After the fiasco that was the skent investigation, these complaints have intensified to the point where I worry our department may be closed completely if we don't find a target species that promises high, certain returns on investment. I suggest that unicorns are one such candidate species.

Academics from the Athenaeum of Mathematics and Metaphysics have suggested that [the imperial economy could vastly improve its allocative efficiency if it was optimized through the use of linear programming techniques. Unfortunately, this is not computationally feasible.](https://crookedtimber.org/2012/05/30/in-soviet-union-optimization-problem-solves-you/) However, the unicorns' special powers can remove this obstacle. When threatened, a unicorn will start a "time loop" three seconds long. If the unicorn is killed or otherwise put in an unfortunate situation at any time during the loop, he will revert himself and his surroundings back to their states at the beginning of the loop. This can be repeated several times before the unicorn runs out of power. After the last iteration of a time loop is complete, the creatures caught up in it receive their memories of all previous loops in a near-instantaneous flood. Similar time loops can be generated by bone mages with access to unicorn bones.

Here's the general idea. Kill a unicorn, and give a bone each to a bunch of bone mages from a mortal species with quick reaction times. The mages should be telepathically linked via entad. When a bone mage begins a time loop, the next one immediately starts their time loop. The mages just keep making nested loops in this fashion until the last mage has started theirs. After that, the last mage is telepathically fed the calculation results from every other version of themselves, and they execute whichever step of the calculation being performed would be appropriate at the time. Finally, the time loops are ended in the reverse order of their construction. Nobody starts a nested loop during the last iteration of the first loop, preventing any bones beyond the first from being drained when the process is completed. 

This process can be used to solve mathematical problems at vastly increased rates. In fact, if the reaction times of the bone mages used is less than 150ms or so, then my calculations suggest that the mages could optimize the whole hexal economy in one shot, even ignoring the practice granted by the time loops! I hope that you consider this opportunity.

Throughout history, it was typical for the rulers of the Jesh delta to also control the rest of its continent. However, administration of this area was usually left to pre-existing local governments, due both to the region's economic backwardness and willingness to switch allegiance to foreign powers and to the difficulty of projecting power far into the highlands. But all of this changed in the second century FE, when the Lankwon government simultaneously developed a corps of soul mages, absorbed most of its regional rivals, and embraced supposedly Neo-Utherian ideas about cultural and economic integration. While most opposition to increased continental centralization was successfully suppressed, a few guerilla groups survived all the way to the collapse of the Second Empire.

A member of one such group was crouched amongst the bushes on a mountain ledge overlooking grain terraces, a small hamlet, and an unassuming beige building known to be a secret magical research facility. Though the majority of such facilities were located near the relevant athenaeum or Lankwon city, some research deemed likely to lead to exclusions was carried out in areas considered more expendable. Since such research often yielded potent new repression techniques, these remote laboratories were frequent targets of resistance intelligence operations. Even just knowing who and what came in and out of them was useful information, as it could be used to help identify powerful mages and on occasion topics of research.

Through his telescope, the rebel could see twenty-two springtail Animalia exiting a truck and entering the building. A nearby farmer saw them and gawked for a second⁠—the driver would probably get harangued or fired later for not dropping them off in the less-publicly-visible back of the lot—then resumed his labor. The rebel continued watching to see if any other people or goods would be delivered to the site. 

For a couple minutes, nothing happened. Then, the farmer near the facility was swept into a mad flurry of action. At a supernatural pace, he flew about the valley below, leveling buildings, channeling the river and streams, and leaving naught but flat fields of crops in his wake. Escaping just in time, the springtail Animalia burst out of the building and lept up to the ledge with enhanced [furculae](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furcula_(springtail)) strikes. A couple seconds later, the rebel received a flood of memories of alternate versions of these events. In most of those memories, nothing of note happened, and in the rest, some or all of the Animalia died. Even augmenting their jumps with bone magic and healing themselves in mid-air, they usually failed to avert their deaths, either landing short of the mountains and getting caught up in the farming frenzy, dying of hemolymph loss after their exoskeletons splintered under the tremendous forces and pressures of the jump, or aiming incorrectly and crashing into the cliff while still below the apex of their flight paths. After a brief moment spent dazed by the visions, the rebel realized the danger of his position and ran away from the ledge. As he looked over his shoulder to see if the mages were pursuing him, he saw the valley warp and ripple, balls of stone separating from the main body of Aerb and forming perfect plots of farmland at regular intervals in the air. Many questions swirled in his head, but one was paramount:

*"What the hell did they* do *to Pai Shep?"*

  One of my favourite parts about the Exclusionary Principle as a worldbuilding concept is that it provides a plausible explanation(both intra- and extra- diagetic) for why magical advances like in your story aren't commonly a thing in-universe. Even proposing such an experiment might be grounds for immediate execution.

  Imagine how intensely risk averse Harvard university would be as an institution if it had a monopoly on psychology, were 1000x more powerful politically and economically, and at any given moment pushing the cutting edge of psychology too far could not only inadvertently detonate a nuclear bomb, but also destroy psychology as a viable profession for the rest of history, as well as all their power and influence. 

  In my view that would breed a culture of extreme conservatism on magical usage and experimentation, which would bleed into every other aspect of athenium operations. They would select students based on that criteria, they would make instilling those values in students a bedrock of instruction, and they would dedicate a sizable portion of their energy on hunting down and exterminating any hint of ideological deviancy.

  Reading the first part: Hmm, I smell an exclusion coming.  
  Reading the second part: Yes, delicious.

  Can someone explain what happens at the end?

    The farmer guy near the facility got caught up in the time loops. He was training farming for, given reasonable assumptions about the number of cycles per loop and so on, around 5 million years of subjective time. That's a lot. >!The Pai Shep exclusion zone, as explained in the link, is from a farmer who got so good at farming that he... uh... made a perfect farm that was an exclusion zone. This is a Pai Shep origin story.!<

      Heh, I think when I first read that, I thought that >!a farming tech got excluded!< because >!the DM!< thought that >!having the green revolution!< would ruin the quasi-medieval setting
      ```

  Sounds like quantum computing with magic, interesting concept.
