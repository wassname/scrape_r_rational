## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  I'm working on a setting to rationalize some of the legends about elves.

  I like the idea of pocket-dimensions where time flows differently than the real world.  And I like the idea that elves or faeries have ancient, semi-immortal rulers.

  But "control over the flow of time," or even "centuries of compound interest" are world-breaking.  And the aesthetic (dark-age nobles who live in castles) doesn't fit with the idea that everyone important was born in or before the classical era.

  ---

  My plan is to say that elves live in a place that's like Sandman's Dreaming.  The realm's geography is naturally chaotic and shifts based on images passing through a collective unconscious.

  Entropy, inside the realm, tends to erode people's ability to store memory.  So, spend too much time unprotected and you lose your sense of self.  Then, you're drafted into whatever scene the realm happens to be creating.

  Powerful creatures are able to carve out pockets of relative stability.  These have a geography that's fixed by their rulers.

  These realms only grant so much "storage space" for new information.  An exceptionally big realm might gives its inhabitants the ability to hold a few years of episodic memories.  And strong episodic memories are required to perform strong magic.

  So, while time is accelerated, the inhabitant's gradual amnesia means that the Faerie realms fall into semi-stable loops instead of developing faster than the real world.

  These loops are why faeries are so concerned with concerned with equal exchanges.  Without a careful eye to equal trades, a Faerie could be generous in a way that gets repeated endlessly.  This could impoverish a generous gift-giver.  So the pro-social thing is to never accept a gift without giving an equal one in return.

  Faeries are interested in mortals because inhabitants of the real world are born with the ability to hold decades of episodic memory.  This is why Faerie nobles want to adopt mortal children.

  And, adults often have strong episodic memories that they can trade, or are just able to break up the stagnation that courts will naturally fall into.

  ---

  Does this seem like it fits with the key tropes around Faeries?  Are there any obvious ones that I'm missing?

  Also, how would people go about breaking a setting like this?  Would it matter if I said that written records tend to decay if people don't invest them with magic or memory?

    This seems more Faerie than Elvin as a concept. Elves are much more human, whereas Fae (in my mind) are more emotionally charged - almost like forces than highly rational minds. Think Kingkiller Chronicles or Jonathan Strange and Dr Norrell.

    In the interest of simplicity, I would say the geography *and time passage* should be creature dependant. Tie it into magic if you want - magical creatures impose their will on the world, so it's almost that your Fae realm has lots of "free magic" searching for any will to mirror and create a tangible reality from. Faster thinking creatures would generate faster time, etc. Particularly strong Fae could be at the centre of the realms of stability you mentioned - strong enough to impose upon kilometers, though a consequence of such stability might be that they think slowly, so time passes very slowly. Added with awareness of their own body could make these Fae "pseudo-immortal".

    Entropy - an interesting idea, but the mechanics of forgetting should be consistent. I would suggest it as an extension of the previous magic idea I mentioned - every time you misrecall a memory free magic rewrites your memory of it to what you just recalled. Similarly misreading texts or just glancing over them briefly could accidentally wipe them clean. Storage space is now directly linked to how much you can accurately remember. Fortunately sense of our own bodies is high, and Fae could have heightened senses, so their own bodies are consistent. There could even be some Fae who've offered their bodies to carve important information into their very flesh.

    A consequence: technology breaks down very quickly if it isn't rudimentary enough for you to know everything about it (e.g. a wheel would survive, a gate could be assigned a powerful Fae to maintain, but not everyone can have intricate items). I'm sure some ideas of Faeries involves technology not working when they are near.

    Now, amnesia becomes a very real issue, and the rule about equal exchanges is just general good sense. They never want to be cheated (especially repeatedly) and never want to give offense (or risk forgetting an enemy). Stories of trickster Faeries could originate from the poor who would tend to come into contact with stranger, more mad Faeries on the fringes of magical society, who've lost themselves from magic and somehow stumbled into mortal realms.

    As far as abducting humans goes - you'll have to be very careful with time manipulations to make sure their lifespans aren't too short, but equally you'll need sufficient reason for them not to be affected by memory loss. Having them simply being non-magical creatures would be sufficient - then the free magic has no way to recognise them. However, they are still subject to directed magic - whether by time or control or direct application by a Faerie. Their inability to resist such manipulation could stop them being too carried away with having decades more knowledge than most of the Fae, and certainly make them weak.

    As far as trading memories goes, particularly powerful Faeries should be able to impose a memory into another's mind, but the system I describe gives no way to *take* memories, though with sufficient control you could make a target very susceptible to answers.

     A few final notes - there could(?) be a source of this free magic. Perhaps it's singular, or there's many. Maybe they move around. Perhaps the absolute strongest Fae control a source with their will. The benefit of a source is that it can explain gradations in magical strength, and magical creatures have limited powers away from said source. Some whose bodies rely on magic to function may even die from lack of magic.

    You've made no indication of how the Fae realm borders with the human one - might be worth working that one out. There's so much potential in terms of history with borders creeping and occasionally engulfing a human village settled too close, etc.

    I would set a story in this world in a more technologically advanced era. One where there's been some decades of exploration into the Fae world and the honeymoon trade period is dying and tensions are beginning to rise. Deliciously complicated.

    Fae could be strangely attractive due to the influence of how they perceive themselves on their own bodies.

    And finally - the idea of "loops" seems bad, because that would flat out make it impossible for Faeries to progress or develop. But I've made this up on the spot but it seems to follow the general ideas of your (very creative) world. And it all stems from this notion of free magic following will, so it should be very consistent with a bit of care. And it relies on the fallibility and imperfection of living beings to become a sharp double-edged sword that effectively limits possibilities into the not too unreasonable or world-breaking.

    Rather than making written records decay, why not give fairies a form of extreme aphasia? You can pick and choose other symptoms as you please, but fundamentally they would just plain be unable to understand the written word.

      That makes sense and gives a pretty good reason why the fairies are spending a ton of time journaling.

  Given our current understanding of physics, what would an expanding singularity AI in the cosmos look like? Let's assume it 's very nearly as efficient as physically possible. Let's also assume it's unable to circumvent heat death; so it is trying maximize the processing it can do before then, thus it really wants to save what negentropy it can.            
  **Basically the question is given current physics limitations and no FTL or way of preventing the universes heat death; what is the best way to maximize the amount of processing you are able to do long term within one's future light cone?**

  I'm assuming it would likely expand at very close to the speed of light (i'm discounting the possibility of warp drives or other FTL exploits for this thought experiment) so you wouldn't have that much warning before it arrives (_unless_ you can you think of a way for it to somehow use lasers to remotely assemble nanomachines or something similar so that it can spread _at c_), however even if it's travelling at very close to c it is still travelling over such vast distances that on a human timescale you might see it coming quite while before it arrives. If you have any other ideas of what you might expect an expanding singularity to look like from outside I'm curious to know. 

  I'm guessing if you saw something like this coming it would likely look like an expanding void with some low energy emissions (I imagine things would be efficient enough they wouldn't give off any IR), however beyond that there's a lot of questions about what the most efficient way to assemble matter is if you're trying to maximize processing done before the universes heat death. One particularly interesting question is; **what is the most efficient way to do processing?** If it involves atoms it may be a better idea to use iron, just so that you can use the extra energy, though there's a question of what the conversion rate is between matter and energy when it comes to the ability to do processing. I have a strong suspicion that the most efficient processor would have to be a quantum computer, I also have a strong suspicion that it might involve subatomic components because of the sort of heuristic that faster computing always seems to use smaller components, but i'm still curious what we can think of now even if I doubt it will be what's ultimately used.  

  Initially upon thinking about this I figured it might turn all matter into iron since that has the highest nuclear binding energy; however I realized with small black holes harvesting Hawking radiation, you could get energy directly from matter so actually _that's_ probably the most efficient power source.      

  There's also the question, within one's future light cone how much can one delay heat death by stopping all the rampant wastes of negentropy? Of course you would be measuring in subjective time since you want to maximize the amount of processing you can do long term as mentioned above. I'm not sure how much more efficient the computing will be if you are trying to use say reversible computing to minimize entropy.

  _Another question that comes to mind is how much of your negentropy would you want to hoard for later?_ You might be able to perform processing more efficiently somehow once the universe was much colder, though i'm not sure of the specifics. There's also a obvious tradeoff with the fact you can't store energy negentropy perfectly efficiency, however you will likely have much more efficient means of using it in the future.          
  I'm not sure there's any way we could hope to give a perfect answer to this and for that exact reason I imagine it may serve to cripple some rather defective SAI. Though it would still be expanding through it's future light cone and be shoving everything into a massive black hole so it would be pretty dangerous nonetheless.

  I'm currently building a new species/world with literal plant/flower based intelligent characters. Anyone have thoughts or ideas of cultural/behavioral traits that would come up/make sense for such?

    Do they have roots?  Are they stuck planted in one place for their entire lives?  Or do they have the ability to uproot and move somewhere else, and if so, how much effort does this take?  Transplanted plants often don't do very well for some time after.  Does this apply?  Or do they just walk around on feet like animals do and drink water when they find it?  These sorts of things will impact their culture, since the less mobile they are the more likely they are to grow up near other family members and well-known acquaintances.  The more mobile they are the more similar to humans they'll be in this regard.

    Similarly, if they use photosynthesis then they'll have a stronger respect/dependency on the sun, since it directly provides food for them instead of indirectly like with farmers or hunters.  This could impact religion, culture, traditions, rituals.  Maybe they give thanks to the sun every morning at sunrise, or have some sort of festival every spring, or something.

    Also, I expect if they don't eat meat they might have a different view of animals.  But maybe they still know how to hunt for bones and skins and to protect themselves from herbivores.  (Would an herbivore attack plants that can move and fight back?  If there aren't any in real life you can always invent one if you want)  Maybe they raise some sort of carnivore like wolves to eat the herbivores.

    Also, how do they deal with seasons?  Do they hibernate in the winter?  Do they move all of their energy and their consciousness into their roots for the winter?  Or do they hide in caves or some sort of building and stay warm with fires?  Actually, do they build out of wood even though they're plants.  I imagine they would view nonsentient plants the same way we view animals and so be okay with it, but maybe there are ultra-vegans among them who think that's wrong too.

    There are probably other things you can think of, but I think all of them depend on the specific mechanics that you decide to make.  I think the best way to work through it is to pick each feature that makes them different from humans mechanically, see how that will change what they must do to survive, and then how that affects what items or actions or creatures they like or dislike or love or fear and how that might influence their culture over thousands or millions of years.

    And also keep in mind that there are many cultures different cultures even among the same species.  If you have two or more competing ideas, just have some cultures that adopt each of them.  Maybe they interact with each other, or maybe they're really far away and have never heard of each other, but the world is more complete if you know they exist and why.

      My current concept is they transition from a more or less none-sentient sessile and purely photosynthetic seedling form, to a motile, omnivorous, sentient form with minimal photosynthesis relative to total energy budget.

      Their ability to move is not as good as humans, lower efficiency in movement (something more like a lizard in locomotive efficiency/gait pattern). Also there are indeed herbivores, but also as they are not the only thing that is a 'plant that thinks' like in terms of species and ecosystem. I'm meandering and developing things as I go. Thanks for bringing up the way they might tame carnivores to protect from grazers. I'll mull on a lot of this.

        An interesting book to look into (albeit long) is Star Maker by Olaf. A tad dated (nuclear energy is considered the holy grail of energy production in the book) but does a fantastic job of describing different alien species and their cultures. 

        It has symbiotic species, hive-minds, species similar to humans but with emphasis on different senses, etc. Even some intelligent stars. For your question, it described "Plantmen", and their two differing states of sessile and motile. Sessile, when they would absorb energy, was almost a form of meditation/sleep for them (letting them get back to their roots, so to speak). Can't really recall all the details, but one thing that stuck out to me was that as the species industrialized, the importance of each form varied. Sometimes they would think that being motile all the time was most important and create technologies for that sake. Othertimes they would think being sessile was more important and set up automatic lamps to let them meditate through the night. 

        Can't really recall anything else from it, but I think the entire text is online, so you could find that and Ctrl-F "Plantmen".

  So, let's say that there's a superpower-based world where there's a few standard powers; when someone gets empowered, it's immediately recognizable which power they have, out of a discrete list of a few dozen distinct powers.  But each power has some measure of strength which varies from user to user.  Like, there may be a standard super-strength power, but for one person the upper limit is one ton and for another person the upper limit is one hundred tons and for most people it's somewhere in-between.  Presumably for each power there'd be some kind of probabilistic distribution curve of strength.

  There's one power where what "strength" means is purely "can you override other people with the same power".  Higher values override lower values, and the values are irrational numbers that are, for fairly obvious mathematical/probabilistic reasons, never in practice going to be duplicated between two data points/users.  Does this make mathematical sense?  A distribution curve where the values produced actually only represent greater and lesser values and not quantities/multiples of one?  It's, like, a topological distribution curve, where you can stretch the curve out horizontally and it doesn't effectively change anything because all the values are still lesser or greater than each other.  I hope this isn't a bunch of nonsense.

    [Yes, that works.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution#Cumulative_distribution_function) Though I'm confused why this would be in question. Obviously you can flip a coin onto a real number line and record where it lands.
    ```

    - u/LiteralHeadCannon:
      ```
      I guess the question is "what does a number *mean* if its only relation to other numbers is lesser/greater".  In this system, is there even any practical difference between a bell curve between the minimum and maximum where numbers are centered on a most common value and a flat distribution where numbers are given an unweighted random value between the minimum and maximum?
      ```

      - u/Gurkenglas:
        ```
        No, there's no difference. In-universe mathematicians could [without loss of generality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Without_loss_of_generality) choose any distribution based on what makes calculations easier, like we do for IQ.
        ```
