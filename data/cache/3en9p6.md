    I've basically given up on it updating again, at least in significant amounts.

      It may seem like the story is abandonded, but Thinker6 has a habit of updating every couple of months, while he's not writing another story( The Number Girl is really worth the recommendation here). I'd put the  probability of this fic updating this year at 80% at least.

  I wouldn't call them so much more rational than they are in canon, but born into places where their natural abilities, reactions, and habits serve them better.  In canon, Taylor was really good at winning over allies, but the approaching end of the world prevents her from making the most of this.  Likewise, Jack Slash is extremely persuasive, lucky, and determined, but wastes his talents on a managing a small band of murder hobos.

  I love this fic, espeically compared to other Worm Fanfics,  but I have issues with some stuff in this work. Mostly:

  1. The Leviathan fight's over-the-top Endbringer escalation, especially the bypassing of the Manton effect and the ridiculous ending of that fight. 

  2. Weaver is too successful in recruting parahumans for her organization. Parahumans are notoriously terrible at working in big groups-- unless she has enormous help from Cauldron or a couple of strong/subtle/wide Master powers helping to keep Parahuman neuroses at bay, she shouldn't be so successful in her society.
