## A rationalist in a rational wold [RT] [DC] [WIP] [FF]

### Post:

Yes! This was finally it! The day i have been preparing for my entire life without knowing out it. I was going to wake up in a different dimension and live there. That might sound super scary to most but from reading rational fiction, and through the principles of comparative advantage all i could think about was how everything was finally going to be great.

I had all my bases covered. Go back to medieval times? No problem, i'll just invent steel. I can’t actually make steel but i know that it was just about getting the carbon right, and i could do that with air flow and lime. I don’t actually know what lime is but other people do so it should be fine. 

Or gunpowder that's always a good one. Easy to make, it's just charcoal, sulfur and pee, and easy to use, just put it in a tube with a ball and set on fire. I had seen dozens youtube videos on it. Like seen them in my feed. I didn’t actually watch them all but the guy always gets it in the end so it can’t be that hard.

Going into the Harry Potter or Twilight world? No problem everyone is so dumb there that i'll rule it in a week. Although that's already been done so it will probably be a newer series that i haven't read, so no advanced knowledge, but still should be fine.

Animorphs? i'll be a Doctor Doolittle. StarGate? Cushy government job. A.I. oriented world? Well that one i might have a bit of trouble with but nobody ever gets taken there, they alway just start out there.

The magic sparkles were so bright that they blinded me. A voice spoke in my head. “You have switched with another whom has switched with you, you are they and they are you”

Looking around excitingly i tried to get a glimpse of my new world. My eyes hadn’t adjusted yet but i could start to make out fluorescent lights. Slightly disappointed that it won’t be a medieval scene, i thought to myself,at least i have indoor plumbing. 

After rubbing my eyes nearly off i could finally see again, taking the whole scene in i thought to myself Shit. This is the worst possible outcome.

Standing there in front of me was the last thing in the world i had wanted to see, and the last thing i had expected to see, a thing whose context made it the stuff of nightmares, my bedroom.

*If there is positive response i will continue it*

  I was expecting him to end up in a futuristic rational world, suddenly realizing that actually the protagonist here was the person he swapped with, who will use his hyper rationality to change the world.                            
  Whereas on the other hand he will probably end up living off basic income as a social outcast because everyone else in this world is so much more clever and sophisticated that they would never want anything to do with him.

  It would be kind of a funny genre inversion, though making a story about someone who ends up in a world where they're comparatively stupid and have no special powers would be hard to stretch into a story.

    Would rationalist humans condemn someone to social outcast status? Surely there would be room for the mentally handicapped, like volunteering or communal living.

    And sure it would be a story. Coming to terms with oneself is decidedly nontrivial for many people.

      I don't necessarily mean that people would explicitly shin them. Instead they would be social outcasts simply because nobody could tolerate their presence.                                               
      Though I suppose you have a point that they might fit in among those will actual mental handicaps (provided medicine hasn't advanced enough that they don't exist).

    Futurama did this exact thigg with the da vinci episode

      Or actually the whole series.

  And that was the worst day of Eliezer Yudkowsky's life. The story, you see, was nothing like the stories. And being the hero of his own was absolutely terrifying.

  (please do. This is a fantastic idea.)

  Quite nice. Though it's probably better to not continue this: it's very good as a short story, but might be easily ruined if you try expanding it.

  ... I think you missed a perfect opportunity for a dramatic pause in the last sentence XD
