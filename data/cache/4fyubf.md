## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  What are some ways to gamify writing?

  I'm practicing writing fiction, and it's gradually coming along, but it's pretty hard for me. I really want to get good at it, but my reddit-addicted brain just seems to refuse to engage in this activity, doesn't enter the flow. Programming, on the other hand, works very well(it has an immediate feedback/gratification loop and clear goals). So I'm trying to figure out what kind of system would help me to experience the same thing in writing.

  /r/WritingPrompts is pretty helpful, and blogging has sort of natural gamification(traffic/upvotes/comments) embedded in it, but these are misleading, my brain is getting dopamine spikes out of seing upvotes or refreshing the stats, not out of the writing process itself.

  There's gotta be a way to design a feedback loop that would make writing fiction addictive.

  I've been thinking about a website with  daily flashfiction challenges(100-1000 words, winners determined by voting, leaderboard of the best writers), but it's not that different from writingprompts. Github-like streaks could help perhaps(a visual representation of how many words you have written every day, and how many days in a row you write). Or maybe a text editor with a progress bar that would show how much words you have written until reaching a daily goal....

  Can writing be made interactive, like in a chat? Or more real-time, like improv? Or collaborative?

  ----

  Or, perhaps, I'm just doing it wrong. Writing HN/reddit comments works, writing personal diary works. Writing non-fiction articles about rationality works(because there's clear goals, and a clear path towards putting together an article), but writing fiction/comedy doesnt, my brain just goes blank and immediately gets bored. I've been trying to solve it for a long time, still can't seem to figure out why I can't.

    Have you tried [Writer Kata](http://writerkata.com/)? It's not everything you're looking for, but it's pretty great.  Having the challenges split up by size makes it easy to start for the day, since you only have to start with writing  individual sentences.  As you move forward, you get bigger and bigger challenges, but since you're already warmed up, it's a lot easier than just starting from blank.

    I have similar motivation problems when writing fanfiction. My solution is usually to get as much out the door as I can on initial enthusiasm. Then, any time I want to write a new chapter, I binge-read comments in order to build more enthusiasm. It works well as a positive feedback loop, but it can be broken easily by an underwhelming chapter or a busy week.
    ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Set daily goals for yourself, and if possible, keep a word count visible at all times. I use Scrivener, which has session and project goals you can keep on screen and a little bar that changes from red to green as you fill it. That helps for me, in those moments when I'm feeling like screwing off and doing something else, or when I feel the urge to dive back into some story that I stepped away from months ago (an urge that, if followed, would probably lead to me making lots of incremental progress but never finishing anything).

    Writing serials also helps, because then you have a basic unit (the chapter), social pressure (from even a small audience), and clear deadlines (in the form of a weekly schedule). But if you like short stories, maybe that doesn't help as much, and serials come with some serious drawbacks.

    Make a [quest](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/intro-to-questing.12494/)! Get other people involved, get excited, make other people do (some of) the work for you. It'll get you better at writing and, in my experience, it's quite engaging, at least from the reader's side, and from the authors of them I've spoken with it's the same on their end.

  Let's say that you had carte blanche to design a fantasy virtual reality MMO using technology that's twenty years down the road. What features would you include or specifically not include?

  ----

  I've been watching Log Horizon (which I'm not done with - no spoilers, please) and marveling at how similar to modern-day MMOs their game world is. In part this must have been done in order to reduce the workload, since they can just borrow the grammar and concepts, but at the same time it seems somewhat stale to me. If I were writing my own "trapped in an MMO" story the first thing I would do is create my own MMO rather than borrowing heavily from existing games. There are some definite cons to that, but I really like worldbuilding.
  ```

  - u/traverseda:
    ```
    I'm working on [an engine](http://github.com/traverseda/pycraft) that I hope will someday include MMO features.

    On an unrelated note, here's some of the stuff I'd like to see in an MMO

    Actual construction of things like cities and fortresses. Structures should be mostly player owned and player created.

    One of the things I like is an intermeshed player economy. Make it so that trading and trade caravans are an actual worthwhile thing.

    Along with that, make travel difficult. I've got ideas for a vaguely steven-universe crystal-gem system, where you can "project" your friends into your local territory, but they can't share loot or equipment. Physically moving from a server in london to one in japan would take weeks of travel time, it's also dangerous.

    There's a huge opportunity for whichever guild sets up reliable shipping.

    I'd also like there to be different levels of death. You die in combat, you poof. You turn into an object, and someone has to carry you back. Or maybe they just leave you, and you need to run the hell out. Or maybe you hire a guild to come retrieve you.

    But once someone is poofed, you can invest resources to permanently destroy that character. Destroy all their levels, maybe steel some of their equipment. The process takes a while, so there would be plenty of time for a rescue attempt.

    It's not the kind of equipment I'd expect an individual to have, but a large guild might be able to do it. During war, a large guild might invest the money to do it on an industrial scale.

    Eve-online style training sounds reasonable as well. As long as you log in once per day, you get a skill point to put into whatever skill you want.

      Have you seen the server transfer system in [Wurm Online](http://www.wurmonline.com/)? It's not weeks long, but it does require hours of doing nothing but sailing a boat in one direction. Without logging off.

    - u/Cariyaga:
      ```
      [Crowfall](https://www.crowfall.com) would seem to be exactly what you're looking for. And yes, I am of the same mind when it comes to MMOs.
      ```

  - u/artifex0:
    ```
    My main problem with MMOs as they exist today is that they always seem to be so focused on keeping people playing with Skinner box mechanics that they sacrifice everything else.  Gameplay tends to be trivial and repetitive, with the leveling process usually requiring no skill whatsoever, immersion is constantly shattered, emotional investment in the narratives tends to be nil...  It's not that developers don't try to include those elements, it's just that never seem to be willing to make any design decisions that might distract from the slot-machine-like reward loop, which leads to players feeling a compulsion to play the game that's not always proportional to their real enjoyment of the game.

    So, if I could design my dream MMO, I think I'd actually get rid of most forms of non-narrative and non-skill-based progress.  There would be no levels, you'd unlock most of your skills in an extended tutorial, loot would tend to be related to the narrative and designed to add to immersion- you might find rare, differently styled cosmetics by exploring a distant nation, but never by grinding mobs.  When not cosmetic, loot would tend to be sidegrades that would open up different playstyles, and almost never work as direct upgrades.

    The combat would be a real challenge- maybe resembling a more forgiving Dark Souls- but just as important to the gameplay would be creative problem solving- like how in Deus Ex, game systems allow for different, sometimes emergent ways of approaching situations.  Also, narrative heavy character interactions, both with NPCs and with other players, would be central to the gameplay.  You'd never see huge swarms of anonymous adventurers completing the same quests as you- instead, all player-to-player interactions would start off with scripted sequences, and then be procedurally woven into the narrative.

    For example, lets say that you and another player were fighting in the same dungeon.  You wouldn't see each other initially, but at some point, you might be interrupted by a sequence where a villain would capture your character.  While you were playing through that scripted sequence, the other player might be shown a room with your character trapped in a cage.  You'd see a screen saying something like "Three Days Later...", and then you'd both be in the same instance, playing through a sequence where you could each choose dialog options to express your characters' personalities, and then the other player could choose to rescue you.  If they did, you'd be playing a co-op rpg, which might work like Divinity: Original Sin in some ways.

    So, the game would procedurally create adventuring parties where everyone had real emotional connections to all of the characters.  When a party member quit the game, you might see a brief cinematic of their character saying farewell and riding off into the sunset- the idea would be to make player interaction as immersive as possible.

    There would also be an extensive matchmaking system- you'd be matched with people from your guild, people you'd individually select, or people who tended to play the game similarly to yourself, depending on your settings.  You'd usually be playing with 3-6 other people, though you might see much larger groups of players in specific sequences, like huge battles.

    Finally, there would be no end-game content.  Instead, there would be a pvp game mode that would be completely separate from the story, and that you could start playing as soon as you installed the game, as well as a new game plus mode once you'd completed the story, that would let you carry over rare cosmetics.  The game would also be designed from the ground up for replayability, with lots of different possible play-styles and content that you'd miss on your first few playthroughs.
    ```

      Procedurally generated quests is also an option for longevity. They might not be quite as good as human-made content (or else you have AGI and the setting stops making sense, as in *[Her](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2014/01/her-isnt-realistic.html)*) but there's a lot of room above "kill ten dire wolves" if good designers took a serious crack at it.

    Log Horizon depict modern MMO because author was avid Everquest player. 

    Some thing that I want to see in perfect MMO.

    Big mysteries and myths. Quests that don't have obvious solutions and whole community tries to figure them out. Obvious problem is that sort of things have expiration date. Secret World had quest that relied on players looking for real world informations. It's too bad that now most google searches lead to direct answer.

    Not focusing exclusively on combat. Common failing of MMOs is that you can be anyone you want as long as you want to be profesional killer. Fallen London is step in right direction. It uses the same set of mechanics for everything: combat, seduction, investigation, stealing, dreaming, book wring and countless other thing.

    Probably with rise of VR, games that focus solely on exploration and virtual sightseeing would gain popularity.
    ```

  - u/gabbalis:
    ```
    If you trap people you can do all sorts of things people wouldn't care as much for in a typical MMO. Like, I don't know... sealing players into sentient sword-form for a thousand game years? Make all legendary loot truly singular? When a player can't quit, you can make them put up with all sorts of unfair game mechanics as a fact of life.

    That said, you still can't put that stuff into a real life MMO, even one 20 years down the road.

    Unless someone wants to play as a sapient sword...
    ```

    - u/Roxolan:
      ```
      Unique legendary loot is an option though. Loot is very easy to randomly generate, so it's just a matter of adding lots and lots of interesting options and delightful synergies.
      ```

      - u/ulyssessword:
        ```
        That depends on how unique you want to make the items.  [Tales of Maj'Eyal](http://te4.org/) (It's not quite a diablo-like game, but close enough for this discussion) has a good spread of items including unique ones, but I don't think that you could procedurally generate interesting unique items.

        The item tiers are:

        1. Basic items (white): No magic powers.  These only show up rarely, and are mostly complete junk.
        2. Ego items (green, blue, or purple): These have one or two sets of powers.  An example of a lesser power would be a sword that deals +5 fire damage.  An example of a greater power would be a sword that deals 10 fire damage in a radius-1 explosion, increases your speed by 5%, and gives you 12% fire resistance.  Green items have one or two lesser egos, blue ones have one greater ego (and maybe a lesser one) and purple ones have two greater egos.  Good purple items are useful through the end of the game.
        3. Rare items (salmon): These have one ego effect (as above), as well as additional procedurally generated powers that follow a theme (like "fire" or "toughness").  These are mostly useful for getting specific effects on equipment slots that don't usually have them, such as your boots giving you +5 poison damage for your attacks.  They only drop from rare enemies, who are generated with character classes.
        4. Randarts (orange): These have three ego effects, as well as approximately double the procedurally generated powers that rare items have.  They are very good, but (mostly) only drop from bosses.
        5. True Artifacts (yellow): individually coded legendary items.  These can have effects seen nowhere else in the game, including activated powers (eg. your archer now has access to the *Sleep* spell), damage conversion (Any damage that you would deal is converted to a different type instead: your sword would cause Acid damage, your Fireball would cause Acid damage, and poisoning someone would cause Acid damage), getting healed from certain damage types (in addition to being damaged), swords that get bonus damage from your magic power instead of your strength, semi-sentient weapons that can act independently of you, improvements to your skills/spells, and more.

        Allowing careless generation of Artifacts would necessitate extreme caution with every other aspect of the game, or else relatively bland effects on everything.  The alternative is allowing positive feedback loops, effects greater than 100% or less than 0%, or other game-breaking abilities.
        ```

        - u/alexanderwales:
          ```
          Procedural generation is easy, but getting it to create interesting and balanced results is not.

          One of the ways that I've seen games balance things is to just not worry about balance at all, which is possible if there's continual leveling. In Borderlands, it doesn't really matter if the RNG gods give you a great gun, because in another few levels you're going to naturally outgrow it and the OPness is only temporary. But I'm not sure that I've ever seen an MMO where there's no level cap, since the level cap is where the endgame lies. And if there are truly *unique* items that are overpowered, that's a different matter entirely, because the playing field can't just be naturally leveled by everyone getting their own copy.

          I'm curious how difficult it would be to implement auto-balancing of items. The game devs for most games obviously do a bunch of balance changes manually, but with access to loads and loads of data it might be possible to automatically identify which items are overpowered, or overpowered in combination with each other or certain builds.

  I started a new job on Monday. I sort through tax returns and make sure documents are whole/in the right order/exactly A4 sized, etc. It is tremendously boring.

  *However*. Because it is *easy* boring, very monotonous work, we are allowed to listen to podcasts/audiobooks/youtube/whatever.

  This first week I've mostly listened to Let's Plays, Stephen King's It and HPMOR. I was hoping /r/rational might have some recommendations - I have maybe 35 hours a week where I can listen to anything I want but can't really look at a screen much. I've thought about maybe picking up an audio language course, and TTC/the Great Courses are nearly the best thing ever, but I would like some variety. Because I'll probably stay at this job for a while I'll have lots of time to check out recommendations, so even if it's not something that belongs in /r/rational, the more suggestions the better! My general interests are sciencey stuff, politics, history, philosophy, Fantasy, writing, general entertainment... But feel free to mention stuff outside these areas. Learning programming would have been great, but I don't think that would work, since I can't spare a hand to type or look at the screen much.

    If you haven't listened to the original Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy radio dramas, they are quite good.

  The way I understand it it's usually played via forum or something like [anonkun](https://anonkun.com/), an author is telling a story, and many people voting on character's actions.

  What's your experience with that kind of system? How do you think it can be improved?

  I have been thinking about making a website where people could play DnD via chat. Maybe people could gather in a chat room, one GM, and 3-5 players, and have short campaigns.

    Playing RPGs in real time is a well-established practice too, with a large number of tools you'd compete with, from IRC dice bots to the [roll20](https://roll20.net/) behemoth.

    Combat is the part where tools are most helpful, because the big-name RPGs like D&D *really weren't* designed for online play. Anything turn-based slows things down considerably. Anything that has players *interrupting other players*, even just to say "actually I take 1 less damage because I have a Divine Shield power", is even worse. And number-tracking is a pain in the ass.

    There is really two directions to go to solve this: RPG-like video games with automatic rules enforcement (Conclave is the most D&D-like, but *all* multiplayer video games satisfy the D&D need to some extent), and very rules-light RPGs like Dungeon World (but then you have to convince the player base to learn a non-D&D game, which is frustratingly hard even when the game is dead simple).

    I play via roll20, or at least did until our group sort of fell apart over scheduling issues (the bane of most D&D groups). It works *okay*, though I tend to like a little more freeform playing than roll20 is really built for.

    You should tell us.

    > Has anyone here ever have to present a research paper at a conference? What was it like?

    I mostly re-used the slides from when I presented the same material as part of my MSc thesis defense, but changed over to less casual language.  It also turned out that the accepted way of avoiding double-negatives (like, "falsified the null hypothesis of no relationship") for statistical results is to say the statistically significant result *suggests* something ("significantly suggests a relationship").

    I rehearsed my presentation two or three times before actually giving it, once in front of my girlfriend (more of an empirical science type than me), and whenever and wherever it was awkward, I edited it.  By the last time I rehearsed it, I didn't feel like it was perfect (it's never *perfect*), but I did feel like I wasn't sure what I could or should change without making it worse or completely violating an important constraint about length or formality.

    The day of, I wore a button-down shirt and a corduroy suit-jacket (trying for the [smart academic](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php?n=1446) look) over my neatest jeans.  And I was nervous as hell *all day* until my presentation, my heart racing and my hands even clamming up slightly.  I've talked to a few other people who're just *always* like that about public speaking, even when everyone tells us we're perfectly good at it, so don't be too disheartened if you're nervous too.

    And then it went *just fine*, and nobody even asked asshole questions during Q&A.  Somehow, my advisor even ended up liking the slides I sent him and the text of the paper we'd sent in.

    Talking about math mainly, and a little about CS.

    Academic conference? Personally, I hate it, and think it is an unfortunately unavoidable ritual and a waste of time (exception: anything organized by the mfo).

    Typically, people only get funding for travel if they give a talk. This means that there are a lot of short talks scheduled, possibly in multiple tracks, with very short breaks in between. Hence, nobody has time to really explain something, and nobody has time to really listen (imho talks shorter than 50 minutes are worthless, and more than 5 talks a day are impossible to digest).

    Industry conferences are different in my experience: People get funding for travel just to listen to talks, and hence the speakers get sufficiently long time-slots to actually do something interesting.

    Academic colloquia also are awesome, but nobody except for the 3-5 invited speakers gets travel funding.

    So, I'd advise you to think about how much time you have, how much sleep your audience got, and what you want to accomplish. Assuming typical academic standards, this probably means that you want to (a) make a good impression and want (b) people to read your paper, and can give up trying to (c) teach people about your cool ideas.

    This may sound too cynical, but making people feel that they understand something is very different from making them actually understand; choose wisely what you aim for.

An evolution of the similarly-styled mobile armor [Elmeth](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/MAN-08_Elmeth) and mobile suits [Qubeley](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/AMX-004_Qubeley) and [Queen Mansa](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/NZ-000_Queen_Mansa), this massive mobile suit stores a total of twenty-four funnels (for those unacquainted with *Gundam,* self-propelled plasma guns that are controlled telepathically by psychic "Newtype" pilots) in its four binders (wing-like extra appendages, also used to mount thrusters for improved maneuverability and hidden beam-saber-equipped arms for surprise attacks). It has other weapons, but the two attributes of the Kshatriya that make the strongest impression on me are the funnels and the binders.

  Whenever I see funnels' ability of "all-range attack" used--by [Rau Le Creuset's Providence Gundam](https://youtu.be/nN9O3hwTd4k), or [Elpeo Puru's Qubeley Mk. II](https://youtu.be/A44ECDWJjD0), or [George de Sand's Gundam Rose](https://youtu.be/uLYntQiC16Q)--I am absolutely *flabbergasted.* It really impresses upon the viewer how superhuman a Newtype must be, in order to control all these three-dimensional weapons *and* the main body of the mobile suit simultaneously--it reminds me of the Tines in *[A Fire Upon the Deep](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77711)*, or [the Six Paths of Pain](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Six_Paths_of_Pain) in *Naruto*. Also, the Kshatriya's design is absolutely *breathtaking.* The symmetrically-arranged binders can [fold into a closed position](http://i.imgur.com/ehi8HeK.png) in order to protect the body of the mobile suit (and give the visual impression of an imposing cloaked figure--see also [Master Gundam](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/e/e4/Gf13-001nh2-normal.jpg) and [Gundam Deathscythe Hell](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/0/0f/Xxxg-01d2.gif)), or they can be flared outward ([front](http://i.imgur.com/SV5msTb.png), [rear](http://i.imgur.com/jmgchCw.png)) to give their maneuvering thrusters room to work.

  How can an utterly run-of-the-mill Gundam possibly compete with this *undiluted awesomeness??*

  I don't bother to subscribe to the RSS feed of [The Onion](http://www.theonion.com) because I prefer to receive updates from that site [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheOnion). Why? The comments are *hilarious!* In addition to people who *intentionally* make funny comments, it's very entertaining to see people who complain about offensive stories being chewed out by people who actually have senses of humor. [This story](https://www.facebook.com/TheOnion/posts/10154219474489497) was the most recent one to get a lot of complaints ([top comments](https://i.imgur.com/DEm2jjy.png), [reaction distribution](https://i.imgur.com/RJL2h2a.png), [article](http://www.theonion.com/article/kidnapped-boy-found-safe-imagines-kidnapped-boy-2597)).

  It's interesting, though, to note the articles that *I myself* don't find funny. Most often, I get annoyed whenever the site repeatedly [goes ludicrously overboard](http://www.theonion.com/video/brutal-anti-cruz-attack-ad-just-30-seconds-candida-52562) in attacking *some* presidential candidates (even though I dislike them more) while only [poking gentle fun](http://www.theonion.com/article/bernie-sanders-asks-anyone-whos-serious-about-brea-52746) at the *other* presidential candidates (even though I dislike them less). It really feels to me as if [they're trying WAY harder than necessary](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup)--but maybe my sense of humor is just calcifying as I grow older... :-(

  An easy way to seem cooler than you actually are is the production of [modular origami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_origami). It's typically quite simple, requiring a minimum of skill to manufacture each module--but the *assembled* models can be *extremely* impressive.  
  \- [Cuboctahedron](http://i.imgur.com/xEsO1h2.jpg) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboctahedron)): 24 Post-It Notes = 12 square vertex modules = 1 hour of work  
  \- - This is a small example, about as big as my hand. The module is ludicrously simple--it consists of a waterbomb base on top of which a preliminary base has been slotted on and had its tips folded inside.  
  \- [Truncated icosahedron](http://i.imgur.com/XS143DU.jpg) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_icosahedron)): 120 Post-It Notes = 60 triangular vertex modules = 5 hours of work  
  \- - This is a large example, about as big as my head. Again, the simplicity of the module is ridiculous--it's exactly analogous to the square-vertex module, but folded from squares torn into equilateral triangles (wasting more than half of the material...) rather than from the full squares. This model is actually *easier* to assemble than a smaller one (such as the cuboctahedron) would be, since the curves are much more gentle--but this also means that there's less friction holding the modules in place, so the model is more fragile as well more constructable.

  Special "origami paper" is totally unnecessary, since each individual module typically is too simple for the paper's quality to matter and any small errors in folding a module probably will be unnoticeable after the model has been assembled. Post-It Notes ([available in more colors than the standard "Canary Yellow"!](http://www.staples.com/Post-it-Super-Sticky-Notes-3-x-3-Assorted-Marrakesh-and-Rio-de-Janeiro-Collections-15-Pads-Pack-654-15SSMULTI-/product_168224)) are extremely convenient for modular works of moderate size (though the adhesive can be annoying), but printer paper and binder paper [also are serviceable](http://i.imgur.com/7pgIFxw.jpg) if you want your models to be outrageously humongous (and easier to assemble). Alternatively, you can tear each piece of printer/binder paper into four Post-It-Note-sized squares rather than into a single giant square.

    My favorite mecha anime will always be Broken Blade or Break Blade. Although it falls into some [anime trope traps](http://i.imgur.com/Ircnc0Kl.png) (though that one is actually subverted later), it has a cool magic system and is one of the few mecha anime with a reasonable explanation for why there are mecha. 

    I might even say Broken Blade is the only mecha anime where I feel like the mecha are adequately justified. In most mecha anime the mecha are like tanks (they have guns and are powered by some kind of power source and contain a pilot). There's no real explanation for why they're better than tanks though-- generally you'd expect treads to outperform legs and for a single axial gun to be easier to aim and use than having unnecessary arms and legs that manipulate external tools. 

    This gets even more ridiculous with space-based mecha, where it's like, ok, maybe you can think of some contrived reason to have arms, sure. but legs? In space? ._.

    In Break Blade, it's 100% reasonable for the mecha to exist. Since mecha are basically just armor worn by Sorcerers, with motion powered by their magic, it makes sense they'd have arms and legs. The Sorcerers can probably more intuitively control their motion and weaponry with their intuitive magic when it's analogous to their biological limbs. Break Blade's Golem Armor probably was developed over time as an extension of physically worn armor, where eventually weapons, them arms and legs, became supplemented with magical strength, until they extended beyond the body of the wearer and were controlled entirely by magic and the wearer was fully enclosed (once quartz displays were developed). Break Blade's mecha actually make sense and you can see how originally they were just suits of armor.

    I like the magic system, too. In the Broken Blade world, everyone has magic, which is the ability to, at short distances move certain kinds of quartz crystals using your mind. The amount you can move, how good you are at doing it, and your ability to exert pressure etc all vary from person to person. Their industry is based off of this. Farm tools and vehicles are powered by it. For example, you see a motorcycle where the driver spins a quartz in a disc to power the bike, and machine tools that are controlled by the workers since they have quartz crystals embedded in the joints. 

    The mechs themselves are well-designed. Krisna's Fafnir-class golems [(link)](http://i.imgur.com/QCFzku4.jpg) are about 40 feet tall. The torso is basically an armored shell with magic displays in it, with enough room for the pilot and the controls and that's it. The legs and arms extend out from the torso and are controlled via quarts crystals embedded in flexible ropes-- the mech will only be as fast and strong as the pilot's ability to use magic. 

    Basically, this represents pretty much what you'd expect for a society with this kind of magic to develop as a powerful weapon. It's a large magic-powered tank, and since it relies on people's intuitive ability to use magic, it uses hands and legs instead of treads. The development from "guy wearing armor" to "powered armor with magic" to this, which is basically a step up from that (no human limbs in the armor limbs, entire pilot is in the torso) seems clear.

    The weapons they have are cool, too. They mostly use [(link)](http://i.imgur.com/DO0lLQk.jpg) swords, but they have also developed a device called a "pressgun". Basically, it's a gun that operates in a manner similar to an airsoft gun. Using magic to operate a mechanism, a spring is compressed, or an air tank is compressed. This potential energy is then used to push forward a plate or force air into the chamber behind the projectile, which is then launched out of the weapon. A powerful sorcerer can get more range and use more powerful pressguns. Your typical civilian is capable of using a small, hand-held pressgun that can kill someone at close range. The very best sorcerers with the most talent and training, the ones strong enough to pilot golems, can use pressguns that are basically the size of cannons-- and indeed, most golems carry such a pressgun.
