  Oh man oh man, there's a lot to be excited about here. The monster science is in full force, Lilian has a power suit, Ashton is nearing full strength, Mary can *throw knives around corners* and Sylvester has finally had the time and money to put together a really large plan. 

  I'm hyped. Are you?

  Does anyone feel a satisfactory reason has been given for Lillian to help bring Sy in, given the likely outcomes for Sy? Mary I understand given the way her psychology has been portrayed but not Lillian.

    Hayle laid out the motivations pretty well in 10.x, I think.

    If they catch Sy and Jamie, then:

    - Sy and Jamie are guaranteed to be safe
    - All the Lambs are guaranteed to remain together
    - Sy and Jamie get to continue to be a part of the Lambs, helping them do what they do
    - The Lambs get to have their friends back in their lives
    - Lil is guaranteed her path to a black coat


    If they can't find them, then:

    - The Lambs project might lose all funding - very much a Bad Thing for them
    - Someone else, who doesn't have a personal stake in Sy's well being, might kill him - he's wanted alive or dead, after all


    Keep in mind that the Lambs don't necessarily know that Sy views heading back to the Academy as worse than dying, meaning that they can't weigh that against what they want for themselves and what they want for him. And that Sy has previously run away and been recaptured, which ended happily for all.

      Wait, what?

        It happened before the start of the story. It's been referenced a fair few times (first mention was in the Fray Arc, IIRC).
