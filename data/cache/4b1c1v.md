  The chapter is a week old but non one posted it here.

  Are there any fanfictions similar to this one?

    It depends on what you mean by similar. 

    Off the top of my head with my best guess at which parts of this you find interesting, I would rec [A World Full of Monsters](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11122077/1/A-World-Full-of-Monsters), [Effloresco Secundus](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8525251/1/Effloresco-Secundus) and maaaybe [The Empty Cage](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7305950/1/The-Empty-Cage)
    ```

    The only thing that came to mind was "Lighting Up the Dark" by	Velorien. There are probably more, but a lot of "realistic" fics tend to get too dark for my tastes.

  Clever title. Interesting fanfic that's new to me. I'm liking it. Thanks for sharing.

  Chiaroscuro. I like Chiaroscuro. It's clever, the writing is proficient, the characters make good decisions, the fights are solid.

  It's definitely not a bad story, its just sometimes it seems to lack that spark of greatness that would push it over the edge to being something really special.
