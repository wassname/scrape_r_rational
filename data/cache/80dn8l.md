## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  Do humans have any axiomatic beliefs? An axiomatic belief it one that is inherently true; you can never argue yourself out of that belief, nor be argued from it. Some things seem extremely difficult to be convinced otherwise of, like the fact I am alive (conditional on me being able to think it), but... not impossible.

  If there are no axiomatic beliefs, how far could you take this? Could you change their mind on every belief simultaneously? Could you turn a person into another preexisting model, solely through sensory hacks? I'm tempted to say no, not least for physical structure-of-the-brain reasons.

  This is a silly question, but it's one of those silly questions that's endured casual prodding pretty well.

    Yeah, I think when you allow for anomalous psychology, you end up with axiomatic beliefs to be impossible.

    See the cotard delusion for examples of people who believe they are not alive: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotard_delusion

      Talking about Cotard delusion recently was actually what prompted me to post this, though I've had the question longer than I've known of the illness. One issue with the analogy is that Cotard seems to be a physical illness, more like snapping a computer in two than hacking it.

    Axiomatic belief: I exist.

    Not "I exist in reality", that's different. "I exist" in the sense that I am a thing. In the sense that Frodo Baggins exists, not in reality, but in a fictional story. 

    Without some kind of mind control, I cannot be argued out of that belief. I could be convinced that I don't exist in the real world, that I'm a fictional character of a story written by a simulated person in a virtual reality maintained by aliens who are simulated by super-intelligent robots who are being dreamed of by a mental patient in a hypothetical of a god, but at the end of the day, I still exist.
    ```

    - u/Veedrac:
      ```
      This seems like a pretty strong contender for needs-superhuman-effort, but for reasons I'm not sure I can explain concisely I'm not sold on that really being the case.

      There are conceivable paths I see that lead to beliefs like "we don't have evidence for a continuum of time" and then to "everything exists only in as much as it is does from its own perspective", to which there are paths to beliefs like "everything exists to an equal extent", after which pointing to something that doesn't exist at least shakes the belief in self-existence.

      I'm not saying these are *correct* arguments, but I don't need to do so; they only need to be convincing when given by its most effective advocate, however theoretical.
      ```

      - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
        ```
        When I say "I exist", I don't mean I have to exist in any kind of time continuum, or make any kind of logical sense.

        For example, I could say "squares that are circles". They don't exist in reality. They don't even exist theoretically, since squares are by definition, not circles. But since I have mentioned them, they are a thing now. Which means they exist, even if only in this hypothetical illogical paragraph. 

        So when I say "I exist", I mean it in the same sense. You could convince me that the entire world is an illusion, that there is no real world, that time and space don't exist, that there are no beings that can simulate or create hypotheticals for other things to exist in, that the basic axiom of mathematics reach a contradiction rendering the entire thing meaningless, and it still wouldn't change my belief that "I exist".
        ```

        - u/Veedrac:
          ```
          You seem to be arguing that you wouldn't change your belief *because it is correct*; this doesn't hold. You can be convinced of false things. I'll go out on a limb and even suggest you already have been about something.

          > For example, I could say "squares that are circles". They don't exist in reality. They don't even exist theoretically, since squares are by definition, not circles.

          Except, you know, in Manhattan space.
          ```

          - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
            ```
            It isn't because it is correct, but because it is so ridiculously weak that I don't see how you could convince me that it's wrong. 

            Most beliefs are like towers: the belief sits at the top, and the rest of the tower are the premises and assumptions that are necessary for that belief. If you knock out the assumptions, you can topple the tower. For example, the belief that "there are no squares that are circles", relies on assumptions like squares have 4 sides and circles are round. You comment about Manhattan space is an attempt to knock out my assumption that circles are round, which would indeed topple my tower of belief that  "there are no squares that are circles".

            The belief that "I exist" *(in the weakest possible sense of the word)* is like a single block. There aren't any other assumptions necessary for it as far as I can tell. That's why I was listing so many examples of assumptions you could knock out without having any effect on that belief. The existence of the world isn't part of the tower. The existence of time isn't part of the tower. The existence of other beings isn't part of the tower. You remove them from my belief space, and the single block "I exist" will still be standing there by itself.
            ```

              > It isn't because it is correct, but because it is so ridiculously weak that I don't see how you could convince me that it's wrong.

              This reminds me a lot of [the AI box experiment](http://lesswrong.com/lw/up/shut_up_and_do_the_impossible/). First someone said "a superintelligence can't possibly convince me of X, no matter how smart it is", then Eliezer (not superintelligent) convinced him. Then an onlooker said "I know you just convinced someone who was convinced he couldn't be convinced even by a superintelligence, but I'm still convinced a superintelligence can't convince me of X", then Eliezer (still not superintelligent) did it again.

              Not seeing an argument doesn't mean there isn't one.

              > The belief that "I exist" (in the weakest possible sense of the word) is like a single block. There aren't any other assumptions necessary for it as far as I can tell.

              I've already said why I disagree with this. I can certainly imagine myself not believing I exist.
              ```

    - u/Roneitis:
      ```
      There are idealists who would extend their doctrine of non-continuity/ non-existence of the physical realm to the observer, leading them to doubt the notion of self, that represented by "I". 

      Idealism is weird.
      ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Excuse me while I go double check the literature on self-modeling and figure out precisely what I'll have to knock out in your nervous system to lesion out that belief.

    - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:
      ```
      I can see how that could get bogged down to arguing over definitions of “I” and “to exist”.
      ```

- u/None:
  ```
  So I'm taking a class mixing psychologists, electrical engineers, computer scientists and neuroscientists.  We're supposed to be building a *lingua franca* amongst each other, to conduct interdisciplinary work...

  It's depressing how much of what we're really doing amounts to very basic "rationalist-type", "read the Sequences lol" stuff.  One of today's engineering lessons was that the map is not the territory.  Actually, that's a big lesson from the whole class, since the entire history of cognitive psychology and neuroscience often looks like one long string of mind-projection fallacies.

  Such is life.

  [An entertaining argument](http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7xzb1r/d_friday_offtopic_thread/duge4g0/?context=1) recently reminded me that the proper matching of payments to goods and services can be impossible. For example:

  I probably would pay fifteen or twenty dollars to [ShaperV](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1960462) to reward him for writing [*Time Braid*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644) and to encourage him to finish [*Indomitable*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5207262). However, copyright laws forbid me from doing so (or, at least, forbid ShaperV from accepting such money). Instead, if I want to buy anything from ShaperV, it must be one of [his original works](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8314513). However, I don't find his original works to be worth rewarding or encouraging (based on several chapters of [*Fimbulwinter*](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3198066) and several summaries of his other works, at which I glanced years ago). I therefore find myself in a dilemma: I must, either buy ShaperV's original work and run the risk that he'll be encouraged to keep writing books that I don't like, or not buy it and run the risk of his being discouraged from ALL writing.

  Likewise, shortly after the completion of [*Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108) (for which I probably would pay ten dollars if I could), the organization that employed Prophet Yudkowsky (pbuh) saw fit to publish (on a "pay what you want" basis) another, nonfiction work of his, [*Rationality: From AI to Zombies*](https://intelligence.org/rationality-ai-zombies/). I was forced to confront a similar problem: Should I pay an extra sum of ten dollars (above the five-dollar suggested price, which I found reasonable for the nonfiction book on its own merits) and risk sending the wrong message, or should I refrain from paying that premium and risk damaging the author's future willingness/ability to entertain me? I eventually chose a middle course of paying only a two-dollar premium. (Alternatively, did I actually consider *From AI to Zombies* valueless and intend the whole seven dollars for *HPMoR*? At this late date, I am unable to remember.)

  A third example is FilthyRobot. After watching hundreds of this Twitch streamer's videos [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/FilthyRobotChannel/playlists), I subscribed to [his Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/FilthyRobot) for five dollars per month. However, he produces *both* videos that I *watch* (*e.&nbsp;g.*, of [*Battle Brothers*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQFX9B_9L4-lP-878kjh86uT0BQ1xdrvK), [*XCOM 2*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQFX9B_9L4-nbnLVxYieErwNWGCFZ_ILh), and [*Darkest Dungeon*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQFX9B_9L4-lrBij8Tnj_mmD34jhjhh81)) *and* videos that I *don't* watch (*e.&nbsp;g.*, of  [*Northgard*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQFX9B_9L4-lmo-10hR87jtS7jPXw1gdp), [*Mordheim: City of the Damned*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQFX9B_9L4-lKYf-lJ1Xuuzoq6Wd0zQiq), and [*They Are Billions*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQFX9B_9L4-k_sCZZZN3vK_baLXXIePpq)). I can't mark my Patreon subscription "Do not interpret as supporting *Mordheim* content", any more than I can mark my Amazon purchase of a ShaperV book as "Do not interpret as supporting the *Daniel Black* series" or my MIRI purchase of *From AI to Zombies* as "Past five dollars, do not interpret as supporting *From AI to Zombies*"&mdash;and, even if I could, I would refrain from setting such a precedent because it would be ridiculous to expect a content creator to read and interpret all the hundreds or thousands of messages that he would get. So, my monetary support of FilthyRobot is on very unstable footing.

  The conclusions of this random comment: (1) Bundle deals that force people to buy what they don't want are bad (see also ESPN's [problems](https://www.techdirt.com/blog/?tag=espn) with r/cordcutters); (2) [as applied to the sale of derivative works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_work#The_fair_use_defense_in_derivative_work_cases) (leaving aside the argument linked above, which was about unauthorized distribution), copyright laws are bad (see also [openly-sold Japanese doujinshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doujinshi#Copyright_issues) and the open proliferation of commissioned fanfiction stories on [FIMFiction](https://www.fimfiction.net/)).

    There are laws against making donations to people? Also, isn't there a [specific thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(law\)) that legalizes works where effort was put into the end product even if it's not 100% original?

    >Likewise, shortly after the completion of HPMoR (for which I probably would pay ten dollars if I could), the org. that employed Prophet Yud (pbuh) saw fit to publish another, non-fiction work of his. I was forced to confront a similar problem: Should I pay an extra sum of ten dollars (above the five-buck suggested price, which I found reasonable for the nonfic book on its own merits) and risk sending the wrong message, or should I refrain from paying that premium and risk damaging the author's future willingness/ability to entertain me?

    Send Yud a $10 donation with a message that mentions HPMOR and then pay whatever you want for the nonfiction book.

    >or, if I could, it would be ridiculous to expect the content creator to read and interpret all those hundreds or thousands of messages

    Yeah which is why petabytes of data get interpreted daily with 0 human intervention. I'm not expecting the author to spin up a database and learn SQL for this sort of thing but a ctrl+f with a few names of their works or just something that makes a word cloud out of all the messages should be enough.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      Donation is often used as a thin fig leaf of deniability in a number of circumstances, but the problem is that the law often cares most about *intent*. This comes up most often not in the realm of copyright infringing prose fiction, but prostitution, and the primary reason that all prostitution isn't run on a donation-based model is that even if you call it a donation, the courts will still say "if there had been no donation, there would be no sex, ergo it is paying a fee for sex, and therefore, prostitution as defined by the legal code".

      I'm not aware of any actual legal test of this with regards to prose fiction, and it would probably come down to a question of intent; are people donating in order to signal, in order to show appreciation, or because if they don't donate, no work will be created? Is any of this actually provable to the level of burden required by the courts?

      Except it won't actually come to that, because there are very, very few fanfic authors that can withstand a legal battle in terms of money, and very few legal organizations that would take on such a case pro bono (the [Organization for Transformative Works](http://www.transformativeworks.org/) might be one, but it would probably have to be a very solid case that would set good precedent).

      Regarding transformation, it's not always enough, and in many of the cases ToaKraka listed, the works *aren't* sufficiently transformative, at least as far as my understanding of the law goes (copyright law is a hobby of mine). Writing a sequel to the Harry Potter series is an infringement of copyright, at least as far as the law goes, because you're taking the bones of the original series and using them in the same way they were intended to be used. Most of the successful uses of fair use that lean on "transformation" are about parody, critique, or social commentary of the original work for this reason, and there are a slew of failed cases where someone tried to defend a derivative work as transformative because while it created something new, that new thing wasn't actually transforming the original.
