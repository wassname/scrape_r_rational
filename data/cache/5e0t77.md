## [Q] Is there any "down lift" fiction (opposite of uplift fiction)?

### Post:

So I have been enjoying various uplift fiction stories e.g. 

* www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War
* www.paultwister.com
* www.schlockmercenary.com/ (may not quite be considered uplift fiction)

So is there any of the opposite (preferably rational)?

Edit:
Thanks for all the replies!

  Meaning basically that someone comes across a technologically advanced world and attempts to destroy it? A *Fight Club* or Unabomber type thing?

  Edit: or John Ringo's Council War series

  It's difficult to give suggestions that don't give away too much of the story. Metamorphosis of Prime intellect might count, but it's ambiguous how to interpret the ending (imo)
  ```

  Could you specify some criteria that a "downlift" story should meet? Active suppression of technology to a pre-industrial level? **[Set in Stone](https://setinstonestory.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/)** by /u/Farmerbob1 puts that front and centre. As do several YA dystopian stories, like John Christopher's Tripod series.

  It's a second/third-act reveal in stories like [Spoiler](#s "Janny Wurts' Mistwraith series"), [Spoiler](#s "Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn series (no relation)") or the anime/manga [Spoiler](#s "Scrapped Princess").

  I guess anything where knowledge is *suppressed* instead of increased? Mistborn 1-3 by Brandon Sanderson has that, but it's just part of the backstory. It's not a central theme of the books or anything.

    Both Anathem (Stephenson) and Dune (Herbert) posit worlds in which computers turn out to be so dangerous that the technology must be dramatically limited. In Anathem, programmers are separated from scientists, and both groups are forced to live apart from society in monasteries. In Dune, computers are considered anathema and an alternative set of technologies based on advanced human intelligence allows people to perform (somewhat) similar operations, like astronavigation. The Tripod Trilogy might also fit this (human technology suppressed by alien occupiers). 

    The universe of the Culture books (Banks) has a sort of technological high point in the distant past, but the level of technology in the books is still high.  A technological fall is a pretty common trope in general (post-apocalyptic everything, also many fantasy books like Sword of Shannara or Prince of Thorns), but that might not be what you're looking for. Wheel of Time might also technically fit your criteria, as the "technology" there (more like magic) has fallen from a high point and must be rediscovered over the course of the novels.

      The Culture is very much on the slope upwards, they are the collection of material societies that are voluntarily choosing not to transcend. The stories talk about how the effector and displacer technology improved from the Idiran war to the stories set after it and Player of Games directly contrasts a large (~50cm) drone built several hundred years earlier to the newly created drone that was fist-sized. The same books also mentions that they are contacting societies in the Large Magellanic Cloud for the first time. GSVs are getting larger -- the MSV Not Invented Here was a GSV when it was built and reclassed down when the Plate class GSVs started being built.

      I am not interested in post tech, but in dismantling tech in order to improve society (ending of battlestar galactica goes in that direction)

        This is exactly the scenario I considered in Set In Stone.  Someone plugged me with a link earlier (which is how I found this thread.)

        After colonizing an extremely metal-poor world, Humanity finally manages to create a stable, sane, AI, and convince it that humanity is required for it's long-term sanity.  The AI, in turn, determines that humans are insufficiently sane.  So it suppresses technology and engages in a very long term biological and societal experiment in an effort to reduce humanity's aggressive violent tendencies.

        That's the backstory.  The story itself is told from the point of view of a young swineherd with worrisome violent tendencies, who has to navigate through a scenario of potential war in a society that hasn't seen a war in a thousand years.

        The story is a readable draft, but due to my change of career and working 80+ hour weeks for the last year or so, I have not edited it for publication yet.

          I will give it a try, thanks.

        Science Fiction tends to be written by people with big ideas, that don't like hewing to Malthusian principles or "appropriate technology", and if you extend the last thousand years forward you are going to assume that technology will (eventually) have an answer to every question and problem that it raises. By giving that up you are assigning an end date to the continued survival of the people who suffer under your restrictions.

        So, some examples (none of which are particularly rational):

        Anne McCaffrey's Pern was settled by Space Amish, colonists who deliberately selected a world that didn't have the resources (metals) to sustain an industrial society.

        David Weber's Safehold books are about a colony world that lives in fear that the aliens who destroyed Earth and the other human colonies would come back for them and so ban anything that might lead to the re-development of radio.

        David Brin's *The Practice Effect* is a world where machines built under conventional physics have difficulty operating.

        Niven and Pournelle's *Fallen Angels* is Earth, after an anti-technology government took power in the US and banned space flight. It tells the story of two survivors of the International Space Station after they crash during a routine machine to skim atmosphere and resupply volatiles and how they get back into space. It's propaganda, but it's also fun :)

        Sharon Shinn's Samaria (romance) novels are another colony world that was colonized by Luddites that wanted the pastoral ideal (with semi-mystical weather control).

        Peter F Hamilton's *Night's Dawn* trilogy has two examples, the human colonized world of Norfolk that prohibits most post-industrial technology and iirc one of the alien races they interact with has deliberately frozen their technology level. (I might be mis-remembering it but I think the Adamists also had some self-imposed limits on researching biology? Most of them found the Edenists unsettling and avoided researching anything that might rediscover the technology that set them apart?)

  The first parts of Isaac Asimov's Foundation series is about destroying the current stagnant galactic empire as soon as possible, to shorten the "dark ages" before the next galactic spanning civilization arose.

- u/Empiricist_or_not:
  ```
  Atlas Shrugged could be considered an example.

  Abner Doon’s story in [*Worthing series.*](https://www.goodreads.com/series/53869-worthing) I’ve been seeing probable parallels between this story and actions of a certain RL dictator for quite some time, by now.

  Given your request, you can start from chapter 4 of Capitol [*\(“Breaking the Game”\)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_the_Game) and see if you like the general narration and storyline, because it serves as a pretty good preview to the whole trilogy.

  p.s. Here’s another recently made book request that *could* be relevant to your interests:
