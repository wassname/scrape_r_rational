  Now the best opci√≥n they have is breking mama's legs and escaping right now , emma is  incapable of leading a group and will delay them or require someone to help her move which is a  problem   .They should have some kind of contingence plan in case one of them    is injured but their reaction suggest the optimist bias  didn't let them realize that could happen to one of them ( maybe they even had plans of what to do if one of the little kids was injured).
  To be fair I didn't expect mama to do that either,since  she wants to ship them in perfect conditions , but apparently only the brain is important .
