    This is excellent and I hope the author writes more eventually.

      I would advise you make an account and express interest in it, then. No guarantees, of course, but that fanfic only has 12 comments, and authors, as any creative person, thrive on feedback.

      e: On checking the comments myself on posting mine, I notice that you did so already. Suggestion shall remain for others, though.

        Yep, definitely agree with your assessment. Positive feedback is important.

      Well, it's not rationalist per se, but he does have some other Homestuck fanfiction.

  No full fics, no. I wish. Collision is great, but REALLY short.

    Well to be fair home stuck is a little long
    ```

      ```
      Harry Potter's 1,084,170 words vs Homestuck's 817612 words + 4 hours of animations. It's really long, but HPMOR exists, y'know. You don't have to exactly adapt all of it.

        Have you read any of homestuck? That word count is nothing compared to the pictures

        Maybe it gets word-y-er after the point where I lost my place but the first bit is 95% images

          The equivalent word count was calculated using the panels too http://readmspa.org/stats/.

  Homestuck is the antithesis of rational fiction in almost every way. You *could* make a rational fic about it, but it would be hard as hell.

  Lord English makes this impossible.

  If Lord English is rational, he is unbeatable. He gained his unconditional immortality from breaking the clock that sets the conditions for his immortality--and in the process, absorbing the Clockwork Majyyks that power it. Due to this, his only weaknesses are weapons made using the weight on said clock, a Magic Cue Ball, which grants omniscience.

  The main problem is that he has that *on top* of having more control over time than anyone else in all reality (being the Lord of Time), clockwork majyyk lasers that can kill the already-dead and break reality, the brains of Dirk's Autoresponder, the brawn of Equius and whatever the hell half of Gamzee's got going for him.

  There is no foreseeable situation where Lord English can lose without the kind of bullshit that Homestuck presents in order to make the situation possible.

  Of course, if you simply write out Lord English (which I wouldn't see as a bad idea), it might be possible. But Sburb is a boring game, and playing it as a munchkin would likely not be that exciting.

    Lord English is stupid, but he's an extremely persistent and powerful time traveller. He's basically Skynet as portrayed in [Branches on the Tree of Time](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time), and that's a rationalist fanfiction.

    I don't think there's any one problem that can't be overcome. I think it's more that it just has everything wrong for a rational fanfiction. The main villain isn't smart. The setting is overly silly. Things happen because the universe needs them to. Time travel is abundant, limited only by plot.

      As someone who has written Homestuck fanfiction, I agree. There's simply too much nonsensoleum.

    I think Doc Scratch implies any Cue Ball is equally damaging. I don't think it has to be that specifc one. 

    Otherwise you're right, but it's like saying Voldemort is unbeatable because he has seven horcruxes and is magically more powerful than anyone in Harry Potter after book 6. HPMOR still rebalanced both Harry and Voldemort so the fight was still hard as fuck but viable.

      I didn't mean to imply that it had to be that specific one. In fact, given Homestuck's tendency for the platonic, I think it may be a bit ridiculous to think that at all.

    But the rest of Sburb is equally broken, eg the Alchemiter.
    ```

    - u/Putnam3145:
      ```
      The alchemiter is too broken in a different way; it's simultaneously too deterministic and too chaotic. It's basically based on whether or not... I guess whether or not the item was to be alchemized in the first place?

      There's lots of other broken things, like prototyping your own dead dream self in a sprite with some other overpowered thing, but... Lord English did that, too, with ARquiusprite. Plus, Jade's own OPness from that particular game mechanic was replicated somewhat by Lord English due to the way he emerged from Doc Scratch (I'm pretty sure). I forgot to mention that, in fact.

      What I mean is: Sburb is hella munchkinable, but Lord English seems to already have done that about as far as it's possible to.

      EDIT: Actually, now that I think it, there's some small amount of evidence that English just sort of freezes up upon being confronted with a cue ball weapon (he's noticeably unmoving in both cases where his eyes are stuck at 8s), so that could probably be used, but then you have the opposite problem of it being too easy...
      ```

      ```
      That's exactly what makes rational Homestuck impossible, as far as I can tell. *Every* mechanic that defines it is powerful enough to make things uninteresting.
      ```

      - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
        ```
        Or it makes the outcome uncertain in what ends up being a relatively short story.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          Playing the setting straight like that one HPMOR omake (72 hours to victory I think it's called) would make it short. You'd probably need a really ambitious AU to turn it into a long story.
          ```
