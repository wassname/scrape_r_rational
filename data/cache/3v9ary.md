## Rational Undertale?

  Meh!  Undertale is already pretty "rational" in a way: it's a game about how everyone around you is actually a real person with their own lives, and you don't *need* to powergame your way through a heap of corpses, and in fact you're kind of a bad person if you do.

  It's a very Reality Ensues sort of game, that way.

      If the box is all you know and you don't know that there's anything reachable outside of it you don't really try to escape it. People thought for eons (and still think) that our world was created by a superior being. Yet breaking out and going to His world only exists as the typical "path to paradise//heaven/nirvana" thing. I haven't heard any stories of vikings trying to break through Ymir's skull.

  The sun is shining. Birds are singing. Flowers are blooming.

  On days like these, time machines appear in the middle of fields.

  A skeleton steps out and hammers into the ground a sign that says:

  ## **do you want to have a bad time**

  ##**these flowers are bad**

  ## **you need a cup of butter**

  ## **not a buttercup**

  He sighs as he finishes. "why didn't i do this before? i'm such a bonehead." He gets back into his time machine and vanishes.

    Wasn't his time machine broken? I don't think he actually did any travel himself.

    Hee. That would perhaps solve things, to the extend one ignores all the issues with basically cutting away a branch of the timeline/rewinding it, but...

    Do you really think that was a misunderstanding on Chara's part, rather than a deliberate murder attempt?

  No. Now, if you wanted to write it... Rational!sans would be an optimal choice. (What run it is is up to the author.) Take either Flowey or chara for the antagonist.

  Rational!Frisk breaks the laws of balance, since canon has them completely OP with the save and all- if victory is possible, they will win in the end.

  Rational!Flowey is arguably worse, but may make a good dubious character.

  Not as far as I've seen. I've been checking AO3 and and FFNet pretty obsessively for fics. :p

  Edit: The closest thing I've found is this, dealing with the political aftermath of exitting -- it's only got two chapters, though they're long: http://archiveofourown.org/works/5148158/chapters/11851688

  Also, fair warning to anyone remotely interested in playing the game Undertale (really solid one, by the way, though this isn't exactly the place to proselytize), don't read this. Spoilers abound, and it's a game that pretty much anything about it is a spoiler.

  I'd like to see this too; I don't think it would be a good thing within the confines of the story itself, but within the meta-story (the fact that several characters know you can save/reset and thus are more than just the sprite within the game) would be amazing. Yes, they escape the Underground... but they also spread the knowledge that some force out there is controlling their fates and who can just... delete everything. 

  Basically it would become an A.I.-gaining-sentience type of deal, in my mind.

  If you find anything, please post it!

  I wrote [this](http://mhd-hbd.tumblr.com/post/132076270706/undertale-munchkin-fic) a while back, and have been mulling on whether my next writing project should be a Groundhog-day exploration of the Undertale mythos.
