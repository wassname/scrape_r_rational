## [FF] With this Ring (SI/DCU) - Questions on the format and order of reading

### Post:

SOLVED! And thanks for the help guys, I'll leave this up in case anyone else ever wants to find out. 


Hi, so I'm looking into reading [With this Ring](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-twelve.25032/) since I heard its a good and long FF (and the only other Reddit thread I found about it was [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3yxxop/ff_with_this_ring_moving_threads/), so I figured this was the subreddit to post this on, please correct me if I'm wrong) and I can't help but be a little.... confused with the format it should be read it.

So, when I tried to just start reading from that Megathread I link and which seems to be the 'hub' page for the story I found that the post immediately following it was definitely not the beginning of the story, so I had a look at Revised Story Only, and Original Story Only. And while the Revised Story Only appears to have been updated very recently its only about 100k words if the index is correct for that thread, but then I clicked on one of those random Thread Xs and noticed that the story in one of those was over 200k words!?!

So my question is, does anyone know how I should read this? Do I just started at Thread 1 and work my way up to thread whatever and ignore those to 'Story Only' links at the top? And if so what are those story only things for?

&#x200B;

Sorry if these seem like stupid questions, but I really am not sure on what to do and couldn't find anyone else having asked this question yet.

  Wish I had some way to read just the Renegade parts, if anyone knows of one.

    It's nonobvious but fairly straightforward. To read only the renegade sections of wtr, do the following.

    Go to the [main discussion page](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-thirteen.49418/).

    Scroll down to the boxes labelled "Spoiler: Episode number, Title". Click these to expand a list of posts for that episode. They don't actually contain spoilers; Zoat is just using the feature for formatting.

    Some posts will be labelled "(supplementary,  Renegade option.)" Those are what you're looking for. 

    If an episode is entirely focused around the renegade, then instead there will be posts labelled "(supplementary, SI option)". In that case, you want to read every other post within that episode.

    scroll through fairly quickly and use the primitive parts of your brain to spot the scary red bits

    hard to say otherwise, maybe a Tampermonkey script that deletes all the posts that don't start with a red color? that'll miss any that are renegade that don't immediately start with the timestamp, of which there are at least two

    Just FYI, the Renegade part really depends upon you knowing the events that happened in the other timeline, as he'll assume you have the information when he's coming at a similar scenario from a different perspective. I feel like you won't really get the full gist or experience without it. 

    And honestly, one of my favorite scenes, where he dresses down the Justice League for their incompetence by ripping apart each superhero's method of doing things (like why doesn't Superman carry a radiations shield any of the green lanterns could have made from him easily, or Wonder woman for her impractical armor, etc) is on the regular timeline.

      fyi yudkowsky commented in another recent WTR thread that discussed the latest chapter 

      ergo I conclude he's up to date and just wants to read the renegade stuff fast for some reason

  This is the beginning of the story-only thread that Zoat updates every day. It has links to the discussion threads at the bottom in his signature if you're logged into the site. 

  It can be a little confusing because sometimes Zoat jumps around but paying attention to the color of the timestamps is a good indicator for whats going on. The story splits between paragon!paul and renegade!paul (who refers to himself by another name). Occasionally alternate versions and perspective come into the story but reading the posts in order is the best way to follow it.

  To explain the discrepancy, Zoat began writing this story on SpaceBattles until the new Star Wars movies came out. The mods there declared no spoilers for SW anywhere on the site and Zoat made a post that passingly mentioned the Millennium Falcon in it. He was then arbitrarily banned for a day, told them to eat shit and took his story over to SV instead, where he currently updates it once a day.

    ```
    additional note: The Millennium Falcon appeared on the official poster, which had been published well before Zoat mentioned it.

    Not actually the case. He commented with a question of why you'd continue to call yourself a rebellion when you've become the legitimate government (or something to that effect), with no other context. I didn't even know what he was talking about until other posters replied with star wars specific comments and everyone involved got banned.

  ```
  The Revised Story Only thread is how I read it. The word counts for the Story Only thread will appear misleading because only the first post in each chapter is threadmarked.

    ```
    Ahhhhhh, ok thanks.
    ```

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      The threadmarks are used in the story only in order to quickly jump between episodes, as it would be pretty superfluous to threadmark every post in a story only thread.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        I still accidentally clicked the threadmarks all the time in the story only thread. Habits are hard to break.

  [The Story Only Archive](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.25076/) has the entire thing in one thread without other people's posts interfering with the reading experience. You can just read that entire thread and be up to date - the author updates story-only and main threads simultaneously.

  The threads with discussion in them have exactly the same story content but also people discussing every update; this discussion can be interesting at times but is definitely not required to understand the story, and most people will read the story-only portion and then join the the thread discussing the recent updates. The threads run into number-of-post-per-thread limits for the server occasionally, so they're actually spread over ... thirteen threads, right now. If you want to read all of those long threads full of comments, you can. But again it's completely unnecessary.

  The current [thread full of comments](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-thirteen.49418/) also has a table of contents and a FAQ. The FAQ is probably good for new readers to check out. In particular, *the bit about a secondary 'renegade' AU storyline delineated by red-text time in the start of a section* is good to know about.

    The first eleven threads were due to hitting post limits, but those eventually got removed. Thread 12 was due to the move linked in the OP, and thread 13 was created because Zoat hit the character limit for the index page.
    ```

- u/Nimelennar:
  ```
  I've dipped into the comment threads, and there's some additional contextual information (e.g. why there will never be a plot line in the Teen Titans Go! or Titans universe), so if you have a *lot* of free time, you might want to find Thread 1 and go from there, for the full experience.

  That said, I have been following the Story Only thread almost exclusively, and if there's information I've missed out on by not reading the Comment threads, the work doesn't suffer for its omission.

      There's actually a show called Titans now, a live action Teen Titans, that I heavily doubt will be interacted with due to it looking pretty terrible. Teen Titans has had some crossover, but not Titans.
