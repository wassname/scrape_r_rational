  I just got into this, and quite enjoyed it.  Stayed up too late, even.

    Thanks!

    I don't think that I would be the person I am today without HPMOR; it really left its mark on me, and for that I am forever grateful.

  Good to get more discussion on how/why the different artifacts are bound to Amaryllis.

  Curious why the skin tattoo failed. Wondering what the high-level results of a skill as broad as "Engineering" will look like.

  Gotta say, I also think the author does a good job in both the emotionally resonant scenes and the nitty-gritty worldbuilding which often appear as if they're mutually exclusive skills.

    ```
    My guess as to why the tattoo failed is that the fortress is under an anti-magic field.

      ```
      What if the skin mage just stole the teleport stone?
      ```

  > Worth the Candle is a self-insert litRPG portal fantasy, loosely based on my personal experience of falling into a portal to another world and discovering that I had a character sheet attached to my soul.

  If you haven't read any of this, [here's the link to the full thing](http://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249?view_full_work=true).

  If you want to know how to make [pemmican](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_vLuMobHCI&list=PL4e4wpjna1vxXNa7kCTF3i2LzFE9uKPPU) or [portable soup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fE5KzvOZRk), I have helpfully included some "hyperlinks" earlier in this very sentence.

  Oh man, your too good to us <3. This is quickly becoming my favorite litrpg. You need to work a little harder catch to the wandering inn.

  Whats the best way to support the story? Any plans for a patreon?

  keep up the great work!

    I am sadly not fast enough to *ever* catch up to Wandering Inn. My current average word count is ~2600 words per day, while Wandering Inn seems to be ~3700 words per day.

    I do like money, because it can be exchanged for goods and services, but I don't plan on ever monetizing this story, short of some publisher or agent coming up to me and offering me a reasonable deal (which almost certainly will not happen).

    If you want to support this story, my preferences are:

    * write some fanfic
    * draw some fanart
    * post about it somewhere
    * recommend it to friends

    But those are really just "things that would bring me personal happiness".

      ```
      I hope youre ready for some terribly written fanfic!
      ```
