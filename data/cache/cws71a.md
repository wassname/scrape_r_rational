  Not only is this story a work of science-fiction/science-fantasy fanfiction, a genre I know is dear to our sub's heart, it features a rationalist protagonist, >!a rational antagonist!<, and >!AI safety!<.

    ```
    It's a story that's basically built around modern concepts and lingo that's wearing Star Wars like a skin.

    A crudely scalped, stapled together skin.

    The part that amused me was that Rey is set up as this HPMOR-style character and never actually does anything.

    Thanks for sharing it, though.

      It rubs the jargon into its prose or it gets the downvotes again.

      That metaphor is on point.

  Calling it: they didnâ€™t actually win.
