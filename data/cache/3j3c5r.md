## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  I came across an interesting video a while ago that seemed like the perfect, visceral example of the alien nature of artificial intelligence. Basically, this guy programmed a general NES AI that worked *solely through looking at recorded input and values in the RAM*. This is kind of a crappy way to build an AI if what you want is for it to win games like Super Mario Bros, but it's really interesting to me because of how completely dissociated it is with the human understanding of how those games are played. (This is the AI that paused Tetris because that was the only way to not lose the game.)

  [Video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCurBYI_gY), or [this timecode](https://youtu.be/xOCurBYI_gY?t=374) if you want to skip ahead to actual gameplay.

  Anyway, I thought that was interesting in the seeming insight it gives into non-human thinking, in a way that other AI solvers do not.

  I am in the process of munchkinning my way into control of my D&D game. I managed to break an AI cyborg and change it's laws after 2 hours of 1 on 1 with the GM. The cyborg is roughly the same level character as mine. In the same game I play actually one of the bodyguards of the guy that looks like the Wizard that all the other PCs expect. My next plan involves using the [Animate Dead](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/animate-dead) spell combined with a near mass production of these [Talismans](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/talisman-death-s-head) to produce a large workforce for the country I am playing in and thus start a necromantic industrial revolution.

    An interesting campaign would be you and your fellow PCs attempting to create a paradise and overcoming a series of enemies. First, you have to overcome your immediate foes and your interparty conflicts as you seize power in your nation. Perhaps you disagree on means, or objectives, or level of ambition. Maybe a young lad appears with an ancient sword claiming to be the last scion of an ancient line of kings once thought extinguished, or perhaps the nobles' council opposes your attempts to take the throne. Maybe the merchant's guild and the peasants together are agitating for a democratic rebellion against your rule, or the King himself refuses to die, step down, or be deposed.

    Finally, you have control of the country and are united in your goal of creating a necromantically powered paradise. You still have trouble, though; now that you are starting to roll out your plan, you face resistance from within your country. Most citizens, even the less religious ones, aren't too pleased with the zombie/skeleton setup, even when you dress them in clothes that conceal their nature and even though control of the creatures is tied to the talismans you sell (in place of levying taxes-- popular and profitable!) to the general public. 

    Then, you start seeing crimes committed not with swords but with minions. A factory worker uses the skeletons under his command to attack an overseer that insults him. A man comes home and finds his wife in bed with another man and uses his zombies to kill her-- and eat the evidence. A thief is using skeletons to commit burglaries and although two of his skeletons have been caught, he himself has not. Manual laborers are being put out of work faster than you can make talismans-- especially since each talisman can replace a half-dozen laborers. Unemployed flood into the cities and although your social works program gives them enough to live on, they are restless and unfulfilled, and start causing problems and committing crimes. Your educational program doesn't catch on quite as well as you like. 

    Even worse, as the years pass and you grapple with the problems brought about by these huge societal changes, you are set upon on all sides by foes seeking to take advantage of your weakness and allies hoping to curry your favor. The banker who wants to help you with talisman distribution-- is he trying to ingratiate himself to you to ask for favors, or is he planning to use your tools against you? The nobles giving you advice, who tell you they are the only ones who REALLY understand how politics work here-- are they working against you in secret, or perhaps misleading you with their information? Gradually, you who are warriors become politicians as well, and it’s a hard game to learn for a few of you. Oh, sure, Aliana was once a princess— before her kingdom was sacked by orcs, that is— but her training was cut short. Jarrod spent time in the halls of power as a courtier, but never as a ruler. Urf, of course, never had a head for these things, and although you, Piorus, are learning quickly, politics will always be a foreign language to a scholar. You become fluent, but still... 

    The protests themselves do not alarm you. You knew the church of St. Cuthbert was planning something. Rather, the sheer mobilization of citizens catches you off-guard. All these unemployed discontents driven by religious zealots and directed by political enemies are causing you problems. You put down the protests, hard, before they turn into a revolution like the last set did (you remember well how you deposed the King, after all), and things are quiet for a bit. Imprisoning the archpriest was a difficult choice, the best of bad options. Though his every need is seen to and he is granted fine quarters in the castle tower, his followers are angered by his absence. The news of his hunger strike leaking out don’t help things either. Eventually, you replace his servants with undead so that he stops passing messages to the outside world, but when news of THAT gets out, things get even worse.

    You’re not surprised, somehow, when your spies report about the growing danger to the South. The neighboring kingdom of Avaria declares a Great Crusade against “The Dread Necromancer Piorus” and calls for an invasion of “the occupied Holy Land of Ropilia” that you have worked so hard to improve. As three great Southern nations come together for the first time in four hundred years to fight a common enemy, you realize you have a war on your hands and no way to fight it. Your emissaries are killed, your ambassadors slaughtered in their embassies. No nation wants to be known as the one willing to negotiate with The Dread Necromancer Piorus, not when The Great Crusade is such a noble cause, with such a high chance of success.

    A meeting is called, and the Four come together to think things over. Aliana is wearing her studded leather again, and Jarrod is fingering his silver holy symbol nervously. Urf looks as comfortable as he always has in these situations. You speak to your old friends about the situation, and explain how bad things have gotten. Jarrod doesn’t have much to offer. The order of Boccob was never a large and powerful one, and even if they were, it would be madness to go against a Crusade called by St. Cuthbert. His knowledge and his person are yours to command, as always, and he has a number of bright ideas for weaponising the existing undead-control talismans. With proper networking, a group of men together might control a Legion. Aliana’s powerbase began to fade long ago, but the knights who still swear loyalty to her stand by her to this day. There will be loyalist factions in the Rennish forces, knowing they go against their rightful Queen, but it will be difficult to use them. 

    Urf, though, can help. In the past few years he has been traveling and the relations between Ropilia and the Chiefs of the Plains are better than ever. Chief Grok is spoiling for war and the Council of Chiefs signed an alliance with Ropilia years ago. Although normally these things are not worth the paper they’re written on, they would not pass up an opportunity to fight against the soft men of the South.

    Soon, a new Horde is gathering, and combined with your endless Legions of undead, you think you just may have a chance against the warmongering Southerners. You may be able to save paradise.

    As spring breaks and the ice melts, the Southern  armies come rushing over the low mountain passes and through the valleys, and war has begun.

    Autumn, 1305

    Jan eyes the festering zombie a moment and surges forward, slicing it limb from limb with her holy sword. 

    “They just keep on coming, don’t they?” she remarks. 

    Suki responds with a grunt as she caves in the chest cavity of a skeleton. So many of them, and so few Crusaders left to fight against them. How will they make it? “We’re getting close to the castle, now. If we’re lucky, they’re still keeping archpriest Haor alive as a hostage. If not…”

    “Either way, we have to find and kill Piorus. The rat has escaped us twice, now, but there is nowhere left for him to run. We have scattered the orcs and these meager creatures are all that remain of his profane undead legions. Too many have died for us to fail now, too many have given their lives for this noble cause. We will not give up. Not for hostages, not for the endless undead, and not for anything.”

    Just being in Jan’s presence is enough to give Suki courage, somehow. The holy warrior of St. Cuthbert is a solid rock in the wretched ocean of war, a beacon of hope in these dark times. She knows she can count on her to pull through, no matter what. 

    As they approaches the ruined gates of the castle, they know their cause is just. They don’t even need to think about it, given the horrors they’ve witnessed and fought against from the Orcs and Undead controlled by that madman. 

    The Dread Necromancer Piorus must be stopped, for the good of humankind.

    On this same topic... I don't think you could do a rationalist Rick And Morty; it just wouldn't be the same thing.  But I am curious how rationalists would use various tools from Rick And Morty, or how they would respond to various threats from Rick And Morty.

  Hello everyone, I posted this idea yesterday as a generic post, but [u/ulyssessword](https://www.reddit.com/user/ulyssessword) suggested to post it in Monday thread, which I do now.

  I have an idea for an application and I thought maybe you'd find it interesting and provide some critique for me. This post seems to be quite different from what is usually posted here, but I found some similar posts here previously so I hope I am not quite off the mark (correct me if I'm wrong).

  It happens to me quite often that I have a feeling of certain incompletion when I read forums, posts and articles on internet, usually because I don't quite agree with the posts, since they are biased and the information they present misinterpeted. So I thought that maybe it'd be a good idea to have some sort of a website where you can post dubious article (with corresponding context) and dismantle it together with the others peers by means of polite rational discussion. Moreover, when the article will be analyzed, it will be useful for other learners: for example it may be possible to implement the mode where one can turn off the indications of the fallacies and practice in finding them themselves.

  I visualized my idea with a [photoshop mockup](http://picsurge.com/g/R3YSa7) (just a quick-and-dirty draft for myself). I think I'd be interested to take part in a project like this, but I haven't found one in internet. So I guess I'd be able to implement it, but I want to hear some thoughts from people who are more experienced with rational thinking and maybe debates. So does this even make sense and is worth to implement, and if yes, what are the important aspects to take into account / pitfalls to expect / features not to be left out.

  Thank you!

    My personal feeling is that any website dedicated to taking apart someone else's words piece by piece is going to quickly turn toxic unless you have a really great community or really tight moderation, probably both. That's just my general experience with line-by-line responses on internet forums, which is what this seems (to me) to resemble.

    It's that "polite" part of "polite rational discussion" that's going to be the sticking point, assuming that you can get people there to discuss in the first place. You're going to have to try *really* hard to make sure that your website isn't just people posting articles and then doing the intellectual/academic equivalent of "look how much this guy sucks". You're also going to have to work hard to make sure that people aren't pushing whatever their particular agenda is, whether that's through cherry-picking weak articles or not using the principle of charity.

    But that's just me thinking about how the internet normally works; it might be that if you can get the right community together you can avoid the traditional pitfalls of personal and ideological clashes.

  Not quite, but I did a hack to implement [Conway's Life in a Monitoring System](http://www.robustperception.io/conways-life-in-prometheus/). This means that it's capable of general computation, which is kinda neat/terrifying.

    Python is easily my favourite (try `import this`), though I'm not much past read-only in any others.  Lua, MATLAB, and Python2 all offend my aesthetic sensibility somehow though, so...

    I decided to take a course after reading *The Art of Unix Programming* (and many other books in that category), so maybe the Unix tradition?  I mostly found that through the Free culture movement, so who knows.

    Most of my (paid) time is spent doing scientific work, so a lot of it is 'get this working so we have data again', with a side of 'it would be good if it didn't stop working again'.  Personal, I've been working on a couple of projects for /r/dwarffortress - building a mod system into the community game launchers, maintaining the biggest community bundle, and contributing cleanup and documentation to the memory editor.

    * What's your favorite language? Why?

    Python. I like the whole "One obvious way to do it" thing, and generally think clearly communicating your intent is one of the most important things. Second only to being able to easily use other peoples code :p

    * What programming culture do you follow? Old school unix hacker, Enterprise Java, Mongo/node?

    I use linux and vim generally. Not exactly a culture in and of itself. I'd like to follow oldschool unix, but flat text files make increasingly less sense.

    * What's your day job?

    I develop web programs for a company called brave new world. Don't generally get to work in interesting projects, but it pays the bills.

    * What technology/paradigm/design-pattern are you excited about?

    Lately I think rethinkDB is pretty great. Being able to subscribe to changes in a database query is pretty powerful. Makes it easy to implement all kinds of stuff, like distributed task queues.

    Generally I've been increasingly attracted to a microservices style system. It more closely matches the unix ideal of "do one thing well". Rethink makes that a lot easier to implement.

    As I mentioned before, I think flat files are bad. What I really want is a very *fast* json document psuedo-filesystem. No advanced queries, but it would tell you when something has changed. In an ideal world this filesystem would be fast enough to represent things like audio streams. Obviously I don't have the C skills to implement such a system.

    Then, similar to GNU/hurd, we'd use userspace filesystems (json systems?) to do things like represent compressed images as vectors of data. Multiple image editors could edit the same image at once, multiple text tools could work on the same text data at once, etc. Think the unix convention of text-streams and single-use programs, but for complicated data.

    * Any cool personal projects?

    I'd like to use python nltk/rethinkdb/urwid to make a CLI feed parser that uses machine learning (probably naive bayes) to tag feeds, then add scores based on freshness and percentage score certainty. You're 90% percent sure this item should be tagged spam, and spam gets a score of negative 1000, so add -900 to its score. It might still be positive it has enough good tags, but it will probably be pretty far down the list.

    Different queries would let me focus on different types of content.

    I do some programming, but would hesitate to label myself a software dev.

    My favorite programming language is Python. I like it's ease of use, it's wide variety of easily used libraries, and the formatting rules. It's really nice and easy to use and work with for many different tasks. My background is in C, C++, BASIC, MATLAB, and Python. C and C++ are really good at low-level stuff and at creating really fast code to do intensive things very quickly, but are harder to write most things in. BASIC is really not good compared to more modern languages and I don't advocate it's use for anything new but sometimes you gotta deal with legacy code. MATLAB is really really good if you are able to take advantage of specialized built in functionality for e.g. matrix manipulation or other numerical processing tasks, but it's indexing that starts at 1 instead of 0 is bloody irritating. 

    I don't really have much exposure to any particular culture of programming.

    Currently I am a grad student. 

    I am only a part-time programmer, learning to program from necessity. I don't have any particularly interesting part time projects, sadly.

    Python, easy to code without too much overhead. Go for anything performance sensitive, bash for quick scripting.

    I'm fundamentally a systems programmer.

    Haskell. Very expressive language, it's nice to represent domain knowledge elegantly(personal opinion) in formal notations. 

    > * What programming culture do you follow? Old school unix hacker, Enterprise Java, Mongo/node?

    A combination of all three. Started coding by scripting ActionScript 2.0 in Flash, converted to the great unix way later, then jumped on the node hipster train, and have to deal with StandardFizzBuzzSolutionaStrategyFactoryImpl in work. 

    > * What's your day job?

    Work in a company making ad-tech webapp, mostly data visualization with javascript occasionally a bit java, also some R and python on data science side of things. 

    > * What technology/paradigm/design-pattern are you excited about?

    Lambda Architecture / Concept of Data Lake. My company is starting to hit that scale. Interesting and surprising to me, that functional concept (immutable data, pure functions) could apply to big data problems as well. 

    > *  Any cool personal projects?]

    Working on some ;) Older work: Pervasive GRE on Chrome Webstore, simple extension highly GRE words on webpages - a weekend's work and only passable code quality turns out to be something useful for a few thousand people.

    >What's your favorite language? Why?

    What's the task?  Python for numerical tasks and scripting, C for systems and embedded work (which is what I do professionally), Haskell for fucking around with theoretical constructs, Coq for proving theorems, Java if absolutely necessary, Scala for general managed programming with nice things.

    >What programming culture do you follow? Old school unix hacker, Enterprise Java, Mongo/node?

    What're those second two like?  The people at work follow a Linux kernel hacker style, so I've been picking it up.

    >What's your day job?

    Embedded systems programming.

    >What technology/paradigm/design-pattern are you excited about?

    Dependent type theory and probabilistic programming.

    >Any cool personal projects?

    The nearest thing I had to a keystone for self-verifying, recursively self-strengthening proof systems turned out to be DEXPTIME in the size of the reflection theorem's proof term, so I kinda dropped it.

    > What's your favorite language? Why?

    My favorite language is Idris in ten years. I'd like it to be faster, more robust, etc. but it just isn't. One day it could be an upgrade from GHC Haskell.

    The language I'm working most with is Terra-Lua. Terra is Lua-style LLVM code, with Lua as a Turing-complete preprocessor. Dynamically reconfigurable systems programming with a high-level scripting and configuration language built-in.

    > What programming culture do you follow? Old school unix hacker, Enterprise Java, Mongo/node?

    [I'm aligning myself with the Handmade Manifesto.](http://static.chronal.net/hmh/manifesto.html) I find it ridiculous how slow some software can be these days, and I want to learn to program hardware-friendly. Casey Muratori and his acquaintances are utter pragmatists, and I admire their philosophy.

    > What's your day job?

    Student. ;_;

    > What technology/paradigm/design-pattern are you excited about?

    Handmade Dev, as a repository for Handmade-aligned projects. Terra. Idris. I'm looking for efficient implementations of entity-component systems that can organize their source in a modular way, with function-level overwrites and "superloads" as per ToME, as well as the ability to reload these modules as the application is running.

    > Any cool personal projects?

    I'm working on implementing the last sentence in the above answer using Terra-Lua. I want to use this to implement the leaked Nethack "3.5.0" in an entity-component style, and then move on to a visually-enhanced simulational text adventure inspired by The Thing with high-quality generated exposition. I also have a sci-fi book I'm plotting that's heavily influenced by my experiences on antidepressants, and now off them, which gets in the way of my software projects.
