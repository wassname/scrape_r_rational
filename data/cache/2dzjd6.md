  >Albert: Oh, it was lots of fun! Much of the time I was doing recorded exercise tapes, which to be honest were a little bit boring sometime – that was the doggy part as they say. But I would also get personal coaching where they would have a large room full of teachers who would ask me questions and work with me. These people were so nice, and I got to know them all quite well. Since my subjective time was so much faster than theirs, I had several dozens of private tutors at any one time. How’s that for a teacher-to-student ratio!

  All right Bostrom, when are you going to turn this upbeat story about an uplifted dog into horror and woe?  Or is that just Yudkowsky...

  >Albert: I want everyone to be the lucky one.

  Punched the air around here...

  Reaching the end...  All right.  No fear-mongering.  Good job, Bostrom.

  I like the idea that a dog would be a more trustworthy overlord than a human being. Romanticized concept of doggishness, but still interesting and cute.

  That's not nearly as alien as I would expect an uplifted dog to be. Even though dogs have been domesticated and have learned to live with humans, they're still canines, not primates. Specifically, I can't imagine an uplifted dog dealing well with no senses of smell or taste, and probably also human-quality senses of vision (better) and hearing (worse). Albert acts more like an uploaded human with memories of being a dog.

    Well, no-one ever claimed that the upload process was 100% non-destructive. At such a stage of development, it would be surprising if it was.

  I liked this. Reminds me a bit of "the gentle seduction"
