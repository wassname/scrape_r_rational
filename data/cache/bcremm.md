## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  **1) How would you munchkin your powers as a flying brick?**

  - You wake up one day and realise you have the powers of the archtypical generic flying brick superhuman. 
  - Through a series of improbable coincidences and some hasty experimentation, you've discovered the following:
  - Flight: You can fly, though you've only tried going at low subsonic speeds. You don't know if an atmosphere is required.
  - Durability: The first few times you tried flying you accidentally fell 9 stories. It hurt a little, but you didn't seem to sustain any injuries.
  - Strength: You slammed a fist on your table and the table broke. You tried picking up your refrigerator and managed it easily without breaking a sweat.
  - Speed: You can *at minimum* sustain a sprint to comfortably keep up with the vehicles on the road, though you could definitely fly faster, 

  And that's basically it as far as you know. 

  - You don't really know your upper limits.
  - Apart from a few stunned eyewitnesses, no one really knows of your abilities (you are not notable).
  - You don't know how you got these abilities, whether you can do anything else, or who else may have them. As far as you can tell, everyone else appears ordinary.  
  - Your reaction times seem to be similar to a normal human.  
  - You don't seem to require consuming additional calories as a result of using these abilities.  

  Apart from turning a generator crank up and down really fast, what would you do? How would you attempt to safely discover/test their limits? Would you attempt to keep a low profile? How would you best utilize your abilities?

    Well, I've got magic now, so obviously I should clean out all of the skeptics prizes for anyone that can prove extra normal abilities.

    - u/Izeinwinter:
      ```
      Thing is, if you suddenly have magic, then you are in a world where magic exists. Thus, there are considerable odds that those prizes are some sort of trap. Actually, there are only two significant possibilities here - either the world changed, and powered people are going to be crawling out of the woodwork, or you should be really concerned about how the heck the Masquerade is enforced. 

      Flying brick powers are, unfortunately, not very well suited to low-key staking out the offices of a skeptics association.

    Besides cautiously figuring out the limits of my abilities and exploring ways to reverse engineer them, I’d probably try to implement some of the things I wrote about here: https://nikvetr.wordpress.com/2016/07/20/superman-effective-power-application/

      Good thoughts. I guess the real answer to most of these problems are find a way to make silly amounts of money with your power and use that money to fund research/feed people/whatnot.

  ```
  **2) How would you munchkin your powers of a flying brick?**

  - You telepathically control an ordinary sized clay brick.  
  - It weighs a little over 3kg, and is as durable as a typical well made fired brick.   
  - With a thought, you can command the brick to accelerate in any direction.  
  - You are instinctively aware of the brick's position relative to yourself.  
  - It can generate thrust to continuously accelerate at up to 50m/s^2 in any direction, but is otherwise subject to normal physics, velocity limits would depend on various factors like air resistance.   
  - This ability has no range limits, although your proprioception and control of it propagates at lightspeed.
  ```

  - u/phylogenik:
    ```
    So that’s effectively counteracting surface-earth gravity for a 15kg object? If the brick is destroyed, do I lose the ability forever, or can I control the previously-brick particles? Do I have to apply a uniform force to all of them, if the latter, or can I specify rules for them to follow? (e.g. apply a force toward something so they coalesce)?

    Besides the usual reverse-engineering, I’d say collaborating with public and private space agencies to launch small satellites could easily net me a few billion over a decade or two, now that the tyranny of the rocket equation has been locally crippled.
    ```

    - u/fish312:
      ```
      Hmm, didn't really think about the consequences of destroying the brick. I was originally going to say it loses anomalous properties (but that seems limiting), so instead i'll say it retains its original properties, the thrust of each smaller piece is scaled by its mass to give the same 50m/s^2 acceleration as before, and you're able to direct each piece individually limited only by your multitasking abilities, (think of it like tracking the balls in a game of pool, so you could probably direct multiple brick shards in their own general direction, but you wouldn't be able to make a floating sculpture from a brick dust cloud)
      ```

  - u/Solonarv:
    ```
    What happens if the brick is destroyed?

     - Do I get to bond with a new brick
     - Do I now control the pieces of the brick (if yes, how much can I break it apart before that stops working?)
     - Or am I just screwed?
    ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    > This ability has no range limits, although your proprioception and control of it propagates at lightspeed.

    You have a superweapon the likes of which the world has never seen. Maybe. I need a physicist on this.

    Send the brick into space, where there is no air resistance and so you can accelerate it to whatever speed you wish, subject only to the laws of relativity (which I don't really understand). 50m/s^2 of acceleration, constantly applied, will let you get to about 1/10th the speed of light in a week. With enough time, I think you can slam the brick at near lightspeeds into things you want to destroy, like satellites, space stations. Maybe even Earth cities.
    ```

    - u/Sonderjye:
      ```
      Without through education in atmospherical physics I imagine that the brick would burn up in the atmosphere if you propelled it with any meaningful speed from space to anywhere on earth.
      ```

      - u/Ascendant_Mind_01:
        ```
        If it’s moving fast enough the ball of super heated plasma that used to be a brick will still be incredibly destructive.
        ```

        - u/Sonderjye:
          ```
          Based on what we know I have no particular reason to treat a rock falling through the atmosphere differently than any other asteroid and most of those burn up before hitting ground.

          - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
            ```
            It's all in the speed. If it moves fast enough, the fact that it gets utterly disintegrated won't matter.

      Assuming your calculations are extremely precise enough to hit a specific part of the Earth as it rotates and revolves around the sun.  you will definitely want a computer and whatever programs Nasa uses, as well as a communication device attached to the brick so it can give you feedback and you can adjust it to be more precise.
      ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    Thought of a more benevolent use of the flying brick: cleaning up space debris.

    Cleaning up space debris using non-supernatural methods is hellishly expensive. You would need tons of fuel to reach every piece of debris one by one. In contrast, your flying brick takes no fuel to move, and light pushes are often enough to send orbiting space debris back down to Earth.
    ```

- u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
  ```
  **4) How would you munchkin your powers around a flying brick?**

  * You telepathically control an ordinary sized, hollowed out clay brick that is trapped inside your abdominal cavity. (Your organs are fine, and the brick was sterilized before insertion.)
  * It weighs a little over 3kg, and is as durable as a typical well made fired brick.
  * You weigh a little over 75kg
  * With a thought, you can command the brick to accelerate in any direction.
  * You are instinctively aware of the brick's position relative to yourself. Mainly because you can feel it moving around inside you.
  * It can generate thrust to continuously accelerate (itself) at up to 50m/s\^2 in any direction, but is otherwise subject to normal physics. (So it will achieve much lower velocities since it has to drag your body around.)
  * This ability only works while the brick is inside your body, and your proprioception and control of it propagates at lightspeed.

  *hey this is fun!*

  **3) How would you munchkin your powers in a flying brick?**

  - You are trapped inside an ordinary sized, hollowed out clay brick and have been shrunk to an appropriate size.  
  - It weighs a little over 3kg, and is as durable as a typical well made fired brick.  
  - You weigh a little over 75kg
  - With a thought, someone else can command the brick to accelerate in any direction.  
  - You are instinctively aware of the brick's owner's position relative to yourself (and the brick).  
  - You can move freely in the hollow area of the brick to unbalance the controller's control (they cannot anticipate your actions)
  - Being shrunk, you have powers commensurate with being a human that has been shrunk ("super" strength, very dense). All the major downsides of being shrunk (e.g. not being able to breathe or speak) are silently accounted for. 

  *sorry i couldn't resist*
  ```

  - u/Sonderjye:
    ```
    You start reevaluating the life choices that brought you to this point, while praying to your diety of choice that whoever is controlling the brick doesn't do something that'll end up with you dead, such as throwing the brick into the sun, achieving light speed by accelerating in empty space, or use you are a meteorite.

    I would imagine though that you could easily break as soon as the brick is in the air. You weight 75 kgs and can multiply that pressure by making a jump, and I doubt that the structural integrity of one (presumably thin since the brick is hollow) can withstand the heavy weight on the small surface your feel touches. Just make sure you're not too far up into the air.
    ```

  - u/fish312:
    ```
    I'm not sure how porous a brick is, but I'd imagine it'll be similar to being trapped in a room with no door and no windows. So I guess I'll suffocate slowly and painfully.

    If the brick is being externally steered as a single unit (which it was in my example), moment of inertia is basically ignored, so shifting the center of gravity doesn't matter.
    ```

- u/Silver_Swift:
  ```
  A powerful angel just imprisoned a demon inside your body. 

  You feed off the demons powers, making you functionally immortal: you stay young forever and cannot die expect through deliberate suicide. The demon is trapped inside its prison and cannot interact with the outside world except on the first 24 hours of every year, when the demon gets control of your sense of hearing and sight, making you see or hear anything it wants you to.

  The demon works by HPMOR!Sorting Hat rules, it's as smart as you are and knows everything you know, but it hates your guts and want nothing more than getting you to commit suicide or, if that is not achievable, make your eternal life as miserable as possible. 

  It cannot trick you into believing that what you're seeing is real as your other senses are still working normally, but it can drag up anything you secretly feel guilty about, make you relive memories you'd rather forget (and even subtly tweak them if it wants to) or it can just play into your insecurities and try to talk you into believing that you are a terrible human being. 

  It is November 31st, so you have one month before your first encounter with the demon, how do you prepare?
  ```

  - u/Veedrac:
    ```
    First I make sure I understand how this interacts with timezones.
    ```

  - u/Sonderjye:
    ```
    Well, one thing you really wants (and honestly always want) is to build a strong support network. Since the biggest threat to you is committing suicide and mental health issues, you want people in your life who can assure you that you are a valuable human being. That being said my second defence would be to find a way of not being able to hear the demon on those 24 hours. 

    &#x200B;

    Option 1: I start looking for a doctor who are willing to drug me senseless on the first day of the year. 

    &#x200B;

    Option 2: How does the functional immortal work? Does it involve regeneration? Can you deliberately stap your eyes out/blow your eardrums, thus blocking the demons ability to talk to you, and then regrow them later?

    &#x200B;

    Optioin 3: Humans have up towards 21 senses. Start depriving yourself of sight and hearing and train yourself to pay attention to your other senses. Then do a 24 hour experience that overstimulates your other senses, making it easier for you to ignore the other senses.
    ```

    - u/GeneralExtension:
      ```
      Option 1 sounds like it can be bypassed if you can get appropriate dugs - if you understand your limits (and they exceed normal human limits), then you can probably survive drugs at doses that would kill (most\*) humans.

      \*I'd note that if there's one demon then there could be more, but there are already recorded cases of people who can survive ridiculous amounts of drugs.
      ```

      - u/fish312:
        ```
        Well there's such a thing as a medically induced coma, hook you up to an IV and a respirator and you can stay unconscious but alive for weeks if need be.
        ```

  - u/fish312:
    ```
    > make you relive memories you'd rather forget (and even subtly tweak them if it wants to)

    Does this affect your own future recollection of said memory, or just that one instance? Because if it's the former, the only sane option is enough GA to knock you out completely. 

    Failing that, in all likelihood you won't even be *you* anymore by the end of the 24 hours.
    ```

  - u/m0le:
    ```
    Build what is essentially a time lock safe into my flat so I can't be tricked into leaving. All comms are cut off at the door (no wiring at all and the walls are a Faraday cage).

    Then look for ways to incapacitate myself for 24 hours. Too long for a sleep, even chemically assisted, without supervision. Plus if I'm functionally immortal I assume it's from demon magic bs, so he could negate or not the effects of the drugs (under fatal threshold = "accidental exposure", demon removes drugs. Over fatal threshold that I've chosen to take, deliberate suicide, demon doesn't interfere, death).

    I think I'd just tough it out - I'm already plenty good at living with my memories, thanks, and am stubborn enough that an external influence has much less chance of getting me to kill myself by acting rather than just waiting.
    ```

    - u/LeifCarrotson:
      ```
      Agreed, mostly - I wouldn't trust myself to be unable to use the contents of my house to kill myself, even if I was locked inside. Having never experienced the demon's persuasive powers, or the tricks they might use (would I want to kill myself to end some torment? Or would he fool me into thinking my steak knife was my toothbrush? Either one is dangerous...) I can't be sure.  Facing the prospect of functional immortality,  I would not leave that up to chance.

      I do have to assume that I would subsequently be able to survive whatever memories of the day would be remaining. 

      I would lock myself in a room/vault so no one could come in and unlock me, clamped down to a gurney with padded, sturdy restraints, put my head in a helmet, and set a timer for 24 (maybe 30-36, to give some reaction time?) hours, after which the restraints would unlock.

      One thing I would NOT do would be to check into a mental health facility. Yeah, they're really good at keeping people from committing suicide, but I have zero trust they'd let me out after the episode was over.
      ```

        "Can you keep me in and safe for 24 hours then let me out?"

        ...Why 24 hours?

        "Oh, the demon that makes me immortal only has that long once a year to fuck with me, hahaha."

        ...yes, nurse, the extra long sleeves I think...
        ```

  - u/turtleswamp:
    ```
    My fist thought is to just pull a couple consecutive all nighters in the days prior to try and sleep though as much of demon day as I can. If i'm unconscious for most of it and what I am conscious for feels enough like a crazy dream I imagine that'll blunt the worst of the impact.

    &#x200B;

    A bit more munchkiney though, how specific is the suicide rule? Am I vulnerable to only self inflicted harm or to specific things people use to commit suicide, and how indirect does it have to be before it stops counting as self inflicted? Do i suffer injuries but just always recover or am I immune to damage? Can i just have somone else tape a plastic bag over my head until I pass out then remove it once the allotted time has passed?

    &#x200B;

    If the bag thing works I imagine that I can get somone to do it provided I can demonstrate i'm actually immortal which i have a whole month to experiment with and work up to an efficient demonstration.

    First thing that comes to mind is taking note of the parachute-tattoo and unlocking skin magic. Then, saving the first-cowardice girl and convincing her to help you grind some basic fighting (and maybe throwing, with rocks on the ground) skills so you're not *completely* helpless.

    Not sure how blood and bone magic would work, but maybe try to mess around with zombie bones for a boost, and get Amaryllis to explain blood magic for a quick cantrip.

    I'm a been lurking on this subreddit a while, but this actually my first time posting here. Mostly I've delurked since I find this scenario interesting.


    **Also this whole post is pretty much a giant spoiler for the serial up to the latest chapter**


    The only non-excluded OP combo in the there that we know of for sure is the recently revealed still + soul magic so that would be what I would go for. I'm mostly just going through the book, but there really isn't that much about mechanics and the world(at least that I remember) to really diverge.


    **The rough roadmap would probably look like this:**


    Get through tutorial with maximum possible MEN but keep a few points for other requirements of various magics.


    Going into the desert town is mostly a waste of time. Convince Amaryliss to skip it if you can, otherwise go through as quickly as possible avoiding confrontation with the gold mage (should be doable, maybe), if you can't avoid it abandon Amaryliss for now.


    Uniqities didn't contact you until late in the story, but it is implied that they would be approachable under right conditions. Use them to get to Atheneum of Sound and Silence as soon as possible.


    Next you need the soul magic. It is somewhat reasonable to assume that as with spirit magic(also get this while you are there anyway), you can unlock it in Library. This part hinges on getting hold of Raven and getting her to take you there. Then convincing her(or the other librarians) to show you enough Library magic to unlock it (which shouldn't be a problem).


    Get good enough with soul magic to do the sacrifice. Raise Spirit high enough to get rid of the level problem. Raise as many skills as high as possible. 


    Enlist Bethel to help you steal the artifact preventing sleeping.
    Raise Still magic to 100 and other magics as high as possible with what you have left. 
    Rob them blind.


    Use your temporary OP powers to level as quickly as possible so you are not helpless if you fall unconcious.


    Game Over, mostly.



    **Problems I see with this:**


    * The physical attribute was needed in the Tutorial but could you get by with blood magic instead. Could you convince Amaryliss to show it to you as you met her?


    * Can you avoid Harold if you go soon enough? If not, you would be toast. You could leave it for after Library, but you would not be able to kill the antimemetic monster(you could just run for it though).


    * Do we know how to contact Raven? Could we find out?


    * This really needs cooperation of other people, you will probably need points in SOC.


    * ROB would most likely not appreciate cheesing it.



    *Optional Extras that should'nt take too long and should help if you can¨t get long enough with minimal combat:*


    * Unlock all of the magics that do not have onerous requirements.


    * Gold Magic - this seems really good and the problem here is not unlocking it but getting to keep it. For our purposes, you can get enough gold for the first few motnhs, after which it mostly doesn't matter. You will either have completely OP powers which will make getting enough gold until you win trivial or you will be dead. And that's assumimg that the meta stilling doesn't work on the gold counter.


    * Velocity magic - the obvious solution would be to drop down the Boundless Pit and teleport away after you get it. The fall wouldn't take that long and the Pit is deep enough. I honestly can't tell how survivable that speed at low level would be though.

  Would you rather be able to at will accelerate your thoughts and perceptions of the world by 50% (i.e ”mental processes”) or the speed with which you and parts of your body move (i.e. ”physical processes”), with no accompanying change to the other in either case? Assume that all changes are purely biological, with no supernatural tomfoolery — to the extent that there exists natural human variation in these abilities, your muscle fibers, neurons, etc. have been subtly altered to result in the above speed-up. Mental processes here would entail things like processing visual information (incl. reading) and contemplation, and would effectively provide you with 50% more subjective experience, but the world around you (incl. e.g. people talking) would appear as if to move 33% slower; physical processes could include things like running (so your so-so 6 min mile would become a very impressive ~4 min mile, excluding the effect terrain deformation or whatever has on running speed), digestion, and recovery from injury, but not e.g. the “mental” components of sleep, though you may feel more “physically” refreshed on less. However, this turbo boost may require a period of adjustment, as your current sense of coordination has been tuned to moving at slower speeds. Required secondary powers would also be in effect (e.g. moving faster means generating more force, so you might also be a bit stronger, insofar as needed).

  Having chosen an option, what would you do with it?

  And alternatively, if you had to choose an option to *permanently* apply to yourself, which would you choose? If any at all.
  ```

  - u/Norseman2:
    ```
    Mental processes easily. Most activities that I do are mentally-limited, not physically limited. Reading, typing, writing, thinking, etc. Additionally, for physical processes, actual muscle strength/speed is not my limiting factor; heat is. The faster I run, the faster I'll overheat, so any added muscle/speed would allow me to maybe sprint faster over short distances, but over long-distances I'd still be limited by heat.

    With faster mental processes, I'd probably switch to a job which (relatively) minimizes social and physical aspects while maximizing use of enhanced mental ability, like software development, aerospace engineering, etc. and use faster mental speed to complete projects faster than anyone else would be able to in order to get paid 'rockstar' salaries. Or potentially just start making indie games.
    ```

  - u/fish312:
    ```
    I'd pick "physical processes", because I assume "mental processes" is *always* on and affecting my perception of time, and I don't live an interesting enough life to tolerate a 50% longer workday or 50% slower meetings.

    Well that's depressing.

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    Important question: Does this age you?

    If I choose 50% physical speed, does that effectively cost me a third of my remaining lifespan? 

    Since the power is apparently purely biological, I would suspect that this is the case.

    The question then becomes, what's the limiting factor on your age? Check your family records, if they suffer from things like heart disease, then your limiting factor is likely physical. If they suffer from things like Alzheimer's, then it's mental. Choose the power that doesn't cut short your lifespan.
    ```

  - u/Sonderjye:
    ```
    My guts goes towards the mental speed improvement but honestly I'd be worried that conversations with regular people would become even more tedious than they already are, so I'm not sure it's worth it. If the mental improvement allowed me to solve problems I couldn't previously solve it would be different but it only allows me to solve problems that I already could solve, just with 1/3 less time spent. 

    Physical speed does have the advantage of increasing metabolism so I can eat more delicious food.

    If I could turn it on and off at will I'd definitely pick mental speed.
