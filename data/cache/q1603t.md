## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I've just started book 4 of [Alexandra Quick](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle), which is basically a completely independent (and canon complaint*) Potterverse story set in the USA starting around 2006. It follows the eponymous Alexandra Quick, who's the muggle-raised daughter of a "dark lord" and her adventures in wizarding America. In general, the summary of "a darker take on Harry Potter's world" isn't wrong, and although it doesn't descend into gratuitous tragedy, it takes elements that JKR glossed over and takes them to their logical conclusions (eg magical slavery, implications of mind magic, human sacrifice, etc). 

  It's fantastic. 

  In fact, it's so good, that the storytelling, worldbuilding, and basically everything put it firmly in the "fanfiction that is better than the source material" bookshelf. There's also a lot of it--as of writing this review, 5 full 200-300k word books. Where in original HP many of the worldbuilding elements felt like they were created because the author thought it would be "witchy" if everyone drank pumpkin juice and rode on brooms, the worldbuilding in AQ expands in all directions, up to and including, actually making sense. 

  Even better, there is a [professional quality audio book version of all 5 books available](https://www.samgabrielvo.com/) online and for free. The production quality is as good or better than what you'd expect from audible, and it's *free*. Sam Gabriel, who makes them, is truly a gift to the internet. 

  All that said though, I don't think that this series will be popular with the traditional /r/rational crowd because the main character is persistently an absolute blockhead. She's a rational character in the sense that her decisions are logical conclusions of her psyche and her decision making process is clear, yet they are consistently *bad* decisions. Its almost like *Worm*, in fact, except the bad decisions aren't influenced by alien parasites, just by an extremely hotheaded psychological profile. Book three *really* made me want to reach into the book and imbue some sense into AQ. That said though, excepting for AQ's psychological hangups, she's actually smart, good at problem solving, and clever. 

  So YMMV.

    +1 to the rec. The series is great, the only caveat is getting past the first book. 

    > I don't think that this series will be popular with the traditional [/r/rational](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational) crowd because the main character is persistently an absolute blockhead.

    The series has been recommended a bunch of times here actually. It's well received. 

    Alexandra may not be a prototypical rat!fic protagonist, but her mistakes follow naturally from well established character flaws. The writing is great that way. Also, I remember being a teenager; I would never in a million years complain that a teenage character was acting **too** stupidly and impulsively and short-sightedly.
    ```

  - u/Anderkent:

    +1 - AQ was a good series if you can get over how unlikeable the MC initially is.
    ```

  - u/Dent7777:
    ```
    +1 to the Rec. There's a ton of content written so far, and it's almost all quality.

    The first book was solid I my estimation, and the only complaint I have abt the fic is that Alexandra Quick suffers from a bit of protagonist syndrome, where her backstory is relevant and famous setting-wide, where she's unusually capable, where she always seems to find herself at the center of grand events in the fic universe. It makes for a fun plot but isn't unique or trope-breaking in that regard.

  Started reading [Mark of the Fool: A Progression Fantasy](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41618/mark-of-the-fool-a-progression-fantasy) this week; I think I saw it mentioned on here a time or two, though using the terrible Reddit search function only revealed [an enthusiastic recommendation](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/mlq6y7/my_review_of_the_mark_of_the_fool_youd_be_a_fool/) from several months ago that sparked a debate about whether the OP was a shill and/or if it was worth recommending a work with (at the time) only 17k words and a handful of chapters out. Well I sunk my teeth into it, and 46 chapters in, it's *really* enjoyable. There are around 150 chapters out right now, so there's plenty to keep you occupied. The writing quality is very high for a RR story, and there's a good mixture of action and incremental progress that keeps things fresh. The few complaints I have is that the author uses chapter cliffhangers constantly, and that the characters' dialogue seems to slip casual sayings in that seem out of place in a fantasy setting (for example there's been no discussion of hell yet, but the protagonist will say things like "Aw, HELL no!"). But yeah, unless something changes later on, the writing is solid and the pacing is good. I'm giving it a recommendation.

  A more lukewarm recommendation is for [The Isekai Police (aka "Earth's Advocates")](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/42012/the-isekai-police-aka-earths-advocates), which I [reviewed a while back](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ocgwr9/rt_wip_dst_earths_advocatesthe_isekai_police_when/). The first book finished a few weeks ago, so I got around to finishing up the last score of chapters. The story itself isn't too bad, and there was an interesting mystery in finding out what was going on with the setting, but ultimately it didn't make much of an impression on me. It's not bad, but I had the feeling that the author is fairly new to writing and had a decent concept but failed to expand it into a great one. It's one of those stories I feel like the author could rewrite in a few years to make much more robust and interesting. As for now, he plans on writing the second book after he takes a break to work on a pet project which is an isekai where the protagonist is transported to a world where NTR/cheating is the baseline. I... don't think I'll read that one. I may read the second book when it is finished though. Again, not a bad story, but not one that stands out to me. 

  In other news, I went back to see if more of [Dungeon Crawler Carl](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29358/dungeon-crawler-carl-book-5-the-hunting-grounds) had been posted, and... nope. There have been no new chapters since July. The author is still active on Twitter, and I saw some tweets about chapters on Patreon, but I fear that the free releases on RR are over and done with. Which is too bad, because the story is a really good, funny, and dark litRPG. But the first few books aren't available any longer either unless you buy them (I read them thanks to an Amazon Kindle trial), and I have a hunch that the author has moved to having chapters exclusively for Patrons who pay to read. Which I completely understand - the author deserves compensation for his work - but it does mean I probably won't be reading it any longer. I'd still recommend the series if you're fine with paying to access it, though. The writing is great and the characters are very entertaining.

    Just as a follow-up to my original post, I caught up to the current chapters in Mark of the Fool. It remains solid throughout, though it's very much a slooooow progression fantasy with action taking much more of a back seat. I feel like there's maybe 1-2 action chapters for every 4-5 non-action chapters. There remains a lot of good hooks, however, and I've had my guesses about the plot proven wrong several times - which is a very pleasant surprise. Some random musings, and warnings about spoilers:

    * I really enjoy that the story starts as a generic-seeming plot where the young protagonist is roped into becoming one of the "legendary heroes," but the weakest one, in a fight against the recurring big bad evil villain... and then when he skedaddles, he finds most people in the wider world look at what he feels like is a world-ending event in the same way we might think of hearing about a brutal dictator in a far-off country. To the protagonist, this is a HUGE DEAL. But to everyone else, it has practically no effect or impact on them - because it basically is just a localized natural disaster. Sucks for Thameland, but everyone considers them a backwater country half a world away. The juxtaposition of how Alex internally has psyched up the Ravener/The Mark of the Fool, and the reality of how>! his cabal/Baelin !<react upon learning the truth is really darn accurate to how people think about things. It doesn't affect them, it's not part of their cultural upbringing... so it's too bad for Thameland and Alex, but, eh, everyone has problems.
    * And having Alex >!reveal the truth to Baelin !<was SO REFRESHING. So many stories have characters hold the idiot ball by not telling the authorities the truth for really contrived reasons. I worried this would be the same as Alex dithers for quite some time, but I was pleasantly surprised to see a character actually do the sane and logical thing rather than hide things until they blow up in his face, just for dramatic tension. 
    * I totally thought >!Minervus was the mana vampire. I thought his change of personality when he shows up at Shale's meant that he had been killed and replaced by the monster!<, and there would be an arc when someone points out he's much nicer and a better team player now, and that's how he gets revealed. I figured the decrepit-looking bakery across the street was the base of operations. >!His murder caught me completely by surprise, but the smart way Alex utilized the mana vampire to power his golem was really creative, cruel, and a great execution of Chekov's Gun from the original discussion about powering golems!<.
    * I'm eagerly waiting to see some other potential plot hooks pay off. >!The rustling in the bushes that gets mentioned a few times; the weird vibes/reactions Selina gives off (though it's likely just her adjusting to knowing she has fire-aligned mana); the broken down bakery; learning whoever summoned the demon during the protest; finding out who sabotaged the lightning rods used in the golem at Shale's (I thought it was Minervus, but I guess not?); what the other several creatures the Ravener sent out have been doing, as well as the one that identified where Alex was. !<There's a lot more still coming. 
    * I don't usually like perspective change chapters that much, but I would really like a chapter or two about what the other Heroes are up to, or what the Ravener/his creatures have been doing. I know the story will get back to that eventually, as it's kind of Alex's central conflict; but for now I feel like a lot is happening in the background and we hardly ever get news of it. A perspective shift every once in a while would do a lot to remind readers that events are progressing elsewhere, rather than them just popping up if the narrative demands it at some point. It's not really a complaint, just a desire. 

    So yeah, I give the story a hearty recommendation, with the caveat that it does get bogged down in the progression at times.

    Edit: an alternate perspective chapter literally came out today. Jeez... Freaky coincidence!

    Oh hey, that's my story! (Isekai Police) Thanks for the review!

    It's literally the first book I've ever written, so I'm glad I was able to make any impression at all. I've taken a bunch of advice on how it can be improved and actually do plan to rewrite it in the future. Here's hoping in the meantime, book 2 is much more interesting!

    Also, as for the... other story I was planning out, the premise is also that the main character is a decent person who wants nothing to do with the setting, and how he works to avoid it and break the zeitgeist of the World with the tropey leveling system it gave him. Also, 0 smut or actual NTR. It's supposed to embody the feeling you get when you're browsing for a decent story, but keep running into that kind of trash instead. But yeah, even hearing the words is enough to make anyone run for the hills, apparently even me! So I don't blame you for wanting to avoid that.

    In fact, what's funny is that just writing *about* those kinds of things skeeved me out a ton, so I'll probably put it on the backburner for the time being.

    I'm 15 chapters in and enjoying it a lot! I read the first two volumes of the Youjo Senki manga and wasn't entertained enough to keep going, but this story manages to nail everything that I liked about it while being more fun in all other respects. Everyone is likable, the worldbuilding is impressively well thought-out, and the comical misunderstandings are warmly funny in a way that leaves both sides looking like good people. Thank you!

  Watched and enjoyed [The Legend of Hei](https://myanimelist.net/anime/40211/Luo_Xiao_Hei_Zhan_Ji_Movie) this weekend. Certainly not 'rational' but a plenty enjoyable romp nevertheless, hitting pleasant story beats with fluidly animated fight scenes (reminded me of the Shimazaki fight in Mob Psycho 100) and interesting worldbuilding. Some good slice-of-life-y moments in there too! Would recommend to fans of fantasy who are fine with animated works. From the MAL synopsis:

  >Luo Xiaohei is a young monster who normally takes the form of a small black cat. Living freely in the forests, gradual deforestation and human development force him to flee and find a new home. Wandering the city streets, the black cat struggles to survive until he encounters Feng Xi, a fellow monster who takes Xiaohei to an isolated island inhabited by a small group of monsters. Excited to find what he thinks is his new home, Xiaohei lives with the monsters for only a short time before Wuxian, a human Guild Executor, arrives on the island in pursuit of Feng Xi.

  >Feng Xi and his companions manage to teleport off the island, leaving Xiaohei and Wuxian alone. Though Xiaohei refuses to cooperate with the man who attacked his friends, Wuxian forces the black cat to travel to the Guild along with him. Embarking on an uncertain journey, Xiaohei is exposed to a new perspective on the relations between humans and monsters in a rapidly changing world.

  [Dark Legend of Potter: Crimson Demons Awaken](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dark-legend-of-potter-crimson-demons-awaken-konosuba-x-harry-potter.958832/#post-78082070) is the Harry Potter crossover fic you didn't know you needed. 

  In the mid 1980's, Petunia and Vernon Dursley are asked to adopt Lily and James's child... Megumin Potter.

  It's just as insane as you'd imagine, but pretty much everything is played straight; the characters from both Harry Potter and Konosuba act more or less the way they would in canon.

  Much like [My Hero School Adventure is All Wrong, as Expected](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/my-hero-school-adventure-is-all-wrong-as-expected-bnha-x-oregairu.697066/#post-52178275), this story is something of a blended crossover; Megumin is the main character, of course, but other characters from Konosuba are inserted into the world fairly seamlessly (Wiz runs a shop in Kockturn Alley, for example). The different magic systems also interact in interesting ways, eventually leading to a bored chuuni thirteen year old applying a five line aria to a basic charm. 

  I think it'll also appeal to the sort of r/rational reader who enjoys metatextual, genre savvy characters - because that's exactly what being chuuni is. Megumin has an (actually canon) habit of rattling off potential plotlines whenever exposed to a new character or turn of events, which means that in Harry Potter-world she immediately exposes pretty much everyone's secret plots. Not that she realizes, given that she also isn't good at reading people and doesn't have a particularly long attention span.

  New royal road story's that i think deserve attention

  [Rigged](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46766/rigged)
  Classic dystopian tower climb litrpg except the main character is diabetic and is running out of insulin. Goes into a lot of detail around the main characters thought processes and dealing with incredibly difficult situations. Its slow paced in the sense that there's not a huge amount of action, especially considering its a litrpg tower climb. I already adore it, very much my type of thing. Taking an absurd and interesting scenario then just putting a random bloke into it - while trying to maintain realism. 180 Pages so far, with update every day i believe.

  [Superworld](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/44658/superworld)
  Young adult drama comedy, set in a superhero world. Very standard you'd think, it's not quite a subversion more of a homage just done better. Characters are distinct and the dialogue is a treat to read, it's also very funny in a way that shows the author has a very good grasp writing funny scenes without relying on wackiness. Not quite rational, but definitely has a lot of elements that are similar and/or enjoyable to this community. Also some big ol mysteries bumping about and the first book is done.

    I'm enjoying Rigged as well. The protagonist is smart and cautious, and for very good reasons. I don't think it's a bad thing, but I find it remarkable that the stats are d20-based. The \[Trial\] must have been somewhat influenced by D&D / Pathfinder.

      Thirding Rigged. Slow paced and introspective, but it's really refreshing to see a guy who doesn't immediately go sociopath/ munchkin. The main conflict is low stakes compared to a lot of dungeon crawl/ Isekai/ litrpgs (MC trying to stay alive given his diabetes), but honestly enjoying it for that because of how personal it feels.

  I watched *Squid Game* this weekend. It was enjoyable, and a surprisingly rational movie, but definitely worth a watch.

  **Major spoilers below**

  The Good: 

  * The characters. I loved the characters and how they were developed. The actors really did a great job. The three leads were great, but I thought Kang Sae-byeok (the North Korean defector) was especially good. You either loved them or loved to hate them.

  * The sets/costumes. They were really beautifully designed. The mostly mute masked minions, the players in their tracksuits, the sets. It all just looked great.

  * The games. Usually "death games" have some convoluted rules where you have to figure out the trick to win. Here's it's just simple kids games, just one a timer and with instant death if you lose. Having simple rules and a clear goal worked out much better IMO.

  * The main story. While it's very much about wealth disparity (the whole game is for the amusement of rich VIPs), it's also about how far people will go in order to win in life. Do you obey the rules and play fair, or cheat if an easier option is presented? Do you act for the greater good of the group, or only in your own self-interest?

  * The marbles. >!Such a simple game, but we get so much from it.!<

  * The MC's development. >!He wins and is just disgusted with being rich after what he had to do to get it.!< I didn't like >!leaving the kid in the orhanage alone for a year, which was kinda a dick move, but I'm glad he remembered and respected his friend's last wish, and helped the old lady.!<

  * The meeting at the end. >!The MC seeing his friend and making that final bet on if people can be good was a nice touch.!< It was a nice bit of closure.

  The bad: 

  * The "VIPs" were, to me, not just pointless but a disappointment, especially after their build-up. Their dialogue was absolutely terrible. It sounded like someone who isn't familiar with English but heard a few jokes and knows a bit about the US came up with them. The actual concept (bored, conceited, obnoxious rich people betting on the game), isn't bad, it was just badly executed. >!Also, there was only ~6 of them, and of that four were American. I was expecting something like Batman's Court of Owls.

  * The detective's story. >!It was interesting at first, but it didn't really go anywhere. At the end I got the feeling that the movie just uses him to show off the Front Man and what goes on behind the scenes of the game. The whole point was to find out what happened to his brother, and we learn that he won a game and became the Front Man, but not why.!<

  * The red >!haircut. It was just god awful. I don't know if there's supposed to be some special significance to the red hair, I get that it's about the MC letting go of his burdens and becoming a new man, I feel like a normal haircut would have been fine and not looked ridiculous.!<

  * The plane >!ending. It felt tacked on. The MC has finally got his life back together and decides at the last minute to throw it away because of his anger/moral outrage. I feel like it would have been much better if he had seen the guy playing red card/blue card, then called his daughter to say he's coming to see her.!< It felt like a step back, and out of tone with the character development.

  - u/Nnaelo:

    I keep getting surprised by how much hype this show gets. The death game genre isn't new, and I can think of at least a couple manga/anime of that type that have done a better job at being rational than *Squid Game* did, and/or just plain better. It couldn't hold my interest beyond the Tug Of War game >!(the detective stumbling his way through an infiltration somehow killed it for me)!< but I'm halfway tempted to go back and watch the rest of it if just to try and figure out why it's so successful.
    ```

  - u/Tibn:
    ```
    Anti-recommend on my part. The show seems as if it was written so that every game except the last would have a semi-obvious exploit but then the writers decided that none of the characters would use them for the last few games, making a lot of the intended to be emotional moments more frustrating than anything else. 

    >!(i.e. according to the rules both players could easily win the marble game by playing something like a ttrpg where it’s literally impossible for any player to lose then trade their marbles, the participants of the glass panel game could have simply had the guy behind them hold onto them or make a rope to hold onto them as they kicked or moved to the panel in front of them or just walk/roll across the beams in the middle of the bridge.)!< 

    The central mystery the show builds up to also had a ridiculously stupid resolution with how it's revealed that >!the death game operates as a horse race with six viewers who inexplicably inconspicuously contribute hundreds of millions of dollars in resources to for a scheduled event they don't even watch the majority of.!< 

    The main twist was also more tedious than anything else with how the only things the twist character ever did seemingly only existed to be strongly indicative of the twist. The ending confrontation was also something you would expect to see in a satire of the genre with how the villain’s scheme for proving that people care about things for what they provide them was >!to make a bet about nobody helping a random homeless man who was coincidentally visibly dying of exposure outside his window that he would have immediately lost if the mc decided to call an ambulance.!< 

    What makes the ending even more baffling is that the show seemed to be building up to making a point about how the revealed preferences of the vast majority of people indicate they value frivolous entertainment over the lives of other people by a large margin and how moral norms and intuitions usually only exist and extend in relation to maintaining small coalitions in the context of adversarial games but never did outside of that one scene.

      ```
      While there are definitely parts of the series that I didn't care for, I feel like you're being a tad unfair with "in hindsight..." here, and making assumptions that don't apply. 

      For the marbles >!I have no idea what TTRPG you're talking about, and know next to nothing about TTRPGs in general. Why would a bunch of middle-aged/elder people know about it? Or come up with something complicated within the time limit? Hindsight is always 20/20, but in the moment it's significantly less.!<

      For the bridge >!you're saying that the players should put themselves at risk and waste time to save others. With the exception of the MC or maybe the North Korean girl, none of them would do that. There was even the glass factory worker who let others die when he had the knowledge to save them. Plus, where would they even get rope? Tying their clothes together wouldn't cut it, and the rules were clear: you had to step on a panel to cross. The Front Man even turned off the lights to keep the players from seeing the difference between he tempered glass and normal glass. More likely, if anyone tried to find an alternative solution they would be immediately shot. !<

      There are also more than six >!viewers. They said that they were watching the game and betting online, and these were the ones who wanted to see the end in person. I agree that the VIPs could be better done, but it was explained that this was the last game for the founder/001, and he was the one giving his money away. I'm not sure where you get "hundreds of millions of dollars in resources" - it was an expensive set up, but didn't look that expensive.!<

      Also, the prize is >!₩45.6 billion, which is "only" about $38 million USD! Which is a lot, but not unfeasible for someone to accumulate.!<

      For the end, I think you're missing that the two are >!betting on human nature to confirm their view. It would negate the MC's argument that people can be good if he interfered and didn't let the stranger help. When people make a bet and one of them interfere to change the results, they lose the bet.!<
      ```

    - u/Honest_Abe40:
      ```
      Regarding the glass, your objections aren’t really that strong. >! What do you mean by holding on to each other? The panels are way too far apart for that. And what would they even make rope out of, especially in a 20 min. time limit? Not to mention they’re literally incentivized to kill each other, most of the people there want the others to die so they can get the most money. It would be *irrational* for a greedy person to save the others unless they need each other for survival. So maybe the first few would want the rope, but the rest wouldn’t give a shit. And sure, if you want to be clever and risk the game runners shooting you for breaking the rules, you can try walking on the bars. !<

        Your spoilers are a bit messed up, but yeah, there was a guy on the bridge >!who could have saved everyone by telling which glass was tempered or not, but chose to let them die instead. Then the Front Man also turned off the lights to make sure the players fall.!<

        I don't know what the >!marbles thing is either, I don't think TTRPG are all that popular so whatever the solution is, it's fair to say it's not one a random group could have figured out.!<

  I've done self-promos here before, but it's been a few months so I'm due for another.

  [Displacement](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40641/displacement) is a high fantasy isekai, with a sapphic lead character and a smattering of politics, linguistics, and medieval science. Lately the narrative has started incorporating more overtly rational & analytical behaviours on the part of the MC, though she doesn't ever reach the 'cold logic' level of rationalism sometimes seen here -- the characters are very much fallible humans.

    Displacement is great, but you never explained the olives.

      They weren’t explained, exactly, but they were pulled into the story in [Chapter 29 part 2](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40641/displacement/chapter/739921/ch-29-p2).

  I've been reading Raymond St. Elmo's [The Blood Tartan](https://www.amazon.com/Blood-Tartan-Quest-Five-Clans-ebook/dp/B073XSWBW5). It's about a burglar-assassin with a love of romance getting swindled in a contract, then trying to survive. It also has vampires, and elves, and talking animals and snake-women. Or maybe they're all delusions of the protagonist. Hard to tell. 

  It's really entertaining, if not rational. Unreliable narrator, but funny monologue that doesn't get boring. For example: 
  >Ah. Rayne. Gray. Me. The Seraph. Was in the casket. But I wasn't. I promise you I was not. I was here in the crowd. I knew it for a fact. People kept stepping on my bare feet. There is no more powerful reply to doubts of self-existence, than to have booted idiots tread your toes. Ouch, ergo sum.

  If you're in the mood for a nice industrial-revolution era adventure with a hint of magic(?), and a fun entertaining protagonist, then give it a try. 

  As for requests, anything with a philosophical bent on Royalroad? Something a bit like [God of Eyes](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26818/god-of-eyes).

  Naomi Novik just released the last graduate. 

  And it is good. It also some insights that could have been more or less lifted straight from the sequences, and then rewritten to be a whole lot more digestible. Not going to name them for spoiler reasons. 

  Warning: Middle book of trilogy, and the end point is brutal as all heck.

    Hm. A Deadly Education was very, very YA - haven't read book two but this series is a -rec from me, the character is like two shades away from Ebony Dark’ness Dementia Raven Way and it makes it hard to land an impact. (and I say that as a great fan of Uprooted / Spinning Silver)

      Her character development from book one sticks, so she is somewhat less angsty in this one if that helps. 

      Note. "Somewhat less". Not "Sunshine and Rainbows".

  Does anyone have a good solution for listing all the books you've read in a publicly linkable way?

  - u/onestojan:

    For a public profile of what I've read I use [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/).

    For niche web fiction I use [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) (with a [zapier](https://zapier.com/) auto backup to a Google sheet). You may also try [Notion](https://www.notion.so/).

  It just restarted airing, so I'm going to recommend the [Mushoku Tensei](https://myanimelist.net/anime/39535/Mushoku_Tensei__Isekai_Ittara_Honki_Dasu) anime. Very high-quality production. Fair warning-- the main character is indisputably a dirtbag... But he's not *unrepentantly* a dirtbag, which I find rather salvages the work. Though YMMV, since Rudy is definitely a very controversial character.

    >  the main character is indisputably a dirtbag... But he's not unrepentantly a dirtbag

    I can't really see what you mean by that when the entire story can be summed up as "lolicon gets transmigrated to pedophile heaven and lives out a power fantasy". 

    Let's sum it up and see: Rudy, a man in his late 30's and an unabashed lolicon(read: pedophile) NEET is reincarnated as a baby with all his memories intact. His "repentant" arc consists of him as a guy in his 40's seducing 2 girls he "grows up" with, one starting at 5yo, the other at ~10yo, to the point they worship him... and then eventually marrying them. Sounds like the textbook definition of grooming, no?

    His third wife is his own age for a change... except she is fated to look like a prepubescent girl for the rest of her life because her magical race doesn't age past puberty. Doesn't that sound like the perfect loophole for a pedophile, a veritable dream girl for people with that unfortunate affliction? Here's the answer: Rudy ends up making a shrine for her stolen panties and a religion around worshiping her. The patron saint of pedophiles? 

    As one can see, **it is not subtle in its proclivities**. I guess I can kind of understand something like this being a niche product that people consume surreptitiously, but its mainstream success baffles me. Recommending it here with a straight face baffles me.

    [Here is a longer thread about the LN](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/lydnqw/d_friday_open_thread/gptoo6f/) from a few months ago. Sorry for retreading old ground. And to be clear, I'm not a moral crusader against this kind of shit or anything, I'll leave that to other people. I just feel obligated when it intrudes on this subreddit, a place I value.

    I broadly enjoyed the first cour, but found all the weird pedophilic pervy stuff to be wholly unnecessary -- as in, you could cut it out entirely and not lose much if any understanding of the characters and plot. Like, I'm fine with some ecchi / fanservice, if not to full 'man of culture' levels, and have largely been desensitized to sexual assault from 'pervy' characters, but still.
    ```

  - u/TacticalTable:
    ```
    Something that really helped me with Mushoku Tensei was that the author _knows_ that the protagonist is a dirtbag. There are so many anime/manga/lns where the main character is a shit and the author thinks that's just his right. Rudy does shitty things, and things go shitty for him, and he eventually learns from it. Really some great character development, because it's rare a story can start a protagonist from so low.
