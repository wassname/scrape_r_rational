## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  So I've been trying to write a rational *Where's Waldo?* with Odlaw as the villain-protagonist. The essential dynamic that I'm going for is that Odlaw is an agent of chaos and Waldo is an agent of the status quo.

  In *some* places this works well, because Waldo as a hero is essentially reactive and attempting to right things that have gone wrong. But I'm having trouble with some of the Waldo canon that contradicts this theme. For example, in [My Left Fang](http://waldo.wikia.com/wiki/My_Left_Fang), Waldo is trying to help a young vampire grow up to be human instead, which is easy to reframe as morally ambiguous if not outright evil, but doesn't fit in with the narrative of Waldo as maintainer of the status quo. For another example, in [It's a Gruel, Gruel World](http://waldo.wikia.com/wiki/It%27s_A_Gruel,_Gruel_World), it appears as though the curse that Waldo is trying to lift has been in place for a fairly long time.

  Any thoughts on how to deal with the more troublesome parts of Waldo canon? The reframe doesn't have to be charitable at all, because it's through Odlaw's eyes. Ideally if there are additions to canon, they're as natural as possible.

      It's a shaky, teetering canon, like a house of cards that's going to come tumbling down if you look at it funny, but yes, there's a canon, mostly developed in the TV show but also partially in the books.

    ```
    Is Waldo immortal?  If so, the status quo he's trying to maintain could be alien to the status quo of today.  Applied to those two specific cases it would mean equality for all sentients, and high regard for natural environment or a certain past state of things, etc.
    ```

  - u/UltraRedSpectrum:
    ```
    If you abuse the canon, no one will ever know. Go nuts.

    Alternatively, rather than enforcing the status quo, Waldo could be just suppressing the supernatural in general. All in all, though, I'm sure that whatever theme you pick, something somewhere will contradict it.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      Well, *I'd* know, which is a big part of the problem. Ditching canon is easy, but I'd see it as a flaw, and that flaw would nag at me. Giving new context to canon by adding in details that were clearly never part of it is like 70% of the point of writing fanfic for me.
      ```

        Multi-layered character? Waldo tells himself that he only aims to maintain the status quo. But really... [Some secondary deeper motivation]
        ```

  - u/Anakiri:
    ```
    Does Waldo ever interfere with non-magical status quos? Maybe curses like vampirism don't count because they're "unnatural". Of course, the problem is only with magic that enforces itself and thus tries to supercede the natural order - slippery slope and all that. Magic in general is fine as long as natural people are pulling the trigger. It's just coincidence that this logic makes Waldo's extremely useful cane permissible by his own moral code.

    If Waldo does canonically interfere with mundane tyrants, it's a simple retcon to reveal some nasty persistant magic behind them.

  Alright you munchkins, I have one for you.

  In my world, there is a special material called Kunda. Were it not for magic, it would just be an overpriced building material somewhere between marble and blue plexiglass. It's very expensive to make, especially when your world's technology is roughly in the 1600s. Never the less, it's something every country can and does produce, because of its magical properties. It's the only known material that prevents people from using magic. People don't know the *how* of this, but the author does and the main characters will eventually.

  When you have a large chunk of it, say the floor of a room, then it emits a magical field that is detectable by any magician who is actively holding magic (Which they can do for a few hours every day). But if you step into the field, say by entering the room, then the field will prevent you from drawing magic (Which you need to do before you can use it), and also it will drain you of the magic you were already holding. This will take less than a second if it's a few inches thick and covers the whole floor, but with a little math you can design a floor that works more slowly/doesn't completely drain people's magic. Lastly, the material will make you feel utterly exhausted and make every action one that takes a lot of effort and concentration. Even standing. Leaving the field allows you to recover within seconds. You are not *actually* made exhausted, it just messes with your body's feedback systems. Knowing this does not let you act normally, because your body doesn't think. The energy drain effect works against non-magicians and animals. Not plants, though. Because the field does extend upwards, bugs that fly into it basically fall down and starve to death.

  If the chunk is smaller, say a pair of manacles, the effect is lesser, and would not be guaranteed to be effective. If you want to transport a magic user prisoner, you either need to put them on a big slab of the thing or make armour of it. It's more effective if you're on the edge of a big slab than surrounded by thin layers. Because magic. Prisoner transports usually just build a big heavy cell into a carriage and add an extra pair of horses.

  It's expensive to make, as I said, so there is not a lot of experimentation going on. That said, currently every country knows that every other country has:

  1) Prison cells with floor, walls and ceiling made of the stuff. Not bars or doors, though, because it's nowhere near as hard as iron

  2) Big slabs of the stuff on the floor before the throne/other locations where you want to openly prevent one side from using magic. Also even non-magicians tend to fall on their knees when taken by surprise by Kunda, and some kings like that.

  3) It's also used by snipers. As bullets. Not very frequently, however, because while the material can prevent magicians from using magic in the first place, it has no special effect against magic already in place, such as a shield, and if your target is unshielded you usually just want to blow their brains out before they notice you. For those rare times when you want to capture someone alive, though, you can try to shoot them with a few bullets to weaken them, and hope they don't commit suicide/also apply some poison to the projectile.

  But. Other than these three uses, do any ideas occur to you lot? The material has been known for centuries, and I wouldn't want to find myself with a plot hole because no character could think of obvious ideas abc.
  ```

  - u/space_fountain:
    ```
    I don't know that bullets make much sense given what you've said. You mentioned that only using handcuffs made out of the stuff doesn't work. In those conditions using it as a bullet seems totally useless.

    I also would like to point out that as stated this material is merely an equalizer. It lets you stop somebody from using magic, but if your in the field it stops you too.

    Question though, you mention it's fragile. What happens when it breaks? What happens when you grind it up? Can you embed bits of it in cement lets say or even iron to get whatever concentration you want plus strength?  

    How heavy is this stuff? If it's light enough you wouldn't see it used as a bullet, but possibly big balls of the stuff could be thrown by a canon or catapult to try to disable enemy positions. It really mostly depends on the expense. Ideally you'd want to build walls around a fort with this stuff but it sounds like it's too expensive for that.

    One potential interesting application of it is in the fact it drains magic. You could protect a much bigger room from any magic users by having a big hunk of this material at the entrance and making sure no one can get in any other way. Depending on how long it takes for people to recover their magic it might make sense to force everyone to be drained before going into high security areas.

      > What happens when you grind it up? Can you embed bits of it in cement lets say or even iron to get whatever concentration you want plus strength?

      What kind of effect would it have if powdered and drank or eaten?  What if you fed it to plants (plants used for food, plants used for textiles, plants used for timber...).  

      If it's known that it kills bugs, is it practical to use it as a pesticide? Does it kill microorganisms as well — and if so, would it be practical to use to cure infectious diseases?
      ```

      - u/Rhamni:
        ```
        > Does it kill microorganisms as well?

        ...I never gave this any thought. Crap. That said, err... No, it does not affect single celled organims because ~~reasons~~ the effect it has on animals is due to the way it messes with the body's nervous system. No nervous system, no effect.

        Also my world has no undead, so no invincible skeleton armies with magic immunity.

        >What kind of effect would it have if powdered and drank or eaten? What if you fed it to plants (plants used for food, plants used for textiles, plants used for timber...)

        In low concentrations it is so weak it can't be measured. If you cut someone up and put a baseball sized chunk in them, that would cripple them. But just making them eat or drink a little would do nothing at all. Similarly, the concentration you would get in normal clothes or wood would be too low to be effective. One method of transporting prisoners, as I said, is to basically put them in a suit of armour of the stuff.

        >If it's known that it kills bugs, is it practical to use it as a pesticide?

        No. You would need too much. You could conceivably cover the ground in it and just have furrows with earth and plants in them, but that would be ridiculously expensive.

          What's the cause of the expensiveness?  It doesn't seem to be scarcity of material, if every country on earth can produce it.  Is it something that can't be mitigated with economies of scale or the advance of technology or thaumaturgy?  (Aluminum went from difficult and expensive to cheap and ubiquitous.  Does anything prevent this from happening to kunda?)

          - u/Rhamni:
            ```
            It's the amount of work that goes into making it. You need magicians to do it, and magicians are the very wealthiest and most powerful people in society. It's slow, draining work, and you're not allowed to train extra magicians because of international treaties set down to prevent a second magical world war/apocalypse. The nobility has *all* the power, and they don't work for cheap. Some of them might make moderate amounts of it for themselves, though.

              Hard labor that can only be done by the rich and powerful?  Sounds like that would become *exceedingly* expensive indeed.  Do magicians have any incentives to create what's basically their own kryptonite besides extra money they may not actually need?

                Well, it's also *other* magicians' kryptonite. But yeah, not a lot gets made. If your House gets itself into financial trouble you might have to learn how to make it, but most never have to bother.

                  > If your House gets itself into financial trouble

                  Ooh.  So here's a loose plan:

                  1. Become local-level rich. (If a magician, make and sell kunda; if a muggle, run a casino with juuust enough kunda to make people 5% less likely to want to get up from the tables.)
                  2. Use wealth for political influence, mercantile influence, and sufficient goons to acquire and maintain a monopoly on the local kunda production/trade.  
                  3. Find a local magician susceptible to vice and corrupt them, letting them spend their fortune in your chosen casinos, bars, bordellos, whatever; 5% more likely to stick around means increased opportunity for addiction to form.
                  4. When they hit rock bottom, offer to get them cleaned up and back on their feet in return for doing just a liiiiittle work for you, since you own the kunda trade around here.  You now have a debt slave. Repeat ad libitum.
                  5. Use increased kunda production at reduced cost to become nation-level rich.
                  6. Contract with developing nations to replenish their treaty-enforced magician quota when existing magicians die or emigrate—you'll help the process along if necessary—in exchange for a portion of the proceeds of your new industry.
                  7. Train/uplift new magicians from the working class, teaching them just enough about magic to produce kunda.
                  8. Continue to increase wealth (becoming global-level rich) and plant kunda sweatshops around the world until few or no old-school magicians still remain. (This may take more than one lifetime; at some point your company is taking over this plan.)
                  9. Use wealth to control the international conversation on magicians, setting up competing memes of "worthless minimum-wage workers just above burger-flippers" vs "downtrodden human beings working under terrible conditions, with rights just like anyone else".  Make the prospect of them producing a new world war/apocalypse absurd; make the old tragedies a footnote of history. 
                  10. Use political influence to overturn the magician-quota treaties as a useless relic of a past when magicians had power.
                  11. Open up sweatshops and factories in every major city in the world - enough to make kunda an everyday commodity (with exciting, heretofore-undreamed-of new applications being discovered on a monthly basis!) and put your Sleep-Like-Magic® bedframes in every house.

                  (edit: I keep thinking 'wizard' instead of 'magician')

      > I don't know that bullets make much sense given what you've said. You mentioned that only using handcuffs made out of the stuff doesn't work. In those conditions using it as a bullet seems totally useless.

      Yeah, the bullets would never shut down magic fully. If you want to catch the mage alive, though, you may want to use the bullets just to *weaken* them a little. The strength of the effect is severely limited by the small size of a bullet/arrowpoint, but also slightly increased by being stuck *inside* the body. The effect is small but noticeable, and possibly worth it if you don't want the target dead. But yeah, as I said, it's seldom used, and even then you probably want to mix in some poison.

      >What happens when it breaks? What happens when you grind it up? Can you embed bits of it in cement lets say or even iron to get whatever concentration you want plus strength?

      Two slabs/one shattered slab piled together is as effective as one same size slab. The dust is pretty useless unless you make a huge pile of it. Mixing it with other material does work, although you will need more total Kunda (The material) to achieve the same effect the more diluted it is. You can however improve the hardness/whatever of the end product by mixing it.

      >I also would like to point out that as stated this material is merely an equalizer.

      Well, plus super exhaustion.

      >How heavy is this stuff?

      Like marble. So about three times as heavy as water. That's way lighter than most solid metals, but not 'light' really.

      >If it's light enough you wouldn't see it used as a bullet, but possibly big balls of the stuff could be thrown by a canon or catapult to try to disable enemy positions.

      I somehow didn't think of this. It's expensive, but this is absolutely something that would see occasional use, especially since you can reuse most of it as long as you take over the place. Thank you.

      >Ideally you'd want to build walls around a fort with this stuff but it sounds like it's too expensive for that.

      Way too expensive. Plus, it would be impossible to have anyone inside the wall firing cannons/using magic/patrolling within several meters of the wall. Completely unrelated, but in my world if you want to guard against magic you basically cover walls in metal, because the denser matter is, the more it resists magical attack. This is also really expensive, so countries have treaties about not destroying too much infrastructure with magic.

      >Depending on how long it takes for people to recover their magic it might make sense to force everyone to be drained before going into high security areas.

      This is a good thought, but made less necessary by my world being one in which every magician can easily probe any other to see if they are holding magic or not.
      ```

  - u/Muskworker:
    ```
    Scattered thoughts..

    Depending on what kind of magic there is - you mention its effect on magic people are holding, but how about magic that's already been cast?  If it drains magical effects, it should be used to dissipate curses, dispel disguises, and un-enchant artifacts.  If it doesn't drain magical effects, it could allow golems (or something of the sort) to cross unaffected, could be used to arm golems with quantities sufficient to disable opponents, and there may be the possibility of a counter-spell such as stamina boost to evade some of its effects.

    It sounds like this should be useful in making traps (for animals at least, if not humans).

    Can magic be used *against* it?  You can detect it with magic, but can you lift it with magic? (Say there's a trap that drops a slab of it on your head...)  Kunda projectiles can't break a magic shield, but what's the effectiveness of magic projectiles against a kunda shield?

    Would this be used to help break victims of a torture chamber/interrogation room?

    Would it be used in casinos/gambling houses to prevent people from magically gaming the games ... or should it be outlawed because its presence, which is physically draining, might encourage people to remain seated at the games longer?  How about other businesses — if low quantities of the stuff could make people even 5% less likely to move around (i.e.: leave) then any business with an unethical owner and an interest in keeping people on the premises (restaurants, bars, drug dens) might be using it.

    Could it be used in mattresses? The illusion of exhaustion being represented as allowing people to fall asleep easier, and the immediate restoration of energy on rolling out of bed being represented as an empowering start to the day...
    ```

    - u/Rhamni:
      ```
      >you mention its effect on magic people are holding, but how about magic that's already been cast?

      No special effect on such magic.

      >If it doesn't drain magical effects, it could allow golems (or something of the sort) to cross unaffected, could be used to arm golems with quantities sufficient to disable opponents,

      Sure could! Golems are a thing in my world, but only in the distant past and late into the story. When in play, they very much do make use of Kunda.

      >It sounds like this should be useful in making traps (for animals at least, if not humans).

      An excellent point I had not considered but will add to my repertoire. Too expensive for your average hunter, but I'm sure it will make sense to use somewhere.

      >Can magic be used against it? You can detect it with magic, but can you lift it with magic? (Say there's a trap that drops a slab of it on your head...) Kunda projectiles can't break a magic shield, but what's the effectiveness of magic projectiles against a kunda shield?

      Yes and yes. That said, telekinesis is a specialisation most mages can't do much with in my world, But if someone built a wall of Kunda, a mage could certainly damage it from a distance. In my world, if you want a wall that is able to resist magical attack, you have to cover it in a nice thick *expensive* layer of solid metal. Treaties heavily regulate how much damage mages are allowed to do to enemy infrastructure, city walls and such.

      >Would this be used to help break victims of a torture chamber/interrogation room?

      The victim would certainly be uncomfortable, but any rest they got would be as healthy as if it had been normal marble they were sleeping on.

      >Would it be used in casinos/gambling houses to prevent people from magically gaming the games ... or should it be outlawed because its presence, which is physically draining, might encourage people to remain seated at the games longer?

      Goodness me, I had not considered this at all. Well, firstly, a casino wouldn't be very popular if all its customers were magically tired every time they sat down to gamble. There wouldn't be any *laws* against it, but it would be bad for business. Probably the owner would jut occasionally hire a mage to sneakily probe everyone present to see if there was magic in play.

      Your point about other businesses is fantastic. I can already see I'm going to have to mention some clever bastard making their entrance and exit in different places, with the exit corridor having a little bit of Kunda mixed into it so people subconsciously don't want to go through it.

      >Could it be used in mattresses? The illusion of exhaustion being represented as allowing people to fall asleep easier, and the immediate restoration of energy on rolling out of bed being represented as an empowering start to the day...

      Well, probably not *in* the mattress, but you could put a normal mattress on a slab of the stuff. This would indeed help people fall asleep if they weren't quite tired enough without it. Too expensive for most people, but the rich and powerful might invest in this. Hm, I will definitely have to include this.

      Thank you very much!

      No permanent damage, but:

      The effect is amplified because the Kunda is touching them in all directions. Even so, size is critical. A baseball sized hunk would cripple them magically and physically until it was removed, but just forcing them to swallow a few coin sized shards/putting a few bullets in them would only weaken them somewhat.

        What are the effects long term subdermal contact? Can you essentially weight-train with these, by exposing yourself to a small amount, training until you achieve your ordinary fitness, increase exposure, retrain, etc? How would the development of the body be effected, if an amount is implanted at a young age? If the ability to do magic is something that develops alongside the growth of the body, could you permanently cripple a person's magical development with Kunda implants? Or maybe the opposite, along the lines of the previous weight training, developing their ability to use magic hyper-efficiently by training them from a young age to overcome increasing amounts of Kunda interference?
        ```

        - u/Rhamni:
          ```
          Alas, Kunda has no permanent effects. Not sure if anything much happens if you implant a (sterile) normal rock in someone, but... that.

          You can't weight train with them for extra benefit. You would feel tired, but wouldn't get any extra strength. Possibly you could train endurance/discipline from the sheer extra time spent fighting while exhausted.

          No developmental changes, magically or otherwise. Magic is all about the brain.

          *Although*... Hm. So, in my world, there is no hard limit on how much magic you can use in a day. The more you use, the more tired your brain gets (Like you're taking a really long examination/studying session), and your ability to control your magic decreases. Less control means that the magic in you is going to become more and more unruly, and do more and more damage to your body. I suppose practising while made sluggish (but not shut down) by the Kunda would allow you to practise controlling magic while exhausted without taking quite as much damage. Hm. So... magical endurance training. Yeah, that's definitely a thing now. The students are gonna hate it, and the villains are gonna have done it so much for years and years. Excellent.

            Not to nitpick, but large portions of the gains in performance associated with traditional (weight) training are neurological: the nervous system is trained to send stronger signals, ignore the feeling of exhaustion, and move the body more efficiently.

            So I suppose that if kunda is so... *precisely tuned* to the specific neurological feedback loops which are used by the motor and attention systems that you can't train to withstand kunda... that's pretty creepy.

    Is magical telepathy a thing? If not, can I broadcast coded messages to every magician nearby by having a guy run up and down a hallway with a sack of kunda dust and let them sense it? Or it may be better to twirl a kunda-doped fan or staff, to take advantage of the vertical bias by changing the horizontal cross section.

    Similarly, is magic marking a thing, or could there be a reason to bury enough kunda to sense an otherwise uninteresting location? Maybe mark the path through a maze or something, to deter muggles or as a party trick.

    Is the magic-draining effect the same if you jump on and off a kunda plate, as if you just stood on it for the same amount of time you were on it? Could you save money by forcing your victims to take a winding path that goes back and forth over a thin stripe of kunda that they could otherwise run over? Labyrinths might be useful to maximize your enemies' exposure to your limited supply, rather than always relying on one big slab. Even if the effect is weaker overall, the extra exposure time might make it worth it to disable magicians.

    Why would you make prisons with huge slabs built in? I'd expect a only a few quick-drain slabs, probably the same ones that get deployed to the field. The normal cells can have a cheaper thin bed of kunda dust under the floor, just enough to keep the prisoners from recovering their magic. Its almost as safe magically, more safe physically, and a whole lot cheaper. Granted, you're giving up most of the omnipresent mood of drained dispair, but you've got to look at the price tag on that.

    Is kunda water-soluble? If so, what concentration is needed to make the fish too lethargic to bite quite as much? The effect doesn't need to be much to wreck a fishing community. It probably takes too much to be practical, but it was worth a thought.

    On that note, how much kunda is wasted? Almost all manufacturing and sculpting of the stuff probably creates some dust, and you can't recover all of it. That'll get washed away with the rain eventually, along with any lost to weather or damage. Kunda is building up, slowly but surely, in rivers and off the coast. Is this world being set up for ecological disaster?

    Does Kunda help you fall asleep?

    Is there any use for it as a recreational substance (i.e a drug-equivalent)?  I can't think of any reason someone would want to be exhausted, but I can't think of all of the reasons people want things.  

    Can small (and cheapish?) pieces of it under doors and windows act like a bug screen in a palace?

    Can you train past magical exhaustion like you can train past mundane exhaustion?  As an example of this, I couldn't exhaust myself as much as [professional cross country ski racers do](http://www.slate.com/blogs/five_ring_circus/2014/02/10/sochi_olympics_2014_skiathlon_why_do_cross_country_skiers_always_collapse.html): I would stop skiing long before I lost the ability to stay upright.  

    You said the field extends upwards.  Is that a function of Kunda (the field is repelled by gravity or something), or else a function of it being a floor (the field propagates in all directions equally, but "up" is the only one we care about).

    Can anything block Kunda-radiation?  If so, you can build hidden traps or possibly armor.

    So basically, no curing, pickling, cooking, smoking, sugaring, or dehydrating?

    If there's civilization at all, then they're going to have a tough time of winters, or they'll be confined to latitudes where winter isn't an issue. Most food is going to have to be fresh, which means that people can't be far from their food source. That makes proper cities a lot more difficult, and trade gets significantly pared down (no spice trade, for a start).

    Food doesn't degrade at the same rate.  Honey is very stable, I believe.  I've heard miron jars prevent degradation as well, but haven't had time to look at the science behind why.

    > and in the process of preventing this seeds have to burn [their] energy much faster so can't really last much beyond 6 months

    Seeds aren't in a constant state of degradation, either.  

    You have to use magic to explain the effect you're seeking.  A worldwide curse from a past civilization, perhaps.  

    In that case, people in the north would eat like Eskimos, fishing and eating nose-to-tail everything they capture.  Humans might migrate to tundra during summer to hunt, but would leave when it grows cold.  Desert dwellers would rely on cacti and plants like aloe vera as well as insects.  The majority would reside near the equator or in temperate areas, subsisting off of seasonal fruit and perennial greens - basically anything that can grow and has bountiful, consistent harvest year round.  Fats from fruits, nuts, seeds, and fish, and though probably a delicacy, perhaps livestock or game as well.  Protein from insects.  The civilization would be very keen on preserving the environment, and would likely live close to nature.  Maybe each family has their own garden, or share several village-wide gardens.  Anything that could potentially poison plants would be avoided as an existential risk.  Might live in twisted, living trees, though that technology would be advanced.

      I have an explanation, but I didn't want to bring forward random details that weren't relevant. 

      To summarize the idea is related to my magic system in general. What if under normal conditions slight magic/physics modification is needed to let cells work. What then if you take those cells somewhere, where the native biology and the physics to support it are significantly different. Assuming that stuff can turn up the crank on it's tuning of physics than I'd posit you'd see some of the effects I talked about. Basically when things die they stop modifying  physics and suddenly the all their molecules become terrible unstable and fall apart.  This explanation isn't something I plan on sharing with the reader which is another reason I'm reluctant to mention it here. 

      > Seeds aren't in a constant state of degradation, either.

      No they aren't, but if you assume they've got cell apparatus actively maintaining the physics that allows their chemistry to be stable I think it's reasonable to say they have to use more to keep things stable in such a strange environment.

       I came to this trying to work through the implications of my magic system and in particular thinking about how to set up a world where guns, engines, and the like were impossible. Basically I was thinking about disallowing high energy densities. The problem is that humans and life in general is pretty energy dense. We can get around that with the above, but at the price of having stuff burst in to flames when it dies. I thought about this for awhile and arrived at two problems. First top soil. If everything's burning up there won't be any topsoil accumulating. I'd already decided that humanity and our plants and animals in this scenario are transplants, so the obvious solution is having native life which produces top soil sufficient for plants that we can actually eat to grow. We run into the whole energy density problem again, but I decided I was more interest in the implications of a society without much food storage at this point so just kept going. Then I ran into problem two. A lot of food we eat doesn't actually die until we cook it. Seeds exist explicitly to survive until they can grow into a plant. I decided it made sense though to give them a shorter shelf life given they have to drain energy to keep stable where normally they can basically just sit there.

          If a chemical arrangement simply isn't stable anymore that energy has to go somewhere. Maybe it wouldn't actually catch fire, I think it would depend on how closely together cells die, but I'd guess the result of basically every molecule inside a cell falling apart would be pretty close to fire. It's basically what fire does anyway.

  Is there a model of single-timeline time travel that doesn't allow outcome pumps?

  I'm not really sure if this is a good question to ask, but I'll try to explain. First and foremost, time travel is purely fictional and as such there are many competing models of how it works. I'm looking for one with certain properties.

  It should be a single fixed timeline, with all changes to the past already accounted for and woven into history. Paradoxes are impossible, retroactively if need be. The trouble is, the way this is normally written, you can "steer" probability away from certain outcomes just by pre-committing to trigger a paradox if you encounter those outcomes.

  So, if you really want tomorrow to be a sunny day, you can vow that you will go back in time and kill your parents before you were born (or some more mundane paradox, like stealing the keys to the time machine before you can use it), and as long as you have the determination to follow through on that vow... you won't have to, because it'll be sunny.

  That's funny, but it doesn't make much intuitive sense. There's no causality there. No amount of weather scientists examining the data will explain why that day was sunny. Even if they know you have a time machine, *you never actually used it* so clearly you can't be blamed. It seems like cheating, affecting the past without actually using your time machine. And from a writer's perspective, it completely defeats the point of having a single fixed timeline, which was to stop worrying about how the actions of alternate selves impact history.

  Now, it's also said that if you try to do something paradoxical anyway, the universe will conspire against making that paradox happen. If you try to kill your grandfather before your parents are born, your time machine will break down or your gun will jam or you'll learn that you were adopted and the man you killed wasn't your real grandfather. I'd like a model where that happens when you try to change the future in a way that it can't be changed. If tomorrow is sunny, it was going to be sunny anyway. If it's not sunny, you can't trigger a paradox to undo it, because your gun will jam or something.

  What I'm struggling with is: how do you distinguish between events that are part of a time loop and can be affected by it, and events that can't and will find some other way to resolve a paradox if you try to change them?
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    In a single fixed timeline, everything is part of the timeline and there's no distinction between past and future. You can no more change future events than you can change past events. It's not a matter of certain things being "inside" or "outside" the loop, because there is no loop - or if there *is* a loop, then everything is inside it. The primary difficulty of the single timeline model is that it can feel incredibly arbitrary; things happen because that's how things happen, whether it's in the past or the future.

    Incidentally, I think "the timeline conspires to stop paradox" is the wrong way of looking at it. Instead, pretend that you've got a chess game. Generate all possible game logs, including those with illegal moves. Then, strip out all the game logs with illegal moves. What you're left with, no matter which game you watch being played, will be a result that stays within the confines of the rules, *not* because there's some authority enforcing those rules, but because you're only looking at the legal games. The timeline isn't conspiring to stop anyone, the timeline is simply free of paradoxes, and if it weren't, it wouldn't be the timeline.
    ```

    - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
      ```
      In HPMOR, the remaining timelines, on my model, tended to be those where events occurred that discouraged various people from using Time Turners as Outcome Pumps.
      ```

    - u/Chronophilia:
      ```
      But there's more to it than that. Single timelines still have a notion of probability.

      Taking your chess example, you generate all possible game logs and then remove the ones containing illegal moves. Then the "real" timeline is chosen in some way from the remaining possibilities. Is it chosen in an evenly-distributed random manner? Or could there be some bias involved, for example to favour games that end quickly?

      You could also generate a game of chess by having each player take turns making a random legal move. Is there some simple way you could bias the probabilities such that this random chess game has a similar sort of distribution to the "generate all possible games and then choose among them" model?
      ```

      - u/ayrvin:
        ```
        You can, but I feel like it tends to be a bad idea, because the people who attempt to bias probabilities dying of a heart attack seems like it might be a higher probability timeline.

        - u/Chronophilia:
          ```
          No, in that sentence I was using "you" to mean "the author/worldbuilder". Is there a law of physics I could add to my story that would balance the probabilities appropriately? So that people can use time travel to travel through time, but can't use it to bias probabilities of things they can't directly affect?
          ```

          - u/alexanderwales:
            ```
            There's not really a law of physics that you can add (that I know of). The chess analogy is flawed, because in chess players can't get into illegal game states through completely legal moves.

            How I deal with it in *Timewise Tales* is "slippage", so that if you try to do something like that, you end up failing because you'll come in "off course" in either time or space. This explains nothing about how timelines get chosen, but it is a handy device for preventing characters from paradox.

            -----

            This part is probably not of much interest to you, so I've separated it.

            > You could also generate a game of chess by having each player take turns making a random legal move. Is there some simple way you could bias the probabilities such that this random chess game has a similar sort of distribution to the "generate all possible games and then choose among them" model?

            Well, we need a better analogy. Let's say we add in another few rules to chess:

            1. On your turn, you can bring in a duplicate of any piece at any position that doesn't already contain a piece. This replaces your normal turn.
            2. On your turn, you can remove any of your pieces from the game. This replaces your normal turn.
            3. At the end of the game, all pieces put into play by rule 1 must be accounted for as pieces removed by rule 2, and vice versa.

            So you can see that in a lot of cases, we're going to end up with illegal games (via rule 3) through a series of perfectly legal moves. With this new game of temporal chess we're playing, you can't actually know whether your game is legal or not until the end of the game, not unless both players are ignoring the extra rules. (I've actually tried playing chess with these rules, and it's a complete clusterfuck that ends in illegal games pretty much all the time.)

            **If you adopt these new rules and try to make a game *randomly*, the vast majority of games are going to end up illegal, even though the individual moves are legal.** This is the problem that you're facing and the reason that randomly generating legal moves in sequence doesn't work as an analogy.
            ```

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    If you trigger a paradox, it doesn't just drain probability out of the case where there wasn't a sunny day, it drains some relatively lesser amount of probability out of the case where you decided that you would trigger a paradox if it wasn't a sunny day. Any timeline where the future is full of people trying to abuse paradoxes for their gain is going to be almost completely drained of probability, and so your story is most likely to be about a timeline that rarely came close to paradox.

    That, you see, is the Great Filter.

    Not necessarily. There are a number of ways in which the paradox can refuse to happen.

    - Your time machine may misfire, sending you to the wrong place or time.
    - Your gun might jam
    - You might have a heart attack
    - Your mother's marital fidelity left something to be desired, and the man you shoot is not (biologically) your father.

    So. Let us assume that the universe simply eliminates all paradoxical results from the timeline; the remaining non-paradoxical results are then expanded to fill all the probabiity space.

    Let us say that your odds of dying due to a heart attack or other similarly unstoppable cause (tomorrow) are one in ten thousand (before considering the effects of paradox). Let us imagine that the odds of tomorrow being sunny are one in ten. Normally, these events are uncorrelated; the odds of you dying in a heart attack *and* the day being sunny are one in a hundred thousand; the odds of you dying of a heart attack *and* the day being cloudy are nine in a hundred thousand; the odds of you living through tomorrow *and* the day being cloudy are 89991 in a hundred thousand; and the odds of you living through a sunny day tomorrow are 9999 in a hundred thousand.

    For simplicity, let us ignore all other resolutions of the paradox - either the day is sunny, or you die, or there is a paradox. Now, the paradox happens in the "day is cloudy, but you live" timeline - the 89991 in a hundred thousand chance. Those 89991 possible futures don't exist, due to paradox.

    Which means that only 10009 possible futures exist. There are 9999 chances of a sunny day that you live through; one chance of a sunny day that you don't live through; and nine chances of a heart attack on a cloudy day.

    In other words, an outcome pump designed to produce an event with a one-in-ten chance of naturally occurring *multiplies your odds of sudden death by ten times*. Trying to outcome pump your way into winning the lottery is a more likely suicide than jumping off a cliff would be.

    --------------

    So, this doesn't explicitly *disallow* outcome pumps, but it gives a very, very good reason not to use them.

        Hmmm. Options:

        - Paradoxes remain possible (this runs counter to one of the rules defined in your original post)
        - Paradoxes are impossible, but the non-paradoxical results are not *evenly* distributed across the probability space

        The first option I will ignore. As to the second - if the non-paradoxical results are not evenly spread across the probability space, then this implies that there is some sort of consistent bias to the universe's paradox resolution. The exact nature of that bias could of course be anything... but it needs to be a bias that makes sense on a particle scale (so a simple bias towards increased - or decreased - lethality seems unlikely)

    There are models of timetravel where any action that would cause a paradox instead causes you to explode, phase out of existence, or go crazy.

    Even if outcome pumps are possible, there's still the probability of your protagonist existing to consider. They shouldn't end up being the sort of person who causes extremely unlikely things to happen all the time, because that would be unlikely.

    Outcome pumps are dependent on your ability to reliably influence the future. There's a sweet spot in between "change can't possibly cause a sunny day at this point, so time travel has to be effectively impossible or there would be paradoxes everywhere" and "chance conspires to immediately kill you in some unexpected way if you even *think* about causing a paradox."

    This does not fit your model, but it might point you one useful direction.

The protagonist realized it could not always have happened that way because a sample was taken from the knife--eventually there would be no more knife!

    I saw abruptly that this was a form of entropy, and that in any scenario where some timelines are "before" and some are "after" this type of entropy should exist.

    Now think of a paradoxical timeline not as a unit but as a cascade of outcome-shifting timelines, and you can see that such a cascade is unstable--entropy continues to increase.  Eventually the increase will either break the chain or end existence completely.
