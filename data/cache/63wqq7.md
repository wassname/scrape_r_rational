  A short but clever exploration of uncountably infinite sets. I found it a thoroughly enjoyable read, and was surprised to find that apparently it had not been posted to /r/rational (or anywhere else, for that matter).

  Thoughts?

  Where are the Crab and Achilles, though? Or maybe some of Rudy Rucker's Fuzzweed?

    Clearly the dust the old man uses is the undissolved form of the Tortoise's popping-tonic. Being undiluted, its efficacy is infinitely greater, thereby allowing escape from the infinite dream-tower.

  What's the difference between transfinite and infinite?
  ```

    In normal usage, there is no difference--both are used to describe a quantity that is greater than any finite quantity. The reason "transfinite" exists as a word is because [Georg Cantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor) wanted to distinguish his "infinite" cardinals from something he called the "[Absolute Infinite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_Infinite)": a quantity so large, it exceeds the size of every other transfinite cardinal. Note that this is a philosophical concept, not a mathematical one; set theorists don't talk about "Absolute Infinity" as a mathematical object, and in fact there are several paradoxes that would be caused by the existence of such an object, implying that it is self-contradictory and hence *cannot* exist. Despite this, however, the word "transfinite" stuck, and now it and "infinite" are used more or less interchangeably, at least in mathematical circles.

    **EDIT:** I forgot to mention that the Absolute Infinite actually appears in-story as the titular pancake. This, then, is the reason you're not allowed to ask what's beneath the pancake: technically, it shouldn't even *exist*. (Why does it exist, then? Only Scott Aaronson knows for sure. Maybe it's because dreams don't always make sense--or maybe the old man was lying.)

  "Ah, but what if we augment ZFC with axioms that allow quantification over proper classes?"

  "Please, just jump off the edge of the tortoise," said the old man.
