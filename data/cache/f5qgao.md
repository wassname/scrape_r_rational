  Dude totally faked his death.  What better way to avoid dangerous situations as an immortal than to let everyone think you're dead and run around under a more generic identity?

  An interesting read, but I'm surprised to see nothing about Liches.

      There are so few we might as well quote them: 

      > Although undead can also potentially continue existing in perpetuity, they are not considered real immortals. The same goes for spirits and other creatures that naturally don’t age.

      That seems like mortal bias. It also means that all the 'immortals' are victim to the weakness from the second paragraph: 

      > No method allows one to be completely invulnerable or be free of weaknesses, so getting killed is always a danger.

      Four of the immortal 11 are either deceased or likely deceased. Had they chosen a path to immortality that made them undead liches, at least 3 of the 4 would likely sill be 'alive'. In particular, #10, Sakelus, died to a gunshot. Any form of immortality that leaves you vulnerable to gunshots sounds pretty weak. #11 was assasinated, so maybe they would have destroyed his phylactery, though we don't know the details of phylacterys or why a lich wouldn't drop the phylactery in some unmappable section of deep ocean where it couldn't be destroyed.

      If I was able to become immortal, being a lich doesn't sound all bad.
      ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        When a lich is discorporeated its soul returns to the phylactery, which implies they need some kind of preparation at that location to be able to return from there. Zorian spent a brief period as a discorporeated soul and the process nearly killed him outright, so unless being a lich also shores up the weaknesses of the soul we can assume they can't just wander around until they find something to posess.

        Especially seeing as Quatach Ichl only had to do the unbreakable metallic skeleton bit when he was fighting or trying to intimidate someone. So you don't even have to worry about it affecting your social life.

          The author responded to the comment at https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2018/03/24/magic-users-of-pre-ikosian-altazia/comment-page-2/#comment-15889 without disputing the line:

          > Since going Lich would involve losing taste and the other physical sensations...

          which is a weak implicit confirmation that going lich does have some pretty steep drawbacks. 

          But WoG at 
          https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2016/08/07/golems-and-undead/#comment-48 does provide a pretty hearty endorsement of the lich path: 

          > There are no magical/power drawbacks to being a lich no. And yes, most necromancers wish they could become one eventually. It’s just very hard.

          I found some more discussion of the pros and cons of lich-hood at https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2016/12/13/basics-of-magic-mana/#comment-223.

        Bear in mind that anyone who realises you're a lich will automatically assume that you've tortured and murdered a whole bunch of people to get to the point where you were capable of that (and they're probably right), so the Triumvirate Church and most governments will want to summarily execute you.

        A bit more in the comments. The workings of vampires are explained there, for example.

        Ultimately, undeath not being "true" immortality boils down, I think, to two factors: first, the gods said so and second, undead can't procreate i.e. can't give birth to new souls in this world.
        ```

        - u/Nimelennar:
          ```
          I think it's more that with undeath, there's nothing biological going on, where with "true immortality," you're still in a living, biological body, but you've stopped the process of aging.
          ```

          - u/vallar57:
            ```
            Yes, that's the exact criteria as described here. I attempted to explain *why* the criteria is such instead.

- u/PhilanthropAtheist:
  ```
  Just the story alone of the inheritor 20 is good enough for a strong novel. It's unfortunate that they weren't able to be part of Zach and Zorian's Saga. Especially the Alchemist Immortal in Falkrinea could have been a strong boon in their studies.
