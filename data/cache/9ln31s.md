## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  On a bunch of these past posts I've been asking for tips and people to talk to, to help deal with my severe depression. I'd just like to update you all and say that for the first time in a while that things are looking up.

  I am on a new medicinal regiment after taking a genomic sequence and it's really helped me out. Turns out I don't produce L-methylfolate, which was causing long term drop off in effectiveness on my meds. 

  I've been keeping up with a 5 day a week fitness program and have been able to delve into some hobbies that I had become apathetic about.

  I just wanted to thank you all so much for being such a supportive community. I really appreciate you guys so much and I don't know how to express how much your replies have meant to me.

    Did you have any indications or symptoms that genomic sequencing would give you useful answers or was it more of a shot in the dark?
    ```

    - u/SkyTroupe:
      ```
      I started a full time job in August and that had me switch health plans. My new psychiatrist likes to do the sequencing whenever it is covered by someone's insurance policy, especially if they have a history of failed medications.

        What kind of genome sequencing was it?  Was it like 23andme or something?

        I'm also thinking of doing genome sequencing for a similar reason.

  This is a weird place for me to bring this up, but I have been having an *amazing* time with tantric meditation.

  I have a sort of mental script running that s/woo/sensation/; for example, "touch the sacral median and feel your second chakra" becomes "touch the spot between your tail bone and lower back and feel what happens in your pelvis". In other words, although I really don't buy any of the theories or explanations for the sensations, the sensations are *amazing* and I'm really digging the exercises.

  Overall my body, emotions, and energy levels are *massively* improved, and there's a bunch of neat life advice to be gleaned. Ex: I've had golfer's elbow pretty bad for the last month or so, and after each meditation session I notice a marked improvement in the pain/stiffness/etc.

  The core meditation pattern is to focus as absolutely and intensely as you can on [THING] - in the woo explanation, shoving energy in - and then relax and invert your focus, receiving/listening/feeling - in the woo explanation, accepting the energy being emitted. This feels like a really good pattern for life; oscillate between a balanced and reciprocal attention and reception.

  Part of the idea is also, apparently, to get to know your sense of attention the same way movement yoga helps you to get to know your muscles/bones/etc.

  Anyway! It's been really neat and full of information for me.

    Sounds very interesting. How long have you been practicing?
    Can you recommend some sources to try this kind of meditation?

      Three weeks now, one a week? I've irregularly done meditation on my own before over the years, and taken other classes (or taken a class that involved meditation, like a lot of yoga does).

      I'll ask the teach what she recommends and get back to you.

        Thanks!


        I've been trying some meditation (alone, without a teacher - I read some of the book The Mind Illuminated, and tried the techniques described there), and found it surprisingly useful. after a session, I did feel noticeably more calm and focused.

        I also found it difficult... Sitting even for a relatively short time without doing anything but focusing on my breathing proved harder than I thought.

        In general, I really don't like all the spiritual talk around it. In the back of my mind, I wonder if it is all just an elaborate placebo (I also think about it during a session - which is very distracting...)

        I read a lot of people on the internet (yes, I know, a very reliable source) talking about new mind states they reached during meditation (see, for example r/streamentry), and I can't help but thinking that this doesn't strike me as a reasonable outcome, and is most likely just imagination.


        I've tried searching for serious research on the topic - but there's so many articles that  I can't decide what is true anymore...

  I can see why people like PGtE so much. I'm only partway into book 3, but it's quite a fun story. I definitely need more Dread Emperor Traitorous quotes in my life.

    Traitorous is best Dread Emperor.

  - u/GeneralExtension:
    ```
    One of the factions (and some of the emperors) remind me of Megamind. For instance "*Have you seen how gorgeous these boots are?* "

    I'm currently co-DMing a tabletop ropleplay game set in the PGtE verse. The other DM really wanted to have Traitorous and/or Irritant as a the final boss of the campaign and I was like __*NO*__.

  If you're stumped for Winter Solstice gifts, try [modular polyhedral origami](https://files.catbox.moe/sxv8gm.jpg). It's [cheap](https://www.google.com/search?q=post-it+notes), [easy](http://www.britishorigami.info/learn-to-fold/valley-mountain-folds), and exactly as [modest](https://files.catbox.moe/mlk9ey.jpg) or [impressive](https://files.catbox.moe/2mb5pp.jpg) as you want it to be.

  I recommend [the cuboctahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboctahedron), comprising twelve of the very simplest modules, as a starting point.

  How would the Gundam Universal Century timeline differ if the spaceships shown on the show, [built along airplane and boat lines of "thrust pushes the vessel forward"](https://canmom.tumblr.com/post/172819083352/which-way-up-is-your-spaceship-a-history), were replaced with spaceships built along skyscraper lines of "thrust pushes the vessel upward" as seen in The Expanse and other shows?

    Can't help you with the second, in the same boat.

    Beat Saber is the killer app for me (lightsaber DDR). Superhot is also great (Jason Bourne Simulator).

      Seconding Beat Saber. I also hear good things about Superhot.

    I freakin loved HoloPoint, and I hear Budget Cuts is finally out. "Accounting", I think it was called, is a fantastic one-shot.
    ```

    Skyrim was interesting. More for mods. This requires a lot of time investment though. VR mod compatibility is worse than normal.

    Super hot was fun.

    I've enjoyed project cars and distance.

    Pretty much any flying game is fun.

    Space pirate trainer was fun though I'm not sure if this is because I tended to switch back and forth with others while playing it.

    Honey Select is nice if you want something NSFW.
