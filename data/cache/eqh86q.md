  Fallacies are often framed as things *others* do, so there's a tendency of fallacy labels to be misused as attacks. Biases are framed as things *we* do. I love how each bias here is phrased with *we* or *our*, reminding the reader that they are not immune and that the tools of rationality should be used for self-improvement.

    Naive realism is my problem, but I'm reasonably sure most people are pretty dumb though lol
