## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I just read [On Cultivating a Chosen One by Christopher Baxter](https://baen.com/cultivating-chosen-one) and thought people here might enjoy it. 

  Brief summary: a history professor specializing in previous Heroes of Prophecy uses his knowledge to try to create the right conditions for the Dark Lord to be overthrown. 

  Cleverly written with an intelligent protagonist trying to understand and manipulate his world's rules, and (technically a spoiler but unlikely to surprise anyone familiar with the genre) >!a similarly smart antagonist working against him!< . It's a self-contained 5500 word short story so it won't take you too long to read.

    I also enjoyed [The Wizard's Granddaughter](https://writerinthehat.com/the-wizards-granddaughter/) by the same author.

    This was pretty good.

  So *Cyberpunk Edgerunners* was another awe-inspiring, very Studio Trigger show with genuinely spectacular animation and spectacle. Although I really enjoyed it, it made me want something that was the exact opposite, as a palate cleanser. I want to find a story where:

  * The powerful people are looking out for the little guy.
  * There are a lot of happy endings.
  * There are lots of career opportunities to meaningfully improve the world.
  * Being poor doesn't condemn you to dying after a car accident.

  So really, a story that's generally happy and where problems happen in spite of our protagonists living in a society that tends to take good care of people.

    I've only read a bit of it, but [Quill and Still](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/58065/quill-still-sophie-nadash-and-the-quite-nice-very) is, according to a beta reader of it, intended to be what you describe. A scientist from Earth transmigrates to a society that's built for the good of all. It's not perfect and there's still problems to be solved, but it feels... comfy. 

    &#x200B;

    Also seconding your opinion that Edgerunners is very good. It felt... refreshing, in a way.

      I tried Quill and Still and could not get into it.
      ```

    - u/thebastardbrasta:
      ```
      For me, at least, the show combined a very "pure" sense of catharsis with a sense of finality. So you both have this sense of getting to put this awful thing behind you as lovable characters keep dying, and getting to share David's feeling of having made the most out of your one chance at life.
      ```

    - u/PastafarianGames:
      ```
      Am the author, can confirm. Shem isn't perfect, and the village of Kibosh isn't perfect, but it's a story that tries to be cozy and comfy, and where the problems that arise do so despite a society structured to deliver a good life to everyone and empower everyone to be their most actualized selves.

    The third book in Naomi Novik’s [Scholomance trilogy](https://www.goodreads.com/series/282152-the-scholomance) is coming out in a few days, and the series sounds a lot like what you described. The powerful people are brilliant, competent, and trying their level best to help the characters in Magical Boarding School survive. Happy endings, though not universal due to the high number of monster-related deaths, are fairly common among named characters and more common among the rest than you’d expect on base rates. Career opportunities abound, and one of the background messages of the series is that even the most self-centered people will, if they have the slightest bit of sanity, find some way to help others — because if you don’t help other people, how can you expect them to help you?

    Highly recommended!

      TBH I think this doesn't fit the request at all, especially this bit: "a story that's generally happy and where problems happen in spite of our protagonists living in a society that tends to take good care of people". The scholomance series is the exact opposite, with the story set in a ruthlessly brutal setting.

  [With Great Power One Must Go Further Beyond](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/with-great-power-one-must-go-further-beyond-marvel-mha-alt-power-aka-power-plus-ultra.1010628/#post-83797209) is really great - the title says it's a Marvel / MHA cross, but it's not really; the extent of the MHA stuff is that Peter Parker gets All For One instead of his normal Spiderman powers.

  Aside from that it's very reputation / base buildy (Peter runs away and joins the Morlocks, and tries to improve their situation), alongside power combination shenanigans.

  There's an NSFW version over on QQ but I have no idea what the difference is.
  ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    I read the QQ version, and while there weren't really anything sexual outside of Peter getting flustered by superpowered beautiful women, I did feel like it was tending towards a sort of harem. While that didn't bother me too much (it is a wish fulfillment story after all), it might bother some.

    I felt like I was reading Emiya Shirou more than Peter Parker, but that was a fun read.

  There was a story posted (I think) here around a year ago, describing a world where unseen aliens had stopped all violence and provided everyone with clamshells that would produce any safe object on command.

  The main focus of the story was art. The clamshells could produce any work of art of demand, including "The full X book series, plus the ones not written yet" and "a full forum discussion about a series only I know about, as if it was a popular series".

  The viewpoint character is a mother whose son was a creator. He now has no real audience or real attention in a world where everyone can get your work before you're done making it, along with the 6 major changes they would prefer, and how he deals with that.

  I'm decently sure it was someone seeing the oncoming social effects of Dall-E etc models making artwork both much easier for the average person to use and much less rewarding for many artists, and I'm kicking myself for not seeing the connection.

    The story is [The End of Creative Scarcity](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3353977/1/The-End-of-Creative-Scarcity), and the discussion was [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/l60tpe/the_end_of_creative_scarcity_c_rt/).

  It's been recommended here before but I only just got around to reading Project Hail Mary, the most recent book by Andy Weir, who did the Martian.

  It's so incredibly up this sub's alley and had me grinning like an idiot constantly. Just an awesome, relatively grounded sci-fi book.
  ```

  - u/Dent7777:
    ```
    It's a good book imo, but the main character is quite lucky. If you read it as the one universe out of thousands where everything lined up just right, it doesn't break immersion. If you read it naively, it comes off as plot armor.
    ```

  - u/MagicWeasel:
    ```
    I want to second this recommendation and put in a good word for *Artemis*, the book in between The Martian and PHM. Artemis is not as good as the other two (which are S-tier), but it's A-tier, so if you loved the other two there is no reason that you won't really enjoy Artemis. 

    (I avoided it for way too long since I heard it was bad, when it's just "very good" and not "excellent"!)
    ```

    - u/Weerdo5255:
      ```
      I'd put it in the category of something I've read once and I was good with it. 

      The Martian and Hail Mary are one's I've already gone through multiple times. 

      For Hail Mary, I really, really, have to recommend the audio-book. Without spoiling anything, one of the elements of the story comes across fantastically in audio format over just text.

  I think the [works of TimMaguire](https://forums.spacebattles.com/search/35371216/) on Spacebattles are likely to appeal to some people on this subreddit. 

  In particular I've read and enjoyed [I Only Ate The One Moon](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/i-only-ate-the-one-moon-original-sf.912963/reader/) and [Now I Rule The World](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/now-i-rule-the-world-original-supervillain-fiction.767197/). The former is complete, the latter is not.

  &#x200B;

  I don't want to spoil anything and they're written well enough that I suggest you just read the first chapter of each. If it appeals to you, the rest of the story likely will, too.

  [The Path of Ascension](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40920/the-path-of-ascension/) is pretty good. Someone recommended it here a few weeks ago. It's long, so I'm still 20 chapters shy of the latest chapter, but enjoying it so far. The writing style didn't grab me at first, but seemed to improve steadily over time. The story also becomes more about different characters with different perspectives (not *too* many of them, but enough that it's not just all about one guy). (He also doesn't form a harem, despite that being reasonably commonplace in universe for either gender -- he just isn't interested in doing that.)

  Where it really shines is worldbuilding and consequences. It's a somewhat sci-fi take on the cultivation/dungeon/RPG hybrid, in that thousands of planets (mostly not in the same actual universe as each other) can be reached through chaotic space, either directly by high end cultivators or through a transportation network for normal people.

  The protagonist goes from an unusually low powered yet determined backwater hick orphan to extremely OP in the long run / slightly OP in the short run, so he has to deal with the consequences of this in the context of there being a vast society of already OP individuals out there already. This would be implausible to survive with his freedom intact if not for the (self-interested, but not nakedly so) protection of several of the already OP individuals who have already gone to the trouble of setting up a highly progressive (yet imperfect) political/magical power structure designed to protect and nurture the up and comers with unique abilities. One of the systems they've set up for that, the titular Path of Ascension, forbids them from aiding him directly in most ways.

  He has to rely heavily on subterfuge because his backers (despite being capable of moving planets around, etc.) aren't quite omnipotent enough to protect him from everything, and are constrained by the rules from powerleveling him directly. A lot of the fights involve hiding his secret power or finding ways to use it without tipping people off.

  It also has some good transhumanist themes. Immortality is reachable for most folks (although they often lack the drive to do so in time, and the dungeons, called rifts, are a limited resource -- which bothers some characters enough to want to do something about it). Also a bit transhumanist is that one of the plot devices is a mana powered personal AI implant, which helps with battle simulations, communications, etc. (Most of it is cultivation / RPG style without much plausibly physics based technology though.)
  ```

  - u/Judah77:
    ```
    Path's writing quality went into a steep decline in later chapters/arcs.  I think I dropped it around Ch53ish.
    ```

    - u/steelong:
      ```
      There's a dip during that stretch where the author started going in a different (worse) direction, but swerved after getting some backlash.  It's a pretty long stretch, though.

      I'd say things get a bit better after that, but even then the style can only be said to be "good" when comparing to the average royal road story.

      The worldbuilding is the only area where this story stands out, but it stands out enough to keep me going.  It also helps that the author does seem to be improving in the other areas.
      ```

      - u/corneliuspudge:
        ```
        I think I might have been the original recommender and I fully agree with you. While Path has never made me drop my jaw with the story or the characters, it scratches a part of my brain I've always wanted scratched. The powers are cool. The setting is cool. Everything is quantified just enough, without making it feel like someone's attempt at a TTRPG. I don't know, it's just such a satisfying read for me.

  [Immersion](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/immersion-sword-art-online-au.103350/) \- SAO/Overlord quest. Phenomenal worldbuilding, improving on the original setting by leagues by fleshing out the story with lore. Alien AI gods and civilizations, multiverse shenanigans - Kirito no longer the sole axis Aincrad spins around.  Along the same vein of Rihaku's Simple Transaction and simulationist like Mfd.
