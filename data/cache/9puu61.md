## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You gain the ability to use Portent dice, as for a Divination Wizard in 5th edition D&D.

  At midnight each night, two random numbers between 1 and 20 pop into your head. (You can roll 2d20 yourself as long as you do it within 5 seconds of midnight.) For that 24 hour span you can replace your "natural roll," or that of someone you can see, with one of these numbers, 1 being a critical fumble and 20 a critical success. Once you use a number it vanishes, and unused numbers vanish at midnight.

  That said, it's only a d20. Getting a 20 for Portent means you can guarantee one action you take that day resulting in an outcome in the 95th percentile--you're not gonna win the lottery, but a nat 20 on your Charisma check when asking out that cute barista would probably get you a date.

  Given that it's unpredictable (some days you'll get two 12s) and that the best-case scenario is 2 chances to limit results to either the top or bottom 5%, how do you munchkin your fancy new power?
  ```

    You win the stock market every day you get a 15+ by giving yourself a 75% chance of choosing good stocks for the day on a luck roll. You don't ask for the best stocks, just stocks which will rise, which is roughly 50% of them anyway. You could become the first hedge fund manager who actually beats the market consistently by moving out of the market when you get crappy rolls.

    Furthermore, putting bad numbers on others' sense motive checks and good ones on your charisma checks means getting clients is easier. Money is the best superpower, and this one is really easy to turn into a lot of money.
    ```

    - u/fassina2:

      There's more you can do with stocks than buying but yes it works. You can do a lot of weird shit, like bet a stock will go down and if it does go down you get paid and other things.

      &#x200B;

      But yes, your method works. Seeing that this is the case I'd use FX where you can multiply your returns because of the way it works, i.e say you'd get 1000 profit on FX you'd get 100.000 because it can multiply your money, I forgot the specific word for it.

      &#x200B;

      I just thought of this, doesn't this dice only mean you make a choice at the top 95% percentile of every person on earth, so compared to experts you'd basically be at their level without their knowledge 1 every 20 days. 

      If this works based on your personal skill, you could get technically on the top 5% of the top 5% by getting all their skill and knowledge.

      But since we know that these 'experts' and hedgefund managers can't even do better than random chance most of the time, and even the times they do it can be attributed to random chance, the skill becomes less useful.

        >I just thought of this, doesn't this dice only mean you make a choice at the top 95% percentile of every person on earth, so compared to experts you'd basically be at their level without their knowledge 1 every 20 days.

        It gives you an _outcome_ in the top 5%, and most of the trading done in the stock market is being done by experts anyway. So given how much chance there is in the stock market getting a number above a 10 is going to make you outperform the market since plenty of people already outperform the market _on a specific trade_. The difference which gives you a massive advantage is that you _always_ outperform the market.
        ```

    > You can roll 2d20 yourself as long as you do it within 5 seconds of midnight

    This technically allows the use of weighted dice. Do the dice need to be fair? Are manufacturing defects that cause some numbers to be more likely than others okay? I really like this one because of how many ways there are to use it.
    ```

    - u/GeneralExtension:
      ```
      Weighted dice? Try 20 sides, with a 20 on each side.
      ```

  - u/GemOfEvan:
    ```
    The real power is that you know what you rolled. If you portent a 1, do your thing with a 1 and then do the opposite.

    Attempt to flip a coin to see if protons do decay; heads they do, tails they don't. Regardless of if you know the answer, it's a 50-50 chance. So, if your portent was 11-20, you know you flipped correct and if your portent was 1-10, you know the opposite is correct.

    Imagine a game with a clock labeled 1 through 20. In this game you must roll a d20 against some target x between 1 and 20 on the clock. You get points equal to the number of spaces you need to go clockwise around the clock to go from your roll to the target, with a direct hit being worth 20 points.

    So if the target is 5 and you rolled a 3, you get 2 points. If you rolled a 6, you get 19 points.

    Irrespective of the target, the scores will be uniformly distributed from 1-20, so your portent will equal your score. So, you can get what the target is by starting from your game roll and moving clockwise a number of spaces equal to your portent.

    Then, play the game with the target being the nth digit of some string of text you would like to know encoded in base 20.

    You can get about 8.6 bits of information with this method each day, and a kilobyte in around 3 years.
    ```

    - u/fassina2:
      ```
      Wouldn't this just make you 95% better at making predictions at a 20, but since making accurate predictions is very unlikely specially in vague terms like specific letters in a phrase, it'd amount to very little since you'd only be 95% better than wrong 99% of the time? 

      Assuming average is a low value being on the 95% percentile of that is still low, unless you have a very wide bell curve going on. An IRL example like height you'd end up around 6'3, so not very useful, 95% percentile of IQ is also nothing insane (less than 130). 

      So you can see that the effectiveness of this is not high enough to do this kind of thing.

      &#x200B;

      But I guess you could spend years and somehow get to something useful with this method..
      ```

  - u/vakusdrake:
    ```
    Well as already pointed out you can use this to get rich off the stock market. However once you've become the richest person alive you could do much more by setting up prediction markets and betting on the outcome of particular events happening. That way you can use your probability manipulation to skew pretty much all major world events in whichever direction you want which will massively add up in terms of long term influence. For instance many election come pretty close so you could swing a massive number of election by doing this.
    ```

      ```
      >For that 24 hour span you can replace your "natural roll," or that of someone you can see, with one of these numbers, 1 being a critical fumble and 20 a critical success.

      I don't think you could influence elections with this. You can effect one roll, elections are too complex for a single roll cause a visible change.

      &#x200B;

      You could make politicians stutter or trip though, so that's fun..

      &#x200B;

      PS. It's take decades to become the richest person in the world or even just billionaire using only the stock market returns, even starting with a large sum of money. Even with a hedge fund, you could maybe get a large annual bonus + salary out every year, in addition to your personal returns, but that's it.

      &#x200B;

      People rarely get rich young from stocks, business is where the 'quick money' (10 year time investment) is at.

  This time I have a power from a children's book to munchkin:

  You have the ability to "absorb" diseases and physical issues from people by playing pattycake with them and doing a specific chant about the issue you're absorbing. You can also pass those issues on to other people in a similar way. The person you're absorbing or passing on issues to must consent to playing pattycake with you and say the chant at least once, though they don't have to know what will happen. You can also recover from diseases and physical issues quicker. How do you use this power?

  (For the record, I use "physical issues" because the original story had stuff like hiccups and bloating being transferred.)
  ```

  - u/boomfarmer:
    ```
    Several thoughts: you'd be a boon for medical testing purposes, because you would be able to demonstrate the effects of a drug on a person with and without a particular disease.

    If the practice has no effect when the song mismatches the disease, with tailored songs you could be used to diagnose specific diseases for which there are no good tests.

    You'd also be able to remove complicating ailmets, allowing doctors to treat an ailment in isolation before returning the other ailments.

    But all of these require a way to store ailments, which requires a battery of healthyish patients. Enter the prison industry. Reduced sentences for time served as a diseasr battery.
    ```

  - u/vakusdrake:
    ```
    It seems like the best primary use of this ability (though it has some use in medical testing as pointed out by boomfarmer) by far is getting rich people to pay you exorbitant fees to transfer various disorders from them to people they pay to accept their conditions for them. Given the whole pattycake thing you're not really likely to be able to transfer conditions to unwilling recipients.       
    This is still the best strategy even from an altruistic standpoint since you could give most of the money to charity.

    Once your abilities become high profile enough you could probably find some terminally ill people willing to take on an arbitrary amount of potentially very bad conditions for the greater good (and in exchange for payment to their families). After you've found those willing recipients you will be able to massively step up your operations healing thousands of people per day and making staggering sums of money in the process.
    ```

  - u/Noumero:
    ```
    Do mental issues count? If so, you could find people with [pronoia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronoia_(psychology\)) or similar disorders, take the disorders off, then transfer them to business competitors, CEOs of companies you want to hijack, or politicians.

    Logistics may be a bit (read: very) tricky, but it effectively approaches mind control as long as you're able to prevent your thralls from interacting with other people too much.

    ___

    (That's aside from the obvious applications, such as diagnosing people, curing people by transferring diseases to animals (if possible) or braindead patients, transferring traumas of soldiers/athletes to less physically active people (for a payment), assassinating people, trying to set yourself up as a religious messiah, and so on. Generally speaking, I think it would create a new market with two groups of people: those who are willing to pay to get rid of injures, and those who are willing to heal off someone's injury for a payment.)
    ```

    - u/Gray_Gryphon:
      ```
      Original story had nothing to say about mental issues, but let's say they count. Though I'm not sure how you'd convince CEOs and politicians to do the chant with you. Also transferring to animals and braindead patients won't work because they have to do the chant as well, and they can't speak.

- u/Covane:
  ```
  Telekinesis is a frequent subject covered here but I wasn't able to find a previous thread that addressed this particular question: 

  Telekinesis with no real rules about what can be moved except it doesn't work on humans. It can be used as a projected force field and the field itself can be shaped, and there can be subdivisions within the field. A competent user could for example form a massive torus and accelerate the air to incredibly high temperatures. It can also be used for more simple brute force, like throwing a force field to stop a car. The fields can also be brought close together and have a fairly high upper boundary of how much pressure they can exert, perhaps as high as 100 gigapascals. I see for commercial work a common use of this ability being excavation, as it's very well suited to moving dirt and it can be used to tear stone apart, as projecting the fields has no rules other than it ignores humans. 

  How could you munchkin this power to make money in a way people don't know about? You have limited starting capital, you can probably get up to around 50K-250K in a small business loan. Detection is paramount, you can't be caught using the power and you also want to avoid being too suspicious/conspicuous. That's an arbitrary line, but I trust your judgment.
  ```

  - u/None:

    a force field that doesn't prevent a human fist?

    I assume it doesn't work around humans (or you could target their clothes)


    it looks like telekinesis can generate more energy than the human body. So turn a generator for electricity (boring)

    maybe steal money (not really a good way to make money)

    push satellites into orbit... and sell pictures... and sell your own gps... 

    look up prizes you could get with cheating (like use your power to make your robot win some DARPA challenge)

    sell people a fuel efficiency elixier/crystal/sticker and use your power to cheat at tests 

    can you make atoms/molecules react? in a macro scale? if you can make some expansive chemicals (like enzymes)

      Thank you for the input! 

      Humans can pass "harmlessly" through it, their clothes are targetable, so you could "throw" a force field at a human that would hit their clothes, and their hair if it was sufficiently long enough, and those would either hold them back or be ripped off of them, depending on the amount of force being used 

      This is for a particular character in a story I'm working on, and the character does eventually use telekinesis to move things into orbit, but I'm trying to bridge the narrative gap.

      1. Student/Young professional
      2. Telekinesis
      3. ???
      4. Profit
      5. SpaceX 

      I'm imagining they invest in/buy calls on a stock and use TK in some way to discreetly assist a company. If that fails, then they may short a company and cause them some minor issue that causes a small drop they can profit from. If all else failed they may resort to theft, but the character in question would probably sooner go semi-public with their power or go to work for the government.

        There doesn't need to be this gap, once things start rolling the growth get's exponential, you could slow it for a couple chapters (if it's a book), maybe he takes more time because he's preparing or something.

        there are those street performers that pretend to be floating 

        https://www.google.com/search?q=street+performance+floating+man

        could be a nice student job... he still can study.... (if someone is looking for tk people not so great)

        just to get enough money for rent...


        or sell magic training stones... you focus your mana in to them and they float... instead of $199,99 just $99,99 for a short period... 


        well, he could also make stuff (like clean highways or make shoes) if he can multitask 

        or make really small watches... 

        well, robot challenges should be still able to winnable through cheating

        he could just use private financed ones with a false name and a wig...

  Your superpower is forcing other people to listen to you.

  When engaged in a conversation the other party is unable to leave or to change the topic on their own accord. They are unable to ignore your arguments, and must react to them in a meaningful way. They may lie or deceive you, or even stay silent, but they must at least listen to you and consider your position.

  Lastly: this is just a subconscious reaction, but they may realize their own behavior afterwards if they reflect upon it.

  you are spiderman in a world with real physics

  your powers: 

  sticky feet and hands (through cloth and you can turn it off)

  fast reflexes (not a danger sense or precognition)

  superstrength (you can lift cars and survive some hits)


  tools:

  web shooters (including web)






  How would you fight?

  Cause I think spidey could lift stronger opponents up and keep them from getting leverage. (like the hulk) If he sticks his feet to the ground and his hands on the back of his opponent

  And groups could be webbed together (he does it sometimes but mostly he webbes only single people). he could also swing and uses the webline (or a second one) to knock them over. (not sure if I made myself clear)


  of course I want also to know how would someone be able to beat spidey

  either one of his villains... heroes he worked with... or normal people (of course their powers have to follow somewhat the laws of physics too)

    If I had to fight I guess I'd be smart, go full plate, sword, submachine gun etc. Super strength makes armor even more OP.

      Well, it depends...

      In 1980 there was much crime in New York. If I believe the interview/docu podcast I heard, that was because police would only investigate crimes if that could make it in the newspaper. (Theft under 10.000$ would be ignored)

      If that was the case in my neighbourhood and I could stop them without too much risk (cause superpowers). I would do that.


      Now there is another problem there. Police district manager whatever (chiefs?) try to keep the number of crimes low by downgrading crimes to some that wouldn't get tracked by the statistics.


      The stop and frisk(?) they do in NY is also because those searches/arrests look good in the statistics... 

      podcast: https://www.stitcher.com/s?eid=56691545&refid=asa

      but yeah, where I live I wouldn't go out fight crime, cause I wouldn't find anything. 

      But if I know a victim which the police ignores I would help them. And if then more asked for help  (via internet or flyers or a bat signal) I wouldn't be able to say no.

  The party, after a gruelling journey, has arrived at the city of Town, populated by around 10,000 people. They narrowly managed to outrun the horde of perhaps 4,000 gnolls, evil super-strong hyena-people who were hot on their tails. With perhaps 1,500 men-at-arms and the unbroken walls of the city, can the party turn the army away, or failing that, save the people from the horde?

  This is all Dungeons and Dragons 5e.

  We, the party, are 6:

  * A Wizard (Illusionist) who is sworn to harm no creature.

  * A Bard (Swords) who is the party face

  * A Warlock (Celestial) who is the primary healer

  * A [UA Artificer](https://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/1_UA_Artificer_20170109.pdf) (Alchemist) who can make items

  * A fighter (??) who can use both sword and bow

  * A pugilist, who refuses to share any information with the party.

  The town's walls are defensible, but the enemy has among their numbers 12 Hezrou, spread out throughout the horde, which are living siege engines. Seeing as the heroes are among the only people who can make a difference with regards to the oversize demons, we have been saddled with that particular responsibility. We are all **level 5** at the moment, but have acquired enough XP to move to **level 6** on a long rest. However, we have opted to explore the catacombs beneath the city to try to find a tunnel out of the city, either away from the main body of the horde, or directly underneath it. We intend to delve the catacomb again before we rest to find an area to keep the civilians, which might bring us up to **level 7**. How can we defeat 12 CR8 Hezrou, given that they are surrounded by 100s of CR1/2 gnolls each, before next morning when the gnolls will likely attack?

  Details:

  * The Wizard and Warlock both have familiars. 

  * The Artificer might be able to enchant the Fighter's weapon to deal magic damage.

  * We have found a long tunnel in the catacombs, but we don't know which direction it leads. Finding which way is goes is helpful.

  * The demons were presumably not summoned by a creature, but rather entered the world through portals (think Out of the 
  Abyss). 

  * We have potential allies - both a teleportation circle within the town might bring in a powerful hero, or a Green Dragon ally who split up with up before we got to the town. Both might be contacted with a Sending (which the Wizard does not have yet), but should not be relied on. 

  * The men-at-arms have ballistas arming the walls. These might take out one or two Hezrou on their own, but shouldn't be relied on.

  * The horde outnumbers the men-at-arms. If the wall falls, it's over.

  Ideas we've had (reveal after giving it a little thought)

  * >!Level 6: Have the Bard cast Dissonant Whispers to get the Hezrou to attack the gnolls around them - the gnolls have no ability to de-escalate and will attack the Hezrou back!<

  * >!Level 6: Have the Wizard Disguise Self/Tongues to infiltrate the gnoll camp while the bard does his thing - Disguise Self gives no save, only revealed on investigation, so could take advantage of the chaos caused by the bard to abuse pack mentality and get gnolls to attack other Hezrou!<

  * >!Level 6: Get the Fighter the Sharpshooter feat or the Warlock the Eldritch Spear invocation (Level 7) and Fly them above the camp, so they can rain down terror from above. Ideally combined with Greater Invisibility (Level 7).!<

  * >!Get the Artificer's Mechanical Servant to be a Large Eagle and use Enlarge on it to get it to carry rubble and bombard the enemy camps.!<

  * >!The pugilist has Mold Earth - teach it to the casters within the city and have them start digging escape tunnels. Alternately, make tunnels under the gnoll camp for quick collapse and exfiltration.!<
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I can only come up with marginally effective strategies.  And I'm using internet sources, so I hope it's all canon.

    &#x200B;

    I would split the party.  

    * Have the Artificer work on the ballistae; load them up with spells (like protection from evil to make them last longer in the fight) and formulae.  A tanglefoot ballista could wreck the plan of an army.  See if the villagers can make large scale alchemical fire under his guidance.
    * Have the pugilist to direct villagers to make traps with mold earth.  The illusionist can cover them later.
    * Have the bard, illusionist, and maybe warlock make the enemy's night before battle a living hell.  Start fires everywhere with prestidigitation and invisible servant.  Use acid or poison (if available on food supplies)  Use enthrall to make the enemy fight each other.  Blind hezrou or use illusions to make them stomp around.  Use loud noises and alarm spells so they don't sleep.  Smokesticks plus illusion to make them think there's an invading enemy.  Invisibility and impersonation would help a lot here.  Ask the DM for will save modifiers for sleepless gnolls, and then use enthrall again during the battle.  
    * Point out to the DM that gnolls love fighting each other and do it all the time anyways.
    * Were this another DnD, I would have the warlock counter summoning or dispelling demons, but 5e's don't have that power for reasons?
    * Weaken a section of the walls for a killing zone when it falls.  Have it prepared with alchemical fire, archers, and all sorts of nastiness.
