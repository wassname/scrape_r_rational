  These self-inserts are fun, but I always wonder why people don't just go to the Hokage (after a few checks at least). I'm reminded of Jackie Chan - "This is a job for the proper authorities."

    It's on the cards as a strong possibility. The largest problems are getting all the information across without leaving traces. Letters have scent. Messengers have short memories, which necessitates many messengers being sent to get all the information across. The more messengers, the higher the chance that a briefing will be interrupted or a detail missed leading to capture.

    The solution to the problem - as with so many things - lies with shadow clones. That, and defeating Akatsuki has a rather large risk of Pain just deciding to level Konoha before Naruto is ready to beat him up.

    Presumably to avoid T&I. I like konoha, but not that much. Canon already has a "good end" so if you fix the uchiha massacre/rebellion you're pretty much golden.

    I had a fanfic planned (now scrapped) where the SI would try to inform the homage about the uchiha massacre, but their communication got intercepted by orochimaru, who took the oportinity to grab some sharingan and become the end boss.

  I thought this was an update for Lighting Up the Dark (didn't remember the name) but turns out it's a different story with 26 chapters already. It's my lucky day!
  ```

  - u/FuguofAnotherWorld:
    ```
    Ah, Lighting up the Dark. Such a good story, shame it seems to have died. 

    Perhaps one day I might write something half as good. Ah, but at least soon I shall have my characters out and about doing missions and facing the harsh and unpredictable world. All this cheeriness and humour is the last thing I expected to write.

    Edit: Hopefully I can manage the transition without descending into grimderp.
