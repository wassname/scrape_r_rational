## [R][WIP][BST] Playing around with Doctor Who Time War ratfic: Ch1 finished; feedback? Ideas?

### Post:

For the last year I've been entertaining the idea of writing a rationalist fanfic of the Time War from Doctor Who. I was having a lot of difficulty with the worldbuilding, but thanks to some help (from 4chan/tv/ of all places), I've gotten around to taking a stab at Chapter One. It's a short thing, less than two thousand words; the tentative title is "Healer of All Wounds". **You can read it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r2ivYFvBVfpf3oh99cVb1M_Z7q_JMY2hYDR3A38ydW0/edit?usp=sharing).**

So, /r/rational, here's where you can help me out. Did you like it? Comments, complaints, critiques? Where would *you* go from here? Are there any parts of the Doctor Who universe you'd like to see explored? Any and all feedback is requested. Thanks in advance!

  Which Doctor is this going to be based around, and how much lore from either series (old and new) are you planning on using? Will I understand everything if I haven't seen the early stuff? Will I be able to follow along anyways?

  "They tried to impose their homeworld from Dronid." I think something's wrong with this sentence. I don't know what's going on here. 

  As for stuff I would like to see, in S02E03 (new series) "School Reunion," the plot revolves around the Skasis Paradigm, which is essentially a theory of everything that grants people godhood. I've always headcanoned that the Doctor first learned of this in the Time War, and things went horribly wrong when people tried to abuse it. Just a thought. 

  All that aside, so far so good. I'd read more of it.

    A modified kind of Eighth Doctor, just because he's the one in the Time War (era). Since the crash went differently, there's no War Doctor. I plan to pick and choose from the lore, since there's just so much. But no, I don't plan on leaving anything unexplained. (Even if it means introducing a companion.) Someone with no knowledge of the show should be able to follow along.

    >"They tried to impose their homeworld from Dronid." I think something's wrong with this sentence. I don't know what's going on here.

    An explanation of the mechanics of time travel, and therefore homeworlds etc, will come in a later chapter. Right now, it's fine if it's technobabble.

    >the Skasis Paradigm

    Oh yeah, I'd forgotten about that! Around March abouts, Dropbox synched wrong with my writing app and I lost all my work on worldbuilding, which was a huge setback... But yes, I remember the Skasis Paradigm was something I'd written on. And ... Block Transfer Computation? Thanks for reminding me!

      Oh, and for God's sakes, portray humans as having developed some form of transhumanism at some point.  Having the Doctor run around with biological superintelligence and regeneration while humans lumber around being slow, dumb, and mortal is just *embarrassing*.

        Yes, definitely. He'll be primarily interacting with 1990s or modern Earth, but I've planned for some … fuckery involving the Roman Empire and the Third Reich. And god knows what they've been up to.

  If the Doctor Who universe is going to be given a rational treatment, you'll need to wildly diverge from canon with respect to the strategies the Time Lords use. The Time Lords are a [Type IV Kardashev](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#Type_IV) Civilisation, given their access to incredible technology such as TARDIS'. If they are going to put themselves in personal danger, like the Doctor does, then they are going to be easily capable of creating personal equipment, like an invulnerable personal shield, and far better weapons than a sonic screwdriver. The Doctor's TARDIS alone seems easily capable of creating things like that, despite not specialising in creating things, and yet he goes out with little protection, leading to him being captured on a regular basis in canon, and in your first chapter where he is grievously injured. 

  The scene in that teaser video the BBC released before the 50th anniversary, about a foot soldier fighting in the Time War, would never happen because with access to the powers to the Time Lords have, you don't fight wars with foot soldiers. Even with a soldier based strategy, you would use invulnerable robots, not mortal soldiers. Civilian targets wouldn't need to be defended when you can just evacuate them all with a TARDIS to literally anywhere else in time and space. 

  Fighting a war changes completely with access to just teleportation, let alone time travel. Incidentally, you will need to make some forms of rules about sending information to past selves, because otherwise fighting a war becomes completely futile, as everyone hears the enemies plans before they are implemented

    This. Much as I love DW, I don't think there's anyway to make an honest rational fic out of it without totally changing *everything* to the point that it bears no resemblance to the original at all. 

    For example, you'll very likely have to change the fact that Time Lords are essentially humans with some extra organs and undefined temporal sensitivity. I can't imagine how any Type IV civilization would still view meatbodies as a sensible idea.

    So the Doctor goes from being a smart quirky alien dude to a quirky postbiological superintelligence. This kinda makes any plots with human companions boring, because it would be like taking your pet ant along to save the world. :(

    Then again, the Doctor lies, so...

      The Doctor and most of the Time Lords will be meat bodies, but there's a very good reason (or at least I think so) that I can't reveal without revealing a major plot point.

      On that note, any other specific complaints about Doctor Who canon you have that maybe I haven't considered? This is a [BST] thread, after all.

  TARDIS.  Remote. Control!  So many episodes could've been easily ended if only he'd bothered to get one.  It should be standard issue for the Time War anyway.
