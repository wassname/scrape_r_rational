## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Many stories on this sub is centered around the MC accumulating power, often with the motivation of causing a wid escale change but we rarely get to see the implementing of the change. I would love for recs where the focus is on 'what changes would MC make after reaching high level and what challenges do they face in doing that'. Stuff in the genre of 'what happened after Zorian >!exited the time loop!<' and 'what would the last 1/3 of WtC look like if >!the GM had let the party play kingdom building!<'
  ```

    It's a bit of a rare genre, I think. Part of it is most fantasy/scifi/fiction ties deeply into the Hero's journey, and "Kingdom Building" or watching powerful protagonists implement change in a systemic is way less likely to be written about than their journey towards acquiring power in the first place. None of the "big influences" like *Harry Potter*, *Star Wars*, or even *Lord of the Rings* really ever focus on building something, but rather the adventure itself.

    In terms of webfiction, the only thing that somewhat springs to mind is *A Journey of Black and Red*. Most of it is vampire-oriented action-adventure, but there is a non-insignificant portion of the story that deals with "implementing change", because vampires see themselves as long-term influences and thus act as "shadow"-nobles who steer and direct the development of their domain to an unaware human population. Part of establishing herself as a figure in the vampire community involves doing tasks like administrating a location/building prosperity etc. It's a decent read.

    [Patriarch](https://archiveofourown.org/works/46292428/chapters/133055026#workskin) kinda scratches that itch but has a lot of focus on the comical relief of high power low people skill MC and hasnt updated in a while.

      I've bingoed it, so it's readable and kind of good, but I see some quite strong discrepancies in world-building  and protagonist character >!As is all Grey Auction and Broker plotline contradict to MoL settings. There should have been explanation why neither protagonist nor antagonist were never involved in some way with such a strong player. Taramatula family shown to be cowards and borderline suicidal idiots, which was never hinted at in the original, all the accommodations Zorian  making for them are not quite in character for MoL Zorian who is prone to straightforward application of power solutions. Shifter clan again incompetents in the way too similar to Taramatula which make it repetitive plot device. !< Xvim character is quite good though.
      ```

        Same impressions as the one you had. Enjoyable to binge but one of the main issue I see with this fic is that it feels too unplanned, it's clear while reading that the author is writing by the seat of his pants.

    [Ar'Kendrithyst](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26727/arkendrithyst) fits that to a T. In fact, basically everything after book 4ish is about the large scale changes the protagonist makes and the challenges in making them, although individual power still matters. The story itself is about the responsibilities that come with power, as well as making the world a nicer, kinder place. Highly recommended.

    To a lesser extent [Slumrat Rising](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/65801/slumrat-rising) would also fit, though instead of enacting large scale constructive changes the MC is kind of being a terrorist :P.  The larger scale changes don't really happen till volume 3 though, and volume 3 just recently ended. Highly recommended. 

    [Infinite Realm](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27325/infinite-realm-monsters-legends) also has large scale changes enacted by its main characters later on, although the focus is still more on the overall mystery of the system and high level opponents instead of society. And there's an antagonist that's just really annoying. 

    You could look into The Menocht Loop, which is a time loop story that takes place after the protagonist exits the time loop. A super powerful mage randomly appearing in a country is a highly politically charged event, and the protagonist's existence causes changes in the geopolitics. Although I don't think the protagonist plays more of a passive role since he doesn't really want to be involved in these plots. 

    [Monroe](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35398/monroe?sorting=newest) has the protagonist making large scale changes due to an advantage he has, although his power accumulation takes a backseat to enabling the community around him to become self sufficient. It itched the scratch of everyone being mostly reasonable, although it has a weirdly anti-woke first chapter that makes a lot of people drop it. YMMV

      >  The larger scale changes don't really happen till volume 3 though, and volume 3 just recently ended.

      It just ended on Patreon, which is about 30 chapters ahead of RR.

      > It itched the scratch of everyone being mostly reasonable, although it has a weirdly anti-woke first chapter that makes a lot of people drop it.

      Yup, that's me - the first chapter was... I don't even know. Somehow a high energy physics lab was run by a clique of women and minorities that exhibit every single terrible right wing stereotype? Like... has the author ever even been in the general vicinity of a physics program? It's so anti-woke it circles around to being woke again, because a physics program that can find that many people to affirmative action into their labs is doing absolutely great in terms of diversity, equity and inclusion - even if those actual people are terrible.

      The worst part is that the main bad thing that happens to the protagonist - the PI stealing his work and not really understanding it - wasn't even something that required all those anti-woke stereotypes in the first place! That happens all the time in shitty grad and postdoc programs!
      ```

      - u/CaramilkThief:
        ```
        I used to be in the author's discord server, and asked him about why he chose to keep that section of the first chapter even though it deters away so many people from the story. He said that the event is based on something that happened in his life. I... chose not to pursue the topic farther. I will say though that something about the story feels a bit like the author has not lived in a big multicultural city, because the execution of this sort of minority-driven-discrimination was terrible.

  I am enjoying [Otherworldly Anarchist](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/78440/otherworldly-anarchist).  Maybe a bit of a guilty pleasure of a read since every character with power seems to be cartoonishly Evil or abusive, but I just enjoy fiction where a protagonist stands up to a broken or exploitative society. There are some tiny hints of rationality in that one reason the protagonist has power is due to their increased knowledge of science giving them an advantage with magic, but so far there isn’t a lot of experimentation or use of scientific concepts except as an excuse for the protagonist to be powerful and learn quickly. 

  Another rec along these lines of “incredibly angry and grim setting” which protagonist fights back against would be the Scholomance series by Naomi Novik.

  I’d be interested in other recommendations where the protagonists rebels or fights back against that sort of broken social or political structure rather than working from the inside.

    You may like the Daemon series by Daniel Suarez. It's about a computer genius making a daemon script that takes over the world economy, and overturns the status quo. 

    [Ends of Magic: Antimage](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/57697/ends-of-magic-antimage-litrpg?sorting=newest) has a protagonist that gets isekaid and almost turned into a slave, which gives him a vendetta against the slaver society that summoned him. There's a lot of fighting back against slavers and freeing the slaves, mostly done through violence. 

    [Slumrat Rising](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/65801/slumrat-rising), obviously. 

    Dungeon Crawler Carl has a protagonist that's pretty much a revolutionary in the making. 

    Only Villains Do That also has a protagonist that fights back against a fucked society. Currently on hiatus.

    *Worm*, obviously, but I’m going to guess you’ve already read it.

    This is a popular trope in *Harry Potter* fic, due to the natural rebelliousness of the cast and the tendencies of the fandom. It’s been a long time since I’ve read any that fit, so it’s hard to remember quality, but you could try [Renegade Cause](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4714715/1/Renegade-Cause), [Divided and Entwined](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined), or something more unhinged like [Wastelands of Time](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time).

      Seconded. There's a lot of rage in the way it's written, in the way the protagonist thinks about the world and his place in it. He does get better over time, but the entire setting hammers in the fact that the average person is a rat, and will at best be a rat slightly higher in the food chain. Which is why protagonist, justifiably, becomes a terrorist :P

    Not exactly rational, but "Gideon the Ninth" has "incredibly angry and grim setting" tuned to 11. Bonus points if you listen to Moira Quirk's narration as she brings the snark.

    Also, The Broken Earth trilogy by N. K. Jemisin while were at it. An imagnitave and well told story where the journey is a massive part of the story. It still hits to this day for me.

  Can I interest you in a dragon harem fantasy? It's quite good. Presenting [Hoard](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/76478/hoard), by Webbonomicon (author of The Gods Are Bastards):

  >Kaln wasn’t even trying to slay the dragon, it was just in the way of his revenge.  
  
  But he did, and it led to an obstacle greater than the dread dragon himself: his three widows.  Declaring Kaln their new husband by right of conquest, the dragons tempted him with surprisingly beautiful humanoid forms, with the palatial lair and vast riches owned by the beast he had just slain, and Kaln just couldn’t refuse.  
  
  After all, a hoard and dragon wives could surely aid in his vengeance.  
  
  Unfortunately Kaln’s beautiful new brides are vain, greedy, lazy, selfish, manipulative, violent, arrogant, and generally...dragons.  They are also ancient, incredibly powerful, smarter than him, and only proposed this arrangement to use him in their own schemes.  
  
  But sometimes, the people who are the most difficult to love prove most worth the effort.  Sometimes, a delay in your path can lead to the happiness you'd never realized you were searching for all along.  And sometimes, such as when you've upset the world’s balance of power by killing an ancient dragon, protecting that happiness means fending off a world full of opportunists who want a slice of what's yours.  
  
  At times like that, it's handy to be married to three horrible monsters.

      The pattern exists because their works are *absurdly* long. It's not like they start a new project every week or anything. TGAB is nearly as long as the *entire* wheel of time series after all, and it's still going, albeit slowly. There's plenty there for you to read, with plenty of satisfying arc endings that could serve as a stopping point.
      ```

    - u/NTaya:
      ```
      On one hand, yes. On the other hand, *The Gods Are Bastards* got out of the hiatus successfully. So while they tend to temporarily stop writing their works due to the burnout (I would get burnout too if I wrote 300+k words of high-quality, well-edited prose a year!), they don't abandon them entirely.
      ```

    - u/rsemauck:
      ```
      I'd argue that TGAB is very very good, rather long and has great stopping points with arcs ending.  OVDT on the other hand didn't finish with a great stopping point but I'd still give him the benefit of the doubt especially since he doesn't actually completely stops and has come back to finish projects before.

  I'm looking for good recommendations for Audible. Please help. 

  I loved Worth the Candle and wish they'd finish the series already. It's the kind of story I felt I was living in and felt bereft when there wasn't anything more.  

  I've actually gone through a long list of stories and lean toward progression, but I'm open to recommendations. In no particular order, I've listened to and enjoyed HWFWM, DCC, DoTF, Double-Blind, The Martian, Project Hail Mary, All the Skills, Brandon Sanderson, Mage Errent, Divine Apostasy, Jim Butcher, Cormoran Strike Novels, Children of Time, Primal Hunter, Ripple System, Perfect Run, Mother of Learning, etc. I've probably hit all of the recommendations from r/ProgressionFantasy and r/litrpg. 

  I like characters and stories written well, and I get that many of the above don't fit this criteria. I am newish to this group. Unfortunately I don't get a lot of time to sit down and read and so injest most of my stories in audio format while doing other things.
  ```

  - u/Dragongeek:
    ```
    A selection from my Audible:

    - Neal Stephenson's stuff. *Seveneves, Anathem, Cryptonomicon*. This is S-grade good stuff, he's basically *the* modern sci-fi author

    - *Altered Carbon* Series. Good stuff. Cyberpunk, better than the show. 

    - For LitRPG, Macronomicon's *Apocalypse* series is a must-read. Smart characters, smart plot, and a complete series. 

    - More LitRPG, and a bit "cuter" is Andrew Seiple's *Small Medium* series or the *Threadbare* series which take place in the same universe. 

    - If you want to get hardcore grim fantasy, Abercrombie's stuff is top-notch. *The Blade Itself*, *Before they are Hanged*, etc. All good stuff, and the narrator is super gritty and does a fantastic job

    - In terms of free web fiction audiobooks, there's Sam Gabriel's reading of *Alexandra Quick*. It's ostensibly *Harry Potter* fanfiction, but IMO it's better than what JKR wrote and Sam Gabriel has a great voice. The protagonist is a bit painful towards readership sanity though

    - Andrew Seiple's *Dire* series. Hilariously, this was originally *Worm* fanfic, but the author apparently liked their OC so much, that they went and wrote a whole series of original fiction books about it. It's a superhero story, and it's generally a fun listen. 

    - John Scalzi's *Old Man's War* series. Pretty good sci-fi, and the narration is very nice too. My "comfort listen" in terms of sci-fi

    - Only if you are fluent in **German**, I highly, *highly* recommend *Qualityland - Dunkle Edition*. It's narrated by the author, who does a great job, and this book is one of the funniest things I've ever listened to. 

    - *Second Hand Curses*. Sorta metanarrative about fairy tales. Pretty good, and the audio version has an ensemble cast who do a great job. 

    - *Tower of Somnus* series. LitRPG, Decent, with cyberpunk and fantasy elements in a VR world / real world way

    - *The Wandering Inn* series. An absolute Unit of LitRPG. Each "Book" is like 40 - 60 hours long, and there's like 10. This will consume your life if you let it. Generally I feel TWI isn't that well-liked on /r/rational, but I think it's good once it hits its stride. Has some very good payoff moments, but like there's a LOT of it.

    - u/Summer-Knight:
      ```
      Thanks. There is a lot here and I appreciate all of your suggestions. 

      I actually have book one in Macronomicon’s series and have been eying it for a bit. It is now next in line.  

      I struggled with WI and made it three books in. You’re absolutely right about the payoffs and the story is good. I just lost interest in the many side stories and a few other things.  I'm not saying it's bad and many people really like the series. 

      I hear so much about Worm and would grab it in a second if it ever ended up on audio.  I'll check the Dire series out. It sounds interesting thanks.

    The Bobiverse series (beginning with "We are Legion, We are Bob") has a premise that almost seems tailor-made for /r/rational and the audiobook is excellent (it's narrated by Ray Porter, who you might be familiar with as the narrator of Project Hail Mary).  I wouldn't categorize it a "progression" story per se, but I think you'll find it scratches a similar itch.
    ```

    - u/Summer-Knight:

      I've read parts (the first "book") of Thundamoo's works (VM, HMGGH, and Bioshifter) and while the beginnings are strong and the author definitely has a fantastic level of imagination and worldbuilding oompf, there's something that just irks me about their works. It's hard to put my finger on it, but maybe it's the same-y-ness between the protagonists and hitting the same story beats over and over. 

      In fact, it reminds me of the problems that I have with RavensDagger's works, but it's more subtle and less pronounced.
      ```

      - u/NTaya:
        ```
        As an author, I have the same problem as Thundamoo and Ravensdagger. I think it's very simple: all three of us really like girls. My stories have completely different, often rather imaginative settings, but the "vibes" are kinda samey between them since they feature girls doing girly things and having girly problems. Honestly, this is indeed hard to explain, but I totally get what you are talking about.

    I don't listen to audiobooks, but I have friends who do and these books we agree are good/great in both mediums:

    Vorkosigan Saga by Lois McMaster Bujold - Start with Warrior's Apprentice (first book in main series) or Shards of Honor (a prequel with a different protagonist) - I don't know exactly why, but Bujold's prose is one of my favourites. She could write a pages of a character watching paint dry and make it fascinating, I'm sure. She's got the gift of gab. 

    Cold Iron (Masters and Mages Trilogy - Complete) By Miles Cameron - The first book is extremely character driven and I loved that about it, though the subsequent books become more and more plot driven epic fantasy. 

    Tigana (standalone) or Sailing to Sarantium (Sarantine Mosaic Duology - Complete) By Guy Gavriel Kay - Kay is a master at putting a fantasy spin on IRL places and epochs and filling them full of relatable, empathetic characters. 

    The Pariah (Covenant of Steel Trilogy - Complete) By Anthony Ryan - A revenge story told from the increasingly rare first person pov, with each installment better than the last. 

    Shogun by James Clavell - This rec is the only one I don't recall hearing if the audiobook any good, but I'm recc'ing it because a high budget mini-series adaptation is being released right now and it's by all accounts very good. The book was my favourite for a long time(before the term weaboo was ever uttered), and still ranks high up there to this day.

    Given all the others on your list it seems unlikely that you've not tried it, but I've just finished listening to Cradle on audible. The narration is decent, and the books work well in that format.

    Jon Culshaw does good narration for Discworld (I didn't like the other discworld narrators on Audible much), and his renditions of the Guards books are very good (other than Snuff, which is a bad book).

    I've just started on the Vorkosigan books books by Lois McMaster Bujold, which are great books and fairly well narrated.

    I am not super fond of listening to litrpg as stat listings don't go so well with the format, so the following recs aren't that.. but they are good, and good listens: 

    The Murderbot series, Martha Wells. 

    T. Kingfisher is very good and very varied. Look through her listing on audible for anything that strikes the fancy, it will be very well executed.  

    Legends and Lattes, Travis Baldree (Yes, same guy that does narration a lot. )

    The Scholomance series, Naomi Novik.

      T. Kingfisher - Do you have a starting rec or a favorite?

      Murderbot and Sholomance are quite good. Good authors both of them.

      I wondered about Legends and Lattes. Travis B. is the GOAT when it comes to narration. 

      Is The Book of the Ice the same, better, or not as good as the Books of the Ancestor?
      ```

      - u/Izeinwinter:
        ```
        With Kingfisher it really depends what you like -she is very consistently good, but she jumps sub-genres a lot. Anything with paladins ? Because those are fairly solidly in the conventional fantasy genre. 

        Picked the book of the Ice specifically because I listened to it. I read the books of the Ancestor  on kindle, so no idea how good the narrator is for it. As a book series, I liked it a bit better, but think that was mostly down to liking some characters better, so.

    The Zombie Knight has a protagonist who's power is creating iron. So he can build a suit of armour around himself, summon pillars, drop massive balls on people, etc. His power set expands as the story goes on, like being able to summon iron that's already in motion, and he picks up some magic items, but always stays relatively limited. Although I haven't followed the last few arcs so it may have changed.

  I read Worth the Candle, and I guess this is a de-recomendation but only if you had the same reservations I did going in.

  &#x200B;

  See I've had WTC recommended to me several times but I've always been put off by the premise of a man getting isekaid into a world stitched together with his own ideas. It stinks of a "it was all a dream" type of story.  Still I gave the first chapter a try and was sucked in by the none standard fantasy world.

  &#x200B;

  Generally the world building in WTC is fantastic, I especially like the concept of Exclusion Zones. They're just inherently intriguing. And even though I was enjoying what I was reading, the meta-ness of everything kept giving me a sinking feeling. I got about 100 chapters in and I just couldn't take it anymore. I had to know the nature of the world, so skipped to the end.

  &#x200B;

  >!And yeah my initial instinct seems to have been about right. It wasn't all a dream but it felt like something in that vein. The unreality of it all made the adventure seem rather pointless. To be fair I did skip more than half the narrative, so maybe with more context the reveal would have worked better, but I kind of doubt it.!<

  &#x200B;

  Although I ultimately didn't like WTC, I would be interested in reading Alexander Wales other longform stories. I have to ask though if I'd have the same problem with them as I did with WTC?

    I question the legitimacy of dereccing things based on skipping the actual plot...it seems like you'd have a stronger point if you just said you didn't enjoy it after the first 100 chapters for one.

      I mean that's fair. Take my de-rec with a boulder size grain of salt. I did skip half the story, and full disclosure, I didn't read the epilogues either. But I still feel like my particular criticism of WTC has merit.

      &#x200B;

      >!Like I said its not all a dream, but the thrust of it is the same. !<

      >!These characters don't have lives of their own. They don't exist outside of the story. And in a sense they're just psychological symbols for the DM to work out personal problems. So nothing that happens actual matters outside of what it might mean to the DM. !<

      >!All the problems you have with 'it's all a dream' type stories.!<

      >!Now maybe the idea here is we're suppose to accept these characters actually do exist in a meta narrative universe and continue on with their own lives after the story ends. I won't say this type of story can't work. One of my favorite Visual Novels is about meta fictional character (I hesitate to name it cause it's a bit of a spoiler) but the problem with WTC is it's rationalist fiction, and if you're writing rationalist fiction you're going to put your readers in a rationalist mindset. So you can't really expect them to swallow a tarot card leap of logic like this at the eleventh hour.!<

      So even though I didn't read all of WTC, I feel like my point still stands.

        Just curious, but have you ever played DnD or similar role playing games? Do you have similar issues with the story/experience because it's all made up, including the character you play? 

        WTC was kind of a weird beast, covering a lot of wildly different narrative ground, but one of the things I felt it really did do well was to convey the feeling of an actual role playing game.
        ```

      - u/i6i:
        ```
        Yeah, nah.

        >!The epilogue and a significant chunck of the story exist to provide examples of characters exiting their intended roles. The thing is titled "Worth the Candle" and the DM's account is deliberately left ignorant of anything besides the creative process of the plot so as to explain  that he too is a character created as part of Aerb. The whole "everyone is symbolic" thing is just him justifying a lack of moral investment in his authority. He doesn't have the capacity to really care about anything that's happening beyond moving along Arthur's plot ergo why he fucks off after him. !<

        >!All a Dream is used to mean that there are no lasting consequence except perhaps personal emotional realizations so the only thing in common with that here is that there are emotional consequences at a scale we are left ignorant of in addition the real consequence we spend like 7(?) extra chapters on.  !<

        >!I'm unclear what you're calling a tarot card leap of logic about this. It's not like we weren't getting fake bug reports in the game interface since the early chapters. To me it seems very clear that instead of the story not following its internal rules what you're actually complaining about is that it...did keep doing that and whatever it is you're calling a rational mindset was expecting a 11th hour twist to the contrary. !<

        - u/LeanLew:
          ```
          >!I should clarify my point wasn't that the reveal doesn't make sense. It's that in order to accept at face value that the character Juniper Smith is somehow taking over authorship of the Worth the Candle universe from the DM (who I think is literally suppose to be Alexander Wales) you have to jump over the far more sensible reading that everything you've just read is the ramblings of the DM and none of it is real in any capacity. !<

            - u/LeanLew:
              ```
              This is true. That's why suspension of disbelief is such a fragile thing. I'm trying to maintain the fantasy that what I'm reading is real.

              &#x200B;

              >!This is very hard to do when the DM's final reveal is that Juniper Smith is a character in a novel.!<

            ```
            >!That's what I thought you meant and why I mentioned the \*fake out\* bug reports from like chapter 4. Nothing about the world of Worth the Candle is actually limited by 8 bit integers either. The DM isn't ranting about the difficulty of having to move from AO3 to Royal Road nor anything about the story's audience. His not actually breaking the fourth wall to bully people in the story about which of them is more internet popular. He has the same motives as Wales because those are the only motives that someone like him could plausibly have for arranging events as he did but he has no more actual information about reality outside of the story than Juniper. !<

            >!You're saying that the \*more sensible\* reading is that the story stopped being told at the last chapter and the rest is just an author rant (presumably targeting the rich audience of people with a parasocial relationship to Alexander Wales?) and that it would require a \*leap in logic\* to think anything else...instead of actually finishing reading the thing.!<

That's unfalsifiable for any plot under the sun but what I disagree with is that there is a point where the text acknowledges this possibility as more plausible than the characters being as real as the DM. It's "sensible" only in the context of you posting on the same social media site as the author not in terms of what's actually written in the book.    !<

                    >!What's the nature of anyone's reality? The full scope of the question dwarfs any answer but the question of what immediately is happening to him is that probably whatever process was used to create Aerb and the meta-pantheon cares a lot about human experiences vs. maintaining elegant fundamental laws of physics. It's fundamentally what most religions claim to be happening IRL with much less observable evidence. The final reveals that people of Aerb have access to modifying their own awareness and nested infinite simulations meaning that for all we know literally everyone is having the same experiences as Juniper is.!<

  - u/Relevant_Occasion_33:
    ```
    Probably not. While I have mixed feelings about WTC's ending, I'd say it's definitely more complicated than >!it being a dream all along. Whether you can interpret it as the Dungeon Master not even knowing how Aerb's existence works or whether Aerb is a fantasy even within the narrative is an open question.!< 

    I've read most of Wales' other stuff, only dropping This Used To Be About Dungeons partway through so I can't say for sure about that story. I don't think you'll have any issues with his other works.
    ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    FYI in case you didn't see it, but Alexander Wales actually did a "side story" type thing to WtC that's [literally just a list of and explanation for about 65 exclusion zones](https://archiveofourown.org/works/47107573/chapters/118683370), including all the ones encountered in the story.
    ```

  - u/Naitra:
    ```
    I myself disliked WTC a lot, both due to the meta-narrative leading to what you've mentioned and the characters I didn't find compelling, combined with too many chapters that felt like therapy sessions for the characters.

    You should check out his other books though, they're miles better than WTC in my opinion and don't have the same flaws.
    ```

  - u/thomas_m_k:
    ```
    This would also be my main criticism of WtC, that the story doesn't treat its world as real. I think The Erogamer handles this much better – its world is also kind of a game, but it feels actually real, like this is happening somewhere in the multiverse, and there are deep layers to its reality. WtC never feels like that.

    Still, up to like chapter 163, WtC is one of the absolute best stories I've ever read, and I will always think of it fondly even if I didn't like the ending.
    ```

  - u/grekhaus:
    ```
    His other works are a LOT less meta. If you liked the weird fantasy world aspects of WTC, I would suggest Dark Wizard of Donkirk or especially This Used To Be About Dungeons. Thresholder seems less likely to be your cup of tea.

  - u/serge_cell:
    ```
    Quality of the writing falling through the floor in the last arc and and especially epilogue. And it IMO is even worse than "its'a dream" it's >!self-referential book about writing book!<
    ```

    - u/NTaya:
      ```
      Agreed with the last arc being bad. I actually loved the meta-narrative self-referential stuff, but the last arc felt rushed and not even half as good as what came before.
      ```

      - u/ReproachfulWombat:
        ```
        The meeting with 'Uther' and the resolution of that whole plot was one of the most disappointing things I've read in fiction. We were building up to it for over half a million words... >!and then it just happens in this uninteresting copy-paste dungeon, and he's an uninteresting dick. What a waste. It genuinely felt like Awales got bored of the story and decided he wanted to move on, so we rushed through all the big mysteries/antagonists in as few chapters as possible.!<

        It's still an incredible feat of writing, and I've recommended WTC to all my friends, but the ending is definitely the weakest point.

          - u/ReproachfulWombat:

            I get that it was intentional, but that doesn't change the fundamental problem. >!A massively important character that was built up for hundreds of thousands of words turned out to just be a boring dickhead, and we had to be rushed through that realisation since the story was about to end. He wasn't even an asshole in an *entertaining* way.  The fact that the author *intended* me to find Uther annoying and boring doesn't mean that I wasn't annoyed and bored.!<

    Not particularly rational LitRPGs are everywhere, so you really won't go much wrong just going to the top rated section of RoyalRoad and picking anything there (although having just checked the awful Magical Girl Gunslinger is still there, so YMMV). 

    Outside of RR the best is probably Shadow Slave, which has been recommended here before. It's on Web novel but you probably want to find an alternate source
