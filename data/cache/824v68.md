  I'm sorry if this comes out wrong, but if I knew that there was a "seed asset" near me that was preparing to take me out, I would be wayyyyyy the fuck more freaked out. Like, what the actual fuck. "Oh, we are here to take you down, specifically," and then Hector goes, "Oh, huh, thats interesting, anyways, back to work." THIS IS WHAT GTFO GRAB BAGS AND SITUATIONS ARE FOR. This calls for a bugout bag asap and getting the fuck out of dodge. Like, "the wheels are not turning any faster than usual", I mean yeah, but like, what the fuck. I would bugout faster than somebody could blink. It makes no sense to stay at all. Inform Paris, and then bugout now, rather than when you get the knock on the door.

    Fourthing this!  It's confirmation of his worst fear about them (which almost paralysed him when talking with them before), but he treats it as though he was already pretty sure of it and was fine with it (even though there hasn't been anything suggested that he can *do* about them, physically?).  Either that or it hadn't sunk in yet and he's going to wake up in a cold sweat later, but he was thinking enough about it that that didn't sound to be the case.

    If they come after him and he unleashes secret safeguards that we haven't heard about (which have been giving him extra confidence, and which he presumably hadn't told even his sister about?), I will be pleasantly surprised.  If they come after him and he's caught blindsided and ruefully captured, I will be...  annoyed.

      I assumed that he was setting something up after the "I need an exit" bit and it'll trigger at a moment of dramatic convenience. More worried about if his leaving any family around as easy blackmail targets.

    I'm Ã  little disappointed in his level of paranoia. He seems to respect the boundaries of his potential enemies way too much considering he should be considering that he's already outed to someone and is facing the expiration.

    Maybe there's a gas leak in his house that is making him less suspicious.

  Echo the other comment about Hector's response to Polarity confirming that she's here for him and just waiting for the takedown order. I'm confused as to what crimes the CIA thinks Delphic has been committing. Maybe just association with the Doc, maybe they're just feeding Polarity a justification she would accept, maybe something else.

  As for the extra bits of alt-history that were dropped, *goddamn* is that a bigger fork from our time line than I was expecting. I guess I was too optimistic thinking it was Korea that turned against the Allies and not WW2 itself. Definitely makes me think more of the theory that America's relative standing in the world is diminished, and with the USSR having apparently collapsed before or near the end d of WW2, there would have been no Cold War at all to make Americans fiercely loyal to the idealized vision of liberal democracy that would stave off dynastic power. If I'm reading it right, Germany de facto won WW2, annexed northern France and most of Eastern Europe, and then the Empire collapsed due to internal resistance in the form of nationalistic, but democratic separatist movements? Seems kind of a weird combination to rise up in the face of a triumphant fascism. And since the Allies apparently never made it into the German interior, did they ever discover the concentration camps and the holocaust?

  Is Germany still then the post-Anschluss union of Germanic states, or was the collapse total back to post WW1 borders? I wonder how the war in the Pacific went.

    Furthermore, with such a drastically altered WW2, how did the manhattan project fare? No cold war and no "missile gap" means less missile research? They didn't reach the moon, anyhow, and that means maybe ICBM reliability can't be that good? Better rockets could have gotten them to the moon with enough political will.

      I love how the two of you immediately jump to what I consider the key questions.

        On a previous chapter somebody mentioned the whole missile thing after musing on apollo's failure.  This chapter the whole WW2 drop was making me wonder how Supers and Nukes get along. 

        Adds another dimension to super registration if supers are among the most powerful destructive forces. If a strong super could shrug off tank shells and bombs....

      Wait, wait, wait. Do nukes exist in the Delphic-verse? A site-based Google search turns up no mention of nukes or nuclear power at all.

      Are *supers* the apocalyptic power everyone's afraid to let loose that's deterred great-power war if there aren't any nukes? The supers we've seen so far are relatively innocuous - not enough to deter a Third Reich that controlled everything from Brittany to Crimea. Supers capable of doing that would make Superman look tame - something like Scion and the Endbringers from Worm. Moreover they would have likely had to demonstrate their power at least once, and each nation claiming to have a deterrent super would have to publicly make such a demonstration.

      It also means the balance of power is far more tenuous than in the real world. Supers can be killed, die naturally with time, and new ones can emerge. Which means any great power with deterrent capable supers might at any point come to believe it has the capability to gain a decisive advantage over its opponents.

      And if *Germany* is the counter-weight to American power, and a German-aligned super-villain team recently assassinated a healing super - that might just be the opening gambit in a bid to cripple American super-deterrence by first destroying their ability to heal any damage done in the next round.

      Hah - this just went from bank robbers playing mercenary for an evil corporation to the opening act of WW3.

        There are nukes now in the Delpic-verse. There were not nukes yet in the 1940s. The WMD used to end war in the Pacific was the upsilon beam, and it wasn't nearly as awe-inspiring.

        To answer one question from last week and pointedly ignore your other musings here: the lukewarm end to the European theater combined with the drawn-out, bloody victory in the Pacific theater was why Truman did not have the support to beat Dewey in '48.

        I really, really want to say more... but I think I should save it for the story.

  Delphic is a superhero story about Hector, a young man in Detroit with the ability to see the past and the present. It follows his attempts to leverage this unusual ability to do good in the world while remaining behind the scenes, keeping both his identity and the truth of his powers secret from those who would see him as a threat.

  Story threads will focus on several characters as Hector encounters them:

  * Hector's sister, Paris, a homicide detective hiding her own power,
  * Doc Stevens, a disgraced scientist at the forefront of research on the source of super powers, and
  * The exploits of various "Super Teams": government-run groups of supers whose scope of operations have been steadily growing.

  Just read up to the current chapter, must say, I'm liking the story so far. I am surprised by him pushing aside the seed being his neighbour, at least in thought process if not action, though he does seem like the type of person able to do that. 

  You have another reader in me, I look forward to your updates.

  Criticism is very good! I'm appreciating the honest feedback I've seen on this thread.

  It also looks like the thread has received a couple of downvotes. I presume that reflects a couple of people who were unhappy with the story (or just the chapter). If they have not already, I would love to get feedback from them as well. I consider myself a very inexperienced writer and am looking for as much constructive criticism as I can get.
