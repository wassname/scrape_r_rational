  **Soap Bubbles**

  I'm beginning to think that the "primordial prisons" aren't really pocket dimensions containing primordials, but rather the primordials themselves. The primordials that previously roamed the world were just physical projections of pocket dimensions--say, a soap bubble within a soap bubble. Banishing the primordials was the equivalent of pushing the interior soap bubble to the exterior--which is possible because the bubbles share a common film (i.e., the primordials are the spawn of the world dragon). This is what made the primordials impossible to defeat. Popping a sub-bubble risks popping the larger one; destroying a primordial could compromise the world dragon. Very interesting.


  **Sovereign Gate Theory**

  I would like to conjecture a little on the nature of the Sovereign Gate--namely, why it was inactive for all those years. I don't think that the SG is a single primordial, but rather a tool that taps into them. If the SG is near a primordial during the planetary alignment, it taps into that primordial to simulate the world for the controller. The SG functioned normally when it was located in the Xlotic--the former seat of the Ikosian empire--because it was kept near the Golden-Feathered Worm. It's been inactive for the past few cycles because the Ikosians *left* the Xlotic, and the imperial family / Novedas were unaware that this would affect the SG's function. Luckily, before the current cycle, Zach's guardian donated the SG to the time magic research facility--which just so happens to be located next to Panaxeth's prison, triggering the time loop. To explain it in metaphor: rather than a full computer running the simulation, the SG is more like an OS for the simulation that runs from a USB drive. It was pulled out of one computer (the Xlotic primordial) when the Ikosians migrated. Zach's guardian accidentally plugged it into a new one (Panaxeth).

  Arcane Magical Knowledge collected over the years by elite mages:

  Shall we beat up these mages and make them tell us their secrets? Mind magic it out of their minds? Oh no, let's just trade for it. They clearly worked hard to get this knowledge, let's respect that!

  Expensive National Airship built by elite mages + construction crew:

    Airship would reset to exactly the same state, secrets would remain stolen, unless Zorian edits his memory.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I doubt this is it. I think Zorian would have no problem with stealing knowledge if it were contained in a private book someone owned. I think it's more that he doesn't want to attack Innocents and sift through their minds. As he feels like doing that would be crossing a boundary. If I remember correctly it's discussed in/following the chapter that Xvim originally proposes the idea.
      ```

      - u/Xtraordinaire:
        ```
        Zorian's prime concern is that mind magic abuse is too enticing so he can't afford to get casual about it. The same goes for his efforts to stay alive, treating death as something of a nuisance is a BAD habit to have in the real world.
        ```

        - u/appropriate-username:
          ```
          Yeah and stealing an airship is hardly something he'd be able to casually do once he's out of the time loop so this concern is much smaller with regards to this action.
          ```

      - u/I_Hump_Rainbowz:
        ```
        I would agree with Zorian that this would be crossing a boundary too. I do not know if I agree that this sentiment is worth stopping at that boundary for though.

        Its similar to the torture vs execution discussion.

        > I think Zorian would have no problem with stealing knowledge if it were contained in a private book someone owned.

        This is literally a thing Zorian is doing, he and Zach are practicing for the break in to the royal treasury by breaking into various noble houses, and he's taken plenty of secrets that way. They have this exact conversation then, basically.
        ```

  - u/TsortsAleksatr:
    ```
    I think they said, in a chapter, that trade would be beneficial since it would be easier for the other person to give and teach him their secrets voluntarily instead of forcing the secret out of their minds. Besides all tradeable items also reset.

    Reminds me of a scene where a super-powerful villain buys his groceries with real money since it would be easier and less time-consuming than stealing anything he wanted and having to deal with the pathetic attempts of the police to stop him.
    ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    Souls are a thing in MoLverse. And it's not clear what happens to them at the loop end. It's possible that there are thousands of copies of each soul in whatever afterlife they go to, each containing a record of Zorian's deeds.

    So treating people differently to things makes sense.
    ```

    - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
      ```
      If Zorian steals the airship, there will be souls containing records of Zorian stealing the airship. The souls of the mages and the construction crew will record their years of hard work finally culminating in an airship so grandiose that it is worthy of being called a national vanity project, only for the airship to be stolen away before they can even test drive it D:
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        OK, but if he doesn't actually hurt anyone, and everything gets reset, I expect Zorian to be OK with that.
        ```

- u/space_fountain:
  ```
  Time to talk about my pet theory. I think red robes may have help optimize the assault on the primordial prisons because he needed them to succeed in breaking the primordial out so he could escape the loop.

  It seems that red robes put a lot of resources for a ton of loops into making the invasion go down perfectly. Maybe he just really wanted to help them out or thought it was funny or something, but especially with what we learn this chapter and the reaction when they mentioned breaking one out. I think it's much more likely that he needed to.
  ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    The beneficial thing about that, if Z&Z can confirm it, is that RR will be immediately outside the prison door. The whole of the time loop only takes a short amount of time in the real world. Seconds, likely. So RR wouldn't have time to go anywhere, and he won't be expecting Z&Z. So when they exit the time loop, presuming Zorian is combat ready upon leaving, they can teleport to the Hole and take out RR. Or Zach could do it alone, because he's probably the best combat mage alive, and RR can't compensate.

      We dont know if red robe might be holding back. He mightve not outright killed zach because he is the center of the loop and he knows zach more than most. In the end, i wouldnt put much faith in zach seeing as how the red robe knows more about his capabilities than most.

          Strength isn't everything and he's proved to be cleverer than Zach as well as being able to get the lich fight on his side not to mention we still haven't seen his full potential yet. 

          Zach is an unreliable narrator seeing as how he was obviously under some sort of red robe mind magic that you cannot trust him until he goes under examination by Zorian.

                  To be fair, RR was specifically trying *not* to kill Zorian, since he needed to interrogate him. As a necromancer, that's probably one of the most difficult situations to show your abilities in.    
                  Also, the only real weakness we saw is that his mental defenses are shoddy. Admittedly, that would be enough for Zorian to blast him - but it doesn't mean he's not a powerful mage.

        If RR escaped through the primordial prison door, then he essentially just walked out. The people in the loop aren't simulations, they're all real, just destroyed and recreated every month. The gate is built to keep things separate, and the only way it has to get people out is to shuffle souls. But if you can make an actual doorway through to the real world, then walking out means that you appear on the other side of that door. There are then two copies of you as well.

    Doesn't make sense to me considering what he had done as part of said optimization. I think it's more likely he is invested in the original plan (so he is an Ibasan or a cultist), and therefore naturally wants it to succeed.

  ```
  Theory: QI, being as old as he is, is aware of the Sovereign Gate and upon approaching the period when the gate can be opened sets up the groundwork for an invasion. Upon discovering that he is in the loop (through similar techniques to Silverlake) he starts the invasion in order to use the primordial as a bridge and get to the real universe. Assuming this is true, it's plausible that, what with RR helping the invasion and ZZ being absent in various restarts, that QI has succeeded in this many times and that on the other side of the prison there is an army of QI/RR clones waiting.

  Bonus theory: the primordial they are inside is the one imprisoned beneath the city. The prison door looks the same but from another perspective, perhaps this is because they're inside the prison looking at the other side of the door. Silverlake remarks that there are no guards, because the Sovereign Gate can't create them, or because the guards are on the other side of the door?
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    I see several problems:

    - If QI is setting up an invasion regardless, why assume that he's aware that the loop has actually begun? What differences would we observe? Actually, I would argue that his observed behavior suggests he *doesn't* know about the loop, or he would have dealt with Zach differently (eg capturing and studying instead of simply assaulting his soul).
    - If they were inside the primordial's prison, it would kill them all. And Zorian has seen the primordial breaking out of its prison into the loop world.
    ```

    - u/twiddlebit:
      ```
      I was thinking that he would be setting up an invasion in anticipation of the gate being used because he had prior knowledge of the gate; only going through with the plan after confirming being in the loop.

      After sleeping on it I have to admit this doesn't seem very likely, although i do think it's awfully convenient that the invasion coincides with the loop. Either the loop was started because of the invasion or the invasion is started because they are in the loop, which is plausible if QI can detect whether they are in a loop or not and if he can either mobilise the invasion within a month or if he was already preparing the invasion and just needs to say the word go.

      Wild theory #3: QI is aware of the sovereign gate and assumes the loop will start a month later as it was supposed to. To this end he endeavours to release a primordial in order to end the loop on day one, sabotaging the loop and preventing people from gaining ridiculous amounts of power. If i remember correctly QI is the oldest named entity im the story barring gods and primordials, if anyone would have prior knowledge of the gate surely it'd be him
      ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        Wild theory #4: the Gate is an anti-Primordial defence mechanism. We already know it can do insane time acceleration, so it isn't a stretch at all to think that it can keep a separate simulation of the world without a Controller in it. If a Primordial is ever released in that world, the Gate waits until a month before it would happen in the real world and then activates, pulling in a member of the Noveda house so they can gain the foreknowledge and expertise necessary to stop the prison break.
        ```

      - u/Crazy_Demon:
        ```
        It's not that much of a coincidence, the releasing of the primordial needs to be done during the planar alignment (just like the start of the soverign gate).  Don't forget the whole reason the invasion is occurring now and at cyoria is to unleash a primordial on their enemies.


        We also don't know how long is been since the soverign gate was last used.  For all we know it could be tens of thousands of years ago, long before the gods fell silent.  Qual may have heard of the myth but just because he's a 1000 years old doesn't mean he knows what's true and what's false and how everything works

          1600 years ago: Dynasty change (gate may or may not be used, last possible use of the gate, since it was dormant "past few Cycles", meaning no gate at least 400, 800, and 1200 years ago)

          about 600 years ago: Gods go silent

          about 500 years ago: Cataclysm (Xlotic desert forms)

    I wonder how not having a phylactery would effect QIs combat ability. Obviously he'd be easier to destroy but I wonder if the anchor could have some effect on his ability to perform magic as an undead. I suppose he could be carrying one when he exits the loop.
    ```

  - u/silver7017:

    If that is the case, then something has gone wrong with QI's plan. somehow the gate got activated a month early, and thus burns power much more quickly than intended. this was mentioned a few times.

  Also: the primordial thing sounds scary but honestly it doesn't really affect anything except they might be able to escape through the changing primordial's prison.  The SG has been used before and been in use for centuries at a time, there's no reason to worry if they don't actively try to talk to it..... oh fuck that's how they're going to get out, isn't it?

    Its not actually confirmed that they are living inside a primordial's bodyverse. 

    Unless its the same primordial as the one trapped under the city, I can't think of a reason for their prisons be linked.
    So I think if they are trapped in a primodial its probably that one.


    As an aside: it will be interesting to see what contigency Silverlake uses to keep her conciousness at the end of the moth.
    ```

    - u/Quetzhal:
      ```
      I think it's just the opposite - they could be trapped in any primordial *but* the one beneath Cyoria. Having an exit to the prison inside himself wouldn't make any physical sense - though I suppose it would explain why the universe resets when he's summoned. 

      More likely, in my opinion, is that a bridge to every primordial but the one that holds them is created. The link to that primordial is possibly the Sovereign Gate, acting as a sort of entrance built into the primordial's mutilated body. 

      As for Silverlake, I suspect she would have to do something that mimics a primordial's prison, such that the loop mistakes her dimension for one as well and skips over destroying it. The problem is that won't be part of the original blueprint - so she'll either need to bridge the gap back herself, or more likely get Zach and Zorian to do it.

        - u/Quetzhal:
          ```
          Yes? Assuming that a mind-shattering cosmic entity should break conventional geometry *just because* it's a mind-shattering cosmic entity is just your brain making associations with other geometry-breaking entities. Is there any reason to believe this one breaks geometry in that fashion? 

          We've been shown that space can be compressed in the MoL universe. No reason to assume anything else. It's not *impossible* or even that unlikely, but I'm going with the razor first.
          ```

          - u/None:
            ```
            >Normally, mental contact with the entity resulted in quick insanity [...] 

            As you can see above, mind-shattering is paraphrasing the way the author described the primordial. It can induce madness and insanity upon individuals therefore it can shatter minds ergo mind-shattering. I never implied that the geometries the entity existed in were the cause of the madness or insanity.

            Also, if you want to be pedantic, I never said it broke geometry. I just said it used non-conventional geometries. Nothing about it being non-conventional equates to it breaking geometry. Even within conventional geometries there are objects and surfaces that fold in on themselves (e.g. Klein bottles). 

            Secondly, you act as if using associations to other similar entities is a bad thing. It is both natural and normal for authors to use allusions to other constructs in literature to convey feeling and tone. This is an obvious allusion to Cthulhu and other cosmic entities. While not all of the cosmic entities are non-conventional, most of them do follow non-conventional geometries. 

            Also if you note what I wrote, I used the word expect, which implies using context and clues to extrapolate a data point which you might not know. In this case, I asked if you expected it to follow conventional geometries. So, using meta-knowledge of the author's allusion and information from the text ("[...]  Golden-Feathered Worm was very dimensionally[sic] complex [...]"), it is normal to assume that it will not follow conventional geometries.

        We were told that they are multidimensional beings. The idea doesn't seem that weird to me. I think you're assuming the Primordial is like inside some space inside his prison, but I don't know that we need to assume that. If it isn't. If it's more like it's sealed just outside the universe, there's no reason the plug shouldn't extend "inside" of it.

    He's been able to have a giant floating castle for a while now. Just attach a floating spell to the orb, and he's set.

    Well, he can't actually access said castle when it's floating, and when he can access it it's invisible, but it still fits the criteria.

  Second bonus theory. They aren't in just any primordial. They're inside the one trapped at Cyoria. Think about it. We know there aren't huge number of them so it was already decently likely. Add to that that Silverlake is quite right that the easiest and simplest thing would be just not to copy any of the prisons. So why did they? Maybe it's not so much another angle on the prison as the other side of it.

  There are a decent number of flaws with this. The biggest being why can the primordial be broken out then, but I still think it's a worthwhile theory
  ```

  - u/JiggyRobot:
    ```
    If they are inside the Cyoria primordial, wouldn't that mean the primordial has an entrance to its own prison inside its body?

    - u/daydev:
      ```
      It's not too crazy to assume the primordial has a connection to outside from inside its body, a "mouth" if you will, the current "outside" being inside the prison. It enters the paradox territory when you consider that this way the "mouth" location on the inside the primordial matches the location of the prison entrance two dimensions out.
      ```

  - u/IFap2PB:

    That was my immediate thought as well. It would go a ways to explain why Z&Z couldn't find any other primordial prisons. They just don't exist within the time loop.

      They havent actively found their prison locations tbf so its a jump to say their prisons are missing. Until they know for a fact the prison is supposed to be at a certain place, its all up in the air for now.
      ```

  - u/DCarrier:
    ```
    That was also my impression. "But it's the same prison as it has always been… just seen from a different perspective," sounds a lot like you're now on the inside of the prison looking out.

    Perhaps the primordial breaking out was the primordial dragon that the world they're used to is in.

  So I had this thought a little late, but it struck me that Mrs. Kazinski would *flip* at Zorian if she ever found out he let Kirielle become friends with someone who can turn into a black cat. Considering witches are probably associated with black cats and all.

  Anyway, great chapter, we're getting a bunch of neat info.

  The staple of magicpunk, airship, here we come!

  The primordial theory is beautiful. I guess Z&Z will find themselves studying summoning magic soon, in order to device a spell that can planeshift them out of this dimension using one of the primordial cages as a reference or something. Why summoning? Because it's one field of magic mentioned rather regularily, but not yet seen being practiced by anyone. Well, it's blocked by the SG, but still, my Chekhov Gun senses are tingling.
  ```

- u/JiggyRobot:
  ```
  Huh. So if a primordial is enough to contain all that, makes you wonder what the source of the primordial (one of the dragons) could contain. 

  Probably enough room in one of those bad boys for a universe, with some extra space to fit in a spiritual plane and maybe even a few fancy pocket dimension/prisons. After all, just using of the dragons to make a planet seems kind of small potatoes now.
  ```

  - u/IFap2PB:
    ```
    Also makes you wonder where the gods came from before they were in the current universe, and where did they go when they disappeared.
    ```

    - u/Gurkenglas:
      ```
      The universe might be running out of energy the same way the time loop is, and when it went below some level of energy the gods starved.
      ```

      - u/IFap2PB:
        ```
        Or at least bailed from that dragon and used one of the other ones flying around to make a new universe. Maybe as soon as Zack and Zorian hop out into their "real world" they'll have to escape that real world into whatever universe is around that one.
        ```

    - u/JiggyRobot:
      ```
      That's a very good point. I was initially thinking that perhaps the gods moved onto one of the other world dragons/universes, but that wouldn't explain where they came from originally. 

      It suggests some sort of 'outer' universe that has gods and world dragons running around in.
      ```

- u/IFap2PB:
  ```
  It could be that the reason the time loop was activated a month early was a byproduct of the primordial escaping it's prison.
  ```

    Doesn't the invasion fail to free the primordial even if Z&Z don't do anything, now that RR is gone?
    ```

    - u/IFap2PB:
      ```
      No, when Zack and Zorian don't interfere the primordial is freed. Even when Zorian triggered the summoning two weeks early the primordial was freed, instigating an early termination of the loop. The primordial summoning definitely succeeds at least to the degree that reality is broken without intervention from either Zack or Zorian. Red Robes just makes the invasion much more effective in terms of strategy and destructive power.
      ```

      - u/Ardvarkeating101:
        ```
        The very second loop Zorian and Zach don't do anything and by the time the loop resets the primordial hasn't been freed, and that was with RR super charging them
        ```

        - u/IFap2PB:
          ```
          We didn't have a point of view on the ritual site though. The ritual could very likely have been well underway. It is known that without RR interference, the loop ends right about when the summoning is completed, so the primordial might have been about to be freed, we just didn't see it.

  Feels like a slow chapter - loop as primordial and airship sums it up. I really hoped that we'd see Silverlake join the loop in some way or at least make inquiries into securing that option.

    I think she's definitely angling for that. It sounds like she's mobilizing a great deal of her assets to try to understand them. It could just be curiosity, but this is someone who's managed to attain immortality. To me it sounds like she's trying to develop a plan.
    ```

    - u/literal-hitler:
      ```
      She understands the situation far better than anyone else they've told by a wide margin. She understands just how valuable it is and that her time to act is limited. She has the most knowledge of the relevant subjects. 

      She is the most dangerous person to them by far.
      ```

      - u/IFap2PB:
        ```
        But also the best person to know or come up with a plan for either finding a way out of the loop. It might be a good idea for Z&Z to just bring her into the loop. That way she has what she wants and can't really interfere anymore. If she finds a way out she can try it and Z&Z can watch and see if the Guardian boots her back or destroys that iteration of her without risking themselves.
        ```

        - u/literal-hitler:
          ```
          But once they let her into the loop, Z&Z know way too much about her. Quite possibly more than anyone currently alive. We already know one person left the loop without the Anchor, why not another? Though messing up Zorian's soul and mind wiping Zach before she left would make sure they couldn't follow.
          ```

          - u/IFap2PB:
            ```
            She's too smart to take that kind of risk. Chapter 76 proved that Zorian alone would give her a tough fight in a physical confrontation. Against Zack she's screwed.
            ```

            - u/literal-hitler:
              ```
              A direct confrontation where she knows nothing about them. I was thinking more of an ambush when and where they would least expect it after having more information. And/or time to gather firepower.
              ```

              - u/IFap2PB:
                ```
                Still a huge risk. If she does any serious digging she'll realize that Zorian is a master mind mage and extremely paranoid. If she screws up the slightest bit she's dead. She might be able to take out Zack and Zorian with proper planning but it would be a toss up. Those kinds of risks aren't worth taking when there's no obvious reward.
                ```

    - u/Dismalward:
      ```
      Unfortunately they cant really trust the witch as opposed to his other friends because theyve only known her for 3 or so months and she knows a great deal about soul magic/dimension loop she can be a great threat despite their seeming immortality inside the loop.
      ```
