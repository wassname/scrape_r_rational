## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  Im toying with an idea for a munchkin/rational Alt History version of WW2, focusing on Poland specifically.  


  It starts as it did in original timeline, on September 1, 1939. The immediate difference is however:  


  Whenever a Polish soldier dies (any member of the Polish armed forces) their strength, speed, dexterity, durability and theoretical knowledge and skills (not personal knowledge or intelligence though) is given to the nearest Polish soldier, atop of their own.  


  (for example, if there were two Polish soldiers who could benchpress 60 kg, and one dies, the other can now benchpress 120 kg).  


  Im working through the possible long term and exponential consequences of that "national" superpower. At what point does the number of "Super Poles" is enough to overwhelm the technological advantage of the Nazis, and the number advantage of the Soviets? At what point will they be able to go on an offensive? What would be the most optimal tactical and strategic use for a soldier who is Double (or Triple, or Quandruple) as strong and fast as normal human?  


  Assuming the Polish government and military cadres are rational and bloodlusted to win, how can they munchkin this power to maximum utility?
