## Rational Borderlands?

### Post:

I'm talking about the Loot and Shoot created by Tell Tale games. Is there a fic out there that covers this? Would a ratfic even be possible with this game? Inquiring minds (namely mine) want to know.

  Well it’s created by gearbox, and given the obvious gaminess of the universe, rationalizing the inherent zaniness of the setting would either require some absurd hand waving or some explanation of how 99% or Pandora’s population ended up as violent sociopaths

    That part isn't as hard as it sounds.  The [backstory to the Borderlands games](https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/Borderlands#Story) provides a future-dystopian corporate/libertarian baseline explaining that many of the residents of Pandora were brought there to begin with *because* they were violent criminals.

    Even given that, many of the characters in Borderlands seem uncommonly insane, so perhaps also throw in that the traces of [Eridium](https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/Eridium) or some other substance in the atmosphere have psychosis-inducing effects on humans.

    Now back to broader question of writing rational fiction in the universe, that sounds harder.  On the one hand, the extremely gamified elements could be subject to some interesting munchkinning.  But I think the more you try to strongman the setting to write rational fiction in it, the farther away you get from its intended craziness.  I think the result would either be not very rational, or not very much like Borderlands.

  A couple possible points of departure:

  1 - The ability of the new-you stations to accurately re-instance a person depends on some limited resource; the more of this resource it spends, the more accurately the reproduction inherits your values and skills. (The player didn't notice this in-game because their bank account was always in proportion to their level i.e. how delicately tuned their skills were.)

  The powerful, but disfigured and crazy, bandits are those who died a bunch when they had no money to their name, then "got better". They are aggressive because those who did not seek out and hoard resources are now beyond resurrection. Civilians cower in slums (mostly out of sight of the course of the story) - density limited by foraging - to avoid that sort of fate. The wildlife isn't actually that nasty; it is just that nearly everyone with combat experience is hung over.

  2 - The new-you stations, designed for baseline humans, do fine with organic matter... but the modern adventurer (or street thug) is better described as nanotech in an organic matrix. For such critters the use of a new-you station imposes a steep cost to identity (best avoided by having the forethought to set up a 3rd-party backup) and a minor cost to power (best fixed with careful infusion of the missing species - or by the desperate by pointing at a suitable feedstock and wishing to be "more"...).

  The bandits are those who died enough to stop caring about it; they may have made a few ill-advised feedstock choices along the way. They aren't really that common, but their numbers are slowly snowballing - you can't really kill them and they'll eat the bars of any cage you put them in. Civilians stay out of the way because of philosophical problems with re-instancing or just because they don't like the feeling of bullets going through their guts. The wildlife somehow \*\*is\*\* that nasty.

  I don't know that it is, but my take would be that all the violent psychopaths on the planet are the hyper-rationalists.
