## [Challenge Companion] Anniversary

### Post:

**tl;dr: this is the companion thread to [the biweekly challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8qwmlk/biweekly_challenge_anniversary_50_cash_prize/?utm_content=comments&utm_medium=hot&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=rational), post musings, ideas, recommendations, etc. here.**

This marks three years of the weekly (later, biweekly) challenge, FYI.

  ```
  This comes at an auspicious time. Tomorrow is the tenth anniversary of the day I met (and had my first date with) my wife!

  We will see if that spurs any inspiration this week.
  ```
