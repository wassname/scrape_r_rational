  Called it on the amulet.

  Strange that it would have the power of 'halving' magic though. Does it work iteratively?

  I wonder if Bacon's tree has anything to do with his book [The Advancement of Learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Advancement_of_Learning), which was the basis for Diderot and d'Alembert's tree of knowledge.

    Surely he meant the diary, which is probably one of his horcruxes.

  ```
  Nitpicking:  Harry is supposed [to be able](#s "to cast spells without a wand now? We need a line "Bartok thrust an extra wand from his belt into harrys hand". ")

  Edit: and regarding [time turners](#s "it is quite unlikely that harry would be able to destructively interfere with the shell that is specifically for the purpose of preventing breakage. ") Maybe an extra line can be added?
  ```

  - u/heiligeEzel:
    ```
    Where is Harry casting spells without a wand?

    Also, I imagine the time-turner shell as something Harry can open to get to the Time-Turner, and then close after using. So deliberately breaking it should still be possible.
    ```

    - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
      ```
      [Spoiler](#s "after the dementor is summoned, he tries to cast expecto patronum, but formerly his wand was shattered apparently? In the wizengamot scene dumbledore levitates his wand to harry for this very purpose, but this is omitted here")

      The shell thing makes sense, I misremembered the description.
      ```

        ```
        Woops. :) (will fix!)
        ```
