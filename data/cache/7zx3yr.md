## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  I had acquired a +1 warhammer of apparitions in my dnd campaign. The hammer was enchanted with a killing blow counter, where after killing 150 creatures, the hammer would release it's dark power for me to overcome and then master

  I took that hammer to the fishing and bait shop and made 150 doses of worm puree, the apparation inside the hammer was unimpressed, but this +3 warhammer hits like a bus

  edit: it looks like this isn't going to work regardless of how I tweak the ruleset.

  tl;dr: **What are the most powerful mythological or fictional creatures that you can think of?** Note that creatures shouldn't be humanoid (in their true form), and there should be more than one of them in any given work.
  _____

  So I'm working on creating the ruleset of what has a low chance of turning into a freeform RP.

  During "character creation" so to speak, a genie appears to every person on the planet and let them pick *any* real, mythological, or fictional (but not imaginary) type of creature and get their abilities (from the mundane to the magical). Now, I figure a majority of people would either dismiss the genie (getting no powers), pick some regular animal (say, cats) and get some relatively unimpressive powers (nightvision, better smell, better able to survive falls, etc.) But some subset of the population is inevitably going to pick magical or fictional creatures, and some of those creatures would be very, very OP.

  Now, a certain amount of OPness is expected, and even welcome; it's more wish-fulfilment-y to have characters with neat superpowers. But while a lot of possible choices exist on the same "power scale" so to speak (for example, most kinds of werewolves are less powerful than most kinds of dragon, but by the same token most kinds of dragons are still killable by most kinds of werewolf), you have creatures that are explicitly designed to be ridiculously OP, to the point where if a person with bad intentions picks them, they're extinction-level events (or at least still incredibly dangerous.)

  So,

  * What are the most OP creatures you can think of to pick, especially considering that other people will also be picking OP creatures?
  * How could I "balance" the most OP creatures to still be incredibly powerful, and proportionally more powerful than less-OP creatures, but not completely break the setting? (As an allowance to sanity, the genie has "fuzzy logic" abilities, akin to a DM house ruling stuff)

  Some examples of creatures I consider powerful, but balanced:

  Inheritance cycle dragons (mindreading is nasty good, but they're still very vulnerable to ordinary weaponry), Nemean lions (high tier invulnerability is great, but still have exploitable weak spots), most non-legendary pokemon, 5e Tarrasque

  Some examples of creatures I consider unbalanced:

  3.5e Tarrasque, legendary pokemon, anything that has to be killed with a special, magic weapon that obviously wouldn't exist in the real world, Naruto tailed beasts

  ~~edit: actually, I think I've come up with a possible, partial, solution. Namely, that the genie will scale the offensive and defensive abilities of every creature to asymptotically approach the power of a nuclear bomb (say, 500 kT), and the maximum speed to be mach 2, and the maximum acceleration to be 10 gravities, and the maximum mental processing speed to be 4x human average. If you have less than than, say, 90% of an amount, abilities are virtually unchanged. Approaching or exceeding a bound places you on a logistic curve, with the "meeting" point being the optimal choice of creature for each category. So without warning, virtually everything is still vulnerable to an ICBM strike.~~

    Where's the dividing line? Can I ask the genie to hold on a bit while I write and self-publish some awful dreck with a really OP monster?

    >What are the most OP creatures you can think of to pick, especially considering that other people will also be picking OP creatures?

    In rough order of power:

     - An unbound genie, to grant arbitrarily powerful wishes.

     - Time travellers.

     - Power copiers, especially if they can keep multiple sets at once.

     - Some types of Hydra, or other adaptive regenerators.

     - Hecatoncheires, Eldrazi (from Magic the Gathering), Balrogs (or other maiar, from Lord of the Rings), other epic-level creatures.

     - Exponentially breeding monsters, chain-summoning ones, infection/converting ones, etc.

    >How could I "balance" the most OP creatures to still be incredibly powerful, and proportionally more powerful than less-OP creatures, but not completely break the setting? (As an allowance to sanity, the genie has "fuzzy logic" abilities, akin to a DM house ruling stuff)

    You have 1-3 words to describe your creature.  After that, the genie may ask clarifying questions, or may give you some powers that match your description.  

    For example, "Tarrasque" may get the powers from [D&D 3.5](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/tarrasque.htm), [D&D 5e](http://5e.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/tarrasque.htm), or [Starcraft](http://starcraft.wikia.com/wiki/Torrasque_(StarCraft_II\)).  All of them are large, powerful beasts that are difficult to kill, but they have wildly different power levels.

    "Dragon" may get the genie to ask questions, like "what type" or "from which stories", and then proceed from there.
    ```

      ```
      >An unbound genie, to grant arbitrarily powerful wishes.

      For the record, I don't consider an arabian djinn a "creature" but since there are plenty of other creatures that grant wishes, that can slide.

      >Time travellers.

      I'm not actually aware of any creatures that willingly timetravel. I'm sure there *are* some, but I can't think of any.

      >Power copiers, especially if they can keep multiple sets at once.

      Power copiers would definitely be powerful, but I'm not actually aware of any that can arbitrarily copy every type of power and ability.

      >Some types of Hydra, or other adaptive regenerators.

      I actually think regenerators wouldn't be *that* much of a threat, because there would be so many out-of-context powers running around, guaranteeing someone would be able to no-sell anything but the highest tiers of regeneration (ignoring grey goo, that is.) Certainly still incredibly dangerous, but with the relatively low probability for any single person to specifically pick the most broken regenerator tin order to kill bunches of people, they would actually make interesting challenges that destabalize regions, but aren't threats to the world as a whole.

      >Hecatoncheires, Eldrazi (from Magic the Gathering), Balrogs (or other maiar, from Lord of the Rings), other epic-level creatures.

      These are definitely good ones. I failed to consider card-game monsters, and they get very, very nasty.

      >Exponentially breeding monsters, chain-summoning ones, infection/converting ones, etc.

      Yep, grey goo would be very nasty (and not covered under my edit.)

      >You have 1-3 words to describe your creature. After that, the genie may ask clarifying questions, or may give you some powers that match your description.

      Actually, independent of balancing, this seems like a pretty good idea regardless.

      >For example, "Tarrasque" may get the powers from D&D 3.5, D&D 5e, or Starcraft. All of them are large, powerful beasts that are difficult to kill, but they have wildly different power levels.

      Yeah, I've definitely been looking for an organic way for the genie to pick the "least worldbreaking" version of a worldbreaker, and this seems like a good one.

      ____

      How about this for a better restriction on creature picking/power granting:

      "Pick a class of creature from either the natural world or published fiction that has previously had members of that class killed by the actions of mortals. You will gain powers of the same type, and of proportional magnitude, of those possessed by the creature you pick."

      With the genie then either asking questions clarify what exactly they mean by, say "3.5e tarrasque" (e.x. from which novel?), and picking a representative example to base powers off intended to balance creature choices using fuzzy DM logic.

      So if you pick a wish-granter, for example, your power to grant wishes is limited, and you can grant them at a limited rate. If you have regeneration, it's slowed down. Self-replication only happens so fast, and is dependent of food intake, mind reading only shows you a bit of a mind at a time, and so on and so forth. And the "killed by mortals" restriction sections off a vast quantity of the truly broken monsters.

    > How could I "balance" the most OP creatures to still be incredibly powerful, and proportionally more powerful than less-OP creatures, but not completely break the setting? (As an allowance to sanity, the genie has "fuzzy logic" abilities, akin to a DM house ruling stuff)

    Step one is to ban any creature that has time-travel as an ability, because that's an instant balance breaker: the first person to activate a time travel ability can just go back in time and kills all the puny other humans before they transform into OP creatures. This ban also rules out all kinds of gods, genies, and reality warpers.

    After that most creatures are okay really. For every creature that can only be killed with attack method X, there's another creature with an attack method that always kills absolutely anything. It's like when the unstoppable force hits the immovable object. Just create a massive magical explosion that hurts both sides whenever that happens.

    Once you have that, the smart people will choose dimensional sliding creatures so they can get the hell out of our universe that has suddenly become full of horrible creatures like [star conquerers](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/d/d1/Justice_League_Adventures_Vol_1_5.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100812070042) and [sun eaters](https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80419/1901472-sun_eater.jpg) (the two most overpowered things I can think of, but there are surely other more OP ones). 

    Anyone foolish enough to choose something as puny as a werewolf, or really any creature that can't escape Earth, is going to find themselves without an Earth to stand on. Anyone choosing creatures that can escape Earth but not the Milky Way will likely die from collateral damage soon after, unless they are one of the big players that are throwing stars around.

    Given your response to buckykat that:

    >I think the largest parts of what make them so broke is their self-replication and instinctual knowledge (as you wouldn't be nearly so threatening if you couldn't properly manipulate your fields and your firewalls) so maybe a ban on self-replication outside of normal human sexual intercourse (or technology assisted human intercourse), and removing all instinctual knowledge (with the justification that such a knowledge dump would be like replacing you with another person) thus forcing everyone to learn about their new abilities through practice (albeit aided by instincts that can't be called "knowledge" and any brain mechanism boosts)?

    This opens up the opportunity to pick godlike beings who would otherwise be off the table for any reasonable person because of how much you'd lose your identity.              
    So with the stipulation that you keep your personality and gain no new knowledge in place I will simply pick Azathoth. Or any of the number of other gods conceived of which aren't humanoid.

    Alternatively I could pick the enhanced humans from some fiction I previously wrote. These enhanced humans would by themselves not really be that impressive (basically they're just peak human in every regard with a few extra goodies) however they also have cellular machinery which will construct nanobots to kick off the creation of a FAI and a singularity should they ever find themselves in a pre singularity world.          
    Of course I couldn't pick the enhanced _humans_ because of the "no humanoids clause" however there are equivalent versions of many other animals. So I could turn into a warbird which has human level intelligence, and then pretty rapidly when the nanobot triggered singularity gets afoot I can get my body changed back to human (or just upload).

  Under the whim of some chaotic god whose name you don't know how to properly pronounce, you are given the [Magic 8 Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball) of Power and Happiness. Unlike the more traditional ones this 8ball only has a decahedron inside with only 5 positive and 5 negative answers. The instructions that came with the 8ball tell you that it will only work under specific conditions, however the result will always be 100% accurate.

  The conditions are:

  * Your questions must always be asked with good "intent" behind them. If you try to make a prediction knowing that someone will be harmed by it, even if not directly, the chaotic god will smite a relative or a loved one.

  * The questions must always be asked with the purpose of either conquering a country/the world, or reaching true happiness. Otherwise you won't get an answer at all.

  * Within the span of 10 predictions, one of them must always be done with the intent of amusing the chaotic god. The counter resets every 10 predictions so it doesn't matter if it is the fourth or the eleventh one, but it must be done. Otherwise...

  Some attributes of the 8ball to keep in mind:

  * The card with the instructions/conditions/attributes is the "key" of the Magic 8 ball. The ball itself won't work unless the owner is the one asking the question and the card is within 5m of the ball and the owner.

  * Every time you touch it, it releases a randomly disgusting and intense smell that can last from 10 minutes to 3 hours.

  * Whenever you activate it, it will try to taunt you by laughing like a madman or crying like a baby.

  * Predictions that result in the user being miserable lower the above effects, while predictions that greatly benefit the user will make the item temporarily unusable and generate a very strong but short ranged AoE mental attack that lasts for 6 hours (basically a car alarm in your head or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYKgkFvMM))

  * Ignoring the 8ball and therefore boring a chaotic god, is NOT a good idea. However, you can gift it to someone else as long as these two requirements are fulfilled: 1) You have to bathe the 8ball in your blood and clean it with your tongue. 2) You recognize the person you will gift it to as someone who is more fucked up than you are, and is even less qualified than you are to use it.

  How would you take advantage of such a powerful yet obnoxious item? What kind of questions or "predictions" would you make?" would you even try? how long do you think it'll take until you get sick of it and try to give it away? are you willing to pay the price? or would you rather come with a way to bypass its obnoxiousness?

    >Your questions must always be asked with good "intent" behind them. If you try to make a prediction knowing that someone will be harmed by it, even if not directly, the chaotic god will smite a relative or a loved one.

    "Indirectly harmed" is a very broad brush to paint with. Pretty much everything can be construed to cause indirect harm.
    ```

  - u/GemOfEvan:
    ```
    The chaos god is just begging for you to ask it "is the answer to this question some form of 'no'?".

    SOP here is to ask it questions in the form "is the nth bit of the best answer to question x that is at most 100 bytes long, enconded using this specific huffman code, a 1?", but the throughput of the thing is vague.

    What does it mean for a prediction to have a great benefit? Does knowing the nth bit of the answer to some question a great benefit? If it is, we're very limited to what we can ask.
    ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    * To deal with the smell problem, keep the ball in contact with your skin at all times.

    * Ask "will the Powerball lottery jackpot at X date be 500,000,000 or greater?"

    * If yes, use standard binary hacking methods to get the correct ticket. We choose not to win the lottery every week because that would become suspicious.

    * Amusement questions could be things like, "If I begin doing jumping-jacks on the sidewalk right now, would the jackpot on X date be higher?" or other completely random actions. We might get something good at random, but hopefully the God will be amused by a slew of creative and stupid questions.

    * Once we win the lottery, we use the ball to predict market crashes so we can gobble up collapsed stocks like candy. We become the most successful hedge-fund manager ever, and our ball-required eccentricities get ignored by everyone. Use our newfound superwealth to politically conquer the United States and instantiate sensible reform.

    * Hand the ball off to some random. Give them pointers in its use.
