  If you're wondering where ch 75 went, it's just a character sheet and some screens that are on it, mostly for quick reference/refresher, titled "Stats for Nerds".

  This web serial now has [a functional Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/alexanderwales) under my Alexander Wales pen name, but I'll still be posting to reddit for stuff related to this fic using the /u/cthulhuraejepsen pseud. You can read the About section on the Patreon for more information.

  Thanks for reading!

    :O

    Well that's a shock! But considering how much I enjoyed Shadows, Glimwarden, and Metropolitan Man, it really shouldn't have surprised me as much as it did. All pretty different, and all really good. 

    Also, note to self, I need to start listening to the Rationally Writing podcast.

      >  Shadows, Glimwarden, and Metropolitan Man,

      I loved MM, it seems I have two new stories to read.

      What confuses me slightly is this: Alex has said previously that WtC is a self-insert. Which would indicate he is 18-19 in the real world, right?

      Am I wrong here? 

      Metropolitan Man was written in 2014, which would put him around 14 at the time of writing it. Unless he has used his past-self as a self insert, it is pretty incredible how great an author he was for such an age.

      I mean, it's great story regardless, I enjoy his writing in any case, but for a teenager to be this good, that's incredible.
      ```

        > What confuses me slightly is this: Alex has said previously that WtC is a self-insert. Which would indicate he is 18-19 in the real world, right?

        It's a loose self-insert, largely because the story involves a lot of people that I wouldn't be comfortable directly copying in a written work, and if I was going so far as to change *them*, then I might as well change a few things about *myself* so as to provide some plausible deniability and give a thin veneer of privacy.

        (I'd rather not answer any questions about what's true, what's adapted, and what's made up, mostly because I'd end up having to talk about my issues, and part of the reason I'm writing this is because I would rather do that in prose form.)
        ```

        - u/rabotat:
          ```
          Thanks for the answer. I didn't mean to pry, I can see how this would be a personal thing for you.
          ```

        > I loved MM, it seems I have two new stories to read.

        Shadows of the Limelight is complete (though IIRC it leaves space for a followup). I actually liked Glimwarden better, but it's on indefinite hiatus :-(

        >Alex has said previously that WtC is a self-insert. Which would indicate he is 18-19 in the real world, right?

        He gave a bit of an explanation for what he means by self-insert before in a comment, I think. Let me see if I can find it. The jist of it was that the self-insert title has more to do with original character creation and gets a bad rap; they're not meant to be literally the author. Like Bella Swan from Twilight was a self-insert from Stephenie Meyer (she's said as much), but no one thinks that's *actually* her. It's a projection of the author into a character (often idealized as a Mary Sue/Marty Stu by bad authors).

        Edit: [Found it!](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7t36op/rtwip_worth_the_candle_ch_71_the_soul_of/dt9kwu8/)

        I highly doubt he's a teenager any more, but he was at one time and probably used some of the experience to craft Juniper to some extent.

          Yeah, makes sense.

          >Shadows of the Limelight

          Oh, I was following that for a while, I enjoyed it. Didn't know it was finished.

          To be honest, I am not a great fan of a narative driven universes, but I can't help but to like fiction that is well written.

    🤦

    I swear half the stuff on this sub is written by you.

    But seriously, I remember seeing some post a little while back about how 75% of the stories are actually written by you, Eliezer, and maybe someone else. I can't remember. Something like that is legitimately true. We need some sort of productivity statistics for rational authors/stories.

    As another person stated, I'm disappointed because the amount of people actually writing rational fiction is lower than expected. One author less than we thought. **We could have had Alexander Wales and cthulhuraejepsen combined!** But it's really only one person. 😞

    I got totally bamboozled.

    Using a pseudonym is interesting: I tried and failed to get into one of your other original stories, and didn't like it, so if you used that name for this, I might not have read it. (I also probably didn't try hard enough to get into your story. Maybe one day.) Maybe not, because this kept getting upvoted a lot, and I'm in a constant state of trying to find something to read.

    I'm glad I read this though; this is one of my favorite original stories, and your early update rate was insane. This is an awesome story.

    Once I actually get a revenue stream (I'm a college student), I promise to donate something to the Patreon eventually. I need to pay back to all the creators I like, and you deserve it especially for the bamboozle.

    ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ You're amazing.

    I keep just getting this feeling of amazement and that feeling that you just got played hard. Man. Props to you, so much.

    ***

    Alright, I'm gonna read the chapter now. I wonder how much the character of Juniper maps onto you. He's an incredibly well developed character.

      This is one of the nice things about using a pseudonym that's not connected to your other pseudonyms. People don't come in making comparisons or with preconceptions of how you write or who you are, and the work stands by itself without that much of an authorial presence aside from what's on the page for that specific work.

      (One of the ethical questions I think about is that by depriving people of information, you're preventing them from making an informed choice about what to read. I'm hoping that no one feels really bitter about being tricked into reading this story because they'd made a vow not to read anything I'd written ever again, but those were the dice that I threw.)
      ```

      - u/Green0Photon:
        ```
        I think that, for the most part, you're ethically fine. If you were evil, and so I choose not to read your work, it wouldn't really be a big problem. Free works mean that just by reading it, I wouldn't necessarily be supporting you (and thus evil). Donating, on the other hand, is more morally dubious.

        Still a little stupid to debate, though, because any free will you took away is so unbelievably miniscule in comparison to many other common things we experience. I'd argue that the good the work itself does more than balances out any evil you committed by using a pseudonym. So don't worry! :)

        ***

        That silliness aside, I like how you handled the pseudonym here, in comparison to the Waves Arisen. We still don't know if that's Eliezer or not, and it would be nice to have the author confirm or deny that prediction.

        Around now was perfect, imo. I don't know if I'd want you to use a pseudonym in the future though, because I'd want to make sure I read your future works. (Past works are not as important, because quality increases over time. I did enjoy Metropolitan Man though.) It would not be a big shame to bamboozle us again, but it would be a bit weird. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ Ponder it; I don't have a strong opinion either way.

        I suppose it's less weird to do it on purpose than for lolz.

        FWIW (the candle!), it was the opposite for me: I found the description unappealing and started following it pretty late. 

        If I had known that it was you, then I would have followed it from the start; you earned sufficient trust that I will give anything you write a try, regardless of genre/description.

        Well, this way I got positively surprised once I actually got around to binging "worth the candle"; there's always a silver lining. 

        (and then I got disappointed because alexanderwales and cthulhuraejepsen funge against each other wrt output)

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      Next week: Turns out that Alexander Wales lives in Croatia and spent a few years blogging about decision making and philosophy on some green website under another pseudonym. Then 90% of the content on this sub would have been written by one person, who might as well be the next Isaac Asimov.
      ```

        Christ, don't even joke about that. D:

    ```
    [And his name is...!](https://youtu.be/2D-ZO2rGcSA)

    More seriously this is surprising, and in a weird way disappointing. I don't mean that as a criticism of you, it's just that there's apparently one less author of rational fiction whose work I enjoy.

    I used to live in a world where cthuluraejepsen and Alexander Wales could both be writing a story independently of each other. Now the potential amount of good, new rational fiction per unit of time is decreased when compared to that perception.

    It may be just a start of the new book, but we already get a plot twist! Now we just need one more reveal:

    > I have split personality, the other one's named Eliezer Yudkowsky

    And it will turn out this sub is made and maintained by a single person!

    Wow, I absolutely did not see that coming. I really loved your work as Alexander Wales (especially the dark wizard of donkerk - why wouldn't you publish it, or at least add it to your site, btw?), but still somehow did not recognize your style here. 

    Worth the candle is top notch. It keeps me awake at the late hours of the night as only the very best books does. I think I will donate some humble amount, as a token of my appreciation. Cheers!
    ```

    - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
      ```
      I keep meaning to go over *Dark Wizard of Donkerk* to at least do a first editing pass ... but I like writing a lot more than editing. Enough people have read it now that there's not really a point in trying to keep it as a separate thing with caveats about quality and/or having been written under a different-than-normal process.

      (Seriously though, I don't like editing. It's still my dream that an agent or publisher will come along some day and say "hey, we'll get you an editor and pay them to edit for you", but that's not normally something that happens to people.)

    (For those wondering, this was posted in my Homestuck discord, we just talk about Worth The Candle often. I'd fully support a WTC Discord if one existed, however.)

      I've got no idea who was behind The Waves Arisen. I'm somewhat skeptical that it's EY, but don't have a strong argument either way. I think someone ran a stylometric analysis and it was inconclusive.

The community will follow your story wherever it goes; we are, above all else, your readers.

    Now that you've mentioned it, we *should* have guessed! Nobody is this impossibly articulate about (meta)narrative other than the author of Shadows of the Limelight!

    I have to say, WtC is your best work so far. Probably the best part is the highly intelligent characters chatting, yet in very identifiable and distinct voices.

    My only regret is that I thought we had another excellent new author to the fold!

    But yeah, big reveal! I've got to say, I think WtC is far and away your best work, at least of the ones I've read (side note:this is good motivation to read the rest of them at some point). I think a lot of that is how good the characters and the character dynamics are, but really I enjoy most everything in this story. I'm glad to see a Patreon set up for it.

  > Loyalty increased: Grak lvl 9!

  I was really amused at this, and feel it a small gem of subtle humor. Everyone else gets consideration, which (but of course!) increases Grak's loyalty, rather than any of those other people. I don't blame Juniper for being bewildered and confused by him.

  On my part I'm guessing that Grak appreciates kindness and fairness in general, while being naturally distrustful of kindness and fair words directed at himself. I wonder if he would NOT have increased loyalty, if Juniper had also said something nice/polite/considerate about him, since then instinctive mistrust might have been the reaction.

        ```

        - u/rumblestiltsken:
          ```
          To the point of actively arguing against saving its life? And Solace's? He actually quite liked Solace, despite their differences.

          I kind of hope there is more of an explanation, He literally just took the time to save people who tried to mug him, but then wants to ignore the locus/Solace for some nebulous narrative reason?

          Maybe some deep-seated unhappiness with resurrection? An "Arthur couldn't come back, so why should Solace?" kind of thing.

        ```

  - u/NoYouTryAnother:
    ```
    I think contrasting Joon's saving Valencia in the prison to the ignoring the locus now is instructive. The best I can guess is that Joon has a deep aversion to being obligated to save those he doesn't have a connection with. In previous discussion it was mentioned that he is pretty classical neutral, e.g. only saving somebody he doesn't care for when threatened by the Cowardice affliction. My guess is that his reflection on not getting the cultural baggage with the locus translates to "I don't really care much" and that that translates to resistance to getting involved. Note that not only was Valencia "Joon-bait", but his saving her was likely heavily influenced by the now-absent levelup compulsion.

    Perhaps Joon reached for something familiar in his soul-coma haste? His D&D group did debate a lot. Or it's compensation strategy for low social and he's expecting situations where being a Debate specialist would be useful: the end of this chapter's D&D vignette might be telling. I'm still piqued he passed by Appraisal, the classic litRPG OP ability (assuming it works the usual way).

  This chapter, more than any other, felt like it was written for me specifically. I like the concept of the full harem pairing as a source of humor, and seeing it used as a source of drama is even better; I love the concept of the Boundless Library (I've written a story about something similar to that) and unlike some in this thread I do actually like the reveal that cthulhuraejepsen is Alexander Wales. Why? Because WTC is your best work yet (of those I've read), and in the context of an already excellent body of work this is far, far more impressive, because it means you're actually *still improving*. Kudos for that.

  (Was the Boundless Library a reference to Borges, or just a general unrelated idea?)

    I actually don't remember where the Boundless Library came from. The earliest it shows up in my personal archives is 2009, when I used something similar as a "session ender" (basically, a short story written as a way to cap off a campaign that had lost its luster, so that those characters and loose plot threads would get a proper burial).

    [Here's a pastebin](https://pastebin.com/Shu9M5Jv) - on a quick read-through, it's pretty typical of the prose that I would occasionally inflict on my players.

  Ever since he met Solace I'd been wondering how long it would take for the pseudo-intelligence injection to overcome Joon's crippling fear of his own sexuality and let him figure out that he signed up for a harem game and was playing it all wrong.

  Turns out the answer was never, he had to be clued in by his girlfriend and the One True God. Sort of funny, sort of sad.

  He just happily derped along, recruiting miss Posthuman-AI-literally-created-the-most-attractive-girl-in-the-world-especially-for-you, miss Contemporary-earth-girlfriend-with-pointy-ears, miss(?) Explicitly-down-with-the-experimental-coitus, miss Shameless-old-hippie-chick, and miss Worships-the-very-ground-you-walk-on... all without ever stopping to count the number of penises in his kharass.

  Short question: Is Val actually elvish? Or are non-anima a separate race (because race is transmitted via the soul, not genetics)? As in: There would be one "non-anima humanoid" form, regardless of parents' races.

  I'm asking because Val's parents should both be elves (except if Fallatehr has run a pretty long breeding program and she is half-elven; and I don't think this could work out, because he only got control over the prison once all the non-elves died off).

  Then, one would next ask about the physiology of non-anima: teeth (elven-style or human-style?), aging (elven-style or human-style?), heredity, sexual organs, etc.

  Naively I would have expected her to be physiologically elven (except for the eyes) and significantly older (choose a random age between ~100 and 0, which is the possible time-frame for the start of Fallatehr's non-anima experiment).

  Hence, Val's age appears narratively determined: Out of quite a long time-frame, they happen to break out Fallatehr in the short interval where his one (guesswork) non-anima-daughter is in a fitting age bracket. Make that plus one for retro-causal messing of the DM (practically ret-conning, just like a human DM; even a mighty simulator cannot be expected to solve pspace-complete post-selection).

  ...and now I am sad that Joon didn't call her Null, star of the void, instead of Valencia the red. Or he could have tried for a Bobby Tables style name (I name thee "root", 'of the screamin' WHERE 1=1').

  > A Key For Seven Locks

  As usual, the game layer seems geared to a more typical isekai experience than what Joon is contending with.

  Also, unless I'm miscounting, this seems to imply that there will be two more companions joining the team (Amaryllis, Fenn, Grak, Six-Eyed Doe, Valeria, and two unknowns).
  ```

  - u/Makin-:
    ```
    We already could sort of infer this. Arthur also had seven companions.

    Also I really hope the game isn't actually suggesting he bangs the deer. Maybe the deer gets a humansona at some point?
    ```

    - u/ansible:
      ```
      I think it is more likely that keys and locks may refer to what is most important to each of the companions.  I could see how love and acceptance from a life-mate would be most important for Fenn.  The others will have their own long-term needs in other directions.
      ```

      - u/reaper7876:
        ```
        I would certainly prefer it if that turns out to be the case (edit: not entirely true, on further thought. The conflict between Joon and the game is compelling, and this adds to it), but keys and locks are a fairly common anatomical metaphor, and by Joon's reaction, it was the coitus that caused the quest update; if it was about love and acceptance for Fenn, I suspect he would have received a progress indicator sooner than that.

Anyway, things are fine between Fenn and Amaryllis and myself.” It had been three days now that we’d been at the foothills of the World Spine, sitting behind wards and setting watches, looking out for an attack that we were fairly sure wasn’t going to come. Fenn and I were sharing a bed, but --

              > “I gave Fenn some herbs that will prevent her from having a child, but they’ll take a few weeks to start working,” said Solace.

        Nope. It's a direct reference to a gross, sexist saying. Talking about the relative value of 'a key that opens many locks' and it's opposite. Seems like something the game layer would reference, and is consistent with him getting set up for a harem by the game.

        I really hope so because the alternative is some rather gross and ethically questionable acts just so he can finish the quest.

Even moreso because in this game, all his companions can be fielded at once, there's no party size limit.  Also at least in other games in this genre, if you don't do key loyalty missions, you will be forced to sacrifice a companion during the main quest...

  The interesting question for Joon's strategy here is "what do I do with essentialism 100?".  Each 10 levels has given upgrades for most skills.  If level 20 is a PhD, I expect level 40 to be world-class, and 60+ is pretty godlike.  I'd expect the power ramp to be crazy.

  That said, it seems like high levels of essentialism will give stronger soul defenses, as well as more options and possible faster control.  I would expect to see:

  * Respec skills at extremely low cost (every level at essentialism 100, perhaps at will for essentialism 101+
  * Respec attributes permanently (he likely can do this already, but there is likely also the same cost, and it is most likely to be cost-free now)
  * permanently store extra data in the soul (Fallatehr had pre-prepared modifications of his thralls which he activated on command, faster than you would expect from modifying de novo)
  * modify bones directly, instead of just copying (upgrade own/others bodies; combined with storing extra data gives great options)
  * read, modify or copy memories at will
  * understand how to manipulate a soul such that its modifications are more permanent (-> modify Fallatehr to be permanently loyal)
  * presently resist modifications to the soul
  * Injecting a soul which lacks a body, into a living body (revive Solace)
  * Extract information/understanding from bones (they have soul information, may be able to merge it with Joons own bones in an intelligent way to give super-healing)

  In light of this, it would be good to get all your ducks in a row for this golden chance of upgrading your team.

  * Level up with points in MEN.  Move an attribute point from PHY to MEN, as well as those two ill-placed INS points into MEN.  Being a mage is the real way to pick at the corners of this world, and he might as well take advantage of it (just one point lets him keep his lvl20-perks, which drives that choice)
  * Discuss with everyone about any potential changes they might want to have applied, and any additional animals which they might want to have on hand for snatching skills.  Perhaps get your hands on some elf bones?
  * Go out looking for trouble (someone else to rob you), kidnap one of them, so you can rip his soul and apply Solaces (plus her bones = living solace in her own body).  Do the same for Fallatehr, but mind-rape him into compliance first
  * rip the soul information from the unicorn bones which confers super-healing and disease resistance, possibly also the temporal super-power.  Apply them to yourself
  * mod the skills and attributes of your companions per their requests
  * fix the deer, of course
  * get someone to design scars for Fenn that actually work.  Mod her scars to heal to that configuration, and store a copy of that data in her soul, for reversion on command.  Do that for everyone.  If this doesn't work (or there isn't enough time), just clear the scars for her

  Currently, he loses one skill point per five minutes if he over-skills.  I believe that will happen even faster at high skill levels (emulating an inverse exponential curve).  Perhaps every 2.5min at double his nominal skill level, and every 1.25min at 4x nominal.  So his window with uber-essentialism will be very short indeed.  That will limit how many of these ideas he can enact.

  Thoughts?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I agree with the general thrust of your post that Essentialism is probably going to end up being analogous to transhumanism/directed body modification.

    But I'm also kind of wondering - in keeping with your lvl 20/40/60/etc power creep statement - if pushing Essentialism up past 100 will end up breaking the simulation in some fashion. We already saw the game layer get breached once early on when Jun pushed his mental stats too high (too fast?) and the admin had to rebalance things.

    I could see Essentialism possibly breaking the game in either the whole "Neo in the Matrix" sense (allowing for more and more direct interfacing with the game?) or in a more subtle, in-game munchkinry sense. For example, what if Jun getting 100 in soul magic lets him respec his stats in such a way as to allow him to enter/exit the "forge frenzy" state at will? Maybe all those "useless" crafting skills we saw earlier in the story were actually a Chekov's gun. 

    Wresting away control of the magical item creation process from your current DM is kind of the definition of game breaking. Plus this would allow the narrative to neatly sidestep the party's general inclination to run all around collecting Mary's hand me downs like a bunch of magpies.

      In particular, the notion of 'game breaking' in this world means you get 'Excluded'.  Heck, it looks like one guy got 'Excluded' just for getting really good at farming.

      - u/jaghataikhan:

        Now I'm curious - is exclusion like a divine/DM-proclaimed thing? Or is it more that the other human/sapient kingdoms/state level actors say "This guy is super dangerous - avoid at all costs, go full SCP and keter-level quarantine stat!"
        ```

        - u/Putnam3145:
          ```
          It's been mentioned that certain magics (glass magic) or even *specific abilities within magic* (completely overwriting someone's soul data with your own) have been excluded, which causes them to be *impossible to use* even by *Joon* (many of the skills shown in the essentialism interface are unavailable due to exclusion) so it's definitely not a quarantine thing
          ```

    - u/munkeegutz:
      ```
      > if pushing Essentialism up past 100 will end up breaking the simulation in some fashion. 

      I was originally of the opinion that these messages were communicated intentionally to the player, but now with the 4th-wall break of Valencia, I suspect that they are a seam in the game which can be pulled on.  It is likely that we'll see a bit more through Essentialism or Spirit

      > For example, what if Jun getting 100 in soul magic lets him respec his stats in such a way as to allow him to enter/exit the "forge frenzy" state at will?

      It could just let him do that directly.  Or perhaps Arthur (who did successfully do this) simply leveled his essentialism, and then grabbed some poor sap who was in a forge frenzy, read his mind to find the necessary state, and imposed that state onto himself?  After all, he was king and could do damm near whatever he wanted.

      On a related note, other plausible options at Essentialism 100:

      *  Force unlock of skills + level them up -> Spirit, Library Magic, etc (perhaps this is temporary, in which case he might be able to get hints about how to unlock them for real, or how useful/worthwhile they are)
      *   Add extra bones, or increase bone mass in various places.  Whatever it takes to get extra kick out of them!
      *   Hack your body to have higher metabolism, if it means more energy / some other advantage
      *   Inspect Fallatehrs goons -- they surely have some soul hacking going on, learn from what was applied to them.

      Another random thought -- Fenn can now do the same bone magic trick, too.  If she can't copy her bones over, she certainly can let Joon do it for her.

    ```
    The terminology might be a little bit off, given that was written from memory (as it should be, in character).

    The [Smith set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_set) is the smallest non-empty set of all candidates who have pairwise victories over all candidates outside the set. For example, if you have three voters voting for three candidates:

        A>B>C
        B>C>A
        C>B>A

    ... then A loses to B and C in pairwise elections, C wins against A and loses against B, and B wins against C and A, meaning that B is the only member of the Smith set.

    Normal instant-runoff voting sometimes selects a winner outside the Smith set, which means that it doesn't meet the [Smith criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_criterion). By first finding the Smith set, then doing IRV within it, the winner will always be within the Smith set.

      > the smallest non-empty set of all candidates

      Okay, those words answer my confusion. I was concerned that if A B and C formed a Smith set, someone could rig a Smith set with just A and B, unfairly excluding C. "All" answers that. I was also concerned that there might be other forms of arbitrariness in privileging one possible set over another, but in a vague way that is reassured somehow by the word "smallest". Thanks.

  This chapter was interesting, but chapter 75 actually interested me more. But first, having all that game layer info compiled in one place is a really good idea, but a lot of it is still missing. The Achievements, like that the Petit Mort and Key for seven locks mentioned in the next chapter. (the Key achievement really have to be sex with each companion, or is the unlock requirement context sensitive to the type of relationship Joon has with each one)

  The Primary and secondary stat requirements are spread out all over the chapters. Also the virtues he has gained for the various skills.

  But mostly, I want to know more about the things the quests have been hinting at been discussed previously? The Celestar has been brought up several times, as a land mark and the place the elves came from in multiple waves. In the world, it's not a secret. And I know nothing about that part of the setting. That is something I do not like about how the detail this story goes into. What I like about another story, Mother of Learning, is you read it an go, "that is a world you could make RPG supplement for, a world someone could run a campaign in"

  It has a depth this story lacks. This story go so far into omitting 'unnecessary' detail, that the world comes off as piecemeal and broken. where everything outside the casts immediate area is just an empty facade.

  I don't know what the celestar looks like. I don't know if it was a natural moon that was once habitable but now isn't, or if it was an artificial worldlet that was broken beyond repair. I know know why the elves came down in waves, and why each wave of refugees is considered a different type of elves. I want to know all these things more than I want to read about a date.

  I want to see the exclusion principle gone over in some depth. How are things excluded, why are things excluded, what things can and cannot be excluded? Are things excluded for political reasons (as opposed to an existential threat to the world), what happens if people disagree with exclusion, can you reverse an exclusion?

  If 'Captain Blue-in-the-Bottle' is in an exclusion zone, and things excluded cannot go outside the zone, why should anyone outside care about the Z-word being his? What does it being 'his' word mean in practical terms? Something people living in the setting would be aware of, something the reader doesn't.

  Things like this make the story seem like the Writers of Lost got involved. They hint at a deeper intracy to the world, and deliver nothing but a lot of hanging threads.

  Not something that we should already know, but something that should be investigated, Luck. How does it work, especially in relationship to Joon? That not picking up a sword, until you finally do, then using it perfectly sounds like gaining a skill at its skill cap from 0. That sounds really good if he is playing around with skill level swapping. Since he can raise his luck score is that something he can do? he can see Fenns character sheet, and his own. He could find her luck represented on the sheet, and his, and figure out how much luck it takes to have the luck she does.

  The Doris, Issue, Instead of soulfucking her, what about Looking at a Doris, finding her probabilistic magic in the soul sheets, and copying it onto yourself as a temporary adjustment? Also, did you mean an area a thousand miles square (1,000 miles x 1,000 miles), or a thousand square miles? 1,000 square miles is less than a 32x32 mile area. That seems small for over 9 million Dorisis. I don't know if that is possible without modern infrastructure and supply lines. How does she feed herself? Unless Doris's are being created as food for other Doris's?

  Can I just say I really, really, really dislike the "harem" angle that keeps getting pushed? This is a wonderful story, and I'll still read it... but I'm going to stop recommending it to friends at this point. It's somewhere between "distracting from the best part of the story" and "borderline disgusting."

  I've been DMing since I was 10, and I really enjoy both the concept of being in an amalgam of created worlds and the idea of the game overlay. Your writing style is also just downright satisfying.

  But... damn, man. I really wish you hadn't started ridiculously playing up the angle that overshadows the reasons I like the story in the first place. It feels like that time someone in my games *insisted* that they play a class from The Book of Erotic Fantasy. D&D isn't a great place to solve sexual dysfunction. The worlds just don't mesh well.

  Edit: Well, looks like a lot of people here just really enjoy reading about a man surrounded by women who are at risk of being devolved into nothing more than a variety of fucks.

    A tabletop group I was part of a few years ago had a DM who... let's just say, was quite a bit less mature (and several years younger) than many members of the group. Usually it was fine... until he would do something that just made us go "Dude, wtf?" And not in a "Oh, I'm delightfully horrified at the implications" way, but in a "Why do you think including rapey slime monsters was a good idea?" It was a conflict between players and the DM, where the DM wanted to add some sexual stuff that the players (and our characters) had nooooo interest in. We managed to bypass most of it, but boy was aggravating.

    I see this story as something similar. The meta-DM has its own values and prompts - it clearly is pushing the harem angle. The characters though? 

    * Juniper clearly wants no part of it. He's been Team Fenn since they first got together. 

    * Fenn clearly doesn't want it - it makes her insecure. 

    * Mary clearly doesn't want it, but had resigned herself to possibly needing to do so until she found out about the symbiotic loyalty link. They had a great chat discussing exactly why she would put up with being a love interest, but was relieved it didn't have to happen. 

    * Grak... ha, no. Considering Grak left da nad hometown to avoid a Kiss (Cloacal-style) with da nad bondmate? Nope. And even if Grak was down, Juniper clearly isn't.

    * Six-Eyed Doe? No way. Juniper doesn't want it. And we have no idea what SED wants, or if it can even express it.

    * Val is like a child, and despite being Juniper-bait, he's made it clear that he's not interested in pursuing/taking advantage. She simply doesn't know any better.

    I feel like the "harem angle" is being deliberately denied by the characters despite a DM that pushes it, and deconstructed in the cases of characters like Mary and Grak (and even SED, for laughs in this last chapter). If this is a self-insert, CRJ is Juniper, not the DM. A good player counters a bad DM.

    Your edit says: " women who are at risk of being devolved into nothing more than a variety of fucks." I am honestly curious, after 76 chapters, whom do you see Juniper "fucking" besides Fenn? I feel like you're reading into this something that, so far, has not happened and has shown no chance of happening.

      You and I have differing views on the concept of how much an author is beholden to the situations they create. You seem to be pushing the perspective that it is not the fault of the author for these tacked-on character traits. He is only responsible for Joon. That seems overtly wrong. The author has created this world full of fascinating concepts, interesting rules, and... oh, wait, is that a new female companion? Looks like they'll be naked and ready for sex all the time.

      I bring this up because I just read through the whole thing again, and I couldn't help but notice that it was easy to just meet a new companion and assume that they would both have a reason to be naked near Joon often ("they're just quirky", photosynthesis, demon possession, even "I can see them naked via the soul") and would be a potential sex target (history of insecurity, free love, political reasons, or obsession). If you remove those tacked-on artifacts, they're all fairly interesting characters. Which makes it grate when the world seems to be trying to actively reduce them into "something to be fucked" (which was my intention with the phrase you mentioned). Even Grak doesn't actually escape that harem pattern, achievement aside, because he serves as a token sorta-male without being sexually threatening.

      Since the topic of anime and isekai style has come up, it reminds me somewhat of the divide between women designed to be "sex targets" and ones that are full characters in their own right. Mikasa from Attack on Titan is a great example. When asked whether Mikasa would ever be in a relationship during the series, the author said something like "it's an insult to her character that you assume she needs to be with someone by default - she is her own person, and it would distract from who she is." I don't think that is necessary for every character, but tacking on a "being naked near my self-insert character" and "being ready and willing for sex with my self-insert character" for EVERY member of a team makes this story into something that it really, really shouldn't be trying to be. It's overtly distasteful, and I can't in good conscience recommend it to friends anymore.

      At this point, it's distracting so much from the story that even if the final twist is something like "the DM is actually Arthur and he's taking a sort of revenge on Joon for what he views as a betrayal with Tiff," it wouldn't exactly matter. It would just read like an excuse for having a tit-shot and an implied offer in what feels like damn near every chapter.

        I don't understand where you're getting the idea that the characters are being reduced to sex objects, when it seems to me that the author is taking great pains to do the opposite. Yeah, the harem trope has been brought up...so that it can be very forcefully and explicitly deconstructed/subverted. I get that you might prefer a story where it wasn't touched on at all, but this is a story about narratives, and this is a pretty common narrative that is worth addressing. If you see the characters as nothing more than "sex targets" that might be more of a problem with your interpretation than with how they are actually being presented.

        And to be clear, I would completely share your objections if I thought this was actually going to turn into a story of Joon and his harem. I just don't think that's happening/going to happen, although I could very well be wrong of course.

          I don't *predict* that it's going that way. I have *already observed* the manner in which the "harem" concept is being used specifically to cheapen characters. 

          It's the web fiction version of "oh no she tripped over me while coming out of the shower and now her towel is on the ground and we're on the floor together." 

          Instead, it's "I met a new girl who is bound to me for life, is my age, attractive, enjoys being naked around me for a contrived reason, and regularly ensures that I know she is available for sex."

          It's... out of place for such an otherwise well-written bit of fiction.

            It feels like you're pushing your personal aversion to harems and more specifically polyamory onto the narrative. You're preemptively assuming every group member's only purpose is "something to be fucked" because the narrative is throwing poorly disguised sexual tension at Joon at every corner (and a reminder that he is a teenager here). Also, the bastardized concept of 'harem' isn't just a contrivance found in lousy wish-fulfillment literature or anime. Why does it have to be a cheap road to sex rather than an interesting exploration/deconstruction on sexual tension in a typical harem situation? The harem angle and interesting characters aren't mutually exclusive. 

            You opine that "D&D isn't a great place to solve sexual dysfunction" when D&D is actually a great place to solve anything. It is a *social* game in an open world: you can stage any type of discussion you like.

            You're getting sucked into the DMs pace then. The DM is pushing it. The author has other plans. The whole point is that it's awkward. CRJ was Leary of self insert lit for it's notoriously bad tropes. He has a plan to invert this trope just you wait.

    If I map this story-and-comment onto HPMOR, my response would be 'You do know that Yudkowsky is not Harry, right?'.

    That response doesn't work so well for a LitRPG self-insert story. Instead:

    > I was still pissed off at the game when I woke up in the morning.

    The author insert *objects*. It seems to me you're confusing the author for the *mysterious game layer* instead of the protagonist. This isn't even the first time the game layer has been less-than-ideally-aligned.

    (To be clear, at the object level I think I agree with you that I don't desire to see the story go there, but I disagree with the claim that it's already done so or overshadowed anything.)

    Mapping this back onto HPMOR again, maybe this is a hint at the nature of the game. A deep and thorough simulation, populated by a sophisticated world-builder (and what it could take from our protagonist), adequately grafted with an RPG-type skill and combat system, and with achievements generated in the ... how did [reaper7876 call it](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7x3ifv/rtwip_worth_the_candle_ch_76_date_night_start/du5cbba/)... isekai style?

    My other response is 'this is a serial, maybe later developments satisfy your concern'.

    > are at risk of being devolved

    I anticipate such a low chance of this happening. Especially if you mean something the author does wrong and not just something weird happening to the game-within-a-story.
