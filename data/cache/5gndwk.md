  Here's some notable fics from my ff.net favourites that you all might like, minus the already well known /r/rational favourites like Lighting Up the Dark, Animorphs: The Reckoning, The Metropolitan Man, Pokemon: The Origin of Species, and so on. 

  **Excellent:**

  [Prince of the Dark Kingdom](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom)  by Mizuni-sama - Ten years ago, Voldemort created his kingdom. Now a confused young wizard stumbles into it, and carves out a destiny. AU. Nondark Harry. MentorVoldemort. VII Ch.8 In which someone is dead, wounded, or kidnapped in every scene.

  [Alexandra Quick and the Lands Below](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4684861/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Lands-Below) By: Inverarity - Book II of the Alexandra Quick series. Seventh grader Alexandra Quick returns to Charmbridge Academy.

  [Team 8](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2731239/1/Team-8)  by S'TarKan - What if Naruto had been selected for a different team? What if he'd had a different mentor? Who would guess the consequences would be so large?

  **Very good:**

  [A Black Comedy](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy)  by nonjon - COMPLETE. Two years after defeating Voldemort, Harry falls into an alternate dimension with his godfather. Together, they embark on a new life filled with drunken debauchery, thievery, and generally antagonizing all their old family, friends, and enemies.

  [The Substitute](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4641394/1/The-Substitute) by BajaB - The magical contract made by the Goblet of Fire inadvertently sets underway events that change everything you thought you knew about the boy-who-lived. AU GOF, depressing and a bit dark.

  [Crime and Commitment](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11626470/1/Crime-and-Commitment) By serpentguy -  Taylor had always had doubts about what she was doing, even after she had changed her mind on being a superhero. What might have happened if she had focused on all the good she could do if she approached law and order from the other direction? What might have happened if she had given being a supervillain her full commitment?

  [The Changeling](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling) by Annerb - Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why. In-progress.

  [Retsu's Folly](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5543906/1/Retsu-s-Folly)  by nuhuh - It all goes wrong when Dumbledore gives Harry the choice to go back and fight Voldemort or move on.

  **Worthwhile reads:**

  [People Lie](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3745099/1/People-Lie)  by Nugar - Lies have power. They can change a simple-minded believer into a two-faced schemer and a timid follower into a fanatical devotee. They can change a child angry at the world into a man consumed by more than vengeance. But that power is a lie as well.

  [Slaughterhouse Nine Power Taylor](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11047152/1/Slaughterhouse-Nine-Power-Taylor-One-Shots): One-ShotsBy: Thinker6 - Short stories in which Taylor Hebert gets powers from the Slaughterhouse Nine.

  [The Howling Wind](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8550403/1/THW)  by JMenace reviews - (Being rewritten) Naruto's chakra is warped at birth. Instead of strengthening his body and mind, it shrieks and wails like wind through his coils. Thrust into a war of ruthless shinobi and roaming Bijuu, he'll need the resolve to fight through his greatest weakness and survive- or, the determination to make it his greatest strength and win. (Lovecraftian AU)

  [Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbonë](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7287278/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Forests-of-Valbon%C3%AB)  by enembee - Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them.

  [Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8197451/1/Fantastic-Elves-and-Where-to-Find-Them)  by evansentranced - After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.


  **Junkfood-tier fics:** 

  [Dimension Hopping for Beginners](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2829366/1/Dimension-Hopping-for-Beginners)  by nonjon - COMPLETE. In the heat of the battle, he swore a blood oath to defeat Voldemort in every form. But when you factor in his understanding and abilities to travel to alternate dimensions, it presented the sort of problem only a Harry Potter could have.

  [Hope Through Overwhelming Firepower](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9912044/) By: Border42 - The smallest act or difference can be all that is needed to change the future. Now Diebuster!Taylor stands to make more than small or simple changes for the future of mankind.

  [The Lie I've Lived](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived)  by jbern - Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

  Some notable fics from my spacebattles and sufficient velocities watched list, descriptions taken from /r/wormfanfic :

  **Excellent:**

  [Mixed Feelings](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/mixed-feelings-worm-oc.375923/) (Worm OC) by Kittius -  OC with a traumatic past and rich internal voice and depth of personality runs into canon characters and completely misunderstands them and their world. Not too much action, but a great deal of character and interesting interactions.

  [Dire Worm!](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dire-worm-worm-au-oc.300816/) by Lost Demiurge. A hammy, competent and interesting OC from a different setting shows up in Worm and turns everything upside-down with her particular blend of villainy-but-ultimately-for-the-greater-good greatness. Dire is one of my favorite OCs in all Wormfic.

  **Very Good:**

  [Playing with Lego's](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/playing-with-legos-worm-supcom.377328/unread) [Worm/SupCom] by Potato Nose - Taylor gets the Tinker(-like) power of the Seraphim faction from Supreme Commander.

  [El-Ahrairah](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/el-ahrairah-worm.372987/) (Thinker!Taylor) - Thinker Taylor with the ability to see powers joins Cauldron.


  **Worthwhile:**

  [Mass Effect/Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/mass-effect-sid-meiers-alpha-centauri.221597/) by LordsFire - Weird, humorous crossover with no real plot. Really well written

  [Co-op Mode](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/co-op-mode-worm-the-gamer-si.354578/) by Faria_Lyton. An OC joins forces with Taylor (who has her own parallel story, A Bug in the Game) with his absurd Gamer-based powers. Thoroughly entertaining, and building up to good things, if a bit slowly.

  [That Gnawing Worm, Cancer](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/that-gnawing-worm-cancer-worm-au.29151/) [Worm AU] by Nugar - Taylor with relatively weak but non manton limited telekinesis. And terminal brain cancer. Surprisingly light tone. Petty and bitter Taylor makes for some fun moments.
  Heavy AU allowing for more focus on smaller scale stuff.

  [Aberration](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/aberration-worm-d-d.369992/unread) (Worm, D&D) by themanwhowas -  A D&D OC gets shoved into Worm, joins the Merchants, and things escalate. A lot. Still ongoing, currently on a bit of a break while I sort things out with my life, but I'd be happy to get more eyes on the story as encouragement to keep writing.

  [H+ Mayhem](https://forums.spacebattles.com/watched/threads/all) (Worm) by Jurric - Bio-tinker OC is Bonesaw's brother. Uses a combat software called Mayhem that he can cede control to which is absurdly capable. Spends most of his time trying to figure out what the other side of him is up to.

  [Nightingale](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/nightingale-worm-dnd-bard-taylor.381918/) (Worm/DnD bard!Taylor) -  In which Taylor takes up barding… wait what? That’s not what barding means. DnD 5E Bard!Taylor

  [A Cloudy Path](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-cloudy-path-worm-supreme-commander.3604) is one of the best (and longest) Worm fics out there. Taylor triggers as a tinker with Aeon tech from Supreme Commander. Don't need to know anything about Supcom for the fic.

      Yeah, that's a pretty big bummer. In my opinion it and the Alexandra Quick series are maybe the best works to come out of the HP fandom, even surpassing the HP books in some ways. Besides having better worldbuilding, they manage to explore some meaningful themes while retaining a lot of that weird, whimsical quirkiness that first made HP popular. I'll never forgive rowling for the shift in tone after book 5, or for making the climax of the series into a hackneyed christ metaphor...

      - u/chaosmosis:

    - u/None:
      ```
      (Replying more to /u/GlueBoy, but this seems a thread for it).

      Tried to read this story, almost done. Didn't enjoy it tbh. The Voldemort seems too OOC even before [spoiler](#s "soul completion ritual"), too forgiving and not insane (like in canon) at all. The take on politics inside Britain (specifically [spoiler](#s "werewolves") ) is interesting, while the international politics seems a bit cartoonish and bland.

      I really liked the exploits of [spoiler](#s "Tom"), since I like stories like 'The 7th Horcrux'.  Also, WYRA seemed like a major topic at the beginning, I wish that storyline would be developed more.

      However you can only stand the same pattern of [spoiler](#s "Harry escaping somewhere, doing dumb shit, being rescued by Voldemort or Snape, being given a formal punishment, not suffering any consequences, repeat") over and over and over a limited number of times. That's the worst flaw -- I stopped caring for Harry mid-way.

      [Spoiler](#s "Paganism") is a major topic of the fic, and while it augments the HP universe, adding a new dimension to the system of magic (Not unlike the Spirit World in Avatar: The Last Airbender; the ultimate plot device), I sometimes questioned if it in this story more because of author's beliefs. (Like Christianity in Ginny Weasley and the Sealed Intelligence.)

      Oh, and also almost all of the relationships between Harry and peers are overshadowed by relationships between Harry and adults, so the all the student characters feel unimportant.
      ```

      - u/GlueBoy:
        ```
        I liked it in large part because of the OOC Voldemort, to be honest. Besides it being a nice change to have a voldemort that's not a cartoonishly evil psychopathic villain, I don't think it strains belief that this is how he would be if he had won the war. That is, a charismatic, ruthlessly pragmatic, and power hungry despot with a healthy appreciation for his image. 

        Regarding the pagan stuff, IIRC the author stated that her reasoning for adding the pagan stuff was to have a more believable motivation behind the first war (as part of a greater "saving our culture" kind of thing, anyway). Racism *is* a pretty stupid reason to violently overthrow a government you already completely dominate anyway.

        I won't defend PotDK too much, as I haven't read it in so long. It's very possible nostalgia colors my opinion of this fic. Having said that, I know for a fact that 8-9 years ago when I started reading it it was a cut above everything else, significantly so. Having nuanced characters(particularly villains), every "book" having an actual plot(the number 1 sin of fan fiction!), character progression and growth, foreshadowing, and so much more was (and still is) very, very rare in amateur fiction.
        ```

    I haven't read Team 8, but have read and quite enjoyed S'Tarkan's other major work, Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Future Past. Unfortunately both are unfinished due to the medical situation of the author - but he continues to give assurances that they're not abandoned :).

    As mentioned in another thread, NoFP isn't strictly a rational work, but it has a lot of "adult re-examines canon childhood through a critical lens", which may appeal to this subreddit.
    ```

    - u/GlueBoy:
      ```
      S'Tarkan is an excellent writer, but I don't tend to recommend NoFP. I can't stomach when in time travel stories the MC is an adult in a child/teenager's body and has romantic relationships with other children/teenagers. It's just plain... squicky(for lack of a better word).  The proper attitude, IMO, is to see the current iteration of your long lost love as a new person, and move the fuck on. Be sure not to engage in 'grooming', as well. 

      Having said that, I understand why most people seem to overlook its immorality, as the circumstances that lead to it are purely fictional. 

      That actually reminds me of this really weird subplot in 'Door into Summer' by Heinlein, written in 1957 and set in 1970. In the novel the MC gets cryo frozen for 30 years, finds out he's going to marry the daughter of his best friend(whom he only knew as a pre-pubescent girl), goes back in time, picks her up from girls scouts(!), and tells her to go get cryo frozen when she turns 21 so they can meet again. She might or might not be an orphan at that time, lol. 

      There's also this really funny scene where he single-handedly invents robots and then teaches it the intricacies of all household chores in like an afternoon, no programming required. It always tickes me when reading classic SF how optimistic the authors were about technological progress.
      ```

      - u/ATRDCI:
        ```
        Yeah the "squiky" issues in NoFP are something that one has to take or leave with that sort of fic. (Actually I think it does open up interesting possibilities as to "who" the time traveler is in regards to identity (mind of old Harry vs mind of young Harry vs physical chemical-producing body of young Harry) but I haven't seen a fic explore that aspect very well.) To be honest, I enjoy Team 8 much more regardless of squick issues. At this point, NoFP seems to be a bland mixture of Time Traveller Harry tropes.  This is a credit to its legacy since it essentially kick-started that whole genre for Harry Potter fanfiction, but that doesn't make it easier to read.

        Actually since you recommend a couple of nonjon fics, I'd recommend the Where In The World Is Harry Potter series, which I think is just as good as A Black Comedy.  Admittedly in regards to dramatic tension it's junk food, but that really isn't what it is about.  I find it really funny and to be the best portrayal of, among others, Nicholas Flamel I've read.

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        >  The proper attitude, IMO, is to see the current iteration of your long lost love as a new person

        Actually the author and Harry show awareness of this problem, and Harry does make some effort to avoid it, except he has PTSD and therefore isn't very good at handling relationships, plus his emotional development was rather stunted by a long war. And he *is* trying to befriend Ginny at an earlier age, as he does for most of the people he knew. And he attempts to give Ginny her space and let things happen or not naturally, despite literally killing himself to come back in time and save her, because he knows he should respect her independence from the Ginny in the previous timeline. I find their friendship an interesting part of the story, but YMMV. Have you read all of it (that has been written)?

  [*Now* you can celebrate the one-year anniversary of these threads](https://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5bay45/monthly_recommendation_thread/d9n2mfg/)--[from 2015-12-05 to 2016-12-05](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/monthlyrecommendation).

  ---

  *[The Invasion of America](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/52038)* and *[The Conquest of America](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8684)* are two very fun pieces of anti-pacifism/-isolationism propaganda. Each book was published in 1916 and depicts an invasion of the USA--by a vague "Great Coalition" in *Invasion*, and by Germany (which has just won the Great War) in *Conquest*. In order to back up its claims of how pathetically weak the US military was at the time, *Invasion* includes 173 endnotes! *Conquest*, on the other hand, is much more casual and adventurous in tone, and enlists Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla, Alberto Santos-Dumont, and other such illustrious people in order to save the US from European imperialism.

  A brief summary of *Invasion* and a detailed timeline of *Conquest* (including links to the Wikipedia pages of most of the famous people featured in the story) are available [here](http://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/403306).

  I'm not sure how the readers here will react to this recommendation, but it's one of my favorite stories and it's on a weird site to find quality literature, so here it is:

  [Dream Drive](https://www.literotica.com/stories/memberpage.php?uid=2065995&page=submissions) by Over_Red, over on Literotica.

  Yes, there is word porn. No, you don't need to read it to enjoy the story. It's a SciFi/Fantasy story focusing on Virtual Reality in a somewhat-dystopian future.

  Jackson Vedalt is a gamer/tech nerd specializing in hardware modding who wins a chance to be one of the first few people in the world to play a new multiplayer VR Fantasy game called Isis. He quickly discovers that this 'VR' game is a bit... too real. So real, in fact, that he retains his abilities back in the 'real world'.

  The characters are well-written, the plot moves fairly quickly, and what is written has a very satisfying two-part conclusion of epic proportions. Also, the word porn is great if you're into that.

  I've been continually surprised to find great stories over the years on Literotica that would be a delight to read with no sex scenes, and this is the best one of the bunch in my opinion.

    > I've been continually surprised to find great stories over the years on Literotica 

    I too will admit to reading literary erotica for the sake of sharing quality reading material. 

    First I highly recommend any of the [long stories by Al Steiner ](http://storiesonline.net/a/Al_Steiner) over at stories online.net. He does dwell on some Marx inspired political opinions a bit too much. He's kind of an inverse Ayn Rand in that sense, but unlike her his erotic words are excellent. [A Perfect World](http://storiesonline.net/s/43998/a-perfect-world) starts off his series based around a Martian independence movement and features **some of the most realistic near-current-tech space combat I've ever read**.

    I also highly recommend [Nick Scipio's Summer Camp series](http://www.nickscipio.com/main.html), though updates to the final book have been slow of late. It's a **coming of age story** about Paul who grows up spending summers **at a nudist camp** with his parents. Don't get turned off too quickly by the incest tag--none of it gets all the way around the bases and it's over pretty early in the series.

    Well, it's a power difference thing, right? There's only a couple characters that can tell the new gods to fuck off, maybe twice that that could chastise the first group (and it happens sometimes, it's not like Arachne is never opposed by anyone).

  I recently finished *[The Traitor Baru Cormorant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23444482-the-traitor-baru-cormorant)* and it struck me as a highly rational novel. 

  **Summary**: As a child, Baru's sleepy village is economically, and later, politically annexed by the Masquarade, a vast empire. She finds the Empire's knowledge fascinating, but the more she learns, the more her people's ways are subjugated by the Empire's dictates. By the time she reaches adulthood, she's aware the Empire is too vast and powerful to challenge outright, and so she resolves to join its bureaucracy and remake it from within.

  There were a number of good quotes from it I highlighted in my kindle copy. My favorite:

  > *“The sword kills,” Baru recited, trying to remember the Handbook of Manumission, its arguments for revolutionary zeal. “But the arm moves the sword. Is the arm to blame for murder? No. The mind moves the arm. Is the mind to blame? No. The mind has sworn an oath to duty, and that duty moves the mind, as written by the Throne. So it is that a servant of the Throne is blameless.”*

  Keeping with my theme of only playing videogames that run on Linux because I'm too lazy to dual-boot, I've recently been playing [Ladykiller in a Bind](http://ladykillerinabind.com/)

  It's an erotic visual novel with an interesting game mechanic (you can download a [demo here](http://scoutshonour.com/files/Ladykiller%20in%20a%20Bind%20teaser.zip) to see how it plays like): If you don't like the dialogue options, you can choose to be quiet and hope that you(r player character) can think of something better to say. But if you wait too long you might cause an awkward silence or you might lose an opportunity. In this way it mirrors the tension of a real conversation.

  That tension is important because the complexity of the social manipulation and plotting in the game is somewhere between Death Note and HPMOR's Three Armies arc. It's not as educational as *A Girl Corrupted by the Internet is the Summoned Hero*, but it does occasionally make some insightful commentary on the social dynamics and the writing is overall funny in a clever way.

  I've recently discovered there are a whole bunch of Legends of Ethshar books by Lawrence Watt-Evans available for Kindle that I haven't previously read, so I've been binging on those.

  I think they'd appeal to this reddit. I wouldn't call it rational per se, but they generally have fairly intelligent characters who are more inclined to solve problems by thinking through them and judiciously using the tools at hand than by brute force or hero logic. The world building is interesting too. It has, um, I think seven different magic systems in world, which works surprisingly well.

  > When Rosemary Harper joins the crew of the Wayfarer, she isn't expecting much. The Wayfarer, a patched-up ship that's seen better days, offers her everything she could possibly want: a small, quiet spot to call home for a while, adventure in far-off corners of the galaxy, and distance from her troubled past.

  >But Rosemary gets more than she bargained for with the Wayfarer. The crew is a mishmash of species and personalities, from Sissix, the friendly reptillian pilot, to Kizzy and Jenks, the constantly sparring engineers who keep the ship running. Life on board is chaotic, but more or less peaceful - exactly what Rosemary wants.

  >Until the crew are offered the job of a lifetime: the chance to build a hyperspace tunnel to a distant planet. They'll earn enough money to live comfortably for years... if they survive the long trip through war-torn interstellar space without endangering any of the fragile alliances that keep the galaxy peaceful.

  >But Rosemary isn't the only person on board with secrets to hide, and the crew will soon discover that space may be vast, but spaceships are very small indeed.

  The book is great. It's like Firefly, with less shooting and piracy, and more weird aliens.
