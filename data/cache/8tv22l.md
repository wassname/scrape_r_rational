  This is a really strong start. Plus, I've always had a soft-spot for skelly-wizards.

    Thank you! I hope to deliver more of that in the coming chapters.

  Ok, I like this. The in medias res opening is a little confusing at first, but it works and it gets the attention of the reader. 

  I can tel that our protagonist is at least slightly paranoid, but I'm not sure how confused he is at his predicament. Am I right to anticipate that the next chapter will start with a look in the mirror and some more background? (Or failing that,  then directly after contactingthe police?)

    Thanks! I recognize that there's a lot of exposition to go along with any constructed fantasy world, so I wanted to introduce everything pretty quickly. You are correct to assume that, yes, there will at least be a short period of calm in order to establish background, context, etc. 

    Thanks for reading, I'm glad you enjoyed!

  Please keep this going. This is awesome! There are too few magic systems based in biology, which is a shame because biology is awesome.

  Great work!
  ```

    Thanks! I admit, my knowledge of biology is limited to what I can look up online and what I can remember of secondary school, but I hope to deliver something interesting nonetheless.

      Perhaps you should consider getting a beta reader well versed in biology, or maybe starting some kind of chat room (are chat rooms still a thing these days) with a few biologists to brainstorm biologically plausible ideas? There are probably plenty of biologists kicking around this sub-reddit; I can´t be the only one!
      Edit: Also, it was pretty clever of you to pick a bone wizard as the main character then; that´s probably the most interesting specialization that can do the most fun things with limited author expertise.

      Also a Biologist! I am willing to help if you need it.

  Just a suggestion, but when discussing “the surgery” at the beginning maybe mention that as an bone mage he gets along with or complements /disagrees with or naturally conflicts with /doesn’t have much to do with the other schools of magic to sorta get the names and concepts out there

  Edit: no I’m not just suggesting this because I’m intrigued and want to know more about the setting :p

  Nice start. I like how it's looking so far.

    Thank you!

  Typos:

  "amusing to trap in a psychedelic haze"
  trap what?
  ```

  - u/VilhalmFeidhlim:
    ```
    Amusing to trap Aswen himself in a psychedelic haze, sorry.

    Thanks for pointing that out, will get round to revising that soon.
    ```
