## Challenge: What can /r/rational glean from this disguised lore dump?

### Post:

I'm trying to make a setting for a game I'm going to GM and it's weird enough my players will probably want some context walking in. So I wrote a series of short story snippets set in that universe for them to read.

I'd appreciate /r/rational helping me test it out by trying to figure out whatever they can about the setting from what I wrote. If you have any constructive criticism along the way, that's appreciated too.

A lot of the basic info *is* handed to the reader on a platter but I'm curious to see how far people can get. Keep in mind that, while not exactly unreliable, the narrators have limitations and flaws.  
  
> # The Lost Lands  
>  
>Here are some story snippets to give a taste of the Lost Lands. None of them are exactly 'canonical' to the setting, so much as things that could plausibly have happened. The snipped come from a variety of times and places, so it would be hard to encounter situations similar to more than one of these in any single campaign. The stories are also mostly designed to inform readers rather than be a representative sample of the world.  
>  
>There's less total human-habitable 'land' area in the Lost Lands than Europe but the actual setting is very "large" in a way that's hard to explain (without an annoying amount of math), hopefully the snippets can capture that better.

>> This is particularly evident in the different creation myths found across the Lost Lands. Examining a widely collected corpus of these myths, a collection which would not exist without the work of Damho and her followers, will reveal a number of key thematic and structural elements that span cultures and times.  
>>  
>>The most interesting of these shared elements is the fall from the unending lands. This theme usually claims that the species of humanity used to live in a single unending volume. This land was of such abundance that it could support as many as a thousand cities with hundreds of miles between them. Additionally, each of those cities were said to support at least a hundred thousand people without struggle for food or places to live. While those numbers are clear exaggerrations, as you'll find in any story told over generations, it does set the unending lands as a kind of paradise.  
>>  
>>Of course, such a paradise must lead to a fall from grace. In this case it was humanity's lack of respect for the unending place they had. Through magic and trickery the people of this land stole its space believing it would never run out. They ripped it into volumes they could carry with them or into private spaces that could not be observed. They built gates between the unending where they lived and the spaces they hoarded for themselves. This continued until the unending lands was unable to support itself and finally shattered into a million spaces, leaving the gates to wander from space to space searching for targets that no longer existed.  
>>  
>>Despite its simplicity, this ur-myth does make a number of predictions relevant to the study of volumetrics. Things like glass bubbles, which seem to be embedded in a visible but inacessible larger volume, lend credence to the idea that volumes could be created by ripping space from elsewhere. Similarly, careful studies of gate-dynamics seem to show that some gates preferentially attach to specific volumes as if they're still somewhat bound to a location. We can even interpret the collapse of the unending as a system being perturbed out of a high-potential rest state and forced to move a much lower-potential, and therefore much more stable, rest state. If our smaller volumes are very stable it would explain why, despite the theoretical feasiblity, magic cannot manipulate volumes unless backed by the sheer power of a well-established god in each location. Why these manipulations require at least two *different* gods, that's still unclear.

>>I sat down at a corner table and ordered a drink. Things really were looking up for me. It'd been two days since I had figured out how to hide the tainted mana I was leaking, and it looked like I had dropped my tail. Sure, I was just trapping that mana under my aura but that's a longer term problem. It takes a decent while for passive mana to poison you and getting somewhere safe was more urgent. Trying to preform ad-hoc surgery when patron-knows-what is following you is a bad idea. Especially since I'd drop my aura if I went under.  
>>  
>>Still, I'm in a good place. Velsford seems like the last stop in the danger conga, so I've got a lot more choices from here. If I can just keep to my plan, keep anyone from getting under my aura, and make it twenty more hops from this bubble, I'd be free and clear.  
>>  
>>I mean, good lord, twenty random jumps and there's a million bubbles I could be in. If I'm not being tracked bubble by bubble, there's no way anyone can find me. Not to mention, I'll be far enough away that no doctor will have heard of the Concord. Then I can talk to one without having to worry about them cutting my throat on the table.  
>>  
>>Then I noticed someone on the other side of the tavern talking. I tried to ignore it, but there are some things you just have to pay attention to.  
>>  
>>"Friends! This is why you should be proud to be one of our nation! You've seen the power we wield, yet our rulers seem afraid to wield it." said the lady standing on a table as her audience cheered.  
>>  
>>"I'm tired of 'deterrence' and 'strategic posture'." She said the words as if they were poison. "We should take back what's ours and make sure the Venden can't ever insult us again."  
>>  
>>Thirty seconds later I had pushed my way through the crowd and was right in front of the fucker. This was when I noticed that she had stopped ranting and the entire crowd was staring at me.  
>>  
>>You know how hard it is to speak impromptu in front of crowd? Especially when you care about the topic? Now imagine that, except you have to speak about atrocities of war. Oh, and these specific atrocities have a deep personal significance to you. By the way, your audience was just rallying behind the idea of doing the same thing to even more innocents.  
>>  
>>Well, I had the floor. Everyone was waiting for me to say something. So I did the reasonable thing: collected my arguments, figured out how to make my case to a bunch of people who'd probably kill me if they knew where I'm from, and got ready to rebut this asshole's propaganda.  
>>  
>>Oh wait, that's not what I did.  
>>  
>>Nope, what I actually did was panic. Punched the bitch straight out. One moment she was staring right at me, wondering who the fuck I was. The next there was a thud and she was out like a log.  
>>  
>>Thankfully the crowd expected that as much as I had. Sure, their collective expression had morphed from "Who's this dude?" to "Did he just punch that girl out?!" but I'd take it. I was just lucky this wasn't back home. There I'd have already been dog-piled for punching a girl, wouldn't matter why.  
>>  
>>Here that wasn't a thing, so I had a second to start talking.  
>>  
>>"Really!? You people think having an S-Cannon is a good idea!? This girl's been playing you for fools and you're just going to eat it up?  
>>  
>>"Come on, we're better than that. Just think about it.  
>>  
>>"What happens when you fire a severance cannon?"  
>>  
>>Crickets. Staring. I'm lucky it was a rhetorical question.  
>>  
>>"Right, the entire chain of planar bubbles between the cannon and the targeting beacon is 'severed'. Every jump between those planes and anywhere else gets cut. Except for, and this is the part she was leaving out, the jumps that are on the chain.  
>>  
>>"So you fire the thing. What have you got?"  
>>  
>>Three people start answering and immediately stop again. Presumably to politely let one of the others go ahead. Thankfully, I am better than them and therefore have no such weaknesses. Meaning I was free to barrel on in my valiant effort to not realize how fucked I was.  
>>  
>>"Well, there's a straight line of demi-planes between the cannon and the target. Oh, and the brave patriot who's in the target holding the beacon.  
>>  
>>"Now that poor guy needs to get his beacon back home. If he doesn't the S-Can becomes a ticking time bomb. He takes too long, the cannon overloads and all the bubbles within a few jumps of the cannon get severed. Then the cannon goes boom and bleaches this entire place."  
>>  
>>I saw a quick murmur of objection start. Time to nip that in the bud.  
>>  
>>"Oh you didn't know that? Well, it's common knowledge in the capital. I can see why they wouldn't spread it around out here. I mean, the cannon is here and you locals have no need to worry."  
>>  
>>*Note to Self:* Learn where the capital is, also its name, also whether this country even has a capital bubble.  
>>  
>>"So you've got all this happening, then the monsters start showing up."  
>>  
>>Huh, no objections to that? Wish I'd gone to school here. I had to learn this part the hard way.  
>>  
>>"Usually the monsters live in planar bubbles that are very unlike ours, but thanks to the cannon there's a string of bubbles missing most of their portals. And when a bubble needs to fill that quota it'll make new jumps that could go anywhere instead of just connections to somewhere similar.  
>>  
>>"Now that entire chain, the one our friend with the beacon needs to get through, gets a bunch of fresh monsters from those weird inhospitable planes. Oh, and we shouldn't forget the folks that were targeted in the first place. They're still around too.  
>>  
>>"All of those things--people, monsters, etc--can follow the beacon holder to get revenge, food, or wha.."  
>>  
>>I'll admit I'm not the best speaker. I can ramble and the one-sided question and answer sessions get tedious. So I wasn't surprised when folks in the back of the crowd started drifting away. Admittedly, that was mostly because the folks in the back of the crowd *weren't* drifting away. They were running.  
>>  
>>The people in the front of the crowd, they'd gone ashen. They were completely still, except for their eyes.  
>>  
>>I turned around to see what everyone was terrified of.  
>>  
>>It was the bitch. She'd woken up. Nothing inherently frightening.  
>>  
>>People were probably just scared of her new look. Personally, I think it suited her. Wraith-chic goes rather well with casual advocacy for the mass murder of innocent civilians. The floating in midair, the aura of darkness seeping out of her eyes, even the uncanny wail that you don't so much hear as unerringly know, all of it was very stylish. I particularly loved how her organs were shifting underneath her skin as the wraith twisted her body to suit its own needs. I can appreciate how hard it is to work something that dynamic into your style.  
>>  
>>On the other hand, I can't say I liked her scent. The unending, inhuman hunger of it really clashed with the feel of deeply malevolent, self-replicating chaos that's the core theme of her ensemble. It's like seeing someone wearing nice hunting leathers with a single gigantic metal pauldron, the whole thing stops being about showcasing the person underneath and just becomes a confusing distraction.  
>>  
>>Maybe I'm overthinking it and it's just jealousy. I'm wearing the same cologne after all. I just have the good sense to keep it tucked under my aura and not let it seep into the furniture. You really want to have a light touch with scenting your mana, too much is just gauche.  
>>  
>>Suddenly I feel a pulse of, I don't know, *something* coming from the wraith. I suppose I had drifted off a bit. I give the wraith my full attention and it stops dripping indignation through my brain. With the wraith sure I was watching, the bitch's head flopped to the side as her neck split open, revealing a spare jaw full of mismatched teeth and enough tongues to make a hydra jealous.  
>>  
>>Okay, at least the screaming coming out of the new mouth is mostly normal sound. It still sounds like a lion trying to gargle a dozen cuckoo clocks while fighting off a cold but hey, I'll take it.  
>>  
>>I still have no idea how to handle any of this. Is it trying to talk? Does it want something from me? It looks like it's draining something from the people behind me, but maybe I'm immune? Should I be looking for a responsible adult to help me? Should it be a wraith adult or a human adult?  
>>  
>>Nope. I've got nothing.  
>>  
>>So I punched the bloody thing.

>>Compiling a history that spans even a modest breadth of the Lost Lands is an exercise in frustration. Sources and records are only reliable within living memory. Attempt to look any further back and one will find that the stories start to become fragmented before descending rapidly into incoherence.  
>>  
>>Contemporaneous records from only a dozen jumps apart are so different as to be from completely different universes. There is no way to connect the histories of any two places except at the present. Events that seemed universal and web spanning to one peoples, things that defined their culture for generations, don't show the slightest hint in annals of the other.  
>>  
>>How then can we hope to understand where we came from? Are we doomed to be stuck in an eternal present? Can we ever be a true humanity, a people with a shared understanding of ourselves and our place in these lands? Or are we doomed to go on as we always have, a thousand little bubbles of hope and longing all flickering in and out of each others' existence like so many flashbugs?  
>>  
>>The common wisdom is that the very nature of these Lost Lands makes each of my questions a foregone conclusion. And these conclusions will leave us alone and forever bereft of a collective meaning.  
>>  
>>I reject this common wisdom as an insidious nihlism. A parasite that allows us to ignore who we are and move through the world with a dull, gray, unthinking sheen.

>>Daji, my personal shard of Dajyadonus (my patron god), made the soul-tenant equivalent of an affronted squawk. I'm going to assume she (Or is it he today? Should ask when there's enough of my patron around that he can talk) is trying to say that she didn't build this place (*Daji:* *\*nodnod\**) and it's not their fault there's so many of the things.  
>>  
>>I know you didn't make the this place. You aren't the god with a weird obsession for testing whether people are "worthy" (What was Sarnea even testing? Inconsistent.) You didn't lead the cult that built all this. Wait, did you? Is she in your lineage? (*Daji:* *\*shrug\**)  
>>  
>>Still, your fault. If this particular temple didn't exist you'd just have sent me somewhere else. You're the only reason I'm even here. It isn't even the first time. Before this you convinced me to spend three years learning magic (boring). Before that it was learning about ancient languages and ancient engineering (tedious). Honestly, I should have never agreed to join your priesthood in the first place (boring *and* tedious). It's as if you've been shaping my entire life so it turns into a constant stream of tile puzzles for me to bang my head against (Not literally, I have no clue what those tiles even do.)

>>Carter and Anderson's hands were shaking after they finished the working. They were tired after melting, moving, and flash freezing a few tons of stone. The rest of the team couldn't blame them, making a plug was hard even when you had half a dozen people working on it. Still, it's a shame they couldn't have let it cool naturally. Flash frozen plugs were always more brittle than ones that cooled slowly. Something about crystals, Eta recalled, just like everything else this past century.  
>>  
>>A few quick handsigns from Alla, our squad leader, and everyone was drifting to the next chokepoint. Eta made sure to keep close to the walls of the cave, where she could use the crevices as handholds to stop. Floating down the corridor unable to stop was embarrasing during training. Here, with an active incursion, it could be deadly.  
>>  
>>It took a few bruises---moving fast in a down-less vol was hard---before everyone managed to stop, but nobody missed the target entirely. "Sitrep?" Alla asked. Pressing the activation buttion, Eta took a few moments to parse the pinpricks of light in the locator globe. Shades of green for each guard team, blue for miners, red dots and blurs for known and potential hostiles. The circles and shapes represented portals, locations, and key structures.  
>>  
>>The company liked giving elves the globes. Better eyesight meant that the locators could be made smaller and cheaper. Eta's was the size of a large marble.  
>>  
>>"The miners are almost out. They've dismantled the portal honeypot and it looks like they have a hauling chain to get the expensive supplies through the return jump." Eta said. Supplies didn't show on the globe but a line of evenly spaced workers moving back and forth like that couldn't be much else. "Guards 3 and 4 finished their plugs and are heading back. At this pace we won't even be the last ones back."  
>>  
>>A tense, but thankfully uneventful, time later Guard 2 floated into the staging area. This is where the miners came to rest and where their tunnels all started. It's also where the return portal was. Alla was up ahead coordinating with the other leaders, they needed to hold staging until the equipment and miners were through.  
>>  
>>Then the guard teams could retreat through the portal and set up a killzone on the far end, where the laws of nature were on their side. A lot of the things that lived in a floating vol couldn't even stand in vols with a down. Some of them were so weak they just popped once they got through. Didn't mean that floater life wasn't dangerous, especially on their home territory, just that they were built for different things.  
>>  
>>A quick glance showed the miners pulling the last few big mana crystals and the intrusion countermeasure enchantment frames into the room. Once those were through, there were only a dozen miners and support staff left before the guard teams could retreat.  
>>  
>>Eta's thoughts took a moment to drift. It would be a shame but they'd probably lose their big payday. With a retreat, the total profits from the mine would be smaller so their share would be smaller. The management would also need to hire more mercenaries to retake the mining vol and their share from the rest of the project would be cut even more. Still, it would a decent haul for the work.  
>>  
>>A quick glace at the locator showed the hostiles still bound up by the plugs when a scream went trough the room. A boot hit the wall behind the return portal, with most of a leg still in it. The portal itself had collapsed just after the last enchantment frame passed through, right through one of the people holding it.  
>>  
>>Management had decided to cut their losses, and the  payroll. Everyone left here was stuck. Their only way back, gone.

  I read the first two snippets. 

  There was originally a single universe that got sundered into interconnected demi-planes called bubbles. Planar travel is possible via portals, and may have a cost low enough individuals can do it regularly. Portals can be manipulated via advanced technology, which is dangerous. Bubbles "want" a particular number of portals, in the way that atoms "want" eight electrons and will spontaneously connect to other bubbles if they have fewer than the proper number of portals. By default, bubbles are connected to other bubbles that are similar in some way. A -> B -> C, A is most similar to B, and less similar to C. If you disconnect a portal, the resulting new portal may connect to a very dissimilar bubble, which may contain bizarre dangers.
  ```

- u/plutonicHumanoid:
  ```
  All I’ve got is that some previous civilization used space-warping tech/magic (pocket dimensions, teleportation gates, bags of holding) which eventually reached an unstable critical point that messed up space really bad, at a minimum of a country sized level. This created discrete bubbles of space, drawing from many worlds, some which were inhabited. Some of these bubbles are naturally inhospitable, or have native monsters. Travel between bubbles is relatively easy, but you move directly to adjacent bubbles?

  The volumetrics part of the creation myth section is confusing, and it’s not entirely clear how travel between bubbles works.
  ```

- u/CCC_037:
  ```
  So. You have... space-warping magics. Gates, bags of holding, and whatnot.

  Sometime in the dim and distant past, these were overused, and space itself was *shattered* into separate bubbles. People continued living (and non-people too, in a variety of ways) but space-warping magic became *harder*. Pre-existing Gates and so forth still worked, though. Well. More or less. A Gate has to connect to *somewhere*, but a connection can be severed; and when it is severed, then that Gate will (eventually, after a short interval) end up connecting to something else.

  The different worlds have *changed* over time; and some natural forces may be different (e.g. some worlds may have no gravity). It's unclear whether this is a fundamental change in the laws of nature, or whether it's just that some worlds don't contain the raw *mass* to have measurable gravity.

  There's enough worlds - and they're often separate enough - that almost nothing affects them *all*. And a random connection is more than likely going to take you to a world that has never heard of your known history. (It's possible that there may some temporal distortion as well - going to a world through Gate A then back through Gate B could perhaps bring you back to the original universe before you left it).

  Portals may take *effort* to hold open, collapsing (and re-connecting to somewhere else) on their own after some time. And there are enough people who have been cut off from what they consider home that there are *always* going to be wandering groups looking for a way home (or, at least, a way to a place that can become their *new* home).

  Clerics have particular trouble, because the reach of the gods is *not* universal...

    Cool. I've had the "change over time" idea in my setting notes since it's really important, but I wasn't really trying to leave clues to that effect. I love that you managed to just work backwards and figure that out. 

    > There's enough worlds - and they're often separate enough - that almost nothing affects them all. And a random connection is more than likely going to take you to a world that has never heard of your known history. (It's possible that there may some temporal distortion as well - going to a world through Gate A then back through Gate B could perhaps bring you back to the original universe before you left it).

    Yup. I don't have temporal distortions though, mostly because it'd be hell to run a campaign with either closed time loops or split timelines. I just can't handle that and still keep the 'rational' feel of the setting. 

    > Portals may take effort to hold open, collapsing (and re-connecting to somewhere else) on their own after some time. And there are enough people who have been cut off from what they consider home that there are always going to be wandering groups looking for a way home (or, at least, a way to a place that can become their new home).

    You're spot on about the wandering groups. Though I'm still trying to figure out how often wanderers end up creating new settlements vs joining other settlements. 

    I want them to be able to join existing settlements relatively often but the wanderers are just more mouths to feed for any group that's low-mid tech level. Food in particular can be really hard to source just because of the limited space.

    High tech level groups tend to have food (aquaponics and hydroponics analogs) but they're rare since they either stumble onto *things* or *things* stumble onto them. 

    > Clerics have particular trouble, because the reach of the gods is not universal...

    Yup, this is part of why cleric-analogs tend to carry bits of their gods with them. God-shards also make for really adorable pets.

  I like it very much. It seems to have alot of potential, lots of different systems combining in different ways. Your group is lucky to have you.
  ```

- u/CorneliusPhi:
  ```
  The setting reminds me of the Fate SciFi rpg Diaspora.  The magic system involves skills which you can get better at, so it sounds more like GURPS or Shadowrun.  The discussion of Volumetrics and super weapons suggests that at least the most advanced societies are at a much higher tech level than the default D&D world, with advanced scientific institutions and understandings of their world
