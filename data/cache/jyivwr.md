  Did you know there are nearly a dozen adaptations of "They're Made out of Meat"?

  I put together a list of them [here](https://wmbsaltworks.wordpress.com/2019/07/09/theyre-made-out-of-short-film-adaptations-a-made-out-of-meat-masterlist/).

    The New York Film Academy version is a true art piece

      Featuring Ben Bailey. Personally, I choose to believe They're Made of Meat is a sequel to Cash Cab.

    Including the verbatim rip of the original story that a guy submitted to our literary magazine my senior year of high school. We published it, I didn't realize it was plagiarism for years.

  This made me sad about my fleshiness. Good job OP 10/10

  So in order to be welcomed into the galactic community, we'd have to fully embrace the blessings of the Omnissia, but, on the other hand, that would mean we'd no longer be *allowed* to interact with the galactical community in any non-genocidal forms... truly, a catch-22.

    I don't think the Adeptus Mechanicus would be galactically acceptable. Remember that they run all their AIs on dead-meat servitors.

  I taught Middle School English last year and my kids really liked this story.  I liked using flash fiction as a warm up activity; it gave the kids badly needed variety and let them practice skills on a quick variety of different authors.  I actually got one kid to write a pretty good sci-fi story about a ship that crashes into mars told through audiologs without prompting or an assignment.

  Of course, finding flash that was half as good as this made it a real problem.  Two more the kids really liked were  Riddle by Ogbewe Amadin and Felicity by Amy Rivers.  Neither one of which are ration, but both are good fun.
