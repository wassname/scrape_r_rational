## Rational Green Lanterns

### Post:

Ok. This is a big project, so I feel it's best to break it down into parts. I kind of felt like working through this idea in the aftermath of talking with AlexanderWales about potential continuations to "The Metropolitan Man". But I'm not sure I can do it alone. So I thought I'd start a thread for it. Please keep discussion productive, so if you're planning to say that rational GL is impossible at least give a few of your reasons for believing so.

Part 1: How does the ring work? What can it do?

In comics, the lanterns run on the collective willpower of every living being in the universe. Rationally all that power has to come from somewhere. In comics, the rings can generate hardlight constructs, project harmful radiation, and even have built-in FTL capability. Rationally you can probably only fit so much tech around one finger.

I think the hardlight constructs are the important bit. You can give the lanterns ships for interstellar travel. The ships can also run on huge batteries that the smaller chargers get power from. That means they won't have to go back to Oa to recharge quite as much. In addition, you can probably limit the size of the constructs by saying that more volume requires significantly more power. This is ignoring the obvious issues that hardlight in general brings forth...

Part 2: What does a society with that kind of tech look like?

Oa is a world that has the capacity to create whatever its inhabitants can imagine. Rational Oa isn't quite so intense, but still highly capable. Are the buildings made of energy? Probably not, due to power constraints. But the planet might have a lot of factories, to replace broken rings and spaceships for their galactic police squad. Which brings us to...

Part 3: The Corps

What exactly do they do? When do they intervene and when do they let it be? How are they organized and how do they recruit new members? I personally see the only way earth wouldn't have met them yet to be that they avoid interfering unless two or more planets are involved, or an extinction event is imminent. The exception being that lanterns are permitted to watch over their homeworlds to a certain extent. Basically, a Prime Directive, except more functional and practical.

Part 4: Red, Blue, Sapphire, Sinestro

How do the other colors of energy differ? The societies seem simple enough once you've worked out the kinks in the GL Corps. But the rings themselves are an issue. Do they just generate a different color to distinguish between their factions? Could a Red Lantern then tinker with their ring to turn it green and get behind enemy lines? Or do they actually use distinct forms of hardlight that have different limitations and advantages? Maybe some don't use hardlight at all, but instead project radiation like the GLs can no longer do. And do we even want to mention the Black and White variations or are they just too much to ask for?

Part 5: Krypton and Thanagar

Now that we've got a larger galaxy of life, what do the other intelligent civilizations think of Oa's enforced authority? You'd think a few of them wouldn't want to have to submit to GL laws. Maybe a few of them even ally themselves with the Reds or the Blues instead. Then there's the issue of how to handle Mars. The easy solution there is to just say that they're not actual martians, and that Manhunter just never bothered to correct anyone until the name had already stuck.

  Firstly, see [With This Ring](http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.272850/), a self-insert fic involving an orange lantern. Mostly rational; the main character is particularly rational, and gets a lot of stuff done as a result, but the rest of the universe is basically the canon DC-verse.

  Secondly, I'd be inclined to suggest assuming that as many of the comic's conceits are in fact true as is possible. For instance, the emotional spectrum; sure, it's *weird*, but it's also a core part of the existence of lanterns, so if you get rid of it, you're not really telling a Rationalist Green Lantern story, you're telling a story about Sufficiently Advanced Aliens from Oa. This is the DC-verse, it includes beings like Kryptonians, the laws of physics are different. Assume the emotional spectrum is some kind of psionic energy, and that that's actually a valid way to generate Real Ultimate Power, and move forward from that, instead of trying to handwave it away.
  ```

  - u/Escapement:

    I strongly agree with both the recommendation and the prescription to not abandon emotional energy. Rationalism and the scientific method can flourish in any universe where there is causality and repeatability - and exploring the DC comics universe from a scientific min-maxxer perspective is perfectly valid; the more interesting to read result in noting that dualism isn't a thing in our universe but it is in DC comics, is not to have DC comics become purely materialistic and then spend forever exploring the resulting setting which only barely resembles DC comics, but instead to have the protagonist learn to apply their rationality to a universe different from what they imagined it was - to recalibrate themselves appropriately. 

    By the time you scrap enough of the DC universe that you are purely materialistic, you've scrapped enough of the good parts of the setting that you might as well just make a new setting to write fiction in if that's what you want to do. 

    I recommend reading With This Ring. Note the author updates daily (around 12 midnight to 4 in the morning if you live in the US) and has done so very reliably for a long time now. 

    Instead of removing a lot of the most interesting parts of Green Lantern cosmology... **you can just totally write Lensman fanfic**. There's no point in taking the Green Lantern world and spending oodles of time rewriting it by scrapping things into the Lensman world, when the Lensmen already do everything you want and you can just write in their world instead.

    Read *With this ring*, then come back and discuss. You are going in a vastly different direction than a popular fic, and you might want to look at the the way it approaches thing you think you have to discard that but allow it to both be rational and good fun, before you proceed further.

    ```
    Heh. Been reading that one for a while. Very nice fic. Superman does seem to be portrayed as a bit distant compared to the other Leaguers, though; I'm wondering if it's purely so the author can justify Kon's drama - and if so, why? Just so Paul can be pushed away from Kal as much as he's drawn to Luthor's desire to change the world?
    ```

    - u/Escapement:
      ```
      Superman being distant was very much the case in Young Justice canon, and the fic's SI has not done much to change that.

  Would it be safe to assume that you've already read the DCU fanfic "Inviolate", at https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5536346/1/Inviolate (podcast version at https://archiveofourown.org/works/2658290?show_comments=true ), and the version of the Green Lantern Corps presented therein? (Non-spoiler: I believe it predates DC's expounding upon the full emotional spectrum, which may affect how useful it would be to you.)

  For the colors: it makes sense to do away with the idea that they run on emotions, but if there's 'hard light' clearly you are harnessing some sort of exotic energy or physics unknown to us. 

  Working with this idea, each color could be using some variant of this exotic energy. Some could be more suited for hard light projection, others can project hard light but it's more fragile/costlier in terms of energy, but have other benefits like better radiation emission or other properties. 

  For instance, Red constructs can be less solid but abrasive, which more or less coincides with the comics. Sapphire would be much more solid and unable to project radiation (going with the imagery in the comics that their constructs are crystal-like). Green and yellow can be more flexible and versatile.

  On Part 3: The restriction of only policing for interactions tha involve more than one planet is very elegant, I think: it goes well with the idea of 'space police', like a world police in a planet wouldn't get into the affairs of each individual country. It's also elegant because the relative amount of GL officers is low compared to the number of inhabited planets, so their field of action needs to be limited. For this same reason, I'd say they don't even act on extinction-level events unless requested.
  ```

  - u/forrestib:
    ```
    hardlight constructs are a common sci-fi staple. Halo, Portal, Star Trek, Star Wars, etc. I figured it was close enough to the science we know that it would be mostly acceptable for Sufficiently Advanced Aliens.

    But yes, I definitely think the different "frequencies" of the spectrum would have different attributes. The examples you gave actually match the given emotional spectrum very well, with green being near the center, and red and violet being on opposite ends from each other. Perhaps the redscale frequencies generate radiation easier, while the bluescale is more solid and controlled.

    As far as Part 3 is concerned, I think if they were alerted they would probably attempt to prevent any internal affairs that may result in planetary destruction. WW2 wouldn't have gotten a second glance from them, but there likely would have been a lantern on Krypton trying to save their entire culture from being wiped out.

    > For this same reason, I'd say they don't even act on extinction-level events unless requested.

    I like this. 

    Possibly there are worlds that, when invaded, *still* won't call on the Green Lanterns, because you just don't want Oa traipsing in and sniffing around and doing things in your home.
    ```

    - u/forrestib:
      ```
      That's why I think it's important to have parts of the galaxy the GLs don't control. They have a territory, that covers a tenth of the Galaxy, at the most.
      ```

      - u/callmebrotherg:
        ```
        And this "we won't interfere unless one of the parties requests it" line may be why Oa (and other Lantern Corps if they exist) are tolerated (assuming that Oa is not so advanced that a unified offensive by the rest of the Galaxy still couldn't topple it).
        ```

- u/Chronophilia:
  ```
  Oa might not make entire buildings out of energy, but there are a lot of areas that could be made to only materialise as needed. The main one I can think of is skybridges and lifts between buildings. Plus the general benefits of having what is basically a GL ring keyed to the house's owner.

  Sure, you'd expect the cosmic police to have gear that's better than the housewives of Oa. But the houses can be connected directly to the power grid (or Oan equivalent), while the rings have to run on batteries.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  One way to make the colours work: Have them rely on trade secrets, with Sufficiently Advanced blackboxing and DRMs. If you need *this* exact layering of nanoscale iridium, copper, and sulphur to access a green spectrum, and an entirely different layering of bromine, iron, and hydrofluoride to access red, then it's going to be quite difficult for any civilization to use another's frequencies even before any countermeasures.
  ```

  - u/ArgentStonecutter:
    ```
    Early 21st century Earth already has open-source 3d-printed atomic force microscopes. I mean, [this is a thing that is real](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-09/18/lego-microscope). I don't see 24th-century equivalents being able to implement sufficiently advanced copy protection. Absent technological collapse, copy protection is *never* going to be easier than it is now.
    ```

- u/JackStargazer:
  ```
  How I always assumed the rings worked is that most of their actual processing power or mechanisms were stored in subspace and linked to the ring itself. 

  Of course you can't store every tool even around one finger, but the thing can do FTL and a bunch of other impossible things, taking advantage of nonlocality and pocket dimensions to store most of its mechanisms isn't really that different.

  An uncharged ring might only have the ability to hold a small capacitor charge and generate the gateway or connection to its subspace pocket capable of accessing the rest of the mechanism.

  Part 0: I'm guessing the plan is to use Alan Scott and set the story in 1940?

  Part 1:  
  There's a series of artificial satellites located close to the sun that serve as primary data storage, FTL communications relay, civilization monitor, battery pack, super-computer and fabricator. These replicate themselves in order to seed to other star systems not yet part of the GL FTL network and also feed a continuous stream of energy back to the Central Power Battery.  
  Individual Power Batteries serve as power and data relays between these and any Rings in the Battery's immediate vicinity. The FTL connections between the satellites are what allow GLs to travel between the stars, while their primary power source is the local sun, it's energy converted and stored by the satellites.  
  This entire system is overseen by the AI "Ion" (Entity-seeking-stability-through-direct-bond or some such "closest match" translation for it's name) which is extremely limited in it's ability to take direct action (the Guardians have a well-justified fear of proactive AI and have taken steps to ensure the system is only used by "real" lifeforms). It has a tiny selection of actions it is allowed to undertake of it's own volition, including but not limited to: Establishing contact with a potential recruit, expanding the Corps' reach, deciding on and implementing sanctions against rogue Corpsmen and presenting the Guardians in the best light. For all other actions it requires the conscious direction and instruction of an authorized Green Lantern, hence the Willpower aspect. edit: Basically the system AlexanderWales describes.  
  While new Rings come pre-installed with basic combat uses and Ion itself can provide self-augmentation when in the vicinity of a Power Battery, new projections and implementations of the Ring have to be designed and specified by a given GL, then transmitted to their local satellites to design and implement the capability in the same GL's Ring. There is a database storing all such GL designs, but access requires both visiting Oa and having the Guardians judge you trustworthy. Even then "dangerous" designs are restricted or outright banned.  
  The rings themselves are actually tightly-wrapped masses of filaments that extend and shape themselves when in active use. They also extend into their hosts body in order to provide maximum protection, repair and reinforcement. Along with many of the Ring's features, this requires a fully self-aware host to specifically consent to before it can be implemented.

  Part 2:  
  I honestly don't know what form the Oan civilization will take. But I do believe that knowledge of them in story should be mostly limited to the quirks and biases of the Lantern system, and Ion's perceived eccentricities. As it was in Metropolitan Man, I feel the canon beyond the essentials needed to match up with the original works aren't too important and are fair game for reimagining.  
  I have some ideas for the other parts that I'll look into writing up later.  

  Martians:  
  Why can't they be from Mars?  
  Lex is experimenting with space travel, which seems the perfect opportunity to bring the Martians in earlier then they otherwise would have appeared in canon, and right in time for WWII (I think the Green martians would have some interesting reactions to the Aryan philosophy). Couple that with the Green Lantern database likely coming with dire warnings from the last time the Martians had to be dealt with…
  ```

  - u/forrestib:
    ```
    I'm honestly disappointed you didn't think to name your AI Aya.

    Your solution for the Martians is... actually pretty good. The Mars civilization had been in decline for a while. If you say they live primarily underground and haven't been heard from for the last century or so, it's somewhat acceptable to think that earth might not have spotted them yet.
    ```

    - u/MaxDougwell:
      ```
      What can I say, the Entity of Will seemed apropos.  
      Looking it up, I don't think actual Earth had telescopes capable of spotting a small surface-dwelling Martian civilization until around the time of the setting anyway.  
      Are you sticking with Lex as the villain protagonist, or will this story follow GL?
      ```

      - u/forrestib:
        ```
        Likely both. I'm not sure yet. Batman might be involved too if I can make it all fit snugly. Luthor will be the primary POV character, with Bruce or GL as a potential second. Probably not all three though.
        ```

        - u/MaxDougwell:
          ```
          Personally I feel Wonder Woman is a better fit character-wise then Batman for a third character between Lex and GL, but I guess she does demand more extensive explanation and/or the addition of magic.  
          For Part 5…how about the primary goals of the Corps is to prevent the rise of Galaxy-spanning threats like strong A.I., and were actively working to contain Brainiac? Brainiac meanwhile works to propagate itself, or even to help the Kryptonians as originally intended.  
          To match up with the re-imagining of kryptonite as FTL-enabling fuel, the Green Lanterns use it as the primary component of their equipment, explaining their FTL capability, high-density energy storage and bright green colour-scheme. Brainiac could have reverse-engineered it's FTL applications from observation of the Corps, then surreptitiously passed that knowledge along, allowing speeds the Lanterns couldn't simply outrun and blow up.  
          Brainiac would edit in various flaws after the fact in the belief that the discovery of the Lanterns would somehow cripple it's plans, whatever those plans are decided to be.  
          Most of this is kind of irrelevant to the actual story, but I think kryptonite-as-Lantern-material would be a good fit, tying the world together and giving Lex additional reasons to be paranoid.
          ```

          - u/forrestib:
            ```
            I considered WW too. If I can work her in in a way that makes sense, I'll do it. But she's tertiary priority. I like Batman because he's a foil for Lex, as a fellow super-rich-super-antihero type character. Really Green Lantern is secondary too. The primary priorities to work in for me are Bruce and Brainiac.

            I read a Justice League vs Avengers fic at one point where Hulk radiation was revealed to be an almost identical frequency to Kryptonite radiation, thus functionally taking Superman out of the fight for the whole first round and most of the second. GLs using K is similar in that it helps level the playing field. Maybe Kryptonite doesn't have anything to do with Krypton at all. It's just the fuel for GLs, that just so happens to be harmful to Kryptonian biotech. That's how the GLs were able to hold off Brainiac for so long. Comes with some Nightmare-in-Hindsight for Clark's ship containing a Brainiac fragment, which presumably was the first breach of lantern-enforced AI quarantine of Krypton and surrounding systems.
            ```

            - u/MaxDougwell:
              ```
              I think Superman says that his powers work on a similar principle to kryptonite radiation, so it interferes with his biotech?  

              It would provide an alternative explanation for the sudden failures all their colony ships experienced. The GL Corps have been blowing them up then broadcasting back a warning about the dangerous A.I. Brainiac, which gets filtered out by Brainiac. Heh, for all the Kryptonians knew, Brainiac was engaged in full-scale war with the Corps. Krypton and Brainiac could even be blown up BY the Corps when they realize the quarantine is no longer viable.  
              Containment and restriction of self-propagating threats is also in line with the canon Corps, i.e. the Agent Orange situation.  

              Then you have Brainiac going into panic mode when it realizes there's a GL on the same planet as it who knows about Superman, and that the Corps could at any moment put two and two together regarding Superman's origins as the one that got away.  
              Its self-interested warnings to Lex (the truth that going after a GL could attract the Corps' attention or some convincing lie) would be a good reason for Luthor not to simply crush GL, like the last threatening alien agent he encountered.
              ```

- u/Chosen_Pun:
  ```
  I think the focus of a Rational!GLC should be the characters and how they use their technology, rather than the technology itself. Instead of getting hung up on where the all the Emotional Spectrum's power comes from, examine the story of [the guy who lost an entire advanced civilisation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomar-Re) even with it literally in the palm of his hand.

  Basically, treat the rings like HPMOR treated wands. Only, more predictable and intuitive to use. And capable of reciting their own instruction manual when asked.
  ```
