  there is a judo hold where you can compress the arteries in the neck, and holding that too long will kill someone. so yes, its a thing that can happen. however- was he struggling? how much room did they have, where this happened? 

  the implausible part, to me, is that he was strangled in a car, by someones legs. that implies either a very roomy car, or a gymnist strangler. 

  the conclusion i draw from this, is that we are missing information.

  Thighs are quite awkward to strangle someone with compared with a rope, a tie or even bare hands. So it won't be the go-to solution for the amateur killer and I'll firstly suspect it to be assisted erotic asphyxiation into accidental murder if I read such a headline on the news.

  The mechanics will likely involve more crushing the front of the victim's throat with the back of one's knee with the other thigh behind to keep the head in place, instead of the scissor where the neck may slip out if the victim just move towards the ankles. It'll certainly take a while especially while the victim is conscious and struggling and not sedated.

  They'll have to stop the victim clawing and kicking at them if the rest of the body is not held down, and biting their thigh during the murder. The coroner should check under the fingernails of the victim for clues. Also, the scene of the crime probably wouldn't be the car given the cramped space.

  This reminds me of the "could someone be allergic to water" gimmick account, except with a fetish instead of a daily mail article.

  But, no, I wouldn't find it plausible. A trained martial artist could strangle someone. But subduing people is hard, strangulation is slow, and a random nerd isn't going to manage a blood choke with just their legs.
