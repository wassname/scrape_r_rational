  To anyone curious, I had no part in this and was just made aware of it a few days ago. I found it delightful and stand impressed by its quality. 

  Thanks for the awesome adaptation, and hope to hear more :)

  Haven't been able to listen yet but excited. This is one of the two ratfics really good for bringing in new people, I think, and an audiobook will just make it even easier.

  Awesome, I was just thinking yesterday that I should check for an audio version of this.
