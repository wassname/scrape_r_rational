  Also, testing out a new host for the podcast, so let me know if there are any problems with it!

    The new host is good. My only issue is a pet peeve that there doesn't seem to be a convenient way to adjust the volume in the page. I managed to figure it out thought, so no worries (I opened the dev console and through the network tab found [this](https://anchor.fm/api/v3/episodes/e2v3pv) JSON file which has two audio sources [this one](https://d3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net/production/2019-0-10/8156044-44100-2-8c14cf2bbf57.m4a), which I imagine is where the ads/sponsorship section is kept, and [this one](https://d3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net/production/2019-0-16/8413156-44100-2-4805d198cb0c2.m4a) where the rest of the podcast is, which also explains why the players says 50:06/49:20 at the end of the episode).

    I think the new host is definitely worth it, and good episode too!

      Wow, that's a lot of work for what should be pretty simple. 

      Glad you liked it!

        I have way too many website pet peeves so over the years I ~~have developed a completely useless skill~~ have become adept at this stuff from all that ~~time I've wasted out of sheer pettiness~~ experience and wisdom I have accumulated. So it didn't take long (maybe two minutes).

          Sounds like time well invested if it saves you so much moving forward :)
