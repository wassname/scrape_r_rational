## What would be the best way to exploit the Necrophone [The Order]?

### Post:

So in the Netflix show, The Order, there is a device called a Necrophone, which enables the user to speak with any dead person they name.

Assuming that the dead people you call are able to fluently communicate with you and are compelled to provide truthful answers to all of your questions, how would you best exploit this device? Who would you call and what would you ask them? 

To keep things focused on the specifics of the prompt, let's just assume that all answers automatically include the ways you would use any other generic proof of the supernatural (e.g., claiming the Randi prize, etc.).

  Generic wealth: Any recently deceased CEOs of publicly traded companies get you some impressive insider trading. Recently deceased high-ranking officers and political figures could similarly get you extremely valuable espionage; there the payoff is indirect, though, so the primary problem would be demonstrating your credibility. Drone strikes which let you interrogate the victims flawlessly afterward could be *extremely* profitable.

  I notice that you said "person" rather than "human." So this is useful for:

  1. Figuring out which animals are sentient
  2. Disproving any religions with dead gods
  3. Wild animal suffering research

  Also notable for the fact that the only constraint is that you must say the person's name. So you can figure out when and where human language first evolved by speaking random names into the necrophone, talking with them until you figure out when and where they lived, and repeating a large number of times. Historical research would be doable in a similar way.

  That's all I can think of right now.

    This gave me another idea.

    Universe is very large, maybe somewhere else was some kind of living being that could count as 'person'?

    Maybe we could, well, somehow brute-force all possible vocals and try to summon the dead from another planet? This would be useful for SETI projects.

    Is this Necrophone limited to humans from Earth? Or would it also work for human-like beings from other planets, which are just similiar to humans just by mere chance? You know, given enough time and space there is a chance that there was already a specie similiar to humanity evolved sometime ago.

  Is it capable of FTL signalling?  
  What about sending somebody to a suicide-exploration space mission and then asking him for all information?  
  Send some human probes into the sun or blackhole?

  If somebody were to die, let's say, one light year from Earth, would I be able to question him with this device immediatelly or would it take an information propagation speed into the account?

        The shortest version I can think of: According to special relativity, things that appear to take place at the same time in one reference frame can take place at different times in another. So if you can send messages FTL in your frame, to someone else it can look like you're talking to the past instead of the present.

          Sure that makes sense when it comes to an outside observer, but from your own reference frame (which we obviously must remain in), it doesn't actually reverse cause and effect or allow time travel.

          For instance, imagine that there is a star 3 light years away that is about to go supernova. You are magically alerted the moment it does and you broadcast a radio signal into space announcing the supernova.

          To an observer situated 1 LY from you and 2 LY from the star, it will seem as though you predicted the supernova one year in advance. But from your perspective on earth, you merely know about an event that already occurred*, when that information hasn't reached the rest of us yet. Like a telegram breaking some east coast news to someone on the west coast, while the rest of the country waits for the pony express.

          In no circumstances can you actually leverage that inside knowledge into literal time travel or reversing cause and effect, right?

          *or did it? Is time itself limited by C somehow?

            This is where you dodge the loophole. What's to stop you from "magically alerting" the people living near the star 3 light years away? If you limit all communications from your own reference frame to following the rules of physics as we understand them then it's just a nifty trick that makes it look like you can make some very accurate predictions. If it's two-way communication, then it breaks causality.

              I'm not sure what you mean here, but sure, let's say it's 2 way. In my proposed scenario, you are alerted right when their star goes supernova. If you send an instantaneous message back to them, they would not be interested in it because they would be in the process of getting exploded by their star. How would that break causality? First, the star begins to go nova, then you are alerted a moment later, then you send a message back which they receive as they watch their sun fill the sky. Where's the break?
              ```

                >First, the star begins to go nova, then you are alerted a moment later, then you send a message back which they receive as they watch their sun fill the sky.

                No, actually if they immediately send a message to you as the star is exploding \[from their reference frame\], then you'll have received the message 3 years ago (due to skipping over the light-years involved) aka there's still 3 years before you'll see the light of the nova. Since according to **your** reference frame, there's 3 years before the nova will occur, you send the warning and then all of the sudden they have been warned of the star going nova three years before it actually happens.

                The reason why you are getting so confused is because you are mentally thinking of everything in the universe happening according to some sort of absolute flow of time or an objective reference frame. But the flow of time is subjective and if you send faster than light messages to people, it allows you to pick and choose which reference frame to use (when usually we are stuck with the exact same frame of reference/sequence of events from birth to death).

                By sending a FTL message to Earth and receiving the message 3 years before the light of the nova reached us, the message has technically been sent back in time by 3 years according to Earth's flow of time even if it looks like the star is exploding at the 'same time'. If the message is immediately delivered back from Earth to the star, the star will receive the message 3 years before the nova has occurred, because that would be the 'same point of time' that Earth has received the message. Earth receiving the message can be said to be both occurring as the star goes nova or 3 years before it does so (depending on if you are thinking of Earth's or the star's reference frame), therefore both points in the timeline of the star is available to receive the message.

                It's the reason why FTL communication is considered time-travel because by changing reference frames, it allows information to move backwards in time. One way is only FTL communication, two way becomes time travel.

                  This part confuses me. Yes, from my reference frame, I will get the message 3 years before I ***see*** the star go nova, but since the star is 3 LY away, I don't see the explosion until 3 years after it happens. It seems like you're saying that from my reference frame, the supernova *actually happens* when I see the light from it, not when the light started traveling away from the explosion itself.


                  That seems wrong to me. Are you saying that if in the year 2020 we point a telescope at the sky and see a star 1,000 light years away go supernova, that the star *actually* went supernova in 2020, not 1020? 

                  >Since according to your reference frame, there's 3 years before the nova will occur**, you send the warning and then all of the sudden they have been warned of the star going nova three years before it actually happens.

                  It seems like you're saying that viewing the light from a past event in a telescope is *actually* looking into the past. In my understanding, the past event occurs, and the photons from that event travel through space for years until they hit your telescope. Since it takes a long time for the photons to reach you, you don't become aware of the past event until they do, but it still did happen in the past.

                  >By sending a FTL message to Earth and receiving the message 3 years before the light of the nova reached us, the message has technically been sent back in time by 3 years according to Earth's flow of time even if it looks like the star is exploding at the 'same time'. 

                  Why would it look like the star is exploding at the same time if we got the message 3 years before we saw the explosion?

                  >If the message is immediately delivered back from Earth to the star, the star will receive the message 3 years before the nova has occurred, because that would be the 'same point of time' that Earth has received the message. 


                  This is the part that I need explained to me more. If they send an instant communication to earth the moment the star explodes, and earth instantly responds, why are you saying they would actually receive the response 3 years in the past? Sure, earth is 3 LY away, but since the communication is instant, why does that distance matter? I get the impression there's some theory like, "time itself is limited by the speed of light" underlying your explanation that you haven't articulated yet.


                  >Earth receiving the message can be said to be both occurring as the star goes nova or 3 years before it does so (depending on if you are thinking of Earth's or the star's reference frame), therefore both points in the timeline of the star is available to receive the message.

                  Why is this so different from my earlier metaphor about the east coast news traveling slowly to the west coast while a telegram communicates it instantly? Can you restate this point using that metaphor?


                  If a super powerful telescope 100 LY away were pointed at earth right now, it would see earth as it was 100 years ago. If it sent a FTL IM to earth today, we would receive it right now, and it could report to us what earth looked like 100 years in the past. And if we sent a FTL IM back, it would appear to the telescope that it was receiving a message 100 years into the future of the earth it could *see*, but it would also know that it was just viewing the earth as it existed 100 years ago, and that the earth it got the message from was the present earth. So I get how it could be used to send a message to the future, but both the telescope and we are in the year 2020. How could it send a message back into the past?

                  If what you're saying is true, why do astronomers say stuff like, if the sun suddenly blew up, we wouldn't know about it for 8 minutes, or "this star that we just saw go supernova actually blew up when King Tut still ruled Egypt, it just took that long for the light to reach us? Aren't you saying that these events actually happen only when their light reaches us? That the sun didn't explode 8 minutes ago, it exploded when the explosion reached us? That the star didn't go nova during Tut's reign, it went nova today? Why ignore the travel time like that?

                  Sorry for the giant book I wrote you, I'm just trying to understand this confusing concept.

                    I think for your intuition its best to imagine that "simultaneous" doesn't exist. That there is only cause and effect, one event affecting another.

                    imagine a 2d grid where each point is an event in real life. Every point that is strictly above and to the right of that point is "affected" by this event, and every strictly below and to the right of the point is "a cause of" the event. Now think of all the points in the other two quadrants. They are neither in the past or the future compared to our starting point, no real link between them exists. So you can say any of these events are happening "simultaneously" to ours. 

                    Unless you're studying the specifics of the math, I think you don't need to know why we say specific events are "simultaneous under this reference frame".

                [Relativity of simultaneity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity) is a fundamental property of reality according to our understanding of special relativity. Allowing FTL communication makes it very difficult to describe reality in a way that is consistent among people observing events from different frames of reference. 

                It doesn't really make sense to say that events happened in a certain order until the light from those events is able to be observed. If you can get knowledge about something that happened before the light from it can reach you, then you are effectively predicting the future. So, if you have your prediction that "in three years that star will explode", why couldn't they get the same information by talking to you three years ago? What makes your frame of reference more valid than theirs?

                If you're writing a sci-fi or something and your really need to justify the plot device you could go for a sort of solipsism/multiverse answer, where your frame of reference is the only one that really matters to your experience and every 'outside' observer's experience is consistent with yours because your perspective is what defines reality... but that comes with its own problems.

        I've read most of the other replies, and I'd like to offer my 2 cents.

        First, reference frames.  A reference frame isn't a matter of position.  Imagine 2 observers, A and B; they're moving with respect to one another.  From A's point of view, A isn't moving, and B is, and vice versa.  Or:  In A's reference frame, A isn't moving and B is, and vice versa.  A reference frame is an abstraction so we don't have to invent non-embodied observers for all these thought experiments.

        Second, why you might doubt something's possibility.  We can believe in a lot of things in physics, but one thing we basically reject by default is inconsistency.  You see me moving, I see you moving, fine.  We can transform data gathered in one reference frame to another and we're good.  But what if you had some physics where it turned out that you could turn it into 'I see you moving at great speeds, you see me stationary with respect to you sitting right there.'  What the hell does that even mean, physically?  It's not two different points of view in one universe;  it's two different universes.  There's something pretty wrong with a model that lets that occur.

        There are certain space-time diagrams that really help build intuition with the next part in practice, if not in justification for why it must occur.  The basic principle is the relativity of simultaneity.  Wikipedia's ok:

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity

        Specifically this:

        https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Relativity_of_Simultaneity_Animation.gif

        The x-axis is space, the y-axis is time;  for any given observer, every point in time on the x-axis is simultaneous.  You shift the 'angle' of the x-axis (and y-axis) by shifting your velocity relative to the reference frame we're measuring this all from (remember, there are no privileged reference frames).

        The y-axis angling happens in galilean relativity (normal newtonian mechanics);  If I'm angled so much, it mean's I'm traveling at this speed relative to whatever our comparison reference frame is.  The x-axis changes angle because the speed of light has to be conserved for all observers/reference frames. (a fundamental principle of special relativity). 

        As the relative velocity between our base reference frame and the frame in question approaches c, the space and time axes angle closer and closer to each other.  At c, they'd merge (this is why people say photons don't experience time).

        The gist is that in special relativity, observers in different reference frames have see different orderings of events in the universe.  This is after accounting for the speed of light delays, and there's no 'true' ordering.

        So.  Imagine you're in the same reference frame as earth and this star (they're stationary w.r.t each other).  You send an instant signal from Earth (E) to the star (S).

                                       ^  time
                                       |   
            E1 ----> S1         +---> space


        This is in the nice, comfy reference frame enjoyed by Earth and Star and us.  So E1 and S1 are simulatenous in time.  But wait!  Some dastard in a rocket is accelerating around, picking arbitrary reference frames, like in

        https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Relativity_of_Simultaneity_Animation.gif

        We're allowed to move tilt the x-axis up to 90 degrees, so we can easily make that horizontal line go from above the x-axis to below when going from E to S, i.e. the event at S where they recieved the signal occured before the event at earth where it was sent.

        And in a reference frame of opposite relative velocity, an 'instant' signal going from S to E would be going back in time.

        This is very weird.  Worse, this is incoherent.  Depending on which direction you're moving in now shifts you into alternate histories (because S could operate on info from earth to send earth a conventional light signal to arrive before E sends the message to S, if they're suitably spaced, or a million other things.)

        This is all avoided if and only if we restrict trajectories of messages in general  to travel at no less than 45 degrees to the x-axis (or, in other words, at light speed or slower).  Then, no matter which reference frame we look at the world in, it stays coherent.

        TL;DR:  If you allow FTL signalling along with the other postulates of special relativity, I can construct observers for whom the causal structure of the universe is different in irreconcilable, absurd ways- and the only difference between these guys is one is going 5 m/s left, and the other 5 m/s right.  This is absurd (everything has to go to normality) and so we conclude that a coherent universe with the other rules of relativity has to be one where FTL signalling doesn't happen.

        I think the claim is just a result of analysis shortcuts that gave a misleading result.    The time travel claim has to do with the fact that the speed of light relative to you is the same,  no matter how fast you are going.  

        Let's say Alice and Bob and a photon are all going to race.  The photon takes off at 0.3 Gm/s. Alice and Bob follow and reach  speeds of 0.2 Gm/s and  0.1 Gm/s respectively. Catherine is at the starting point and confirmed these speeds.

        Alice watches the photon, and it is moving 0.3 Gm/s faster than her.

        Bob watches the photon, and it is moving 0.3Gm/s faster than him.

        This is not a  paradox,  the light is moving at the same speed compared to each individual  because they are each experiencing different amounts of time dilation. 

        Now, Alice has Dave with her, and he's a total Mary Sue with the combined powers of God and anime on his side, so he makes Alice go twice as fast (from Catherine's view), raising her speed to 0.4Gm/s. He also skips the discontinuity at 0.3Gm/s because wtf does it mean to be going the same speed as the photon yet watching it move away from you.

        Alice is still watching the photon, and it's *still* moving away from her at 0.3Gm/s. Catherine and Bob are watching Alice catch up to the photon though.  What's going on?  Well, Alice's time dilation is so bad that she's experiencing time in reverse.

        Thus, a rather lame form of time travel.

         It also means she'll never catch up to the photon from her perspective. 

        Except, well, no. Alice measuring her speed relative to anything but the photon is just getting garbage numbers. Her speed is not 0.4Gm/s, it's a  complex number, which is a real number plus an imaginary number. It's garbage because complex numbers only appear in the real world where we have oscillating motion, where the real number is the instantaneous speed and the imaginary number becomes a correction factor that describes how the change in speed will affect the average speed over a period of oscillation. 

        The real reason ftl travel is impossible I that when you take relativistic effects into account your speed is not a number that describes linear motion any longer

  Since you say it allows FTL, then here is another idea.   
  How long will this device last?

  **I think it could be used to establish the permanent FTL communication (at least one-way) with another point in universe.**

  For example: let's make a space ship arc and send it out of our Galaxy, but give the crew the exact indexed list of names for their children. Every time the child is born, they will use the name from the list.  
  Also keep the list of the names on Earth.  
  This way, even after centauries, even after thousands of years, we will be able to 'call' the newly-dead children from the arc ship, because we will know how they were named.

    Since it says "person" and not "human", you could create and kill AI constructs that minimally fit the device's definition of personhood, and are optimized to transfer all sorts of information via the device.

    So whenever you want to send info from star system A to star system B, you just instantiate an AI, load it up with said info, and immediately kill it. The receiver would then call up said AI and get the info. The receiver would need to know the name of the AI, but that can be easily solved by naming each AI something like \`transmitterID\` + \`\_\` + \`aiID\`, with the latter starting at 0 and increasing by 1 with each new AI.

    All of this could be automated. Each transmitter would continuously package up input information and create, fill and destroy AIs at an arbitrary rate. Each AI thus carries a small packet of information. Each receiver would just keep going through the list of names, decoding data out of each audio output.

    If the system is optimized to minimize latency and provides sufficient bandwidth (which could be achieved by parallelizing transmission of large files with arrays of multiple transmitters/receivers), you could seamlessly integrate this system into the existing internet infrastructure, connecting assorted star systems with FTL connections!

  They're a huge national security issue. You can ask some recently dead high-ranking government official about anything. This is great if you're a government.

  If you don't want to draw the attentions of every government, it means you have to keep the thing a secret, so that limits what you can do.

  You could use it for insider trading. Look up whenever someone on the board of a publicly traded company dies, and ask them if there's anything you need to know.

    Yes this would wreak havoc on worldwide natsec and intel. Even if it were confiscated, it would still cause massive chaos. All info would need to be heavily compartmentalized and every country would have to start over from scratch and basically assume everything iscompromised.

  It would be pretty useful for any sort of investigation of murder or missing people. It would let you find out if someone is dead, and obviously most people could tell you who killed them (and the information is guaranteed to be true).

  You could prove/disprove the existence of an afterlife and what it is like. This would probably make a lot of people very upset.

  Being able to get accurate accounts of history straight from primary sources would be nice to have. You could get even more names by asking famous ancient people who they knew. You could probably go pretty far back by asking "who was the oldest person you knew?".

  With a superintellegent ai, you could "resurrect" every person who ever lived by mapping every response to every possible question. This would be greatly sped up by having the AI only understand an inhumanly fast and dense language.

  Do I only need name to ask dead person questions?   
  Can I brute-force whole list of all dead people in my country and ask them if they had some kind of secrets, secret stashes, etc?  
  Some people used to hide valuables in the ground during the, for example, World War, and those goods are still missing and waiting to be found.

  Can I find missing ships this way?

  Also, depending on how this device would really work, it could settle the 'what is really death' debate.

  There is still a dispute on how we should exacly define death and when exacly it happens. We could experiment with it and try to 'call' with this device a person who is dying at the moment and see when exacly he becomes 'callable'

  Do you know that in someone with a dead cerebrum but a living brainstem spontaneous breathing may continue unaided?

  Would this device allow me to communicate with people in Persistent Vegetative State? Because you know, they are basically brain dead

    True, but your experiment would only tell you what the device/magic considered to be "dead." There would still be philosophical debate on whether you agree.

  Before anyone else figures out this exists, I'm going to call historical figures associated with famous buried treasures. I'm also going to call anyone who notoriously died under circumstances suggesting they were killed for knowing the secrets of powerful people, put anything they tell me on a deadman switch to be published if I don't check in every day, and publish it all regardless as soon as anyone else knows the necrophone exists. In the interim I'll follow up on anything they can tell me about how to get evidence proving their claims, which goes in that cache too.

  Recursively trace the origins of oral storytelling traditions.

  Realtime battlefield intelligence. Repeatedly try to call front line troops. When someone answers, ask for a brief report on the situation just before they died. If we know the name of any soldiers on the other side (e.g., by looking at a dead one's tags and necrophone-interrogating him for the names of others, etc), repeatedly try to call them too.

  Is it cheap? Can you leave this running in the background? Can you have more than one at a time? Can you have the undead communicate with each other? If so, you can build a computer.

  Limitations could be overcome by summoning, say, E.T. Jaynes, Feynman, or another hard scientist of the past, have them produce a list of promising research directions. Pay some confederates $10/hour to conjure an arbitrary number of dead PhD students, and have them divide the research directions in smaller tasks, which you can then further divide in smaller tasks, until you can get to the point where you can get the question solved directly; like: what is the value of this integral, or, can you come up with examples of X? Put the little pieces back up together, and bam! If you have an audio recorder + transcription, you might be able to automate most of this.

    >Is it cheap? 

    It costs nothing to operate.

    >Can you leave this running in the background? 

    I suppose. The call lasts until you hang up, even if you leave.

    >Can you have more than one at a time? 

    You only have the one device and you van only call one dead person at a time.

    >Can you have the undead communicate with each other? 

    No.

    Smart idea, but sadly not how it works. If you wanted to have dead people communicate though, you could record a message from one person and play it for another. So if you wanted some older genius's analysis of a modern scientific question that would be totally doable.

      Can the dead still learn? If the connection is of a reasonable quality, the most humane use may be to hook it up to an automated computer terminal and treat the dead as blind paraplegics. Maybe with enough training you can get them to mentally decode a background signal as low-quality video/make noises that correspond to muscle movements.That way, they could regain some degree of autonomy.

      If you hooked up a superintelligence to a necrophone, I wonder if it could exfiltrate the brainstate of the deceased by asking questions.

        Keep in mind that the device can only contact one dead person at a time. Wouldn't a more humane use be to contact dead geniuses and use them to improve life on earth for all humans, rather than restoring a pseudo-body to a single person?

            It's funny, that reminds me of a question I asked in some AskX subreddits a while back. The question was 'How long have humans(or our ancestor species) been using names?'. 

            I was hoping that work like the reconstruction of proto-indoeuropean that linguists have managed might offer sufficient clues to guess at a timeline.

            Nope.

            We have no idea how long ago humans came up with the idea of adopting names for one another, and we'll almost certainly never know. It just predates writing and even what we can piece together of ancient spoken language by too much.
