  This a self contained omake to [Luna Lovegood and the Chamber of Secrets](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/TF77XsD5PbucbJsG3), which in turn is a recursive fanfiction of hpmor.

  The omake assumes knowledge of Newcomb's paradox. Luna Lovegood and the Chamber of Secrets is also good.

    To be clear, the omake does **not** assume knowledge of *Luna Lovegood and the Chamber of Secrets*, *HPMoR*, or even *Harry Potter*, really.

    All you need to know is

     * [Newcomb's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomb%27s_paradox#The_problem),
     * that Omega is the "reliable predictor" mentioned in the former,
     * that Gringotts is a bank and
     * that Hermione Granger is a person.

    That said, I second the *Luna Lovegood and the Chamber of Secrets* recommendation. It's delightful.

      This is the first time I read about Newcomb's paradox. Interestingly:

      > Nozick noted that "To almost everyone, it is perfectly clear and obvious what should be done. The difficulty is that these people seem to divide almost evenly on the problem, with large numbers thinking that the opposing half is just being silly."

      I belong to the group that instinctively thinks that sure, the only sensible move is to grab box B. I basically have no problems thinking in terms of retrocausality or closed time loops, so I assume a perfect predictor is just that and trying to cheat them makes no sense. Not sure what that says about me, probably that I dropped any illusion of having true "free will" long ago.
      ```

        It's a fun paradox, and involves quite a lot of fun assumptions about how the world works.  For me, while I don't have trouble thinking in terms of retrocausality, we having seen any evidence of it in the real world, so I wouldn't use it as a justification.  I would still take the opaque box only, but for different reasons.

        I believe that any sufficiently detailed simulation of a conscious mind is itself conscious.  For the predictor to have 100% accuracy, it must have made that detailed simulation.  Therefore, there are two copies of me, one being offered the choice in reality, and one being offered the choice in the predictor's simulation.  Ideally, with a goal to maximize the amount of money received by the physical me, I would pick one box while in the simulation, and two boxes while in the physical world.  However, there is no way to tell which instance I am, so I need to choose the same in both cases.  Therefore, I pick only a single box.

          The problem still works if the predictor is 60% accurate.
          In the sense that agents that one box get more expected  money. 
          And newcomb's problem is a toy example of a broader case of decision problems that actually kind of includes more comon examples.

          So like it seems that for a good acausal decision theory that does this kind of thing properly we need some notion of logical dependencies of events to your decision algorithm better than just considering exact copies of your algorithm.
          ```

        - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
          ```
          So you basically assume that the predictor is perfectly deterministic and that's why it's perfect - it takes all inputs and simulates outputs with no error - while I'm just accepting it gets information from the future.

          Thing is, in a perfectly deterministic world, what would even be the difference? If evolution is at all time unitary (so suppose wavefunction collapse is just an approximation or an illusion), then having information about the state of the universe at ANY time is the same as having information about all the future and all the past. And conversely, if the world is *not* deterministic, then a 100% accurate predictor would be simply theoretically impossible.

          Note that we know, by Bell's theorem, that QM implies either no locality, no realism (aka determinism), or superdeterminism. If the world is deterministic then it's either superdeterministic (and thus you never had a choice in the first place), or nonlocal (namely some information, hidden from us, travels FTL; and that's the same as saying that there is retrocausality).
          ```

  Whoever wrote that doesn't have a very good understanding of money.  A bank absolutely can create money ex nihilo, at least insofar as the contents of a bank account count as money (some definitions of the money supply only count checking accounts, some also count savings accounts).  Given that the account balance essentially represents a short-term uncollateralized debt to the account-holder (who has no claim on any particular banknotes or coins), the bank can simply increase the balance.  There is no need for anyone to give the bank corresponding physical currency, and there's no real zero sum situation.

  As I understand it the rules of timetravel in HPMOR are essentially divine/mathematical (is there a difference?) in nature; I think something would happen that would cause Hermione's time travel plan to fail; an earthquake strikes the golem for example. There's no reason to think so, except that that's the way it has been said to work within the fiction. It's as fundamental as the rule that all time loops are closed; all time loops are no longer than 6 hours. 

  not that this isn't terribly smart, nor not good writing, nor not fitting into the universe, nor not excellent in general.
  ```

  - u/Dufaer:
    ```
    I believe "divine" is indeed the correct term for the 6-hour restriction, as in "has to be implemented by having an intelligent agent supervise reality".

    It certainly sounds [non-local](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/causal+locality).

    I think you have to take naturally composable things (closed timelike curves) and by surgery on reality you make them non-composable (esentially by destroying worlds that do not satisfy your rule).

    That's my strong gut feeling, anyways.
    ```

    - u/Roneitis:
      ```
      Closed timelike curves make actually a whole butt-load of sense when you consider time as just another dimension, but when you introduce a non-self consistent time loop it just doesn't make any sense; it becomes like a geometry problem of the scale of "give me a triangle with angles that add up to 190Â°" (and, extending the analogy, it's possible, but needs to exist on a different surface). You can't quite use the same analogy for 6 hour time limits, but I think of it as being a similar thing. 

      When you stop considering events as happening after one another, and as just being points in the time dimension, then there isn't in reality a question of "what will the universe do" because the universe already exists, and the universe as an object has all points in time mapped out already.

      Something fun is that my analogy is well suited to notions of Superdeterminism, and all the non-local shenanigans that allows.

        You would probably enjoy reading Greg Egan - it's hard-math science fiction, and his *Clockwork Rocket* trilogy is based on exactly this theme. What would the universe be like, if time was a spacelike dimension?
        ```

      - u/Dufaer:
        ```
        Well, in *HPMoR*, there are no self-inconsistent time loops. What there is is:

        1. self-consistent time loops (perfectly fine in the general theory of relativity)
        2. a 6-hour limit on information transfer backwards in time (pure story conceit, AFAICT)

        You can compose self-inconsistent time loops from self-consistent time loops + weird (semi-)parallel universes. So they are potentially physical just from that and so far more reasonable than the 6-hour limit, AFAICT.

        Superdeterminism seems like just a contrived way to avoid many-worlds by making the entire world a cutscene instead of a simulation.
        ```
