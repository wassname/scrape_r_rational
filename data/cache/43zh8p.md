  Like one comment says in the last video. I started it thinking "No way I am going to watch 3 hours of scrolling text".

  Well I did (at 2x speed though). And I regret nothing. [I think the way it ends](#s " is a kinda common trope, fooling the genie/deity?") But it was delightful.

  This en't a visual novel, it's a kinetic novel!

  Thanks for the link. I'll watch when I have the time.

  Just watched the first video, pretty solid start. Would recommend, and it seems all 6 episodes are already released.

  Edit: Finished. A little uneven, but overall some good fun mixed with interesting concepts. Still recommend.

  I would love to have a conversation about the series, up until the third episode so far.

  For example, [1st episode](#s "Predicting a supernova seems like an optimal choice in this situation. Anyone feel differently? Points for questions that yield immediate answers.")
  [3rd episode](#s "What would you have finally ended up choosing as your one question? I still think there are better choices than the cure to a single disease. 1) A thousand words towards how the human race can overcome  Moloch (http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch) would be immensely useful, for example. I feel like that would counter many concerns about what humans are ready for and is ultimately more valuable than most specific technologies because it eventually encompasses them (if human society fixes it's internal strife and inefficiencies, that fixes both peoples' everyday lives as well as leading to much quicker technological progression in a mature fashion). I guess Mara could have answered in a way that defeated the purpose (for example, the answer is to produce /this/ drug and drug the whole human race into behaving itself) but it seems like at least a reasonable approach. 2) The obvious- How to safely progress towards FAI. Probably wouldn't yield an immediate result but just a good approach might shorten the road and prevent disaster. Also obvious, we might be unable to use the information at this point, so it's a waste.")
  [3rd episode](#s "I'm going to stop at the number sequence and try to figure it out now. Edit: Well, that was a huge mistake lol. Anyway, disappointing challenge and the ending wasn't very satisfying, but it was still a pretty novel entertainment, really liked it overall.")

    [Spoiler] (#s "Sorry about the 3rd episode challenge :). For a moment I thought about indicating "HEY THIS IS NOT A PUZZLE", however I ended up deciding against it. I thought "well, if people try to solve it, they will get very frustrated and possibly relate to Nando". Also part of the philosophy of the piece is that some puzzles are simply unsolvable by our level/type of intelligence; the world isn't fair, the world doesn't exist for you to solve it. Its mechanics present challenges and it doesn't care about whether you can solve them")
    ```

  IMHO, as a brazilian guy who doesn't have true command on english, the pace was just right and I put myself on Nando's perspective. The text-pace-music triumvirat  fully caught my attention.
  ```

- u/literal-hitler:
  ```
  I was kind of frustrated at having to wait for the next line of text by the time it told me this was all going to be text chat logs. I thought it was a joke, but skipping through shows this is indeed a video of just text. If I'm just going to have to sit there skipping the video ahead all the time and finding my place again, I think I'd just like it in text format, I have no idea why you would make it a video.
  ```

  - u/_brightwing:
    ```
    I think the author intended for this to be an immersion experience. Trying to convey the feeling of having a conversation through the chat, to show the intensity as Nando reacts pausing or fires off questions. The space ambient adds nicely to the story too - Stellardrone's amazing.

    It would have been nice though if the author had provided text logs as well, I like to archive interesting things.

     Hope this doesn't dissuade you from watching, this really was good - one of the better rational stories, imo. It might be better to just watch it later when there's nothing pressing to do at hand.

     Maybe we can request the author for a text version, he seems to be on reddit. u/danielrpa I'd love to have answers on few questions about the series. And ask if there were plans for a sequel or if he has any other writing.. What do you guys think? Heâ€™d fit in great with the r/rational crowd :P

      Hello brightwing!

      I actually didn't realize there was a thread about my story, quite surprised! :)

      I plan to release a text-only/ebook version of Outsider - lots of people asked for that and certainly on the plans. The reason I haven't done it yet is because I wanted it to be professionally reviewed. Folks probably spotted some errors (grammar, typos etc) and I wanted to get rid of those first :).

      I appreciate your feedback!

      It's kind of like [watching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKS3MGriZcs) Big Bang Theory without a laugh track. I realize the pauses are there for a reason, but that wouldn't make it any less annoying to watch for three hours, which would completely overshadow the point.

      I actually can't do it. I start doing that thing where I'm reading the text but I'm not processing it after a few lines. I was reminded that youtube had a fast forward feature, so I might try that a little later.
