## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  I'm starting the groundwork for a story where magic slowly gets introduced to a modern world. The main focus is gonna be on how to use the increasing magic in the name of science to further the human race, but also how humans slowly expand the ways to personally use magic. In short, it's gonna be magical engineering + some action/adventure.

  Does anyone know of some common mistakes that gets made when writing these types of stories. 

  I also haven't figured out how the magic system works yet, but it's gonna be on the hard side of the spectrum to help the magic science make some sense. Any ideas for this would also be welcome. 

  General thoughts on the subject is also much appreciated.

    A lot of stories like this that I read have a very linear progression through the magical tech. A -> B -> C -> D -> E.

    Whereas actual research, study and implementation involves unforeseen failure states. Dead ends that seemed promising before a fatal flaw was found. People getting lucky and stumbling across more effective methods than the currently accepted best.

    In short, a golden age of magi-tech discovery would be messy, with many competing theories of the underlying 'truth' of how things work. Different people and thinkers rising and falling from prominence. 

    As an author you know how it actually works, try not to give your characters a clairvoyant homing beacon that allows them to follow perfectly in your footsteps. 

    Also, unless you have an underlying reason for it, a modern revival of magic would be a renaissance of global collective study and collaboration. There is currently in place a massive global cooperative community of scientists that would serve as the foundation should such a monumental discovery such as this take place. Some would horde knowledge, particularly if it was dangerous or affected their mind to make them do so, but the vast sum of current technical magic understanding would be a simple google search away.

    > Does anyone know of some common mistakes that gets made when writing these types of stories.

    I don't know about a common mistake in *this* kind of "scientific advancement" story, but in alternate history stories it's very common for people to overlook how some obvious advances just...didn't happen at the earliest possible moment for one reason or another, and other advances were sort of happenstance and easily could have been delayed if the stars hadn't aligned. 

    So, the principle I'd take away from this is: consider leaving some low-hanging fruit that remains unpicked just because circumstances went in a weird direction for some reason (politicking, different departments or fields not communicating with each other, a crucial resource not being easily accessible, etc).

    1 - Line up the hero's problem with the reader's curiosity.

    If your hero doesn't need magic in their life, they might spend half the story not looking where the reader hopes to go. Don't do that. Make your protagonist need to go where the reader wants to go. Give them a practical need to go where your setting is coolest.

    Obviously, there are lots of reasons to "go toward the magic." You can do a literal "magical investigator for hire". You could do "the city's new magic is messing up my job, so I have to look into what's going on." (Asimov's *Foundation* does this, only with political changes instead of magical ones.) Or "I'm dating an entity from the magic dimension, and now I need to learn everything about his entire species": now you have comic romance. Or two-fisted engineering: "I'm refitting our magic-powered starship, but only a deal with a demon is going to get us back to Earth before our oxygen runs out."

    Whatever your hero wants, make it point toward the good stuff. That's easy advice in a fast-changing or magic-ridden world, where almost any problem drives your heroes into weirdness. But you're going with the slow burn; choose your POV so it won't mean a slow book.

    Beware of protagonists who can get away with ignoring the setting you'd like to show off. Give them a challenge that *forces* them to investigate.

    2 - Develop your magical organizations, whether social, economic or military.

    People are motivated by other people, and big discoveries breed big organizations. For both storytelling and plausibility, you probably want some organizations built around exploiting or investigating magic.

    In mundane terms, who in this world is the NASA or the DARPA of crazy moonshot projects, and who's the Caltech churning out freshly minted magic-engineering graduates to work on them? What kind of work pays off your magic-student loans? If you have a crazy-bad job posting, what kind of magical contract work do you get stuck doing, and who is the scariest boss you could have?

    In novelistic terms, who are your Jedi Knights, Bene Gesserit, Magical Girls Association, Hogwarts School, Seldon Psychohistory Foundation, Lunar Revolutionary Society, or Hunger Games Tournament Administrators?

    If your protagonists work in organizations, it's a whole lot easier to hand them problems or bail them out. It also makes the world more believable.

    Of course, your protagonist is probably in a *badly functioning* organization, or else they wouldn't have story-sized problems. Classified information, budget cuts, secret conspiracies, who knows? But for you, the author, the bad personnel practices of a Hogwarts or the Jedi Knights may be just what you need to get your hero in good trouble.

    Never underestimate the power of inadequate budget and excessive expectations to get someone into a hero-sized jam. (Whether they get a raise after it's over depends on just how badly functioning you want their organization to be.)

    3 - Your magic will be as convincing as its constraints.

    Readers' quickest belief comes for problems, not fixes. So the more time the characters spend working around the *limits* of their magic, the easier it is for the reader to believe in the magic.

    Of course, classic fantasy loves to make magic something the *enemy* has, so it's always a problem, not a solution. It's no accident that Frodo doesn't dare use the One Ring, or that the tradition is "evil sorcerers and heroic warriors" and not the other way around.

    But if you want the good guys to have magic, and you want the reader to buy it, figure out what the *limits* are. Figure out why those limits keep being a problem.

    Classic constraints include "magic causes madness," "magic uses an expensive power source," or "magicians are government-regulated and your protagonist has to stay hidden from the government."

    Since you're doing an optimistic-over-time story, you might go with "power source." The spice must flow! The unobtanium must be obtained! And stop using up our limited supply before we get back to base, hero!

  One of my stories that I've been developing for a couple of years has a major conflicting intersection between technology and magic. Essentially, using high energy density chemical reactants in all but the most secure situations is suicidal because magic finds it laughably easy to prematurely detonate any such large densities of potential energy, often also diverting them along unintended paths.

  The most obvious outworking of this is that modern ballistic weapons, while invented, are seldom used. Carrying around ammo is essentially carrying around a bomb that any enemy mage can detonate on your person from a horizon's distance away.

  You can ward against this, but you need to be both more skilled, more powerful and have more time than the mage trying to interfere. In practice, there are more efficient uses of magic than trying to keep chemical reactant weapons feasible in all but edge cases.

  I'm pretty solid on how this has impacted military strategy and all its outworkings.

  Economically I could use some hole punching. What major industries become totally unfeasible due to the risk of energy sabotage. Some examples of adaptions already in use;

  \* All electrical grids are localised to at most a suburb in size. Limiting the scope infrastructure damage that a single lightning mage could do by violently discharging out the power lines.

  \* Most large scale battery use is stored kinetically, the most stable and least easily magically exploitable kind of potential energy.

  \* Heavy industry and manufacturing is typically done far underground outside the reach of a mage on the surface. Necessitating infiltration of a facility to ruin its machines. This hikes up production costs significantly, which is thankfully *mostly* offset by magic. Things are not quite as cheap as they are in our world however due to the flow on economic effects.

  \* When use of chemical reactants is just too useful to replace, efforts are focused on Information Security, both through standard measures and magical Warding against detection. So while the technology is still used a lot more than the public is aware, it is on a strictly need to know basis (especially strict, given that every person that knows about it makes it easier to find through magical scrying).

  What other major adjustments would society as a whole need to make? Magic allows for improvements in efficiency, storage and overall maintenance that could render obsolete replacement technologies back to being viable. Solutions that rely on a complete magical replacement are nearly as vulnerable as what they are replacing, so would only be used to do something that technology literally cannot, and even then, only if it was entirely necessary to remain competitive economically or militarily.

    The bad news here for your setting is that body fat has comparable energy density than gasoline (less energy per mass, but more energy per volume) and between three to eight times the energy density of gunpowder. Worse yet, a piece of wood contains more energy than an equal weight of gunpowder. Unless the burn rate (which is especially high for gunpowder - it mostly goes off all at once) is more important than the total energy available, the soldiers and the trees are going to be more explosive than the actual bullets.

    So. Let's go with the premise that while magic can make a given fuel source ignite, it cannot make it ignite all at once (unless, as with gunpowder, the fuel source is inclined to do that anyways) and has difficulty in causing ignition comparable to that required to ignite the item normally. Aluminum is quite safe, trees are fine and people are fine if a wizard isn't setting them on fire right now, but gasoline is too dangerous to use and gunpowder is right out. This suggests that we're looking for an energy source which contains a great deal of energy in a vary small and easily warded space, but which does not release said energy very quickly no matter what you do with it. This suggests that we make the switch over to, god help us, radiothermal generators and betavoltaic batteries.

    Consumer electronics are basically no problem. We have the technology now to run a laptop using a betavoltaic cell, and those are considered weird novelty items rather than a backbone of consumer electronics. Presumably in the universe where lithium ion batteries are grenades even if you *don't* bend them, we'll have worked out even more of the kinks involved in their manufacture. Smartphones, streaming video and the internet are all still available. We probably make the switch over to fiber optic sooner rather than later.

    Running an oven costs about 2 KWh per hour, and running an air conditioner costs about 3. A cheap strontium-90 generator (not the sort that uses a critical mass, the sort that relies on the fact that radioactive metals are naturally quite warm no matter what) can easily generate 5 kWh per hour with a 12kg machine over the course of a 25 year lifespan before you have to bring it into the shop to have the isotopes swapped out. (You would not do this inside your house because of the beta emissions. It's the sort of thing you'd wear a special suit in a lead lined room to do.) The average home probably still has solar panels on the roof as a supplemental option and to keep the lights on when the generator is on the weak end of the cycle, but it probably isn't hooked up to the grid, even on a local level.

    An electric car wants around 80 kWh/h to use, which can helpfully be provided by a half kilogram battery that runs on polonium-210. This is actually safer than the strontium generator (less beta particles), but has the decided downside of having only a ~3 month lifespan between isotope replacements. Still, given the setting, it's safer than trying to use a standard car battery. I imagine most people will switch over to bicycles if they can, as radioactives are both scary and expensive, leaving them as a tool for the rich and powerful. Your Uber driver is some dude on a rickshaw, but he still has a working radio.

      You totally picked out the largest major form of transport. Enchanted Bicycles. :)

      People are safe as souls inherently resist foreign influence within their domain, a mage *could* kill them through energy release immolation, but it would be less effort to just telekineticly stab them.

      Thanks for the pointer on Wood. It indeed would become dangerous if the tree has died, so using it in construction is a bit of a no no. Although using magic to weave a still living frame construct would be workable for the super wealthy that like that aesthetic.

      Thanks for the generator breakdown. Electrical Current is another form of energy that is very easy to screw with, but everyone essentially accepts that risk because well, its electricity, you kind of need it. If you don't have to worry about Warding your generator, you can spend that same money to maintain a Ward of your wiring, so I'll make use of radioactive decay generation. Thank you.

  I need inspiration for fantasy trees that have difficult or costly requirements to grow in a way that produces the highest quality fruits. 

  I have kind of hit a dry patch with my ideas and need new ideas to shake something loose.

  The goal is fantastic trees that can be used to produce really cool stuff but won't result in crafters having entire forests of them. The trees will be used in relation to crafting in a VRMMO, so I prefer difficulties that are not necessarily hard game mechanics but not too soft.

  For example a large thirsty tree that prefers blood over water and produces different fruits depending on the blood. Getting enough dragon blood for one tree is a rough challenge but doable, not so much for a larger group of trees. 

  Or a mangrove tree that depends heavily on the special qualities of the water. Getting a pool of special water might be doable, but a whole lake? Difficult. 

  Or a tree that only grow in the deep deserts in small spots where an ancient war has turned the sand magical. Those areas might only hold one, or very few, trees (leading to turf wars), and while shipping enough sand for one tree to be grown in a more defensible position is doable, it does not scale easily.  

  Or a tree that only grows on the floating rocks of high-level Splorgablorg, which means all kinds of logistical and defense issues, and no option to relocate to a more advantageous location.

  I welcome any ideas!

    Having not read the other answers, apologies if I hit something that's already there:

    * A tree that grows more powerful with other trees around, meaning that the limiter is that you want to keep them from going critical, so can't have too many together in one place at one time. If you want too many at once to be less catastrophic than my first thought, then you could just have trees that refuse to fruit when there are others nearby, which might be mediated in different ways.
    * A tree that doesn't fruit without pollinators doing their work, where the pollinators are something rare and exotic, like a specific type of bee.
    * A tree which cannot survive on its own, requiring specific flora and fauna to be planted/raised with it, in a delicate chain of dependency that's *just* on the right side of feasibility. For game mechanical purposes, you could suppose that each tree requires a costly artificial biome of a certain size, expertise to keep it running, and a fairly large footprint.
    * A tree that requires a specific type of highly skilled labor that absolutely does not scale well, for one reason or another. A tree that needs an opera singer every two days would be highly expensive, and opera singers are in relatively rare supply, with not enough of them to make a farm unless you start training them up yourself.
    * A tree that fights others of its own kind, in some way or another. You've already mentioned resource scarcity, but I'm thinking more about the idea of adversarial trees that will make active attempts at killing each other, perhaps through spores, perhaps through poisons, or in some other way. (This would seem maladaptive on the face of it, but there's probably some way to justify it.)
    * Trees that upset the local ecosystem to such a degree that you can't have more than one or two of them close by. Resource scarcity is a good example, but there are lots of different directions you could go with it. For example, a tree that takes in so much carbon dioxide and pumps out so much oxygen that three of them together can asphyxiate a whole forest of regular trees. Or trees that output hydrogen gas, which above a certain threshold will cause explosions. If you wanted to go really exotic, you could have trees that feed on gravity (too many of them and everything nearby will start floating), or that feed on time (too many and time dilation means that they never end up fruiting), or something weird like that.

    The [Greater Mophete](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Erythrina_lysistemon%2C_habitus%2C_Uniegeboutuine%2C_a.jpg) is a large woody tree popular among craftsmen for the numerous and nearly indestructible spines which grow inside the fruit. Unfortunately, this species only pollinated by the Dire Hummingbird, a highly territorial species which requires several acres of [Bloomtide Creeper](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Lonicera_sempervirens_close_up_bloom.JPG/1024px-Lonicera_sempervirens_close_up_bloom.JPG) vine or similar as a supplementary nectar source. Care should be taken to periodically purge the creeper groves of any insects greater than 20cm in length, as these compete with the Hummingbird for nectar and may injure it during feeding if allowed to excessively colonize the Bloomtide Groves.

        The **Imperial Poplar** is the single specific tree which is heir to the Throne of Aspen, having reigned from its home at the Garden House in Cumberance, West Cornalia for the past 129 years. Upon its death, long may that day be delayed, all of its titles and magical potency shall be transferred to its heir through the traditional method of lineal primogeniture. To this end, Garden House maintains a dedicated chivalric order, the Knights of the Emerald Aegis, to defend against any lumberjack-assassins sent by rival claimants. Other members of the lineage have only modestly useful properties.

        The **Nine Wise Hazels** are a set of magically created trees which endowed with oracular power through a technically simple but logistically demanding ritual - one simply needs to plant a hazelnut in the midst of a great deal of knowledge gathered all in one spot (in the form of written documents, educated scholars, chalkboards full of equations, etc.) and recite a certain well known poem. The trick to it is that the quantity of knowledge required increases by an order of magnitude with each new Wise Hazel currently in existence. As such, nine is not a hard limit, but rather the current world record. 

        The **Wraith Banyan** is a species of strangler ficus which is the unique beneficary of ectopollination, the fertilization of a flowering plant by ghosts. As such, it is only capable of being grown along the haunting paths of ghosts, a process which (due to the nature of the banyan as an epiphyte) first requires the growth of a suitable set of trees along the route of the ghost in question, followed by the seeding of the Banyan itself. Care must be taken not to disturb the haunting, as this will result in the Banyan failing to fruit properly if the ghost's haunting path begins to deviate.

            Depending on how MMO-y you're going, I could *definitely* see the **Nine Wise Hazels** working out really well, since they're essentially a leaderboard, but with the bonus that it's possible to sabotage other players.

            If you're going especially MMOish, with a bunch of frequently-respawning mobs that one must grind, you could probably pull off a variant of the **Wraith Banyan** that's dependent on those mobs (and disrupted by players grinding)

    A tree that takes in large quantities of air pollutants in order to produce beautiful crystalline 'fruit' that are valuable for the industry which happens to create those pollutants. Unfortunately, each tree creates a 'dead-zone' of pollutant-free air wherever they are planted, meaning that forests are essentially impossible to create in a way that leads to high-quality crystals. Additionally, the industry needs to cluster in order to produce enough of the pollutant for a single tree, so evenly spaced fields with small clusters in each area won't work out. Whether the feedback loop is by design or an unforeseen consequence of evolution is unknown.

    A tree that walks on its roots, with animal intelligence, and is *extremely* territorial. Any interaction between two members inevitably results in one dying in the fight and the other succumbing to its wounds soon after. Alone, they are rowdy, but can be coaxed into letting their wondrous leaves be harvested in small amounts. Unfortunately, the trees have remarkable senses - and if they can detect the presence of another of their kind for miles around, they'll go out of their way to combat them. Additionally, if they're constrained artificially, they'll die.

    A tree which can grow in a variety of locations. Its sap can be distilled into a reflective liquid that is ideal for divination and precognition. However, said liquid only enhances those skills for the place of harvesting - divination only looks there, and precognition can only be performed there. Additionally, if multiple trees are planted close by each other, the visions their sap allows for become muddled, almost as if they're trying to show multiple futures or locations at once in a way that makes it incomprehensible. Thus, while it is possible and plausible to have a lot of the trees all in one location with a bit of maintenance, the act of allowing it makes the desired product useless.

    Hope these ideas help!

    The tree could be vulnerable to some sort of vermin. Sure, perfectly healthy magic trees could produce the best magical staves. But ones riddled with magic eating termites?

    Or magic eating parasitic vines.

    Or the creature could be perfectly fine with the trees, using them to aid in breeding, but is a vermin to other areas, causing the people in those areas to want to destroy forests.

    Or those people could just be Anti-magic luddites and could try to spray magic devouring herbicide on large concentrations of the tree.

    Alternatively, growing trees could just grow slowly and tiny: A magical bonsai, as opposed to a magical poplar or magical seqouia.

    If magical quality is proportional to age, you can HAVE entire forests planted, but they'll be for low grade single year items, not for high grade 300 year old items.

    If the tree sucks up ambient magic as part of its own feeding cycle, concentrating it for powerful items, it may simply be impossible to grow them too close together: It would be like having two normal trees to close, where one grows a bit faster and then it's shade takes up too much of the sunlight the other tree needs to live.

    But if it sucks up the ambient magic for miles around, any creatures or casters that also use ambient magic might not take kindly to a tree in the area sucking up a resource they were planning to use and might try to destroy them.

      Some really good ideas that I hadn't thought of. I especially like the  "magic feeding" one as it fits one of my missing pieces nicely. 

      The vermin has potential, but would have to be combined with something else to prevent crafters from simply planting the trees in regions that do not have the vermin.

    You also want them to be magical, and carry weight, so.. Grave Trees. they only grow on grave sites, take centuries to grow, cutting them down is a no-no, only careful harvesting of branches, and the wood only keeps its properties if worked by descendants of the dead. I am here assuming you just want to keep items of this kind moderately scarce, and not the sole-province of kings or the like. This way, the game keeper can have a magic bow, but it is not something s/he picked up in a shop, it is *important* to said game keeper, and he or she wont have half a dozen magic items unless they are the solve survivor of a bloodline that got nearly annihilated
