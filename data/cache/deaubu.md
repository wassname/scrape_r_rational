  Always enjoy a good Asimov story. This one had plenty of coverage in his collections, but it is a good one nonetheless :)

    Briefly: A politician launches a smear campaign against an opponent, claiming that he's a robot, and the opponent responds. Dr. Lanning and Dr. Susan Calvin, recurring characters in Asimov's work, both appear in the story.

  good read, though when it comes to lawyers accusing each other of being robots, nothing beats Stanislaw Lem's "Washing Machine Tragedy".
