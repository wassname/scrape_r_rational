        Best case scenario, it becomes a sort of common project that anybody can add stories to, and eventually we'll have enough good ones that we can make a reading canon (though probably not a continuity canon) out of them.

    Maybe that was high-handed of you... but literally the OP starts by defining rational fiction in the most insulting way possible (and such that only a caricature of HPMOR fits his definition), and then various posters continue with either claiming that rational fictional=good fiction (despite numerous counter examples of good fiction that is not 'rational') or lumping all rationalist fiction in with the worst traits of HPMOR or any number of misunderstandings that show they have only read 1 or 2 rationalist stories and not bothered reading the subreddit of tvTropes page at all.

    So the thread was probably going to be shitshow regardless.

    Edit* expanding on my post because I thought of more points to rage about... Earthscorpion shows up to tone police, not the numerous other insults such as calling rational fanfic fans EY cultists, but rather Daystarelds' post calling them out.  People trying to get the thread "back on topic" by returning to the OP even though OP was poorly thought out and/or outright trolling, also ignoring what little advancement the discussion has had from OP.  The LotR being brought up 3 separate times, with the discussion repeating itself down the same way.  People asking why JJBA isn't rational in order to call /r/rational too general... like wtf, in JJBA new applications of powers and powers themselves are randomly invented every couple of fights, the fights often consist of absurd guesses and predictions of opponents actions... trying to call it rational to prove that rational fix definition is too general seems especially disingenuous to me (for the record, I found the dozen or so episodes I watched to be fun, but too repetitive for me to watch the whole series).

    So I think your mistake was trying to fairly engage with them at all.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      I probably got a bit carried away there, but I hope my posts at least showed some people that they were being grossly unfair and unproductive.

      If not and I just succeeded in coming off like an asshole... Whelp, mea culpa. Hopefully I learn from the experience and do better next time.
      ```

      - u/scruiser:
        ```
        So I binged through the rest of the thread... it looks like eventually the discussion actually shifted in a somewhat more productive direction of discussion the definition of "rational" "rationalist" in a manner that at least got the two sides talking to each other.  Ironically, you jumping back in with responses to older comments dragged the discussion back down some.  Of course, given the overall crappiness of the original post, and the regular repetition of points already addressed, its not like anything of value was lost.

        > Hopefully I learn from the experience and do better next time.

        I think you've already done better than EY's worst case of every "critic is a sneer troll", so there's that.  In the case of this thread, I think the best case would probably have just been to respond to the few legitimate points, explain why the "accidentally" insulting comments were insulting (example: many people empathize with characters like HJPEV and actually talked like him as a kid, so calling him an inhuman mindless robot is insulting to these people), and outright ignore the directly insulting comments (i.e. /r/rational is a cult, this comment is not even worth trying to address).
        ```

          >  Ironically, you jumping back in with responses to older comments dragged the discussion back down some.

          Yeah, in future situations, upon returning to a thread after being away a bit, I'm definitely going to read through to the present part of a thread before I start responding to the people who responded to me, so as not to shift the tone back if it's moved on.

          >and outright ignore the directly insulting comments (i.e. /r/rational is a cult, this comment is not even worth trying to address).

          I disagree with this. There are people who legitimately don't know what the community is or have never heard of places like LessWrong. I think it's worth pushing back against accusations of being a cult. I could be wrong though.
          ```

            Just made it to the end of the thread... ironically it was locked a few pages after the discussion had turned mostly civil.

            > I disagree with this. There are people who legitimately don't know what the community is or have never heard of places like LessWrong.

            From my lurking on space battles and other forums, I have seen people that know that lesswrong is just a collaborative blog yet still choose to use the "cult" label.  At this point, "sneer troll" is probably the correct label for them.  As to informing third parties, a link to lesswrong itself along with a few of its better posts should be enough to let someone figure out the cult claim is bullshit.

  Ugh. It's a good thing to have critics, but I really wish the criticism was *better*. Most of the issues the author seems to have with rational fiction really only hold for bad fiction. Having competent antagonists and secondary characters is a founding principle of rational fiction. It is definitely possible to evoke the feeling of a genre without jumping directly into its traps and inconsistencies. Rule based magic systems allow themselves to be used as major solutions without feeling anticlimactic. Trope longevity doesn't necessarily indicate the quality of a trope. 

  The observation that characters seem to become less human in rational fiction is true somewhat more often than the others. It's not true most of the time however and isn't a necessary part of rational fiction. Characters failing due to biases and errors in judgement is a hallmark of rational fiction, and I think rational fiction does a better job of handling this than a lot of other genres. It is a much more enjoyable thing to see a character make a mistake and then have that mistake dissected and analyzed than to have a character fail and never learn from it. 

  This view of rational fiction seems to take the worst pieces of fiction that claim the label and then say that the problems with them are inherent parts of rational fiction as a genre. This is problematic.

    The part that amazes me is that they felt so strongly about this issue that they actively went out and started a discussion about it, just for the purpose of saying how awful this thing that they don't like is. They have denied and ridiculed the genre as a whole, as well as the very polite and reasonable words of the rational-fiction fans who have tried to engage with them.

      Meh, this is very normal and fun. You just don't like being on the receiving side.
       Do you remember that [Doctor Strange is the anti-rational movie and I hate it](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5as909/spoilers_doctor_strange_is_the_antirational_movie/) post we had a while ago? Pretty sure the director didn't kick any puppies.

      Sure generalization is unfair but nothing new. We've seen that before with fanfiction being ridiculed. Presumably a lot of bad rational fiction has been uploaded and they got sick of seeing it.

  I find this exchange on page 15 funny:

  >> The definition of rational fiction has been debated at great length, so I'm not going to touch on how it applies to unaffilliated works, but stories written to fall into that category follow guidelines summarized on /r/rational's sidebar:

  >> Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.

  >> Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".

  >> The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.

  >> The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.

  > Which runs into the same issue that's been raised over and over - by this description, The Lord of the Rings is rational fiction. I Want My Hat Back is rational fiction. Frozen is rational fiction. Star Wars is rational fiction.

  Really, as their examples of things that fit these criteria they picked *The Lord of the Rings* and *Star Wars*? They would be hard-pressed to find worse examples.

  *Star Wars* literally has a dark side and a light side of the force, with the Empire committing genocide and the rebels saving planets of cute aliens.

  *The Lord of the Rings* was explicitly constructed to be an epic about the conflict between good and evil. That's the entire point of the series.

  It is simply staggering to me that they could say something so fundamentally incorrect yet still believe that they are shedding light on someone else's unacknowledged biases.

    Yeah, pretty much. He's got his opinion and he's sticking to it. Various people laid out some points in support of the idea "not all rational fiction is bad", but he and his supporters were having none of it. 

    One thing I noticed: the anti-RF crowd were really rude, and the pro-RF were not, despite the fact that we were the ones being attacked. Go, Team RatFic! I'm proud to be part of a community that has such positive norms.
    ```

    - u/melmonella:
      ```
      Also, quick question. Does Practical Guide To Evil count as rational fiction? Everything there happens because the plot requires it, but in that world Plot is, pretty much, a force of nature. It also violates second rule (factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil") in a pretty obvious way.
      ```

      - u/CeruleanTresses:
        ```
        I'd say it counts, since the characters aren't just swept along by the "narrative," but actively work around it or manipulate it to their own ends. It's not much different than a character in an Earth-like setting taking advantage of real-world physical principles to achieve their goals.
        ```

      - u/Anderkent:
        ```
        The setting's been mostly consistent so far, so I'd say it is. I don't think it violates rule 2; some characters choose which side of the conflict they want to join, and just because the sides call themselves 'good' or 'evil' doesn't actually mean that's the root of the conflict.
        ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        People only join the *side* of Good or Evil because their beliefs and values drive them to it, though, and "Good" and "Evil" are much more complex notions - to the point that we've got people on every point of the Good/Evil spectrum constantly scheming against eachother. If you think about who actually fights who in the story, only a small fraction of it is even Good vs. Evil at all.
        ```

      - u/GaBeRockKing:
        ```
        PGtE isn't particularly rational, as it doesn't make a serious effort to have "fair play whodunnits." Given any particular decision, you can see that it was in-character with the information they had, but you likely couldn't have predicted the character would do them beforehand with the informationn *you'd* been given. There's also a fair bit of "not explaining the plan." What got me to decide it wasn't rational specifically was the way [Spoilers](#s "catherine got revived"). As a reader, I didn't know enough about how the in-universe narrative-causality worked to predict it beforehand in any real sense.

        Of course, I might have missed some foreshadowing a few chapters earlier, in which case I'd be wrong.

        It's still a great story, of course, and I'm happy to see it posted for discussion, but it's more rational-tangent than actually rational, like worm is.

          That's not actually a requirement for rational fiction as far as I can tell from the sidebar. Characters have to solve problems through the application of *their* knowledge, not yours.

          Though yes, it was quite sudden. It has been foreshadowed a bit when Catherine was talking about revivals before, but not really in depth.
          ```

          - u/GaBeRockKing:
            ```
            The reason I consider the fair play whodunnit as crucial to rational fiction is because it's the means by which we determine whether the other tenets of rational fiction were upheld.

            >1.) Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.

            Here, if you only find out the plausible reason after the fact, that's functionally identical to something happening because the plot required it; the author made something happen, and *then* provided the justification. Of maybe they planed everything books in advance, but the point is that we wouldn't *know*.

            >2.) Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".

            This one doesn't actually require a fair play whodunnit, I admit.

            >3.) The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.

            Here, again, the fair play whodunnit is necessary. Without holding the information in advance, it's again impossible to tell if the character was given their information previously, or if the author decidedto bestow that information to get out of a corner they'd written themselves into. Offscreen character knowledge a character couldn't be expected to know is functionally identical to powers as the plot demands.

            >4.) The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.

            And this one pretty clearly requires the fair-play whodunnit as well. If we don't understand the rules of the fictional world, then we can't make a judgement on if they're sane and consistent.

            Of course, not all of these things need to happen all of the time; an author can chose to break genre conciets to make better writing. But it's my personal judgement that PGtE doesn't follow these rules often enough (well, save 3, paradoxically) to qualify as rational. If there was some way to predict its internal narrative causality, it would count. But with the system as vague as it is, it's too hard to predict to be properly rational.

    - u/Timewinders:
      ```
      Seems pretty correct to me. When used in this sense, someone saying "such and such concept/idea/belief is problematic" is usually just a way of saying "I don't like this" or "I disagree". It would have been more honest for him to name the title "This is why rational fiction sucks" or something, but he used the word "problematic" to seem more authoritative and objective. It is pretty pretentious and arrogant.

  All of these points are false and/or solve each other.

  For points two and three, of course most fiction hase genre caveats and weird people who do things without using logic.  The whole point is recognizing that fiction is riddled with these characters and putting a rational character into the middle of them.  The main reason a lot of rational fiction is fanfiction is it's poking fun of and exploiting the fact that the cannon characters do irrational things and pointing out how they're being irrational.

  Further, point two is definitely false.  You can easily have a character who's rational and logical but isn't a cold emotionless robot.  For example, basically any educated person in real life.  Certainly some characters in some rational stories go too far, sometimes on purpose sometimes not.  But since typical stories don't even attempt to use logic or rational behavior in the same way that humans do, it's not unreasonable to try to add some more logic.  If you tried to write as realistic a character as possible into the Harry Potter universe, it would certainly end up looking a lot closer to HPMOR than it would to cannon.

  As for point one, it's also blatantly false.  You can write a story in which multiple or even all characters are rational.  Or you could write one with rational characters and "normal" story characters.  Maybe they'll look stupider in comparison, but it's only necessary to actually make them stupider if you're making a Mary Sue rational circlejerk fanservice sort of story.  in HPMOR, he did sort of make Dumbledore... not stupid per se, but kind of weird in my opinion.  But Quirrelmort was definitely rational.  Hermione and Draco were rational at least in so far as they did things for well thought out, intelligent reasons.  And most of the other characters were just sort of normal people.

  Mostly this guy is just sort of taking the worst flaws that some rational fiction writers make and trying to argue that they're somehow inherent and unavoidable to the genre as opposed to over-exaggerations that some new writers occasionally make.  An issue that occurs in all fanfiction, not just rational ones.

  He's absolutely correct about pretty much everything he's saying, except for the fact that it only applies to bad rationalist fiction.

  His first point about the main character being smart giving everyone else an intelligence downgrade is pretty funny, since most (well done) rational fanfiction actually gives the background and main characters more intelligence than canon, not less. I do agree that there's plenty of "HEY IM HARRY LOOK I SMART, DUMBLEDORE WHY ARE YOU SO INCOMPETENT AND SENILE," but you honestly can't say that those shit fics represent the whole genre.

        For the record, I think that Harry was frequently a smug, obnoxious jerk. I also think he had the best intentions, cared a lot about people and the world in general, and was really clever. 

        The people in the thread keep saying that he "doesn't act human". He doesn't act like an 11-year-old, true. That's a little jarring, although there's an in-universe reason. I think what they really mean is that "he behaves like a utilitarian and I believe that no one behaves like a utilitarian and/or utilitarians are horrible people because they do things that I see as bad on a local scale just because it's good on a global scale." 

        HPMOR definitely had flaws, but I enjoyed it tremendously, despite thinking that Harry was often smug and obnoxious.

      - u/PhilipTrettner:

        Maybe it's just more nuanced. I think Harry is a smart ass and probably an unpleasant person to have around (which qualifies as "what a little shit" in my book). I still like him a lot and I believe that that's not cognitive dissonance but rather identification ;)

  Such an odd rant. One of the reasons I really enjoy rational fiction is because this:

  >One: To create a hypercompetent main narrator you must make everyone else incompetent.

  ... is not supposed to happen. I can think of several rational or rationalist fanfictions I've read where the source material has much more incompetence; HPMOR, R!Animorphs, Pokemon: TOoS, Metropolitan Man, Luminosity.

  I wonder what the ranter had been reading?

  >Which leads into the second problem with rational fics: the characters are too focused on 'intelligence' or 'rationality' and somehow forget to be people.

  Sometimes I can see this as a valid point, but usually the longer a work goes on, the less I feel that way. I've been eating up *Heroes Save the World* recently and originally felt the kids were just too emotionally detached to be believably dealing with the situation... and then I get to an entire chapter that focuses on the trauma it's been inflicting on one of them. 

  And in some other fics with rational themes (if not exactly rational entirely), it's a plot point. In *The Games We Play* it is mentioned as a plot point several times that the kind of modifications and trials facing the main character should be cracking his mind like an egg, but his power helps protect him and make it no more traumatic than, well, a game.

  >Plus what's the point of having real conflicts if your character will just go 'this is the optimal' solution, solve it, done done NO FUCKING TENSION AT ALL.

  Again, this seems to make no sense and makes me wonder what he's been reading. I can't think of any rational fiction I've read with a straight-up Mary Sue who instantly figures out the best method and never makes a mistake. A huge part of the drama is that the characters often know they *don't* know enough and hope their plan works based on their limited information or options. Plenty of rational fiction is extremely dark for exactly this reason; *Worm* comes to mind. 

  >Three: Do you realize what genre cavets and aesthetic trappings are?

  I just think this is a matter of preference. Some people prefer not to look deeper at the concepts in a story - they are happy to go along for the ride and trust that things will work out. But it's a key part of rational fiction that there are rules (even if they may be almost entirely unknown). I much prefer creative solutions to macguffins or "it happened for the sake of the plot." Others, maybe, do not. But even then there are fictions where the twist is that the plot or macguffin are also guided by rules. *A Practical Guide to Evil* has this as a running theme; the meta-conflict is whether the structure set up by Good and Evil can be overthrown, and if the characters are actually doing so or are just acting out their roles. *Unsong* is entirely based on this; everything that happens is for the sake of the plot, because nothing is a coincidence. 

  As mentioned, I wish the ranter had given some concrete examples of what works he's thinking about. The only one I think I've read on Sufficient Velocity is *Dungeon Keeper Ami,* and I think the only point of his that might apply is the idea of incompetent foes.

  Edit: One last thing is that the ranter's definition of "rational" does not match what I think of (which is the sidebar here). His rant specifically seems to be against science porn that masquerades as rational*ist* fiction. Not actually rational fiction in general.

    I would not count Worm as rational fiction.  it does have cases of characters thinking things through, but it also has as a more or less explicit conceit that shards mess up people's ability to be clearheaded and get along, as well as having cosmic entities that think in arbitrary ways and several plot devices.  And not every character uses their abilities in the most efficient way (I have a hard time seeing why Contessa doesn't get up each week and go "path to having a list of the 20 most interesting things that will happen this week, by my current standards and assuming no further uses of this power".)

    Some of these things are arguably rational, but I'd say they are only rational in a trivial way.  "People fight because shards make them want to" is, literally, people doing things for a reason, so the definition is literally satisfied, but I think that goes against its spirit.

  I feel like a large part of the disagreement is the expectation that `rational` fiction should be a well defined genre, with sharp lines deciding whether a particular fic is or isn't rational. That might be the case for rational*ist* fiction, but rational fiction really just stands for writing that people around here like.

  And hey, it might be that the things that make some book good to us (consistent characters, a sensible setting that follows its own rules, etc) are also the things that make some book good to other fanfic communities. There's definitely a self-selection process going on here. Thus the occasional statement of 'rational just means *good*'.

  It doesn't. Rational means good for us. "50 shades of grey" and "Twilight" are *good* fiction. Look at the sales! People **LIKE** them. Maybe not the people around here, maybe not the kind of people that go into detailed analysis of particular fiction genres on online forums. But others do.

  So we need a word for a particular class of writing that appeals to us, that is consistent and well characterised and avoids plot holes etc. etc. Because we used to call that 'good', but that is empirically incorrect. And 'rational' is a word, it fits the spirit of the concept, and so it took off.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    >That might be the case for rationalist fiction, but rational fiction really just stands for writing that people around here like.

    I kind of disagree with this. I mean, yeah, we had to find a label for it and that's the one that stuck, but "rational fiction" pretty well describes the core tenets of the genre, as defined in the sidebar and on the tvtropes page and elsewhere. 

    I don't see why we should back down from the label and say "Rational means good for us."  No, rational fiction means rationally written and explored fiction. Not all rational fiction is "good" and not all non-rational fiction is "bad."  

    And that doesn't mean my taste in stories isn't affected, to some degree, by how rational it is. I liked The Dark Knight even though it's got plotholes big enough to drive a batmobile through,  but I didn't like The Dark Knight Rises because those plot holes were big enough to sink a football stadium into.  (Was it a football stadium? I forget. You get the point.)  If TDK was more irrational I would have liked it less, and vice-versa. But I can explain why, objectively. That I care about those things is part of my personal taste, but those things themselves are not.

      The one dude who called the term "rational fiction" a "marketing term", while being derisive, wasn't *so* far off the mark. I'm not so sure that rational fiction is a genre so much as a collection of secondary attributes that can apply to any genre. It would be like calling "stream-of-consciousness" a genre, when it's really more of a tactic or style used. 

      I think this is supported by the fact that "rational" is a bit of a sliding scale; no one gets into arguments over whether or not a story is fantasy, or more fantasy than another fantasy (barring perhaps Star Wars), but whether a story is rational is very much greyscale. Some stories are more rational than others. 

      In addition, would it be possible to have a rational story that did *not* overlap on any other genre circle in a venn diagram? A rational story that was not also a mystery, or a superhero story, or a sci-fi, or what have you? If it can't stand alone, I'm not sure it deserves to be called a genre.

        This. I had to stop reading the thread because People Being Wrong In Obvious And Simple Ways is very frustrating, but I was hoping that we might be able to come up with a better definition of rational fiction. 

        I like how you describe it as an approach rather than a genre. Maybe it's comparable in that sense to e.g. "grimdark." I don't think that you can quite have a "grimdark genre" but there's definitely a cluster of shared qualities, and you could easily have an /r/grimdark that talked about grimdark fiction. Hell, insofar as some people think that all good literature has to be depressing as fuck, you could easily see a "Why 'Grimdark' is Problematic" thread where some of the posters are arguing that "grimdark" is just being used to describe good fiction and is a useless term.

      - u/DaystarEld:

        Oh absolutely, there's rational sci-fi and rational fantasy and so on. But I don't think there's any reason it needs fo stand alone to be a genre.

        I actually think of it like "romance." Lots of settings and stories can be considered romance stories in addition to their other descriptions, but if you just call something a romance story, or a rational story, the implication is that at the very leasr you know something about it, even if it's a modern, realistic story.
        ```

        - u/ketura:
          ```
          There's still a pretty big leap between a story being a Romance, and a story having romantic elements (such as Star Wars).  I wouldn't call Star Wars a Romance, there's a very particular focus that romantic stories have that Star Wars delegates to the backburner.  

          Which makes the comparison to Rational pretty apt, I suppose.  We have a conflation of vocabulary between Rational the genre that presupposes munchinry, transhumanism, AI, competency porn, and setting fixing, and the rational elements that we have on the sidebar.  We've noticed this problem and have bandied about "rationalist" to attempt to address it, but I think that's fixing a different problem.   

          So as usual, I guess we have vocabulary to blame at the heart of it all.  Rational the genre, vs rational elements, and one side is talking about one while the other is objecting about the perceived sleight on the other.

      On the rational writing podcast, when discussing the definition of rational fiction, the idea that it was 'thinky' fiction came up, that a common feature in rational stories is that they made you think about what was going on.

      I think it's slightly more general than that, and I'll say that I think the (or, at least, *a*) core of rational fiction is that intelligence is a core virtue of the story.  Battles will be won and lost primarily based on who had the better plan, who prepared more, who improvised the quickest, and so on.  This would be in contrast to the 'generic action show' where Determination and Fighting For What You Believe In are core virtues that decide the outcome.  In generic action show, whether the battle is won or lost depends almost entirely on whether the hero can get his second wind when things look down (often triggering some superpower to justify the success of said second wind, but it's the same thing).

      This explains quite a few things, such as why rational fics tend to have anticlimaxes more than usual.  You specifically *need* a long, drawn-out fight to show off the raw willpower and determination of the protagonist at the climax, but in rational fiction you don't specifically need that, since you can show off the cunning of the protagonist and the extent they planned and prepared or the quality of their improvisation in a single scene where the enemy was outsmarted and simply had no hope of victory.  Of course, you can do drawn out fights this way too, but the key is that it's not *required*.  The focus on intelligence also helps explain the attention to detail and consistent rules, since your protagonist is supposed to live and die based on whether they can plan things out and grasp for advantages, and an inscrutable 'as the plot demands' ruleset is incompatible with that, whereas you don't *need* the rules to behave the same way to force your protagonist to the brink of defeat before their show of determination and second wind.

  A lot of the confusion regarding what rational fiction *is* seems to come from the fact that literally nobody from SV in that entire thread managed to understand that the bullet point definition that's being given is an extensional definition, not an intensional one. It points in rational fiction's general definition, it's not a fully complete necessary and sufficient set of constraints by which rational fiction is defined. It's like pointing to a bunch of red things to define what red is, rather than defining a specific wavelength range of light. In addition, the bullet points in the sidebar don't really mean "it's definitely rational fiction if it has these qualities." Instead, they're more along the lines of things that something has to have or it definitely *isn't* rational fiction. Actually narrowing things down from the stories the bullet points bring forward to just the stories that a reader of /r/rational would call rational fiction would take a bunch more bullet points.

  On an unrelated point, they seem to viscerally hate us, and I *recognize* that flavor of hate. It's the type of thing I see whenever someone else in the room fails to hide how nerdy they are. I mean, look at the language they're using. Robotic. Not human. That's pretty familiar to me.

  I really didn't expect SV to get in on the whole "let's hate the nerds" thing, considering, y'know, they're nerds. But apparently to urge to hate nerds is so strong it can infect nerdy communities and make them hate *more* nerdy communities.

    First off, the categories you are dividing people into have an implicit value statement: the people who like cerebral things that are useful and require skill and/or diligence are being put in one group while the trivial hobbies are going in the other. That's okay until you class the groups as "us" and "them."

  The part of this that resonated with me was the section about lack of tension. Good rational/ist fiction *does* have tension, but I can't deny that I've stumbled into more than a few "fix fic"-type stories where the hero just smugly solves every problem without setbacks, and it becomes less of a *story* and more of a dressed-up list of complaints about the original work or genre--or, in some cases, a love letter to the perfect brilliant rational hero. Of all the traps this type of fiction can fall into, that's always the one that disappoints me the most.

    This definitely happens in some rational fiction but I don't see it as endemic to the genre, and certainly not a defining characteristic of it.

    A lot of stories, regardless of genre, are poorly plotted. Rational fiction is neither exempt nor exemplar.

    It's a tricky thing to balance, sometimes, maintaining tension without resorting to deus ex machina or contrived solutions ("But wait, what if I try something I've never done before nor will ever do again?" // "That's so crazy it just might work!"). If it were easy to do then there wouldn't be so many examples (across all media and genres) which get it wrong.

   * Our definition of "rational fiction" is too broad.

  I think this is largely related to "The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent". Some of the posters there couldn't tell whether or not a world was sane and consistent, saying that "star wars" and "lord of the rings" were.

  There are a wide range of genres and characters focused on hypercompetance. Pulling out applied science and problem solving as a bad place for it seems nitpicking.

No one has issues with mcgyver solving problems as long as he limits himself to solution sets that include duct tape.

  I do think some people have issues with stories about people who are outliers in terms of temperament and approach. I've seen a number of people who are upset that the martian is not a meditation on human isolation because they can not imagine themselves or anyone they personally know be able to keep their calm in a crisis, but such people do exist.

    Thanks for popping in here! I skimmed the thread, and the impression that I got is that we're being well repped by BlazingHand, and others; I certainly couldn't do a better job.

    I would not call Jemite's tone "boylishly mischievous". He's picking a fight, and not out of fun, or good nature.

      I'm always fun and I'm always good natured! I don't know why you would have any other impression of my delightfully whimsical and cheery personality.

      I would, however, disagree on being described as 'boyishly mischievous'. I may be on occasion, mischievous, but I haven't been a child for ages /u/Admiral_Skippeh!

      Hmph!

    I don't think this SV thread is a good environment for constructive debate. Whatever the reason, most of the discussion I've seen is mostly of the "You're wrong! Here's an extensive list of reasons why!" "No, YOU'RE wrong. Here's an extensive list of every single factual inaccuracy you said!" kind.

    (plus debates about LoTR, but they're still better than all the toxicity)

    Hi, /u/Admiral_Skippeh.

    So, as far as raising objections constructively, do these posts count?

    Those are the ones I found in two minutes of searching and copy/pasting links from a search of the first three pro-RF people I happened to remember offhand.  There's plenty more in there, and by other people.  Yes, we've engaged and almost without exception we've been polite and constructive.  (I freely admit that my last post in the thread was *not* polite.)

    I read through the first 6 or 8 pages and tried to engage productively three separate times, all to no avail.  In all that time I did not see a single anti-RF person make what I would consider an honest argument.  No one offered benefit of the doubt, no one really engaged with our points, there were numerous ad hominem attacks...shoot, their definition of rational fiction was tautological to start with and they refused to update when more constructive definitions were offered.

    >We can appear like a somewhat acerbic community at first, and we have a few boylishly mischievous members like Jemite, but honestly we're a pretty friendly bunch when you get to know us. _^

    No.  This is not "boyishly mischievous", this is rudeness and contempt.  Here are some quotes to demonstrate what I'm talking about:

    [Jemnite, post #1](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/7515607/)
    Okay, first before I start, I should probably define what 'rational fiction' is. It's that sort of odd fanfic trend where you see people go, "You know what this setting could do? SCIENCE. MOTHERFUCKING SCIENCE ALL OVER THE PLACE," except oftentimes it just means they cram if full of psuedoscience and strange philosophical arguments which have nothing to do with the scientific method at all?

    [...]

    "Rational fiction [...]  hollows out the story and creates glaring faults and defects within it. It's popcorn fiction in the truest sense, it strokes the reader and author's ego for being so 'rational' and 'smart', so that they're too busy with gratification to see the major problems."


    [Jemnite, post #11](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/7515977/) "And if you can say a story that says that is still 'rational fiction', I think you are blinded by your own self-conceits and cannot see past them in order to acknowledge that something you like might be bad."

    [Random832, post #13](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/7516046/) "Another thing that rational fics suffer from is that the protagonist [...] is always a Mary Sue." 


    [Reveen, post #18](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/7516533/)
    "And frankly if you ask me, the better in terms of writing quality the work of fiction is, the less it will distinctly seem like rational fiction."

    [firefossil, post #24](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/7516775/)
    "Rational fiction is inherently disrespectful of the original work."
    [...] 
    "In short, rational fics are generally bad at fiction and bad at rationality."

    (In response to Kiba saying: " So I don't know why would anybody, rationalist or not, think like Vulcans.")

    "Start with all rationalist fiction and all people who write it."

    "Being told I was in the same lofty halls as the aforementioned MoR author wasn't exactly the most en-heartening thing in the world, either. It just comes across as one of those bizarre internet personality cults that lives five miles up its own arse, desperately attaching itself to other things like a fungus to feel bigger and more important than it actually is."

    This is just from the first couple of page, and there was a lot more that I could have included. This is not boyish mischief, this is something that we would be entirely within our rights to call a [Rule 3](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/help/rules/) violation on.

        Free speech is a lovely thing in theory, but the point of it should be to have useful interactions.  Shouting "I'm angry!" over and over is something you have the right to do, but it wastes your time and everyone else's.

  I think the complaint about character writing is very valid. The most charming characters in all rational fiction are in HPMOR, and they borrow a large part of their charm from canon. Can someone give examples of charming original characters in rational fiction?

  The complaint about deconstructing settings instead of playing with them seems valid too. Even when describing very fantastic toys, rational fiction is usually goal-oriented rather than playful. Can you name a piece of rational fiction that's as playful with its toybox as the original Harry Potter?

    >The most charming characters in all rational fiction are in HPMOR, and they borrow a large part of their charm from canon. Can someone give examples of charming original characters in rational fiction?

    Well, so much rational fiction is fanfic, there aren't very many original characters.

    People seemed very fond of Pip from Significant Digits. And Garret from R!Animorphs. ETA: and a lot of people really, really liked Quirrelmort - who's basically an OC - to the point many outright refused to believe he could be a villain.

    > Can someone give examples of charming original characters in rational fiction?


    I liked the crew in babyeating aliens. It's a short piece so obviously the presentation isn't very in-depth, but they're not vulcans.

    >Can you name a piece of rational fiction that's as playful with its toybox as the original Harry Potter?

    *Explicitly* rational fiction (i.e. self-identified rationalist)? I think the closest is Mother of Learning. ~~Non-self-identified... Omelas?~~ (see below)
    ```

    - u/Evan_Th:
      ```
      Omelas?  You're calling *Omelas* playful?  What do you mean by "playful," then?

      *Those Who Walk Away From Omelas* grabs one image, shoves it in our face, and wiggles it about a little to make sure we notice.  To me, "playful" connotes whimsical use of many, or at least multiple, images and connotations.  I don't know of any rationalfic that can come close to canon *Harry Potter* on that, but... for something in that direction, maybe Scott's ["And I Show You How Deep the Rabbit Hole Goes"](http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/02/and-i-show-you-how-deep-the-rabbit-hole-goes)?
      ```

      - u/want_to_want:
        ```
        You're right, Scott's writing is a perfect example of something that's both rational and playful. I wish he put more effort into characters though. Unsong is pretty much a bunch of Valley archetypes and cardboard cutouts, except Dylan Alvarez who feels alive because he is an unrestrained inner part of Scott, like Tyler Durden.

  So I somehow stuck it out until page 14 before finally giving up, but here's a thing that puzzles me. Quite a few people in there were saying that they find rationalfic *disrespectful* to the original work.

  I have this ongoing thing where I try to explicitly notice and dissect perspectives that completely surprise the hell out of me -- as in, "Wow, that idea wouldn't have occurred to me at all, and I still can't quite make sense of how anyone would come up with it". (Came up with this practice because I occasionally get social advice from socially adept family and friends, generally in response to some perceived *faux pas* on my part, and about 80% of the time I wind up with this flabbergasted feeling of "Why would someone even *think* of that?!")

  This is one of those WTF ideas. I've seen it before from a bunch of friends who enjoy writing fanfic as well. How does this work? Is this some generalized dislike of all AU fics? Because as far as I can tell, if you think AU fics are okay, then this 'respect' business is just nonsense.
  ```

  - u/Anderkent:
    ```
    Not necessarily. An AU fic might take a world build by someone else, and just *add* new things to it, rather than changing/*correcting* things.

    So a fic that takes a world, and says 'this thing doesn't make sense, i'll make it better'... That's pretty disrespectful, yeah. (Though I don't really much care about fanfics being 'respectful' to the source; parodies are fun, fix fics are fun).

  I don't know why I click these kinds of links any more; I really don't. I visited the linked thread and saw... pretty much exactly what I expected to see: vitriol, name-calling, strawmanning, one-sided discussion--in other words, stuff that's completely par for the course when dealing with anti-"X"ers. I mean, like, seriously: once you've seen one of these threads, you've seen them all.

  There've been a lot of comments in this reddit post expressing confusion as to why the posters on SB/SV like doing this sort of thing so much, why their "criticism" is pretty much universally awful, etc. To me, the answer is quite simple: they don't like us. Some might call it tribal rivalry (though I think "rivalry" gives it a bit too much credit, as it implies that the dislike is mutual, which I don't find to be the case). EY calls it "sneer culture". You might call it something else--but we all know what it is I'm talking about: there's a group of people you don't like, so you insult them as much as you can, with each insult feeling deliciously cathartic, like getting to punch your sworn enemy, etc. etc. etc. ... and I really don't think there's anything more to it than that. You might protest at that, telling me to give other people the benefit of the doubt--and normally, I'd be all for that. But this, it seems to me, is a case that is ridiculously clear-cut: there are no doubts worth giving the benefit of.

  So posting this sort of thing to /r/rational, in my opinion, accomplishes little. It creates some needless drama, provides little actionable advice, and is thoroughly unpleasant to read through--to say nothing of actually *engaging* with such "criticism". (Mad props to /u/DaystarEld, /u/eaglejarl, /u/blazinghand and /u/hackerkiba by the way; you are more patient people than I.) There might be thoughtful and useful criticism of the rational-sphere out there, but to find it, we need to look elsewhere--because this ain't it.

  Aaand... I don't know what else to say. Mostly I'm just tired of having to go through this same damn song and dance every few months, or however long it actually takes before another SB/SV'er gets it into their head that creating another "I hate ~~Eliezer Yudkowsky~~ rational fiction" would be a *hilarious and original idea*.

  Seriously. Can we stop doing this? Thanks.

  - u/eaglejarl:

    I think you're right about this being sneer culture, and that we all knew we weren't going to change the sneerers' minds. I (and at least some of the others) engaged so that uncommitted people reading the thread would see a rational counterpoint. (Pun intended.). So, yeah, it's aggravating, but there is some value.

- u/LeonCross:

  Having just spent a few hours reading through the entire thread, I actually got something out of it.

  After much concideration and analyzing what I like about "rational fiction," or rather what I most enjoy when I find it in a story and the rational fiction community tends to have a solid cross section of, is Hardened Fiction.

  Thus, I shall be using Hardened Fiction to define my tastes in the future.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    That is a much better term.  "Rationality", "rationalist", and "rational fiction" are all valid terms and I see why they were adopted, but they are terrible from a marketing standpoint.  They are inherently divisive -- "if you don't agree that this is awesome then you are irrational!"  Not the best rallying cry.

    "Hardened fiction".  Great choice.
    ```

- u/somnolentSlumber:
  ```
  I can't help but think that these critics are, like, being so incredibly and unnecessarily mean, for whatever reason. It's like a palpable sense of disgust radiating from their every post, especially the thread OP's. Which is somewhat ironic, given that trying to stay as unbiased as you can is a major tenet of rationalist fiction, and these critics are so inherently biased against rational and rationalist fiction that they actually ended up rationalizing their reasons for hating it.

  Amazing.
  ```

  - u/blazinghand:
    ```
    It's actually *fitting*, not *ironic*. Irony refers to things NOT being fitting, rather than things being fitting. Ironic would be if they were attacking rational fiction while being quite rational and doing everything rational fiction does, acting like the straw vulcans they decry.
    ```

    - u/Anderkent:
      ```
      Vulcans aren't rational, let's not give their presumptions more firepower.
      ```

- u/redrach:
  ```
  It's funny how one of the stories that I've seen positively received here as an example of a rational fanfic is currently running on SV - *With this Ring*, and is fairly popular there.

  I wonder if any of the critics in that thread are following it, but don't consider it a rational fic such since it's never been advertised by the author as such?
  ```

- u/Geminii27:
  ```
  The problems mentioned aren't necessarily inherent in the genre. They might be ones which are slightly easier to fall into, but a good writer will be able to deftly avoid them just as with similar potholes in other genres.
  ```

- u/not-an-automaton:
  ```
  Look, let's be clear; Jemnite is a troll whose sole purpose in life is to create controversial threads, stir up some shit, and watch the fireworks.  They have a known habit of doing shit like this, and the only reason that they're not banned is that they manage to be sufficiently subtle about it.  The rest of the anti-rational fic people in the thread though...
