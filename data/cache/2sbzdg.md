  Downvoting because the SI protagonist wastes time fixing individual worm character's problems instead of immediately communicating the relevant information he has to people and organizations like Dragon or Cauldron that can act on it.  The worm main characters are known to us personally, so it is easier to care about them, but in the face of all humanities extinction (across multiple possible worlds), I think watching out for them should take a lower priority.  In terms of saving the world Dinah, Panacea, and Taylor are the most immediately critical and the rest can be ignored.  The only reason to hesitate telling Cauldron is because of their tendency to screw up things when they can't path to victory it. 

  The crap the protagonist tries pulling with Cauldron probably wouldn't actually work.  In order to beat Contessa's path to victory and force her to do stuff, he would need to precommit across all possible futures to only reveal his information if his demands where met.

  > cannot downvote this enough. starts surreptitiously enough, but it quickly devolves into the sort of self-indulgent fantasy that si fics are so well known for (the author can do no wrong, is loved by all (excepting the antagonists), etc.).

  Yeah, the protagonist is trying to manipulate Cauldron, and Piggot and Dragon and Armsmaster and Tattletale and Eidolon and Coil without any kind of parahuman ability.  He should have no way of succeeding at this without author fiat.  Any of them should be able to force the details out of him one way or another.  He shouldn't have even bothered trying if he is supposed to be a smart SI but he does and he succeeds and its annoying.

  I think we can all agree that this is not the sort of stuff that should be posted here. For me it's insulting to call this work 'rational'

  cannot downvote this enough. starts surreptitiously enough, but it quickly devolves into the sort of self-indulgent fantasy that si fics are so well known for (the author can do no wrong, is loved by all (excepting the antagonists), etc.). like, seriously, read this shit:
  >I had seconds in which to think, to act. I didn't even bother trying to think things through. I just acted.

  >The narrow street, with tall brick buildings on either side. No pavement to speak of. A woman, in her thirties, dragging a kid, maybe ten, by the arm. The look of desperation mirrored on each face. Running toward me. Behind them, two cars, accelerating now to catch up with them. They'd been playing cat and mouse, letting their prospective victims think they might have a chance, but now a new factor had joined the game.

  >Me.

  haha what

  there's a fuckton of this kind of thing; the author puts themselves into every fucking problem in canon, and *always* wins. there is occasionally a fumbled attempt at "conflict" but inevitably it is resolved in the si's decisive favour and he is proven to be the incredible genius we all know he is. christ.

  (ahem.)

  i don't like doing this, and i think that a work's quality (poor though it is) should be judged on the merits of the author. *however*, in this case i think the pleasure derived from the marginal extra reader pales far in comparison to the effect it has on enabling and encouraging the author. so. *please do not promote anything by ack*. roughly 50% of his works are creepy-ass sexual fantasies about underage girls -- often masquerading as standard wormfic. here's the sb mod report from one of his recent stories: 


  "I AM NOT FUCKING AMUSED.

  More to come later, as the moderation staff is currently investigating a thread. Do not make a new thread. Do not repost the story. There will be consequences for this bullshit. You deserve all of it.

  And I am incredibly disappointed in everyone who didn't report this fucking bullshit when it started being posted. God damn.

  [OPPRESSION INTENSIFIES AGAIN]

  Alright, let's make some things perfectly clear:

  First: We do not want underage sexual content on this site. This means that the following are not at all acceptable:
  A) Minors bringing each other to orgasm with their powers. On screen.
  B) Descriptions of teenagers straddling each others naked bodies.
  C) Teenagers describing, in way too much detail, how good the sex they just had was.
  D) Things along those lines. Don't try to game this. You know who you are.
  Second: If you see underage sexual content on the site, fucking report it. Jesus christ. Even if you don't want to report it, then tell the writer that they are breaking the rules and should edit if they do not want to be punished.
  Third: Do not assume that because one post is OKed everything else in the story was. This thing is five hundred thousand words long, and this judgement is only based on four chapters of that. This is now a recurring problem, as it has happened in Panacea Quest and this story.
  Fourth: To all CrW writers, please improve your prose. The moderation staff has to read a lot of your work in the process of doing our job, and if doing so is annoying, confusing, tedious, or actively painful before we get to the creepy sex stuff, we are going to be rather more annoyed than we were otherwise. (As hard as that may seem)
  Five: There are romances that are not underage girls in lesbian relationships or underage harems. This seems to be a common misconception among rule-breakers, so in the name of getting some variety in our reports, I feel this part of the PSA is necessary. Also, we give a bit more leeway to characters that aren't minors.

  Ack, for your offenses in this thread you will be getting a vacation for a month. This is the second time you have been told that 16 year olds are minors as far as SB is concerned, and I dearly hope that it sticks. This thread will not be re-opened, do not create a new one."

  he's written some more explicite underage erotica on ao3, which i will not link for obvious reasons. suffice to say that i think this sort of behaviour should be disincentivised, because nobody's really said anything so far.

    Disincentivize underage erotica by not promoting it, sure.
    Just one problem: this fic is not underage erotica, nor does it contain allusions to it. You don't think he's going to change what he writes based on intangible feedback on a story that is unrelated to the issue, surely?

    Your comments about SI problems are on the mark IMO. Your comments about underage erotica are, as far as I can tell, basically ad hominem and should not inform anyone considering viewing this. The way you stick them together makes the overall accuracy of your comment difficult to judge.
    ```

      i don't have a problem with him writing it, i have a problem with people reading it (of course, there's a pretty obvious causal relationship here). i don't expect him to change what he writes if people have a negative reaction to it, but i do expect new potential readers will be dissuaded.
      ```

    Hmm, didn't know the creepy stuff. I have enjoyed bits and pieces of this fic, but yeah... it does suffer from self insertion problems. The main character has actually beaten several capes in one on one combat, which is just so appallingly stupid given he's meant to be an overweight security guard.
    ```

  - u/AugSphere:

    Thank you for sharing your opinion. 

    Still, I have to disagree with attacking the work just because it contains underage erotica. I think that the constant effort to drive out the controversial content from every single community is harmful. The whole issue is so damn politically charged that everyone must play the game of social signalling to show how tough on child abusers the are. This stupid monkey circus is really annoying and counterproductive to minimising the abuse of actual real-life children. I urge you to reconsider you stance on this subject.

      okay. i feel like i've misrepresented my position, and for that i apologize. to make it more clear:

      >-- often masquerading as standard wormfic.

      this, more than anything else, is my problem with ack (it was probably a bad idea to isolate it to one clause). i don't have any problem with giving the kind of person who would be into underage erotica a safe way to get their rocks off (ei, a way that does not involve any actual children). i would not have any issue with ack if he were a less godawful author and occasionally also posted stuff to underage erotica dot com, or w/e. but it's important to recognize that sexual preferences are not formed in a vacuum; frequent exposure often creates attraction. my beef is not with ack writing underage erotica, it's with him combining it with otherwise unobjectionable works.
