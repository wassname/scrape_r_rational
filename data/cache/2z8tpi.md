## Writing an improved version of HPMOR, need scientists to help

### Post:

I've already started the outline, and it's coming along nicely, except that I need some people who actually know science well to help me with the science aspects of the story. Since by the time the story starts, there is centuries worth of observations and data that needs to be explainable somehow within the context of a universe that has magic in it.

Anyone with some scientific expertise who wants to help me with this?


Thanks!

  I can help with mathematics and basic physics. I think it would be a good idea to either start your own subreddit and/or have an accessible google doc which people can comment on, [similar to S.I.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-BfyA18VKxT_TJhfPtvFsj-0d7DY4BS1SLoY8fNfWc4/edit)

  I am a Chemist. I can help you with material science, chemical reactions, the effect of sulphuric acid on skin, how explosions work, stuff like that.
