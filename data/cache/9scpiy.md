  I shouldn't enjoy anything that pisses Dizzy off so much, but I do.

    Why is she so upset at the end?  I didn't get that part.

      > Nic realised he had made a mistake. He had been wrong to keep himself apart from Simole out of fear his only role of any value or interest might be taken away from him. She would help him if he asked. And she wouldn’t allow him to rely on her.

      Nic got a deeper bond with Simole. He trusts her when he still doesn't trust Dizzy. She sees that. 

      > “He needs you. You can protect him.” Dizzy smiled bitterly. “Must be nice to be born with so much power.”

      She's *not happy* about that, in spite of trying to master her emotions, ice-queen style.

        And she's misinterpreted things by looking at them through her lens. Nic isn't looking to be protected. Just a hand. It'll piss her off even more when she figures it out, that Simole's a few steps ahead.

  For mages, reality is what they make of it. If a mage believes unicorns don't exist and his words enforce that truth, then it doesn't. Until a better mage overrules him.

  >***“Help me?” She laughed, but her throat was dry and the sounds that emerged were broken and half formed. “What can the wizardling do that I cannot? What power do you possess when up is down and down is up?”***

  >***He felt the shift in the world, the power in her words rearranging existence. The guards behind him exclaimed in surprise as they fell upwards towards the ceiling, crashing loudly as though having dropped from a great height.***

  >***Tenner willed himself to refuse the call. He denied what seemed so obviously true. Down was not up, no matter how incontrovertible it seemed. He broke out into a sweat, his entire body aflame under the skin as if from a fever.***

  >***“You fight the truth, child,” she said, perhaps a little impressed. “You struggle well, for a human. But you struggle for nought.”***

  Or you can just argue over the definition of "unicorn".

  Typos:

  > Completing the first year as a Ransom Upperclassman was both not as great an achievement as she thought, and far greater one than he was willing to admit to her.

  and far -> and a far

  >  hundreds of years of old

  years of old -> years old

  > Although judging by the sheer contempt on the Miss Miggets-Hanover’s face, perhaps not.

  on the Miss -> on Miss (unless it's for emphasis)

  > “No,” said Dizzy. “

  Remove the extra “ at the end of the line.
