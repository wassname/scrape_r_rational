  OK, so, this chapter notes!

  We wanted the story to focus on conflict within an established relationship, so we knew we needed a time skip in there somewhere. But so much happens in relationships that you can't really just go "FOUR MONTHS PASSED, THEY ARE NOW REALLY CLOSE" - so we've got a first fight, small generic romance scenes, some frustration, some sacrifices, and we finish it off with a literal pet the dog moment. 

  Some hints at vampire lore: William's hungry and talks about his lungs straining. Our Vampires eat through their lungs - turns out the lungs are a much more direct route to the heart than the stomach is, so it only makes sense. Plus, the digestive system is used for making new vampires. 

  Don't worry - the vampire meeting was important, and there will be consequences!

  Oh and, /u/Atilme : not sure if you still are following the story, but I remember telling you to wait for "peak adorable", and I'm sorry it appeared so much later than promised but I hope if you are still around here, you enjoy it.

    If you hadn't username'd me I probably wouldn't have seen this, so thanks! Now I have to check on all the other fics I haven't been keeping up with... XD

    Will edit once I've read it! Thanks for continuing with it though, it's awesome to read!

    (Feel free to username me in the future as well, it was very nice to come back to this!)

    Edit:

    *squeees intensify*

    It was nice to come back to this and have all of it to catch up on! Dang this is so good! I definitely do enjoy it, thanks for writing and posting it!
