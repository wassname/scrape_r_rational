## [Web Serial] Token

### Post:

Hey everyone!  I've been a silent member of the rationality community for a while.  A few months ago, I started a web serial, and I'm desperate for readers.  The protagonist is rational, but in a low-key way; he doesn't take time to explain principles, and his rationality is not the focus of the story.

Still, the story is set up in a way that *may* be satisfying to rational readers!  There are a lot of background events and lore details to get your brains theorizing.

If you are still not interested after reading the synopsis, you might enjoy an interlude chapter I wrote later in the story, which is in the perspective of an AI gaining sentience.  If that sounds fun, click the 2nd link in this post!

**Synopsis:** Token is a web serial about four friends who find themselves playing through simulated games in real life.  Whether they want to play or not, it is not their choice, and whoever loses a game gets… re-balanced.  Will they conquer this mystery before losing themselves completely?

**Release Rate:** At least 1 chapter per week.

**EDIT1:** As of 9PM EST on Nov 10, I have re-written and updated Arc 1.  Thank you for all of the constructive feedback!  I want to continue to become a better writer!

  The premise (four friends or "friends" forced to play a game of unknown origin with weird rules) is interesting, but it escalates *way* too fast for my tastes, and the first-person perspective locks us out of other viewpoints, making a lot of what the other characters are doing seem arbitrary and pointless. Then, starting in the second "arc", things just start getting too arbitrary and random, not the result of characters interacting with known rules, but characters interacting with *unknown* rules, making the plot harder to predict and sapping a lot of the expected sources of fun for something like this.

    Thanks for reading and giving feedback!  Pacing seems to be an issue.  I'm going to go back and spend some time getting readers better acquainted with the world and the characters.

    The "unknown rules" problem is going to be harder to deal with, because I don't want to reveal too much exposition this early in the story.  Still, I may have to.  Or I could spend more time having the characters explain how they perceive the rules.

    Also, thanks for The Metropolitan Man!  I wasn't aware of your other works, but I'll start reading them soon!

      I think my *expectation* on reading the blurb and getting through the first chapter was that we would:

      1. Be given the rules
      2. Be shown the reaction to those rules
      3. See the characters cleverly accomplish their tasks

      Alternately:

      1. Be given the rules
      2. See the characters balk at the game
      3. See the consequences of not following the game
      4. See the characters start to actually play the game
      5. The story becomes either a character study, or a tragedy about people pressured into losing their other values in the face of survival

      To take one example, I thought that >!Brad not revealing his card was because he immediately saw the game for *being* a game and realized that it would be a tactical advantage to not reveal his goals, and/or his card contained something personally compromising on it. Instead, it was just that the game had told him not to.!< This isn't something that can be inferred from his actions, or from the text that we've been given thus far (especially as regards the game), it's just a "twist" without much punch to it.

      In contrast to this, >!Brad's directive to be productive!< was something that *could* be inferred, since it's noted as being contrary to what Alec expects. The reader can (does) figure this out, which means that there's some satisfaction when it's revealed to be the case. (Maybe not the story that you're going for, but it would be interesting for another player to figure that out and deliberately sabotage >!Brad's attempts at productivity in order to have more points!<.)

      But before we've gotten much in the way of games and meta-games, we're off to the next thing.

        Thank you again.  This was very instructive for what I need to fix.  When I first set up the plot, this is what I anticipated writing (>!four friends playing out the game as it was meant to be played!<).  Arc 1 was always going to  end the way it did (>!for unknown reasons, the game starts trying to kill the protagonists!<), but I arrived at this plot point too soon.  In my on-going re-write, I will spend more time having the friends actually play the game.

  Well I gave it a casual read through 1.6 and, I don't know, the premise seems interesting, but the chapters are really short, and seem like they should be merged. The escalation is abrupt and jarring, some bits are unclear to me, but that just might be the first read through.

  I'll give it a go again in a couple of hours and write out a more detailed review, because the premise really seems interesting, I'm a sucker for that type of story.

  Cool premise, but there were parts where I wasn’t sure what each character was doing. Sometimes you are writing in first person but then refer to the viewpoint character’s name in third person. It made me doubt who the narrator was supposed to be. (Especially when keeping track of who has the most points during the business game.)

  I think that there is a difficult balancing act between explaining rules and jumping into action. My preference is very action heavy, but I think you might need to be more meticulous with your exposition. How did the players move from one tower to another? What did the surroundings look like? And even earlier, how did the players notice that they were in danger in the real world? (Why were they in danger in the real world?)

  I gave a pretty casual/careless read but I think you’d do well with a beta. Ask someone to read a chapter and then summarize it for you. That might give hints about what sections are most clear or hardest to follow.

    Thank you for the feedback!  I'll definitely go back and provide clarity for the type of issues you mentioned.

    As for the perspective shifting from first to third person, could you be referring to the interlude chapters?  The core chapters are written in Alec's first person perspective.  The interludes are written in the third person perspective of other characters.

      >I was crushing it.  The most recent service task had paid out $25,000, putting me miles ahead of the others.  From worst to best, the rankings were Addy with $111,312, Blaine with $140,900, Brad with $142,000, and Alec with $190,950.  Were the others even generating cash flows anymore?

      I found this paragraph really challenging. I got concerned that Alec wasn’t the viewpoint character! It was a silly thing to generate doubt but I admit I was reading in bed before breakfast...
