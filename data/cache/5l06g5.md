  They might appreciate this over at /r/hfy (Humanity, Fuck Yeah!).
  ```

  - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
    ```
    *Seconded.* The only thing I'd change would be to remove the phrase "kick their asses" which broke SoD, and replace with e.g. "save us".  Everything else was great.

    Thanks for suggesting this.  I had no idea /r/hfy even existed.

  Can we get an elevator pitch for this?

    ```
    "Every species in the multiverse has a magic unique to them, lying latent until Awakened. Yesterday was Humanity's turn."
    ```

      ```
      That's a much, much better summary than any I've come up with.  Mind if I steal it?
      ```

    ```
    [A degree of spoilers; attempting to keep to the jist/premise of the piece](#s "Human latent magic presents the second known multiversal existential threat.  The first such threat started a war of eradication that multiversal civilization is currently in the process of losing.  What will the first contact team decide to do?")

    I would enjoy seeing a full story about this I think.

      I too loved this story. But I think most people will be disappointed with a continuation. It won't have the same thrill, the same unknown. It will be a classical "defeat the big bad" story. Which can be very good, but it won't be the _same_.

        That seems like only one way of multiple it could go. It seems like it'd be a little droll if Chooser's prediction was *perfectly* correct, after all.

    These comments are what got me to read it: https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5ie3aw/biweekly_challenge_the_gamer/dbdgloy

  ```
  *Damn*, that was good. I got shivers from reading it. Nice and climactic and inspiring and interesting. Just lovely.

- u/GaBeRockKing:
  ```
  I really enjoyed this, and would gladly read other stories on this setting.
