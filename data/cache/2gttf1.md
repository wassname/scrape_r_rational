## [D][BST] Anyone writing a Rational(ist) novel for NaNoWriMo?

### Post:

I've always wanted to write something but have never made it very far. I'm planning on spending the next month brainstorming and then trying my hand at writing a novel for [NaNoWriMo](http://nanowrimo.org/) in November.

I've only discovered rational and rationalist fiction in the past few weeks, reading HPMoR and parts of Ra, Worm, and Luminosity... I can't imagine wanting to write anything *but* a rationalist novel now. 

Anyone else have any similar aspirations? I was thinking it might be fun and constructive to get a group together for brainstorming purposes and positive reinforcement and the like.

  I'm doing prewriting for NaNo right now, actually. It's going to be a fairly stripped down fantasy story (following Dan Harmon's [story circle](http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit) method). So far, I've got:

  * "Dark" wizards who are only really "dark" in the sense that they give answers to ethical problems in ways that are utilitarian but go against social norms.

  * Battle nuns that get their powers from following an overly rigorous moral code (which has exploitable loopholes).

  * The ability to enter the mental realm and interact with memories, ideas, etc. in physical form (basically, the concept of a [method of loci](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci) taken to the extreme, with magic tossed in).

  And some other stuff. What time I'm not spending on other projects, I'm spending filling up a doc with notes for when NaNo starts, as I've had difficulty in the past with inventing characters out of thin air or changing my mind about how something works at the last moment when I'm writing for speed instead of quality. The opening/prologue chapter was written long ago, and I think I've only just gotten to the point where I know the story that goes with it - you can read that short opening bit [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zdueoKCpOwienqc7qEa6n9XCsoiY7_1MgU589r6Hlq0/edit?usp=sharing).

  Edit: With that said, I think that NaNo is probably not the best time to write rational, since *ideally* that takes research and planning. I'm specifically going with fantasy so that I don't have to look up travel times, dates, names, laws, etc. Historical research is basically right out, unless you're already very familiar with the period, or you're willing to get a lot of things wrong.
  ```

  - u/ciderk:
    ```
    That sounds like a pretty interesting concept!

    I'm thinking about doing a fantasy story that's something like a deconstruction of fantasy dungeon crawling... A group of adventurers that make a living going into dungeons slaughtering 'monsters' and reclaiming stolen treasure until during a raid on a particular dungeon something happens that makes them question the 'Other'-ness of whomever they're killing. Or something like that.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      If this is one of the first things you're writing, I'd highly suggest using Harmon's story circle method above. It's sort of an adaptation of Joseph Campbell's monomyth, but where Campbell was saying "this is the recurrent structure that I see in human myths", Harmon is saying "this is the recurrent structure in myths because it's what works". He's quite explicit about the fact that he's taking advantage of flaws/features of the human brain in order to make pleasing stories. So when you're planning your plot (which I highly suggest that you do), you would go:

      1. A character is in a zone of comfort,
      2. But they want something.
      3. They enter an unfamiliar situation,
      4. Adapt to it,
      5. Get what they wanted,
      6. Pay a heavy price for it,
      7. Then return to their familiar situation,
      8. Having changed.

      And then in your outline, you just make a single line for each of those.

      1. The characters are raiding dungeons for loot,
      2. But they lack for a purpose.
      3. They find out that the Other they've been raiding aren't so different,
      4. Offer to help the Other clear up the misunderstanding,
      5. Get loot/skills from the Other,
      6. Find out that their kingdom is Evil (one of them dies),
      7. They return to the dungeon as it's being raided by the kingdom,
      8. And act in defense of the Other.

      You could flesh that out to 50K words fairly easily, especially as you add in twists and turns (one of the characters betrays the others in exchange for loot, they have long conversations about the differing values systems of the Other, they have long conversations about how the kingdom should act, etc.). This is essentially storytelling on easy mode.
      ```

      - u/ciderk:
        ```
        I really appreciate the effort that you went through to further elucidate the story circle method (which I did read, but forgot to thank you for mentioning it). I'm definitely going to use this a rough outline for my story.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          Fun mode: write characters who are clever enough to see the story structure coming at them and do something about it.
          ```

          - u/alexanderwales:
            ```
            Well, ideally the writing is of a high enough quality that nothing happens explicitly because the plot demands it - everything is so organic that you would never pattern-match it to a story, and even if you did know that you were in a story, it wouldn't change your actions.

            There's also the serious risk that you will end up "[Wrong Genre Savvy](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WronggenreSavvy)".
            ```

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      As a subplot, have them apply rational(ist) optimization principles to their dungeoncrawling.  e.g. Instead of picking the lock on the door, it's faster and safer to tunnel around it with their Wand of Earth Moving -- frivolous example and I'm sure you can do better, but something to start from.
      ```

  - u/TimTravel:
    ```
    You had me at battle nuns.
    ```

- u/nemmonszz:
  ```
  RaNoWriMo, eh? =P
  ```

  - u/MoralRelativity:
    ```
    Yes. Now that you've named it RaNoWriMo is now officially a thing.
    ```

- u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer:
  ```
  Yeah, I'm doing a full rewrite (all original words) of my first ever NaNoWriMo novel-chunk. It was a mess and I know I can do much, much better now. My goal is to hit 50k by the 15th and actually double-NaNo this year, ending with a complete modern fantasy novel rough draft.

  A horrible single-sentence mashup pitch is:

  > Dead Poets Society meets Revolutionary Girl Utena at rational-Hogwarts (as run by Shadowrun Megacorps), set in a modern day, slow-takeoff magical singularity world, with a ('79 novel) The Dead Zone-like-powers Severus Snape-style teacher as the outsider protagonist.

  Wow. That...was both awesome and really stupid written out like that.

  Soooo, I'd be down for a /r/rational NaNo brainstorming group.
  ```

  - u/Iconochasm:
    ```
    You had me at "rational-Hogwarts (as run by Shadowrun Megacorps)".
    ```

  - u/kaj_sotala:
    ```
    A mix of Revolutionary Girl Utena, rational-Hogwarts, _and_ Shadowrun?

    I want to read that when it's done.
    ```

  ```
  I've been spending the past couple months  researching for a rational Super Smash Bros. fic. There's an absolutely ludicrous amount of information I need about all the respective franchises and timelines, but hopefully I'll be set by the time NaNo rolls around.

  Since many things would clash if I tried to just throw it all into the same universe, I'm changing some canonical things as well as inventing a merged timeline.

  I've got the plot mostly laid out, the backstories for 80% of the main cast including Captain Falcon, Samus, Fox, and the character whose POV the story is being told from (a mystery to the reader until they pick up on all the hints or just wait until he says his name).

  I've also been spending time writing random scenes with each of the main cast as the POV character just to get a handle on their personalities and whatnot. Of course, because of the elaborate backstory and all that has happened that isn't canon, some characters will seem to act differently.

  It's a ton of work, but between the extreme hype for Smash 4 and the amazing vastness and depth of the 'verses and characters, it's something I really want to do, and do well. I just hope I can have all of the outlining and prewriting finished before NaNo begins.

    I've never been a big Smash fan, but that story sounds incredible. I'd be interested to see how you manage to work in the characters from different 'genres' (e.g. The scifi-esque characters you mentioned versus chars like Kirby and Pikachu).
    ```

    - u/brandalizing:
      ```
      Most of this is taken care of by the existence of multiple universes - Kirby's warp stars come into play a lot as way of transport between them. Then, of course, Fox and Samus want to integrate Warp Star Drives into their ships.

      Link's time travel will provide most of the focus for the second arc, uncovering more of the mystery of the merged backstory and the underlying plot.

      For PokÃ¨mon, I'm going to try to stay as close to canon as possible. The Pikachu will be under a trainer, but will fight without the trainer's help or commands. I'm thinking of making Jigglypuff the one from the anime, as they already have an established personality. Entertaining as well. Mewtwoâ€¦ooooh, Mewtwo's going to great. I'm probably going off of the anime Mewtwo from PokÃ¨mon 2000, as it gives him a great origin story. He's going to be a very interesting character.

      Man, this is going to be epic.

  *One of us! One of us!*

  Anyway, I had to trawl my posting history to find it, but [I found the last time this topic was made, for reference](http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1ppyqx/is_anyone_doing_a_rationalist_nanowrimo_or_really/).

  I'm torn between writing my [Rational!Mecha](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2fksk7/qdbst_is_there_any_interest_in_a_rationalist/) story (title pending) or *A Most Magnificent Adventure* (WIP), which I attempted last year:

  > [...] The story is about the son of a legendary adventurer and his unlikely friends as they search for his recently vanished father in a world of power crazed (or just plain crazy) blood magicians in dystopian steampunk megacities fortified against a zombie apocalypse that grows stronger, faster and smarter the more it eats while airship merchants and sky pirates do battle overhead.

  Ultimately it turned out way too complicated to get off the ground, as there were too many irregularities/irrationalities in the first act, it's a very bad thing that I haven't really resolved some of those issues. Writing well is *hard*, and it varies directly with the number of characters and the desired complexity of the world, which requires large amounts of research and planning.

  In fact, I'm starting to think that rational fiction is the hardest kind of fiction, because the author must tell a very large number of lies and truths in the same work without them interfering with each other, often in domains in which the author has not earned an Associate's Degree, but you will by the end of it.
  ```

  - u/ciderk:
    ```
    Ah, sorry, I didn't even think to look from a post from previous years about this.

    Your 'airship merchants and sky pirates' story was too complicated to *get off the ground*? That's too bad =) It sounds like a really interesting concept for a story.

    Your reflections on the difficulties of writing this sort of thing are pretty much in line with my apprehensions. It may be foolish for me to attempt this, especially without much writing experience and without  too much grounding in heavy rationality. Oh well, it will certainly be quite the learning experience if i can stick to it.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      Writing rational for NaNo is basically hard-mode. If you don't have much experience writing, I would suggest that you make your primary goal to be finishing NaNo, with a secondary goal of making it rational. If you get to a point where you're getting behind on word count and need to do more research, just plug ahead with the story anyway. Most of the point of NaNo is to *write*, rather than to have a completed book at the end of the month. Writing is like a muscle, and you can build it up by working it - NaNo is basically the best workout that you can do, but it only works if you don't give up. (I would also suggest subbing to /r/nanowrimo, which provides much in the way of positive feedback for your efforts.)
      ```

      - u/ciderk:
        ```
        I appreciate the advice, I think you're right. I think i'll probably do that. Hopefully with enough pre-planning, outlining, brainstorming, and the like, I'll have enough ideas that i'll be able to achieve both goals. But if I have to go back at the end of November to tighten up the rationality in chapter 3, at least I'll have a good foundation and will have flexed my writing muscles for the first time. Either way, this is bound to be quite the adventure!
        ```

    - u/AmeteurOpinions:
      ```
      I wouldn't worry about foolishness -- we're doing this for fun, anyway. I was far too ambitious in writing *A Most Magnificent Adventure* (I had seven main characters). Such a story was beyond the scope of NaNoWriMo, but smaller works are very doable. 

      The best thing you can do is to pick topics which you have fun reading and writing about and use them to structure the story. I have an unfinished [*Legend of Zelda* fanfiction](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1xilpd/bst_rationallegendofzelda/) sitting on my desktop which uses all of Link's various dungeon dives to talk about architecture and archeology juxtaposed against the the unending, unchanging Hylian Dynasty.
      ```

      - u/ciderk:
        ```
        That's great advice, thanks! Also, that sounds like it would be a really fun story to read.
        ```

- u/DataPacRat:
  ```
  I'm probably going to be writing novel-stuff during NaNoWriMo... It's just going to be part of the book I started well before November started, so it doesn't actually qualify for being part of the event. :)

  Good luck to all of you who join in the thing - I look forward to whatever's created by anyone who's a member of this subreddit. :)

  Also, I recommend a followup brainstorming post sometime next month, and frequent-ish update threads in November. I'm really interested in seeing what this community writes, and will probably need a reminder for myself. :)

        Alright, my proposal is to have a stickied "National Novel Writing Month" thread for brainstorming, discussion, etc. Once a day seems like overkill, once per week seems like underkill, so I think maybe once every three days make a new thread? That would be ten posts over the course of the month of November. Maybe with another stickied post the week before.

        > Welcome to Rational Novel Writing Month, a rational take on [National Novel Writing Month](http://nanowrimo.org/). This is your all-purpose thread for posting progress on your novel, brainstorming ideas, solving plot problems, showing excerpts of your work, or whatever else you want to discuss. While you're free to post in any genre you'd like, you'll probably get better feedback if you're following the bullet points in the sidebar, or writing a story that's close to the heart of this subreddit; hard science-fiction, hard fantasy, deconstruction, education, transhumanism, etc. Today is **day X**, and the current word count target to stay on track is **x words**.

        And then plug in the values for day and words (words = day \* 1,666).

        I think this having this in a single, localized place would probably also cut down on some of the clutter in this sub if a decent number of people are doing national novel writing month, and especially if some fraction of them are posting as they go.
        ```

        - u/ciderk:
          ```
          I sent this to /u/PeridexisErrant a few days ago via PM but I like what you wrote much better:

          ---

          **RaNaNoWriMo discussion, {Start Date} to {End Date} - Brainstorming and Planning**
          (we could then think about changing up the title every week to give the thread some added panache, if you wanted)

          This is a weekly thread designed to discuss Rational/Rationalist works of fiction being created for [National Novel Writing Month](http://nanowrimo.org) (NaNoWriMo for short), an annual event challenging people to write a 50,000 word novel during the month of november. All related discussion is welcome here, including brainstorming, progress updates, moral support, requests for feedback, etc.

          (link to prior thread)

          ---

          I like your idea of something like once every 3-5 days to encourage people to continue to post updates and such. Of course I guess a lot of this depends on how many people are definitely planning on participating in discussions here regarding their progress.

          I also sort of thought we might want to start before Nov 1st (maybe one stick for all of October?), in case people wanted to start the discussions regarding brainstorming, outlining, etc. But perhaps we should just keep using this thread until the volume make such a need apparent.

  I want to. I've never actually managed to do NaNoWriMo (November is consistently the month where my projects go to die), and I don't have access to my most convenient writing device (Note to self: never order anything through disability services less than a month in advance).

  Anyway, I want to rewrite [my terrible self-published Marysuetopia Science Fiction novel from 9th grade](http://planetseva.com/) to make some sense, wipe out the idiot balls, and clean up whatever atrocious tech exploits I left open (EX: spacecraft propulsion systems must have mandatory safeguards against being converted into kinetic bombs, space compression is not a perfect solution to everything, and something something transhumanism). I did a rewrite a couple years ago, but it kinda unraveled toward the end (especially when I decided the villain was too smart to monologue, and thus the ending didn't make any sense). The RATIONAL!version I expect to look considerably different, since I want to play with an explicitly rationalist character without removing the flaws from the wannabe rationalist from the original.

  (Though I'd still like feedback on the 2012 version. The RATIONAL!version is effectively a completely different story with some characters/locations in common, but I expect I could gain something from an Aspiring Rationalist's criticism just the same.)

  ```
  My romance/urban fantasy/portal fantasy Nanowrimo wasn't intended as an explicitly rationalist novel at first, but I guess it's shaping up to become one. The characters don't make mistakes because they're stupid, but because of various kinds of emotional and motivational issues. For instance, [in the opening](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tgrEbICCrlCbEoyVxYaBlWTeDkWnzx05lEdpadyY_uk/edit?usp=sharing), the main character misses the fact that a faerie prince is inside her mind because when an unpleasant memory comes to her mind, her first automatic impulse is to push it away:

  > Meri was just about to step inside when the bundle of memory and emotion forced itself into her consciousness. The passerby had reminded her of Mirva, her first girlfriend; and with that came the recollection of Mirva's snide voice when they had broken up. "Well at least *I'm* not fat." 

  > The memory came sheathed in a shell of pain, causing Meri to flinch away from it and not even notice the strange sensation of cold that it was suddenly intertwined with. Instinctively, she called to mind her current boyfriend, who'd gone to lengths to assure her that mild overweight was something that he only liked. *Besides, most of it was muscle these days...*

  > But then a feeling of irritation arose. Why was she letting this topic bother her in the first place? She stepped inside and closed the door behind her, pushing the entire memory firmly out of her mind.

  To be fair, given that she's an ordinary girl in present-day Helsinki, even if she hadn't flinched away, she still wouldn't have generated the hypothesis that the feeling of coldness was a faerie hiding inside her mind. Still, things *would* have gone a lot differently if she hadn't done that.

  (Yeah, that opening was written a while ago. I'm slightly breaking the rules by continuing a previously started work, but I only had a bit of it written and am not including any of it in the 50K total.)

  The story will also touch upon themes of [heroic responsibility](http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/yj2kb/ethical_solipsism_chapter_75/), [Moloch](http://lesswrong.com/lw/kow/moloch_optimisation_and_vs_or_information_and/b7n8), clear communication, and I'm playing around with some fun cognitive science ideas, like the prince's thoughts coming to his mind via [priority queue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue) [scheduling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing\)) rather than the [global neuronal workspace](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Models_of_consciousness#Global_workspace_models) approach that human brains use. I have no idea of whether this will be any good and whether I'll even finish Nanowrimo this year around. Still haven't gotten my today's words written, but did manage to write 2184 words yesterday. (Choice piece of dialogue: "This shouldn't be any worse than your worst nightmare." "I've heard more reassuring descriptions than that.")
