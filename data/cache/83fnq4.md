## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You realize that somehow you were mindcloned around 11 years ago and the mindclone was placed in a baby, who is now somewhere in your country and 11 years old attending a private school. The child underwent infantile amnesia at the usual age, so he or she doesnâ€™t have any of your episodic memory but does have your basic habitual thought habits down and is basically you mentally, if you had been raised by their family. You can detect their emotions and identify the emotions accurately but not read their mind beyond that. What do you do to exploit this?

  Idea not original to me...

  You can form a standing portal between any two doorframes on Earth that are of roughly equivalent size. Doing so requires you to first mark one, then mark the other, which will connect them after roughly two minutes. Attempting to answer some of the inevitable questions:

  * Breaking the doorframes, moving the doors too far relative to the Earth, attempting to drill into the portal from the side of the doorframe, etc. will break the connection, irregularly cutting anything that was between the doors.
  * The portal goes both ways, and from both sides of each doorframe, with orientation decided when the second portal is chosen.
  * Momentum is conserved, but nothing can travel through the doorframe at speed greater than 100kph. Anything moving faster that attempts the transition will be instantly slowed down (though only at the boundary, meaning that a car moving at 200kph and hitting the portal would essentially crash into itself, I think).
  * There is no limit to the number of portals you can create. There is also no limit to the number of marks you can make on doorframes awaiting a link (you can dismiss these marks at will, and cannot link two marked doors without first unmarking one).
  * You cannot link the doorframes if something is in the way (e.g. a door).
  ```

    The obvious one is generation of negentropy. Link two doorframes, one of which is above the other like this:

    (Portal)

    (Air Gap)

    (Portal)

    Put a water wheel in the middle. Then place a liquid of your choice inside - free power.

    One thing I'm curious about - is light slowed down? That probably has a few uses, but I think that means that you'll probably die if you go through (electrical signals in the brain).

    You could use the portals as shields, making an armour out of tiny doorframes. Any projectile that goes in a portal just comes out the other side. It scales up as well.

    Possibly as a defence against certain natural disasters. Example: One portal above an active volcano, another where you don't mind there being ash and lava. Depends on how liberal doorframes are when it comes to shape. On the side of buildings to defend against debris from high winds, along the shores of high flood risk areas - you just need a spot where you don't mind a hazardous dump.

    Disposal of hazardous materials can be done by lowering portals on top of them, and waiting for the centre of gravity to pass through the other side.

    That's all I have for now, but I'm sure there are other uses.

      Slight problem with negentropic generators is that they add more energy to the earth, thereby causing significant global warming if they are used as the main source of power for the planet (especially if more energy-heavy industries like desalination plants are set up to use the cheap energy).
      ```

      - u/Peewee223:
        ```
        I don't see how they would add any more energy to the planet than existing power generation methods do. If anything, the planet should cool back down due to the decrease in greenhouse gas emmissions.
        ```

        - u/Silver_Swift:
          ```
          Technically, if you replace tidal/wind/solar power plants with this you would marginally increase the amount of energy added to the planet (because the tidal energy/wind/sunlight that isn't absorbed by your tidal plant/windmills/solar cells is now heating up whatever it is hitting instead). 

          You're absolute correct for fossil fuel and fission/fusion plants though.

            ~~All power generation eventually turns energy into waste heat; it just delays it a little bit and redistributes the heating. Instead of the wind energy dissipating into heat due to turbulence, it would heat the generator, the power lines, and whatever devices are plugged into the power grid.~~ edit: We agree on this, I misunderstood the argument.

            You could say that solar actually increases the energy captured by the planet, since otherwise a larger portion of the light would bounce back into space.

              True, but when using solar/wind power, you don't convert any _extra_ energy to heat. So in terms of the amount of heat that is added to the planet you either have:

                  energy released by power plants + amount of sunlight hitting the earth

              or

                  energy released by solar plants + amount of sunlight hitting the earth - energy absorbed by solar plants

                ```

      - u/Silver_Swift:
        ```
        The amount of energy added to the earth by the sun is (by definition) equivalent to the power output of a type I Kardashev civilization. According to wikipedia we are currently five-ish orders of magnitude away from that, so even if we add enough portal power plants to replace our current power plants a hundred times over we'd only increase the amount of energy on the planet by 0.1%. 

        Once we're at a point where this becomes an issue we can probably just move our power generation off-planet.

    If objects cannot pass through faster than 100mph, then we have a way to completely destroy energy. I don't know what we could do with that, but it's a thing.

      ```
      This made me realize - these portals are very, very cold. Room temperature air particles move around at an average of ~1000 mph. Forcing air through a portal should be usable as an extremely effective heatsink.

      KE = 1/2 * m * V^2 = 3/2 * k * T

      1/3 * m * V^2 = k * T

      (1/3 * m * V^2 ) / k = T

      so for Nitrogen, 100kph mean particle speed is... [-272.283C (0.873 Kelvin)](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=\(1%2F3+*+\(mass+of+Nitrogen+gas\)+*+\(100kph\)%5E2\)+%2F+boltzmann+constant&rawformassumption=%22UnitClash%22+-%3E+%7B%22boltzmann+constant%22,+%7B%22BoltzmannConstant%22%7D%7D&rawformassumption=%7B%22DPClash%22,+%22ChemicalP%22,+%22mass%22%7D+-%3E+%7B%22MolecularMass%22%7D)

      Ok, so these are pretty useless for transporting things that shouldn't be flash frozen.

      There should also be some weird pressure things going on, but I don't know enough about fluid dynamics to comment on the specifics.
      ```

    - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
      ```
      Eh, it is a portal. We can completely destroy energy even without the 100kph speed restriction: just connect a door on top of the building with a door on the ground floor, and send stuff through it. That stuff loses gravitational potential energy, and we can repeatedly carry it up to the top of the building (investing kinetic energy) and send it through again.
      ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    - Create a fairly small 'door', about the size of my head. Leave one end at home, bring the other end with me, everywhere. Now if I forget my keys (or anything else) I can just get someone to pass it to me.

    - In fact, if the 'home' end is close to a plug, I can have my phone in my pocket while it's charging.

    - If I am feeling larcenous, I can surreptitiously mark a bangle or a ring (preferably a bangle) at a high-end jewellery shop - picking one that's out of sight of any cameras, of course. I can then, at my leisure, remove a substantial fraction of their inventory.

    - Small teleport-doors will also help me take people by surprise with gas-based attacks.

    - By making a 'door' in the neck of a small pouch (which connects to a large pouch of similar neck-size) I effectively have a bag of holding.

    If I enter a door in America and step out of a door in Australia, how badly does the difference in the speed at which the land is moving make me stumble?

    Given the 100kph speed limit, what happens to a laser beam fired through a portal?

    > a car moving at 200kph and hitting the portal would essentially crash into itself

    Disclaimer: I haven't thought about this for more than a minute, but what my physics knowledge would suggest is the following:

    - The car's mechanical state is described by a partial equation (as is usual for these sorts of problems). We have an initial condition (velocity = 200 km/h).

    - As the car impacts the portal, the problem's boundary condition changes (velocity = 100 km/h at the boundary). AFAIK, this change impacts the entire car -- basically, the deformation travels at the speed of sound (which, in cars, is about 6 km/s^1 ). The effects are similar in some regards to what happens if we drive a car into a wall -- it crumples up, which we can observe even outside the portal.

    - What's really fun though is what happens when the car is running at more than 6 km/s (= 21600 km/h). Now the deformation is slower than the car itself. It does not propagate quickly enough, and as a result, we do not see any sign of the impact outside the portal. To our eyes, the car passes through unharmed, though on the other side, it comes out in what I would imagine to be an absurdly deformed state (basically, the difference between a solid and a liquid is academic at those deformation speeds). This will probably also be pretty loud, as the car passes through its own sound barrier. However, the sound will only be heard on the other side of the portal, if at all -- maybe the velocity restriction suppresses the sound.

    I wonder where all of that momentum and kinetic energy ends up...

    You can't link the portals if the door is closed, but can you use them? What happens if you link to the door to the vault in the short time it is open and then try to pass through it at night when it's unguarded? 

    Momentum is conserved, but does that include momentum caused by earth's rotation etc?
    ```

  - u/Peewee223:
    ```
    What happens when force is applied to the interior edge of an active portal?

    Also, can you have a free-standing, dollhouse-sized door frame and lift it from the other side of the portal by reaching through the portal?

    Anyway, I'd fabricate collapsible door frames that fold up into briefcases that I can link back to home base at will. If I need money and the whole free energy thing doesn't pan out, I can sell long distance travel on the cheap, by setting up a hub + spoke network. I can also sell briefcases to rich people, who can use cellphones / sending scrolls / etc. to have me open up a portal to the hub on demand.

  In a 5e campaign I am playing in we are about to hit level 5, we are a group of five which is fighting against a totalitarian dictatorship which holds power thanks to a liberal use of a [Geas](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Geas#h-Geas)-like spell.

  I am about to get access to 3rd level spells as a cleric, most importantly [Sending](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Sending#content).

  How would you suggest to exploit it to the fullest capabilities, assume such limitations :

  - Unreliable consistency, 3rd level spell slots are a limited resource and may be expended for other purposes.
  - RAI interpretation of "words", so no chaining or over-hyphenating  or creating a code which has extremely long words to circumnavigate the 25 words limitation.

  How would you structure an information network in such a context, with these limitations?
  ```

  - u/fortycakes:
    ```
    One information-efficient use of *sending* is to arrange a meeting via *clairvoyance* (also a 3rd-level cleric spell): as long as you can get to within 1 mile of the other party, in a location that's familiar to them (e.g. hired rooms in an inn) then you can use 1 *sending* on your part and 1 *clairvoyance* on their part to transfer 10 minute's worth of information.

    Otherwise, a simple method of compression would be to assign pre-arranged concepts to different words, picking randomly out of a dictionary - e.g. APPLE might be arranged to mean "Your group is discovered."

    Keeping your code-book for translating such signals secret isn't of as paramount importance as it usually would be, since there aren't any (standary) ways to intercept a *sending*; however, the reproduction costs might be prohibitive depending on how expensive your DM thinks books should be.

  How would you munchkin any of the following magic items:

  - A mirror that is a video phone: you can communicate with the person who uses the other mirror in the set (not FTL)

  - An apple tree that produces apples with emeralds where its seeds should be (the limbs and branches don't grow, it just flowers and produces apples; if you try to graft it, the limb you removed is dead and doesn't grow back) 

  - A small vial (test tube sized) that seems to pour water forever without getting empty: but that's only because nobody has tried, there's about 100L of "invisible/hammerspace" water in that vial that regenerates at a rate of 1L a day. It will only pour water if a person is pouring it out, so it can't "spill" (and you can't hook it up to a robot that's programmed to tip out 1L every day to fill your royal moat or anything). 

  The only thing is, you can't use them to prove magic is real and win the randi prize or impress and befriend a world leader or anything like that.

  I think the water could give you perpetual motion, but with 1kg/day you are not looking at much energy compared with say, solar panels.

    > A mirror that is a video phone: you can communicate with the person who uses the other mirror in the set (not FTL)

    Exactly how you would munchkin an actual video phone? 

    Well okay, it is different in that it doesn't use power, but video phones don't really use all that much power either. Instead, let's talk video quality. Normal video phones have like, a few million pixels in terms of resolution, and a limited amount of brightness. Magic mirrors in the literature don't, as far as I know. So one possible way to use this magic mirror would be to place one end as near the sun (or some other blindingly bright light source) as possible, and the other directly over a solar panel. It would be a reliable (clean?) power source as long as the mirror isn't destroyed. 

    But then, the mirror probably isn't that big, so I doubt you would get much power out of it.

    What /u/CreationBlues said. Scam someone by selling the tree to them without telling them that it can't be reproduced.

    Personhood detector. Get someone to try pouring the vial. If it doesn't pour, it isn't a person! This item is awesome! Or it would be, if we lived in a world with shapeshifting hostile non-persons.

    Motion detector. Define "person is pouring it out". What if the person wears gloves? What if the person is using a tool (like a [reach extender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reach_extender)) to grab the vial when pouring it? If sufficient amounts of indirection are allowed, you may be able to use the vial as a motion detector.

    Bomb. What if you stopper the vial but keep "pouring"? What if you put the vial in an airtight container and poured it? Would it just keep on pouring out water, compressing the air in the container further and further, until the entire set-up explodes? 

    Bag of Holding. Can you put things back in the vial's hammerspace?

    Light-weight water container. I'm assuming it is light, because someone would notice if the vial weighed as much as 100 liters of water (~100kgs). This would be somewhat useful for astronauts, since it takes exponentially less fuel to launch a small vial into space than several liters of water.

    Avoiding the [Heat Death of the Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe). Assuming you somehow protected the vial for the trillions of years it would take before that becomes a relevant problem, it would then become the savior of the world, since it creates mass from nothing.

      Thank you for including this caveat.  People on these threads always bring up avoiding the Heat Death of the Universe as if it were some sort of priority, or even possible, which it's not in the case of a prompt where you as a person have the power to create matter, but are not immortal and so will die in a few decades and make little to no impact on long-term entropy.  With the vial it could actually work, but deserves to be last on the list in terms of priorities

    All of thatâ€™s pretty useless, except for, marginally the emerald tree. Itâ€™ll inevitably fall apart at some point, and youâ€™ll get to a point where all of the buds are too damaged to make new apples. Try grafting another apple to it? Try fucking with hormones and chemicals to trick leaf and bud nodes to form branches, since those are the only parts of it that can actually be considered really alive. The rest of the tree is basically a wooden statue. After looking for gem prices, assuming that the gems are the best emeralds anyoneâ€™s ever seen, you can get probably 10-50 thousand for each gem, 10 per Apple, so itâ€™s not worth it to sell it. Become a millionaire and then sell the tree to science.

    Does a full vial weigh 100kg?

    Can you refill it by, say, dunking it underwater?

    How about if you dunk it upside down?

    Does it continue pouring out after you prop it upside down and let go?

    If the answers are no, yes, yes, and yes in that order, you can get perpetual motion from it in 100kg bursts.

    1. drain barrel into upside-down vial (placed intentionally upside down by a person)
    2. lift barrel+vial (via counterweight)
    3. drain vial into barrel
    4. use weight + height of barrel to do work, including lifting the counterweight.

    With enough altitude, this can produce significant energy, though yeah it's probably less useful than more conventional generators.

    Come to think of it, you could also use a similar mechanism to fill a water tower and "smooth out" the power generation.

      Unfortunately, it's no (weighs ~100g), no (you can put the ~100ml the vial holds into the vial, but it doesn't enter hammerspace, which i guess is a one-way valve), N/A, and no. :(

      But I like your style! 

      I deliberately tried to create three magic items that while clearly magic and cool/interesting aren't "let's stop the plot of this story and exploit these items", so with the vial I was going for the great "create water" spell, but in practise it's not much more useful for power generation than a solar panel. 

      The emerald apple tree is interesting but ultimately useless except as a source of money (and relatively slowly: it's a small plant), and the magic mirror is just a videophone (... that could also be used as a solar panel, as per another reply, which is pretty neat!)

        Aw...

        You can electrolyse the 1L of water into 620L of O2 (at STP). That's enough for one person to breathe for a day, with a little left over. I assume that it's easier to filter piss than it is to generate O2 in space, so that might be more useful than using it as a water supply. This will take an average of 150W of DC power generation to keep up. Not *too* bad, but you still have to scrub CO2. Presumably you would just vent the hydrogen into space.
