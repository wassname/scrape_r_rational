## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  I think I have depression. Many of the symptoms I've read about online apply to be, and I've been having something resembling episodes for the past year. I've decided that this isn't a problem that's going away on its own, so I've decided to seek professional help as soon as I can muster the will to do so. At the same time, though, admitting that to myself has improved my mood slightly. I'm still in a crappy state, but I feel more comfortable with it and a bit more confident that I can get better.

    Good luck with that -- it can be quite a difficult road but this step may really help.

    Any time that the problem lies not in the world but in the operation of your own mind, it becomes extremely challenging. But at the same time has the opportunity to be extremely rewarding. How much better would your life be if you had a lot more energy and enthusiasm to apply to things?

    Let me issue a challenge. You say "I've decided to seek professional help as soon as I can muster the will to do so". I challenge you to seek that help (go so far as to schedule an appointment) within the next 5 days (by October 19).

        I don't know.

        I love Worm to bits, but it's absolutely massive in every sense of the word. I can't fathom what the SFX budget would have to look like to truly do justice to fights like Leviathan's or Behemoth's. Not to mention the fact that it's currently longer than all Lord of the Rings and Harry Potters combined.
        ```

    - u/trekie140:
      ```
      The only reservation I have is that Worm wasn't really a superhero story, at least after Leviathan. It was more like a modern dark fantasy, bordering on horror, where the characters just happen to have unique powers and wear masks. It's still good, but it needs a more consistent identity all the way through to avoid disappointing superhero fans the same way it did for me. 

      After Leviathan, the story stopped being something I wanted to read and the superhero trappings made less and less sense given the state of the world. If it had been more clear that I was in for something out of a seinen instead of something like Daredevil or Watchmen, I wouldn't have been put off that it defied basic genre conventions of superhero stories after an AMAZING start.
      ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        Worm is a deconstruction of the genre. Pre-Leviathan was making the point that, on the surface, a world looking like the superhero verses might make sense. Post-Leviathan was throwing all the glaring problems with these verses into harsh light.

        For instance, the biggest problem with superhero verses that they never, ever take a look at in a satisfactory way is collateral damage. You expect me to believe that Galactus is devouring large sections of the world, or that Parallax is eating entire cities, or any of the other extinction-level events in these worlds are happening, and that none of the cities look like warzones? You expect me to believe that, after Superman gets thrown through multiple buildings, there's no evidence in Metropolis that this has happened before, that buildings are damaged?

        Superhero verses have some sort of magical fix-everything-ium. All the destruction and obliteration happening onscreen never has effects on future episodes, like it was just wiped away. In Worm, though, Leviathan shows up and then Brockton Bay never recovers. Which is exactly what we see in the real world when massive natural disasters hit nations unable to absorb the losses.

        In addition, you have the problem of the heroes being too "good" to ever consider killing anyone, from Batman's pathological aversion to using anything resembling a lethal weapon to Superman deliberately pulling punches. *This makes no goddamn sense!* In the real world, the Joker would accidentally fall down the stairs four or five times the second or third time he escaped from Arkham. Hell, he might not even survive Arkham! I take as evidence the case of Anders Breivik, the Norwegian mass murderer who killed over 100 people around 5 years ago. Norwegian prisons are famous worldwide for being really, really nice, and his "cell" is more of a luxury apartment by comparison to prisons most everywhere else. He's attempting to sue, though, because they won't let him leave that cell for any reason. Why? Because all of the other prisoners in the facility have sworn that they will kill him on sight. These are patriotic Norwegians, a nation with the lowest recidivism rates in the developed world, and one of the lowest overall crime rates, and they are vowing to murder the guy.

        That's the prisoners. That says nothing about someone who might actually be able to get away with killing him in a "tragic accident." And that is what would happen to the Joker in reality.

        So. Worm turns that on its head and gives us Jack Slash. Crazy, obsessed with knives, no obviously busted superpowers other than charisma, *and makes a point of not getting caught because he knows that he will die if he does.* Marvel and DC have this thing about how killing is always a bad idea and about constantly bringing back characters who should have kicked it already. Worm neatly sidesteps that problem.

        Leviathan is the wake-up call. It's saying "Hey, you know all those tropes of a superhero verse? They make no sense, and here's why." It replaces those tropes with grim reality, a world where the heroes must kill on occasion, a world where most of the villains just dropped into villainy accidentally. A world where bureaucratic efficiency overtakes the common good, where the heroes are often wrong and the villains...not right, but not wrong either.

        A world much like our own, in some respects.
        ```

        - u/trekie140:
          ```
          That's the problem, though. Worm feels like a superhero story written by someone who doesn't like the genre. People like me who are fans of it understand that some of the tropes can be dumb, but we get past that because we enjoy the core of the stories. We're still happy to see more realistic takes on the genre, at this point we're demanding it, but if that core is changed then we won't enjoy the story.

          The reason why Watchmen was a fantastic deconstruction was because it stayed true to the central theme of superheroes while turning every other trope on its head. It wasn't beloved because it was realistic, in many ways it was as goofy as ever, but because it gave people new insight into stories they loved. Madoka Magika, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and HPMOR succeeded for the same reasons.

          A lot of people like Worm, and that's fine, there's a lot to like about it and I like a lot of it too. But it's a story that defies the themes superheroes are built around. It creates a world that resembles a superhero verse on the surface but lacks any of the same substance. It should carve out an identity for itself separate from the superhero genre so it can be appreciated for what it is instead of what it isn't.
          ```

            What? There are plenty of superhero stories around by people who don't like superheros, and they don't look anything like Worm. If this was actually the case the author would have pruned off the superhero parts and ended up with urban fantasy or something similar. That's what a lot of urban fantasy and science fiction is. Superhero stories by people who don't like superheros.

            Worm is about finding logical in universe reasons to explain all the things that happen in regular superhero stories but don't actually make sense.
            Heroes have got to fight when they first meet 'cause (out of universe) the comic book reader wants to see that? Okay, have a shard driven urge to conflict to explain that. 

            Reed Richards is useless (no science hero bothers to use their amazing tech for anything but superheroing)? Okay, have a Simurgh specifically hunting for any Reed Richards' that are about to make good, plus various tinker power restrictions. 

            Villains don't get killed off permanantly and prison is a revolving door? Okay, have regular Endbringer fights which necessitate preserving every superpower in the hopes that it might someday allow for a combo to save the day or the world, and hence a system designed to keep villains busy but not dead. 

            Does it seem rather odd that almost everyone decides to put on a costume and either declare themselves a hero or villain? Have a not particularly covert government propaganda and PR program to narrow down the decision space that people think in when they consider they should do with new powers, which is devoted to finding something not *too* damaging for all these conflict seeking semi-psychotic people with superpowers (both heroes and villains) to do to keep themselves busy yet alive for the Endbringers. 

            Etc.

  Weekly update on my rational pokemon game, which for now is work on the data creation tool Bill's PC ([previous threads here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EUSMDHdRdbvQJii5uoSezbjtvJpxdF6Da8zqvuW42bg/edit?usp=sharing)):


  ----


  The initial setup for the Move tab is all but complete.  A handful of things remain to add to the GUI, and then it’s just a matter of hooking it up properly.  I said I was going to do that part this week, but due to needing to redesign so much of the move properties it just wasn’t ever in a solid enough state for me to formally complete it.


  ----


  This is mostly due to the creation of what I call the Aspect system.  Previously I expressed the desire to divide moves into Moves and “techniques”, and the Aspect system is the culmination of this idea.  Aspects can be thought of as sub-types: different schools of application of the usage of a particular type.  


  For example, Psychic is divided into Telekinesis, Teleportation, Telepathy, Focus, and Shielding.  The three Ts are self-explanatory, while Shielding is things like Barrier and Focus is the use of psychic energy blasts. Each Aspect will have its own EV which is trained by using moves of that Aspect.  So, to train Focus I can spam Confusion over and over.


  But what’s the point?  Well, through use of this system I hope to make defining move lists a thing of the past.  A move like Psybeam might be designated thusly: 


  >Psybeam: Requires Brain.  Requires INT > 100 AND SPATK > 60.  Requires Psychic Typing >10%. Requires Focus > 200


  So to learn Psybeam, a pokemon has to meet all of the above requirements, and it can then be taught the move.  This can either be done by Move Tutor, TM, or by telling your pokemon to “Experiment”, a mode of training that has a % chance of learning a new move based on what moves the pokemon has witnessed and their eligibility.  A new Kadabra that has never heard of Psybeam might not ever discover it through Experimentation, but one that has seen Psybeam used dozens of times by friends or foes has a good chance of figuring it out!


  Some moves can be approached by multiple types.  Thunder Punch, for instance, would look something like this:

  > Thunder Punch: Requires Arm OR Grasp tag. Requires ATK >80 AND SPATK > 40. Requires Martial > 50. Requires Chi + Discharge > 400.


  So a pokemon could learn this move either by training the fighting Chi Aspect to 400, or the electric Discharge Aspect to 400, or by mixing some of each if it can.  Some type combinations are common enough to have their own dual-type Aspect, such as Mud being Rock/Water or Terrakinesis being Rock/Psychic, with their own tech tree to match.


  This system is very exciting to me, as it will force move sets to be *systematic* in a way that canon pokemon is not.  Access to a move is going to be based on meeting the raw requirements and not something as arbitrary as species.  This is going to result in a lot of emergent gameplay that will no doubt result in surprises for veterans of the series. It will also remove the burden of the designer needing to manually add each move to each pokemon, which is important considering that I plan for there to be many more available moves than in canon.


  [The Aspects in their current form can be viewed here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YfTAk95UdTEtOVFmMl42spmsg3Trn2TRsnqNkFj721c/edit?usp=sharing).


  ----


  While working on these systems this week, I came to the conclusion that I am starting to get diminishing returns on prototypeless design.  So, I will be spending this next week cleaning up Bill’s PC, scrubbing up the documentation, and otherwise getting it into a solid state for the future--as by this time next week I will have begun setting up the game itself.  Bill’s PC is not complete, but for now it grants us enough capabilities to be able to start working on some bare-metal coding.

  Feel free to leave any comments or questions below! Also feel free to join us [on the #pokengineering channel of the /r/rational Discord server](https://discord.gg/sM99CF3) for brainstorming and discussion.  It’s a great group, really, and I would highly recommend hanging out, even if you’re not in it for this project itself.  There’s tabletop groups, Dota 2 partying, and [puns](http://i.imgur.com/j3jRmMZ.png) like you wouldn’t [believe](http://i.imgur.com/8cUkzoGl.jpg).  Come join us!

    Quick question: how close are you to making a prototype of this game? From the little I've seen, I feel like you're defining way more rules, mechanics and other gameplay elements than you should before having a playable version. You should have a prototype super early so you can test if the general mechanics are enjoyable and nothing in your system is broken. There are a lot of things that can look good on paper and go super wrong once people start playing your game, and you do *not* want to find them after you've already spent hours building a system that depends on them.

    On the other hand, I'm following this from afar, so I might be completely wrong, and I have no idea how much experience you have in game design.
    ```

    - u/ketura:
      ```
      Well I aim to start on that this week. I have made games before, but you're right that it's a lot of front-loaded design work. Part of that is because it's horribly complex, but part too is because I don't want to have to throw work out because systems turn out to not be compatible with one another. There's a lot of moving parts, and many problems can be avoided by thinking through the issue thoroughly. This process has also forced me to clearly define what this game *is* and *isn't* about. Having those sorts of limits are important rather than just throwing code together and hoping it all works. 

      Tarn Adams defined a list of things that he wanted in Dwarf Fortress, like, ten years ago *and he's still working on that same list*.  Granted, I have no hope of being so dedicated or consistent, but there *is* virtue in thinking it all out ahead of time so as to build each system with the whole in mind. 

      But to *actually* answer your question, the two things I will start with are the hex grid/ movement and Pokémon generation. I aim to have map reading/writing and movement working by the new year,  and a rudimentary Pokémon gladitorial simulator working by around the same time. The grid will allow me to start testing what speed,  initiative, and movement mean in this game, while the gladiator combat will aid in defining how Pokémon are generated and allow the community to help start balancing individual Pokémon and move stats.

  - u/Timewinders:
    ```
    Your posts have been really interesting so far. I can't help but wonder if you're making the already complex mechanics of pokemon, with its hundreds of interacting ability and move effects, a little too complex. It'd certainly be fun to play, but is it practical to develop?
    ```

    - u/ketura:
      ```
      That's what I'm here to find out!

      Although it is very complex, I try to avoid complexity for complexity's sake. Whenever I add a mechanic or a system, it's either to permit deeper and more interesting decisions, or in some cases even just to make it easier to develop. The anatomy, affinity, and aspect systems all appear to add an incredible amount of complexity, but they also alleviate a certain amount of workload themselves by removing the need to, say, manually define move lists. Time will tell if this turns out to be an efficient trade.

      Another design rule that I'm always keeping in mind, (but that doesn't always show through in these posts) is the concept of an *unfolding design*. The idea is to build systems in such a way that *scale*, that work as a whole if I put 10 hours of work into it or 100. This is mostly a matter of scope on the macro scale: first I aim for a game that lets you walk around a map that's generated from a template. Then I build a game that's the same thing but generates Pokémon for you to look at. Then I do the same thing but a game that has those Pokémon interact with you and lets you fight them. Then a game that also lets you catch and tame them. 

      And so on and so forth: by focusing on keeping each iteration self-contained and as complete as possible as a game, it keeps the idea of fun-ness and usability as central as possible. This concept has also been referred to as building in 'stripes' or 'layers', and hopefully it keeps everything grounded, no leaving big holes in the game with the hope that "it'll be fun once I fill it in later". 

      I still might end up way over my head with nothing to show for it,  who knows. But I *think* I can manage it; the burden of complexity is mostly in balancing the Pokémon data and not the systems that read that data,  and I like to think I have a knack for that. We'll see, though; I'm as interested to see if it will work as you are! The point is to gain experience with this level of detail,  after all, win or lose.

  ---

  *[Europa Universalis IV](http://www.reddit.com/r/eu4)* is a "grand strategy" game, in which the player controls a country between 1444 and 1821. It's been derided by some people as "mindless map painting", as it's rather abstracted--especially in comparison to its predecessor. The goal of [the MEIOU & Taxes user modification for EU4](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=234109254)\* is to replace abstraction with properly realistic (rational?) simulation. For example:  
  \- In vanilla EU4, the player can click a button and spend abstracted "monarch points" to gain abstracted "development points" in a province. In M&T, this button is removed; instead, each point of development represents ten thousand people (with exhaustively-researched numbers at the start of the game in the year 1356), and the population of a province gradually rises or falls depending on the circumstances (war, famine, terrain, crops, etc.).  
  \- In vanilla EU4, if a player sends a missionary to a province, the province typically will be converted from its original religion to the state religion in at most 100 months, if it can be converted at all. In M&T, only ten percent of a province's population (divided into twenty-one separate pieces, of which each can have its own religion) can be converted by a single missionary, and decades may pass before the majority religion of a heathen province becomes the state religion.  

  The release of MEIOU & Taxes 2.0, which will bring the accuracy of the simulation to [even greater heights](http://np.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/42atyf) (e.g., large cities will import food from agricultural provinces, will produce special urban goods, and will have large influence on trade), [is drawing ever closer...](http://i.imgur.com/tDG8Li4.png)

  \*The Steam Workshop version is the most convenient link for me to place here. The vast majority of discussion takes place on [the Paradox forums](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?forums/839)--but it's accessible only to people who have registered EU4 there.

      Rather, you start as Kebab to make sure you can play for the first little while without dying horribly.

    EY should avoid politics, he makes no sense. He admits Clinton is hawkish against Russia, and supports a no fly zone in Syria, which the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs says would be impossible without declaring war on Russia.

    Then claims 'Maybe you heard that Trump said maybe we shouldn't defend NATO countries if Russia invades' and that is somehow worse? Despite the fact **Trump didn't say that** how is demanding allies hold up their agreements in the case of war with Russia a bigger risk of nuclear war than provoking that war?

    The comments on that are hilarious as well. In response to:
    >So by your comment, Trump did NOT say it [...] I loathe Trump. But I loathe misquotes in order to persuade people to one's own views, even more.

    .

    >What sources are you reading, other than the two I linked? I'm finding lots of relevant experts paraphrasing his comments as "maybe".

    'Relevant experts' ie. media partisans who are no doubt more knowledgable than mere Joint Chiefs. Imagine someone argued to EY he was obviously wrong about some AI topic because he didn't understand the difference between levels a and b of the subject, and all these phd's who have decades of experience obviously know better.

    Then imaging those experts experience was the AI equivalent of voting for the Iraq war.

    In the first post, why would he assume that both players would seem reasonable to him? It is not unlikely that discussions taking place above one's expertise might seem to be based on contentions which fly in the face of what is commonly understood or intuited or which might be based on information which is quite obscure to non-professionals.
    ```

    - u/zarraha:
      ```
      As soon as you're aware of that then unreasonable arguments are suddenly reasonable.  There are plenty of things that are weird and unintuitive, such as Relativity and Quantum mechanics, that we nevertheless know are correct.  Two people arguing about different models of Quantum Mechanics are going to both sound completely ridiculous to someone who only understands Newtonian physics, but if you recognize them both as experts then you lower your standards for understanding and so when they make analogies and give simplified explanations you decide that those sound reasonable, although still less reasonable than Newtonian physics that you understand.
      ```

      - u/PL_TOC:
        ```
        Right, but this just incentivizes people to favor simplistic analogies more likely to misrepresent complex issues, fueling the exact scenario of viewing one player as someone who may not seem quite reasonable. Examples are myriad with pop culture academics. 

        I disagree with your first statement. It is a matter of attempting to discern the reasonable from the more easily digestible when the audience lacks awareness of what is correct. 

        I don't see how listening to purported experts with differing opinions would cause me to lower my requirements for believing the arguments a particular person is putting forth. For the sake of the problem it's not helpful to assume outside verification of expertise, when for example you reach the cutting edge of knowledge in certain types problems.

  So I'm working on a generic boxel engine in python (think dwarf-fortress or minecraft). The original is by far the most popular project I've ever put on github ([pycraft](https://github.com/traverseda/pyCraft)), and I'm doing a complete rewrite.

  I'm using python's new async features, which I hope will make the whole thing a lot more practical then normal python game engine stuff. So far this has led to the immediate improvement of being able to run a python terminal alongside the render loop, although it still freezes if you tell the terminal to sleep for too long. I'll see about getting it working multi-process.

      You can think of voxels as a PNG image, and boxels as a tile-engine.

      But for the most part, you can probably use boxel and voxel interchangeably.

      EDIT: better example engine.

        Oh I get what you're saying. So a voxel is the data structure behind the scenes, and a boxel is a cute way of referring to the polygons representing it, Minecraft style.

          Yeah, I edited it a bit to make it clearer, (after  it became clear that no one online had answered the question) but you can think of voxels as a PNG image, and boxels as a tile-engine.

  I've been following *Star Wars Rebels*, which is currently in the middle of its third season, which introduces Grand Admiral Thrawn, probably the most popular character from *Legends* books.

  While Thrawn is way more menacing than usual *Rebels* villains, I feel he's still a downgrade from trilogy!Thrawn. The awesomeness of the original Thrawn wasn't that he looked very smart. It was that his plans *were* smart, and made obvious sense. Every single important decision he made was visibly optimized to increase his chances to win. Whereas one of his major decisions in the last *Rebels* episode to date (let his enemies go after they blew up their own base, ostensibly as part of some greater plan) visibly decreased them.

  The show got most of his personality right, though I'm a bit ticked off at the parts where he personally uses physical violence (he needs a Noghri bodyguard); the studying art is there, the way he captures Hera is well done, and the show seems to imply he ran drills to train the stormtroopers to navigate the local environment. But what I feel is the core of Thrawn, the uncompromising search for victory? Isn't there.

  Trilogy!Thrawn wouldn't have let the rebels escape. He would have either executed Ezra or kept him securely locked up in his ship, and shot down the Phantom as soon as the hostage exchange was over. There was no gain in letting them go. The intelligence he did get about Twi'lek mentality was not worth letting two Rebel leaders and two jedi go, especially since he could have had both. And while it was shown that letting them go was somehow part of his plan, I'm pretty sure that whatever this plan will turn out to be, it will work worse than it would have if he'd just killed them when he could.

  Also, as much as Thrawn himself is well done and mostly faithful to the Heir trilogy, I wish Disney hadn't gone for the easy route of making him look smart by surrounding him with stupid/slow underlings. Book!Thrawn was almost always surrounded and opposed by smart, or at least competent people, which made his genius all the more apparent when he outsmarted them. Pellaeon in particular was a key part of Thrawn's character: he was both fairly dull and unimaginative, and very competent, aware of his limitations, and perfectly capable of understanding subtext, following Thrawn's reasoning and coming up with his own insights. Governor Price and agent Kallus could have that role, but neither of them has the military position that would justify following him around and serving as his foil. And Admiral Konstantine and Captain Slavin are very poor foils.﻿

  **New Demiurge seeks suggestions**

  "Sorry for interrupting; I mean you no harm, and I need to ask your advice on something. 

  "In terms you might be familiar with, I found a glitch in reality, bootstrapped myself to having root authority over the universe, fixed the glitch, and discovered that there are entities out there that want to do the equivalent of using our universe as a CPU to send nine-dimensional spam. To keep that from happening, I have to turn myself into something pretty in-human. I'm not giving any other people access to outside-the-universe, but I don't want to lose the things about the universe I value, so I'm keeping part of my human mind around and am asking everyone for advice about what to do with the universe. Yes, I mean *everyone*. 

  "No, aliens don't exist in-universe, it's just Earthly humans. If souls exist, I don't have access to them. I can't bring back the dead in the sense you mean - you can think of me as being able to rearrange matter and energy. I can do some magic tricks if you want proof, as long as they don't bother anyone else. Right now, nobody is in any physical pain, and anyone who asks for a change to their body gets it. I'm trying to work out protocols for people who may not be considered competent to make decisions for themselves. And I'm trying to work out protocols for when people disagree about anything else I should do. I'm not saying I'm going to follow your advice, but I *am* going to listen to you and carefully consider it. 

  "So: what do *you* think I should do?"

    Outsource parts of the problem to us. You have a lot of power, but not necessary the mental capacity to handle it. You even say that you need to change your mind/body to handle the problems. So break down whatever you have to deal with into chunks and whichever chunks you think is safe for us to help out with, send it to us with some rewards as incentive.

    Preferably after you alter our world into one without any death or meaningless suffering as a post-scarcity society that is.
