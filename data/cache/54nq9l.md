  It's not even RT, tagging it as RSTish is a stretch of imagination.
  The story is plot railroaded, antagonists are always flanderized and juggle idiot balls, protagonist solve things mostly by convenient capabilities of its own powers and an intuition that heavily relies on author knowledge of canon plot.

  It's very hard to find a character that's not an NPC all the time and rarely they do things off scene that matter.

  I've read it up to chapter 14 and while it was interesting initially it quickly became the kind of wish fulfillment fixfic that gives fanfic a bad name.

    Ahh, I misunderstood what rationalist fiction is.  Scrolled down too far on the sidebar, so couldn't find the definition.  Thought it was only:

    > The story shows rationalist techniques, which can be applied by readers.

    My mistake.

  I'm by no means an expert in rational fiction--and I guess it could be considered [internally consistent](#s ", since Danny's success probably isn't much more outlandish than that of Jack Slash, whom he emulates so closely")--but, to me at least, the protagonist of this story felt too much like a Gary Stu. I stopped reading after [Chapter 19](#s ", in which Taylor gets super-OP mind-reading and memory-digging powers, despite canon's several mentions of how that's impossible").
