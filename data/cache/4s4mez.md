  Presented for your listening pleasure, the second (sort of) episode of the Rationally Writing podcast. After feedback from /u/AmeteurOpinions on the request for an episode detailing the history of the genre, /u/alexanderwales and I decided if we're ever going to do it, the sooner the better. 

  It's a bit on the shorter side than most episodes will be, and will probably be just repeating what most people here already know, but hopefully we were able to make it interesting anyway :)  All feedback welcome!

  We're not doing transcripts, but here's the timeline we went off of in the show:

  * Mar, 2009: Yudkowsky [posts on LessWrong](http://lesswrong.com/lw/3m/rationalist_fiction/) about Rationalist Fiction, naming *Null-A* and *David's Sling*.
  * Mar, 2010: Yudkowsky posts first chapters of *[Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality](http://hpmor.com/)*, originally under (fairly obvious) pseudonym.
  * Nov, 2010: Alicorn posts first chapters of *[Luminosity](http://luminous.elcenia.com/)*, a HPMOR-like reimagining of Twilight.
  * Nov, 2012: Iceman posts *[Friendship is Optimal](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal)* to fimfiction.net
  * May, 2013: Velorian posts *[Lighting Up the Dark](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9311012/1/Lighting-Up-the-Dark)*
  * Sep, 2013: I post *[Branches on the Tree of Time](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time)* to ff.net.
  * Oct, 2013: DaystarEld posts *[Pokemon: Origin of Species](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/1/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species)* to ff.net. Yudkowsky recommends *[Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/category/stories-arcs-1-10/arc-1-gestation/1-01/)* in an author's note, which pretty much everyone reads.
  * Dec, 2013: Following [some discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1rkkam/in_light_of_the_recent_slew_of_recommendations/) on /r/HPMOR (and a dry period for that fic), /r/rational is created. *Branches* is one of the first stories posted there, as is *[The Last Christmas](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9915682/1/The-Last-Christmas)*.
  * May, 2014: I post *[A Bluer Shade of White](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10327510/1/A-Bluer-Shade-of-White)* (originally written in response to a prompt). Later in the month, I post the first chapter of *[Metropolitan Man](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man)* (which finishes at slightly less than a chapter a week in June).

  There are a bunch of stories we didn't talk about, and the above list doesn't include all of those mentioned in the podcast, but I generally stand by this history.

  I liked it! I didn't know the exact timeline for a lot of this stuff, so it kept me interested.
