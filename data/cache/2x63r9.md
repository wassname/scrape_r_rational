## Rational Fiction Panel at an Anime Convetion

### Post:

What should a rational + rationalist fiction panel consist of? What's are the key points to get across? Has anyone else had a similar idea?  
I havn't thought to much about this or done too much research so its really rough. I figured, between the short into and conclusion the time would be split into two parts. The first part would be an explanation of the troupes that are embraced and avoided by the genre, and the second part would be giving examples.  
Still a very rough idea, but I'll take any opinions people can offer.

  I think another important part is that "rational != unemotional", that rationality is supposed to make the story _more_ awesome, not less.

  I think the real question is: *which* anime con?  Because if it's the right one, I will personally help you run this panel.  HUE HUE HUE HUE HUE.

  I would put the emphasis on rational*ist* fiction. I don't think you want to show up at a panel and tell people you're into this niche genre about characters who don't hold idiot balls and aren't made of evil at the atomic level who live in a world with consistent rules (well, maybe all that is more radical for anime). The rationalist bullet points on the sidebar are much more distinctive.

  Maybe some emphasis should be on how intelligence can and should be really portrayed in fiction. E.g. less "aha I saw that all coming cuz I read the script" and more, well, Professor Quirrell. And on how shaking up the readers/watchers in ways that are logical rather than retarded can make a work of fiction feel distinct and fresh.

    That's actually still pretty radical, for *most* genre fiction.  And for most literary fiction, for that matter, which seems to enjoy taking unrealistic psychologies to extremes in order to Make a Point About Society.

      Which is really quite a shame â€“ because it really *should* be the basic rules of writing (as /u/writingathing has been eager to remind us many times).

    Why should I not want to do this?

      ```
      Because these are tropes of good writing in general, even if they're often violated. You risk being boring and condescending.
      ```
