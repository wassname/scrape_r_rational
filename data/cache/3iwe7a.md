## [Q] That New World Smell

### Post:

Ten years ago, the Old Gods were in a bit of a pinch, on a losing end of a war that threatened to end all of their up to then presumably eternal lives. They needed a planet full of warriors, driven enough to beat back their enemies and clever enough to use the gifts of their Gods, and so one of their own birthed a planet and people whose very souls were made of magic and could utilize it like none other before. Six months in, the war was won, and the Gods were left with a magical warrior race billions strong, whose very will shaped a full history of their existence, and reality yielded to them. 

Nine and a half years later, coincidentally on this very planet, the population is celebrating the ten year anniversary of first contact, drafted into a cosmic war and beating up the bad guys, go team! Except while everyone else is busy learning new secrets of magic from their alien buddies, doing good for common humanity and shit, there exist a sect of those who study the strange art of Antimagic, and they found something.

By measuring the background radiation of the planet against a meteorite that fell to earth someone was trying to use a megaspell to unite humanity or something, they found that the planet is far, far younger than the billions of years it should be. But if they go public, their evidence could become inert by the nature of the magical community denying it, thus making it so, or the planet itself could collapse out of sheer panic. There do exist forces who wouldn't mind if the Earth just disappeared now that the great cosmic war is over, but that's not relevant information to the hypothetical right now.

* Does the setting and science involved pass the sniff test for reasonable discussion?

* How would you test the theory that the world is ten years old if all of your objective evidence could be made irrelevant by bringing it to the attention of everyone, they already being skeptical of you being a spooky scary scientist who wants to take the magic away?

* In such a system where Magic exists as Motivation, Influence, and Preconceptions of a global society, how do you break it for vast power and personal gain, because this is the thing we do around here, isn't it?

  Other possible theories.

  1. Some magical effect altered the isotope ratios.

  2. The theory is wrong.

  3. Some force other than the gods magic'd up the planet.

  The gods could support various theories. They could say that, perhaps, people's expectations that rocks were constant made it so. They could say, yes, it appears you are fake, what a shock, who did this to us? They could say "We did this, you were violent psycopaths from another world, we did this to give you a fresh start." They could do all of those.

  How do you break it? Seize on pre-existing pressures. Are people in loveless relationships that should be annulled as false? Are some people in unfair contracts that were signed before this? You hire celebrities to promote this message.

  "You only live once, don't let it go to waste! You didn't exist ten years ago, anything that happened before that doesn't matter."

  You sell it as personal freedom.

  Why would the earth's age cause a panic? 

  Are you experiencing anything unusual in connection to this project?
