## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  ```
  [Superworld](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/44658/superworld) is about a two bit fortune teller lying and cheating the world into believing he has the supernatural power to see the future, the twist being that he's living in a world where every single human has some supernatural power -- except him. Out of desperation to hide his aberration from a society built around superpowers he creates his scam just trying to live a normal life. Shockingly, shenanigans ensue and he becomes a pawn in a game much bigger than he can imagine. 

  For a long time I've wanted to read a story about lies and paranoia, and this absolutely delivers, while also providing some fantastic mystery writing, and surprisingly good dialogue and characters. Really excited to see how this continues, thankfully it seems to update very often.

    Ooh I'm a fan of "Muggle in a world of wizards" plots - codex Alera, cradle, etc. They tend to go one of a few ways, e.g. 1) super powered late bloomer 2) anti magic 3) batman prep, and #3 is def my favorite (esp coupled with being like a con artist/ guile hero), so this sounds right up my alley haha

        Sure, few from off the top of my head. *YUGE* SPOILERS AHEAD:

        >!Codex Alera: Starts Type 3, becomes Type 1 later!<

        >!Cradle: Type 1, some cross-over into Type 2 late in the series.!<

        >!My Hero Academy: Type 1. Feels like it'd be #3 at the start, but that honestly completely disappears!<

        >!Talentless Nana: Type 3, with a great initial fake-out protagonist who's Type 2!<

        >!Black Clover: Type 2!<

        >!Familiar of Zero: Type 1!<

        >!Shin Sekai Yori/ From the New World: Type 3 for the main antagonist with crossover with Type 1 (it's complicated)!<

        EDIT- found tons of examples on this page. Reading the descriptions can give you an idea of which categories apply to which characters/ works

        A Certain Magical Index counts, I think. The protag's sole esper ability is that one of his hands cancels other ESP effects. This is in a setting where psychokinesis, clairvoyance, and electromagnetic control are all valid powers.

      There haven't been any clairvoyants before, so he claims his visions aren't very precise.  However the main character makes it a point that the charade will fall apart under scrutiny, so he tries to avoid that as much as he can.

    On the paranoia  (what's real and what's really real) and conspiracy theory front I can maybe recommend [The Illuminatus! Trilogy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57913.The_Illuminatus_Trilogy?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=iYMiGT86xX&rank=1). It's pretty weird though and at times hard to read (there is also a high amount of drugs, sex, drugs and more drugs).  There are some boring and slow sections, but the highs (pun intended) make up for them. I mostly have no idea how/if to recommend this and whether I even like it or not, but it is an experience.

  Not at all rational, but I was recently watching old Hindi(Indian) movies from my childhood, and particularly enjoyed Aankhen ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aankhen\_(2002\_film)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aankhen_(2002_film))). It's about a heist executed by a trio of blind men.  


  This movie was interesting in that it went the opposite direction of most heist films - instead of making the heist bizarre and outlandish, it generated tension from the protagonists' learning to execute the simple actions such as being able to walk around various structures in the bank.

  Invisible Sun, the third book in the Empire Games trilogy by Charles Stross was published recently. I thought it spent a little too much time recapping things that happened in previous novels, but I thought it was a good conclusion to the series that closed off the major plotlines and did move on to lots of new plot after the recap. It also had some well written conflict involving >!an advanced civilization and interdimensional warfare.!<   Empire games is a sequel to the Merchant Princes series, which I recommend reading first with the omnibus editions.

  ```
  Any books, fiction or nonfiction, that fundamentally changed your perspective on something? Looking for something profound I guess
  ```

  - u/viewlesspath:
    ```
    [Eating Animals](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6604712-eating-animals) completely changed my perspective on vegetarianism 10+ years ago. Unfortunately it wasn't enough to actually make me a vegetarian, only a self-aware hypocrite. ^I^do^eat^less^meat^though.

    [Demian by Herman Hesse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demian) was the book that woke me up to the value of literature as a teenager. It was an intensely intimate experience to the point that I can't even evaluate its value accurately and so can't really recommend it someone else, so keep that in mind. For me it changed how I viewed and consumed fiction, and it disposed me to occasionally reading novels that were out of my comfort/interest range, where a book's value had to be greater than "am I continually entertained?". The mental equivalent of increasing the weights when working out, perhaps. So while I don't necessarily recommend Demian, I do recommend finding an inroad to literary fiction that is palatable to you as an individual.

    [Das Kapital by Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital,_Volume_I). Whatever your beliefs, this book is one of several that is essential reading for anyone who wishes to (begin to) understand how our world works and why it works that way. As with many "foundational books", its utility rests not on whether its arguments are strictly true or false, but on the fact that so many people lived and died believing its ideas to be true(or false), and the effect this has on our current reality. That said, the biggest reason to read this book is that it's really fucking embarrassing to be one of those people who argue so confidently for/against socialism/communism and have only read The Communist Manifesto(if that), which is a pamphlet written to incite illiterate peasants in the 1800's. Don't be that person.

    Scott Adams' [God's Debris](https://web.archive.org/web/20130121195252/http://www.andrewsmcmeel.com/godsdebris/) formed my current ideas on the idea of Free Will, though notably because I disagreed with his arguments.

    [Hell is the Absence of God](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6533485-hell-is-the-absence-of-god) \- Ted Chiang. Changed my views on Epicurus' Trilemma which strongly influenced the person I am today. Also got me hooked on Ted Chiang.

    ```
    Deep Economy by Bill McKibben is a profoundly impossible manifesto, but it changed my perspective on what I want the machinery of our economy to be used for. Comparing the real world to McKibben's utopia makes one want to go into local politics, or to try to get us to switch to approval voting rather than plurality voting. Only issue is the transformative technological change that's coming fast...

    Stoner by John Williams

    Put into perspective what a life well lived means to me, likely just meshed with what I was thinking of at the time. Still a superb book whether it changes your perspective or not.

  Any good dungeon core recs with a focus on classical dungeon-y elements? Ie. abyssal dungeon, a lonely dungeon. Didn’t really enjoy stuff like no epic loot, only puns and blue core.
  ```

  - u/Amagineer:
    ```
    our tastes don't entirely align, since i *adore* Blue Core, and thoroughly enjoyed what i've read of No Epic Loot, and it's been a while since i read them, so i may be off the mark, but i think [Dungeon Heart](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/10881/dungeon-heart), [Dungeon of Seasons](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37346/dungeon-of-seasons), [Labrynthia's Maze](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/33118/labyrinthias-maze) and [Saga of the Soul Dungeon](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40181/saga-of-the-soul-dungeon) scratched the conventional dungeon core story itch pretty well

    [Dungeon Engineer](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25361/dungeon-engineer) strays a little further from the mold but i don't think it does so in exactly the same directions as Only Puns or Blue Core.

    [Dungeon Robotics](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21700/dungeon-robotics) was half decent popcorn if i remember correctly but sorta mediocre or worse if you think about it too hard. worth reading until you're not enjoying it any longer at least. also no longer free on RR apparently.

    unfortunately i'm pretty sure most of these are abandoned/on hiatus (everything except for Saga of the Soul Dungeon i think), and i'm even more sure that most of these were popular when they were being updated, so it's likely you've already read them all. good luck in your search for classical dungeon core stuff
    ```

    - u/SpeakKindly:
      ```
      I remember Dungeon Heart being alright when I read it, but most of it is no longer available on Royal Road.

      I tried reading a bit of Dungeon of Seasons, but it got too bloodthirsty for me.

      Labrynthia's Maze is frustrating to read due to grammar and spelling errors. The plot has a few unusual twists, but eventually they seem to add up to a lack of any conflict whatsoever.

      Saga of the Soul Dungeon starts with a good plot arc before we get to see any actual dungeon-building. That plot arc is now over, but it's hard to say whether the follow-up will be equally good.

  Unwitting Champion just posted a hugely important chapter today, really kicking the plot into high gear. Anyone who started reading it and was waiting for "the moment", this is it. 

  For anyone who hasn't, it's a fascinatingly novel take on isekai, playing with and exploring the conventions of the genre in a way I'd never really seen before. 

  "Unwitting Champion is a story of a guy displaced, dealing first and foremost with trying to survive in a world where he is no longer a person but a tool, and – at least from the reaction of those around him – a shoddy one at that. His goal has inextricably linked him to the nobility, which means learning the political climate he has found himself within."

  Any interesting, rationalish works featuring mind reading as a major/primary element? I’m looking for something that explores the ethical and social consequences in a realistic way.

  Non-rational recs are fine, especially if the MC is the one with mind reading.

  I’m thinking about re-reading “Molly Moon and the Big Book of Hypnotism”, a YA book that’s adjacent in topic and goes pretty off the rails from the initial premise, from what I remember.
  ```

  - u/babalook:
    ```
    Pith

    Not necessarily mind-reading (though one of the main characters can read minds) but mind control is one of the more basic "spells" in Pith's magic system and there are lots of unique "spells" that affect the mind so society has created tons of protocols for counteracting information leaks (memory encryption) and sleeper agents.
    ```

    - u/plutonicHumanoid:

      I forgot about Pith, thanks, I’ll try it again.

    Mother of Learning? Protagonist becomes an extremely skilled mental mage, but there's so much else going on it's not much of a focus. People that find out still get real antsy around him, but it's a timeloop story so that cat can actually be put back in the bag anyway (well, 99% of the time).
    ```

  - u/aponty:
    ```
    the current most upvoted recommendation in this thread, Superworld, features mind reading quite prominently, though I'm not sure how realisticly or compellingly the ethical and social consequences are portrayed
    ```

  - u/Asviloka:
    ```
    I love **Mind Reading Isn't Cheating**, but it's on indefinite hiatus. Some really excellent worldbuilding in that one. I'd say it's worth it even incomplete, but be aware that there's no guarantee it'll ever continue.
    ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    Ar'Kendrythist has a pretty good system for mind mages and how they interact with society. The characters aren't rational but the world is, although the mind mage part comes much later (at least not until Poi becomes a main character), and are somewhat scattered throughout the greater plot.

  [The 3rd Law of Cultivation: Qi = MC\^2](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46550/the-3rd-law-of-cultivation-qi-mc2?review=1129742)  is a new cultivation story, that starts almost identically as Beware of chicken, but the difference is with the main character being focused on understanding the quanxia world through alchemy, and deciphering its secrets. So he just wants to research and avoid the whole spar/conflict of cultivation.
  ```

- u/CaramilkThief:
  ```
  Are there any decent to good straight romances on Royalroad? The only ones I've found are Worth the Candle and The Demon Lord's Lover. They both spend more than an insignificant amount of time on their romances. Some honorable mentions include:

  * Beware of Chicken (sweet but maybe a bit too fast)

  * The Perfect Run (not a big part of the plot)

  * Infinite Realm: Monsters and Legends (has good communication but not enough of the chemistry, also a small part of plot)

  * Humble Life of a Skill Trainer (story kinda dropped the ball)
  ```

  - u/Dragongeek:
    ```
    Do you mean "straight romance" as in

     - A story which is exclusively in the "Romance" genre or
     - Stories that feature heterosexual relationships?
    ```

    - u/CaramilkThief:
      ```
      Not exclusively in romance genre, but I do want the romance to be a (relatively) big part of the plot. And I want a heterosexual relationship as the main relationship in focus.

        [Marriage and Monsters: An Eschatological Romance](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/24751/marriage-and-monsters-an-eschatological-romance) got posted here for a while, years back. On hiatus, but stopped at a reasonable point if I remember right. My memory is pretty fuzzy on everything, but I think the tl;dr was Earth gets smushed together with another world of bizarre fantasy stuff in a messy collision, and a married couple gets caught in the middle. Wife becomes a dragon, husband gets a body-hopping psychic entity that has a career as a detective sitting in his brain.
        ```

    I haven't gotten around to actually *reading* it, but [Lazy Dragon Queen: Gaming in an Illogical World](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27012/lazy-dragon-queen-gaming-in-an-illogical-world) maybe?
    ```

  - u/MagmaDrago:
    ```
    - [The Demon and the Princess](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/7243/the-demon-and-the-princess)

    Finding love in a political (peace) marriage between a princess and a demon
    aristocrat after a war. On hiatus, and the only I'd fully recommend going off
    on how strongly I felt about it while it was releasing.

    - [Midnight Moonlight](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/11559/midnight-moonlight)

    Girl with heaps of social anxiety finds out her fantastical delusions are quite
    real. Everything up until V2-5 (I stopped reading then) was good enough. Current
    royalroad backlog goes uptil V5 while on other sites
    ([Neovel](https://neovel.io/book/3695/EN/midnight-moonlight), author's
    personal site -- which I can't find), it's up until V7.

    - [Dating Trials of a Vampire Queen](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22200/dating-trials-of-a-vampire-queen)

    Quite entertaining though it toed into the smut territory a bit in it's latest
    chapter. Went on hiatus on royalroad (dunno 'bout anywhere else) before anything
    substantial could happen with the romance.

    ---

    Honestly though, if you really want to satisfy your romance cravings, royalroad
    is a poor way to do that. You'll have a easier time finding, and a more pleasant
    time reading, a published book.
