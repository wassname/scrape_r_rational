## [Biweekly Challenge] Fables and Legends

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3nwfh6/biweekly_challenge_precommitment/?sort=confidence) the prompt was "Precommitment". /u/cthulhuraejepsen is the winner with their story ["Odd Man Out"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3nwfh6/biweekly_challenge_precommitment/cvvlo6m), and will receive a month of reddit gold along with super special winner flair. Congratulations /u/cthulhuraejepsen!

##### This Time

This time, the challenge will be "Fables and Legends". This is a broad topic that covers everything from Aesop's Fables to Hansel and Gretel, with a lot of leeway. The most well known rationalist fable is [Nick Bostrom's Fable of the Dragon Tyrant](http://www.nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon.html) which is a good example of the sort of feeling you might want to go for. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, November 4th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in [the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3), and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). If you think that you have a good modification to the rules, let me know in a comment [in the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Next time the challenge will be "Amnesia", or more generally, the loss of knowledge. This covers everything from self-editing of memories to antimemetics. It's up to you whether to go with retrograde or anterograde amensia (the later seen in *Memento*), or if you want to go with something more in the realm of science fiction. If you want to write fanfic, franchises of opportunity include *Men in Black*, *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind*, the *Bourne* series, *Harry Potter*, *Artemis Fowl*, *Memento*, along with many, many others.

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 11/4.** Please confine any questions or comments to [the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3).

    How does the fox know that the rabbit he caught is *the smartest* rabbit in the forest, and not just *a* smart rabbit in the forest? Also--

    Fox: ...Are you awake, Mr. Bear?

    Bear: What time is it, Mr. Fox?

    Fox: Lunchtime!

    Sorry, couldn't resist! :D

      > How does the fox know that the rabbit he caught is the smartest rabbit in the forest, and not just a smart rabbit in the forest?

      He doesn't know that it's the *smartest*, but he reasons that Father Moose probably doesn't have some super-special way of figuring out which rabbit is the smartest either, so the context of the challenge is "beating Bear" rather than complete optimization (and Fox is both clever and lazy). Fox is not terribly surprised to find that this challenge was about *good methods* rather than *good outcomes*.

        Oh man, if only academia had it this good...

    Ah, delightful. This would be particularly great to show to children/young teens.

      Thanks. It had to dowith borders controls tightening after the assasination, but I frogot to include that piece. Yet I understand very little of medieval/reinassance border controls so it would have been a weak point anyway.

    I saw what you were playing with, [but for some reason I was expecting ](#s "a runaway princess rather than an assasin").

  (I wrote a second after the first wasn't long enough; not sure how to handle this, so for better or worse posting them together.)

    What's The Kept Promise about? I don't get what the significance of the attacked neuroscience labs is
    ```

    - u/MultipartiteMind:
      ```
      [Spoiler:  ](#s "England existentially threatened by a sudden absurdly powerful enemy!  On the verge of its destruction, King Arthur heroically appears to fulfil his promise to return again in England's time of need!  The at-first incredulous public rejoices as his deeds prove himself time and time again the legendary hero that they admired as children!  A minority of people notice that a lot of neuroscience labs were destroyed after he returned, and wonder 'Wait a moment, ancient magical swords and protection and heaing abilities have actually existed this whole time, *or* this is something new (human or AI) out of a neuroscience lab which wants to act openly while being exulted somewhere instead of hiding or being hated and feared?'.  If the second, research duplication prevention is explained, and the timing of the 'threat' which prevents excess scrutiny is telling.")
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        [Spoiler] (#s "I can't imagine a neuroscience lab that does research into creating mysterious handsome men with legendary swords. What was he supposed to be? A shared delusion? An omnipotent AI? I don't think I get it.")
        ```

  - u/Sailor_Vulcan:
    ```
    For the second story, why is it that when humanity inserts material into the other universe, a planetoid comes out of it instead? Or are there three universes in the story?
    ```

    - u/MultipartiteMind:
      ```
      [Spoiler:  ](#s "There are two universes, and neither of them contain humans.  Note 'the creatures were far too tiny'--it's probably safe to imagine the second universe's inhabitants as around our size, whereas the first's are absurdly large, and their dimensional scanners too insensitive to be able to realise that") [(second spoiler) ](#s "the tiny lifeforms are all moving backwards.")

      [First spoiler again:  ](#s "(Ah, but 'neither of them contain humans' is only my personal preference for envisioning it:  it's not relevant to the story, so you can imagine either as being humans, and there are also ways to imagine both as differently-scaled humans.)")

    ```
    My upvote is for "Future Apparent," which I enjoyed a lot. Like the other posters, I found that "The Kept Promise" covered too much inferential distance without enough explanation. But I'm glad that explanation was absent, since it caused your wordcount to come out low and therefore in turn caused you to write the other story.
