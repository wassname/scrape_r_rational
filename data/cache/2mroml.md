  There's not much on offer, I'm afraid. Things that fall strictly within the "rational fiction" category are sparse. 

  (Low hanging fruit: [check out the tvtropes page.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic))


  Your best bet is fiction that doesn't have all aspects of the genre, but does possess some. ([Here's a list of books rationalists might enjoy.](http://measureofdoubt.com/2013/03/18/what-would-a-rational-gryffindor-read/))

  Personal recommendations:

  * Anything by Terry Pratchett, but especially the stuff dealing with witches.
  * Anathem, by Neal Stephenson
  * [Accelerando](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando-intro.html), by Charles Stross
  ```

    I can second Terry Pratchett. Even before the witches in general, read about Tiffany Aching and ignore the initial feels-like-a-kids-book. After the witches, continue with Moist von Lipwig. Avoid Rincewind, he is the archetype of stupid but lucky hero.

  I'd recommend most things by Charles Stross. The *Merchant Princes* series gets very little love, but is all about revolution and the creative use of power (though if you read this, try to get the reissue that cuts the six books into three fat ones as was originally intended - it's a much better read that way). His science fiction stuff is also probably right up your alley due to the subject matter. And lastly, the *Laundry Files* series is one that I really enjoy, though it varies in how rational it is. Stross has a firm understanding of science and puts a lot of thought into his ideas. Oh, and he's also written one of the best time travel stories I've ever read, *Palimpsest*, which is part of the *Wireless* collection.

    I also recommand everything this guy [writes](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4976703/alexanderwales).

- u/ulyssessword:
  ```
  I'd recommend *The Dragon's Path* by Daniel Abraham (Book one of *The Dagger and the Coin* series)

  It's well written, and has characters that seem tailored for a rational audience.  They range from book-smart (with "clever" solutions) to actually smart, from noble to practical, and everything in between.  It hits all four parts of a rational fic in the sidebar, though "solving problems through intelligent actions" is sort of hit-and-miss: the characters often end up creating problems through stupid applications of their knowledge and resources.
