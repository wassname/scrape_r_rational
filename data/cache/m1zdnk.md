## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  I realize this isn't exactly on topic, but I'd like to point out that "lair" is a Russel Conjugation of "home", implying that the inhabitant is a reptile.

  Expand on two of my fantasy settings for me please!

  I would like some opinions on what nock-on effects my particular magic systems would have in a random standard fantasy world. Thanks in advance!

  System 1: There is a second dimension (lets call it the "Aether") which is a memetic dimension, created and interacts almost solely with consciousness.   
  In this world, all consciousness gets "reflected" in this dimension, each brain has a live "recording" of their consciousness in this dimension (which I will call a "soul" but it (usually) has no effect back on the individual brain).   
  This reflection is just that; if it is "wipped away" or destroyed, it would be just like deleting a picture in your phone of a scene, the scene would not be affected and the picture will return when you take another. (so the soul would reform eventually).   
  The magic system in this world, is through certain materials/training w/e (some cool suggestions here would be appreciated as well) certain people and/or objects/items can allow themselves to be affected by the Aether. E.g. "soul sight" is when a individual somehow allows their photon receptors in their eyes to be affected by the light equivalent in the aether. This makes them able to "see" in the aether and hence see the souls (and whatever else is in there, e.g. a "ghost" is a self-perpetuating soul (consciousness recording))  
  This would allow the user to see people's minds as they are active (and through training be able to read into that - suggestions on what could be gleaned from effectively seeing live MRI scans of people's brains in a medieval setting would also be appreciated), but it also makes them vulnerable to influence from the Aether. (e.g. Ghosts, and soul attacks only affect those who can actually "see" or "feel" it). 

  Lastly, one phenomenon which is possibly with this system for isekai plot purposes, is strong enough souls, with the right materials, etc can be attached to an item and have the soul re-create the consciousness it is a recording off into that item. (Effectively, it will attempt to create a silicone brain in whatever object it is it is trying to mold itself into. If it manages to reflect itself enough into the object, so the object can start perpetuating the soul, it will create a feedback loop and eventually solidify into an artificial consciousness. 

  Note: unlike in PITH, the soul in question would hold all autonomy of itself, it could kill itself, it couldn't really be made to feel pain etc. This is also extremely difficult and costly so is rare, but the rich tend to have a few willing such objects around the place. Note, that since the objects are made to be affected by the aether (to be able to "write" the brain into it) it also is vulnerable to soul attacks, and can influence themselves through their soul slightly. Not enough to say; levitate or animate something, but enough so that it could trigger "nerves" in automatons or wind up mechanical devides such as clocks within themselves to help them interact with the world. They would usually have soul-sight along with other soul senses and since physical sight is so integral to consciousness eventually create photo receptors to be able to see the world like they originally could. 

  What would be the consequences of this?

  System 2:  
  All people have a "spirit", which kind of acts like the soul in the above system (a recording of what you are) except it is your whole physical nature not just mind and it actively back-influences your own body. As people train in something, it will influence the soul to be good at that, which the soul feeds back into the body to strengthen that even further creating a constant feedback loop. Effectively, this ends up working kind of like classes, skills and levels in litRPG's except without a system and all the actual numbers. A archer can become super-human at archery and so-on. 

  One common "class" is a Tamer, (beast tamer, druid, w/e). This is a "class" which at some point has the individual merge their spirit with a companion animal. They and the animal end up taking the most prominent traits from the other. usually, a human's most prominent trait is its intelligence (brain); making the animal smarter but not look much different, while the animal's are whatever physical characteristics are special to it, which basically make the human a low-key furry.   
  This gets passed down to children as well, making most "nobles" or descendants of powerful people with a class that does this share their animalistic traits. 

  I want to not have the average person to all be some sort of geniuses, so there will be some excuse why all humans intelligence isn't amplified due to the spirit (unless they focus heavily on it). 

  What would be the logical consequences of a setting like this on on a fantasy world?

  Thanks to anyone bothering to read all this XD.
