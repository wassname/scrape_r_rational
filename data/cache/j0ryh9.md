## [RT] [C] Nirvana in Fire: political wuxia extraordinaire

### Post:

_TLDR (by u/DXStarr): smart character with a cunning plan, versus a genuinely huge problem_

##### Introduction

Nirvana in Fire (orig. 琅琊榜, pinyin: Lángyá Bǎng, "Langya Hall") is a historical drama set in the 6th century Liang dynasty about a sickly strategist who wants to avenge his former house and its 70 000 soldiers. Caught in a conspiracy, they were massacred by fellow soldiers after fighting an important battle against a foreign aggressor, and it is this conspiracy that concerns the rest of the series.

Nirvana in Fire (henceforth, NIF) has been compared to _Game of Thrones_ and said to be China's _The Count of Monte Cristo_. And today, it's my job to disagree: not only is it the prime example of Chinese political intrigue, it is good enough to be **protorational**.

Why do I say that? The sidebar explicitly states which features are shared by highly rational fiction:

> * Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.
> * Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.
> * Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.
> * Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters'  thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This  is a feature of rationalist fiction, a subcategory of rational fiction.
> * Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known,  consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters  exploring it or building realistic social structures.

I would say that NIF ticks _all_ of these, but the cultural gap between western ratfics and the Chinese web novel industry might obscure some of them. Characters can be wrong, strategies can turn into [Gambit Pileups](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup), and because of a cultural quirk where direct language is almost always seen as _rude_, we are always explicitly guessing and second-guessing people's motivations. The work is decidedly transparent when it comes to social status, and indeed if it were only for that I would consider this rational-IST, but unfortunately instead of a greenhorn schemer climbing up the ranks, we are seeing the result of 12 years of preparation and anger by a highly intelligent man, hence there are times when corroborating details only appear _after_ the fact.

This means we'll automatically judge NIF unfairly, and I assure you that would be unfounded: the world of Da Liang is as coherent and as consistent as clearly delineated political structures can be. But [Adaptation Deviation](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDeviation) [1] [2] from text to screen means that some of the world-building had to be sacrificed for a much tighter and much more engaging script. I have read 50% of the novel and watched NIF a couple of times, and for me the series conserves details much, much better, and its choice of which characters to bring to fore and which to relegate to the sidelines is superior.

_NOTE: If you want to watch the entire thing spoiler-free, there are two main ways: [Viki.com](https://www.viki.com/tv/22943c) and the various playlists on YouTube, such as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtt_YYUGi1gXRt2XVJZrHDBkZECcfmuAJ). You might have to jump between these two because the audio sometimes cuts off suddenly for several minutes at a time._

##### Background

###### Locations

It is difficult to appreciate NIF without a prerequisite knowledge of ancient Chinese political structure. I say "ancient Chinese" knowing I'm paving over thousands of years of history because NIF really isn't a 'historically constrained' work per se. It's a mishmash of different dynasties (so apologies to the sinologists in the audience) but the overarching design is still from the late Northern and Southern dynasties period when China looked like this:

[IMAGE](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fbao%2FX4ifllUwLL.png?alt=media&token=7bbb220c-6434-4200-a05a-1546e6e1c045) 

I have labeled important locations on this map in various colors. It is important to note that Jinling (金陵) itself, the capital of Da Liang where most of the story takes place, is not identifiable as a historic city. So I've taken the liberty of interpreting Jiankang (建康, near modern-day Nanjing) as Jinling itself because it was the capital of Liang for most of its existence in real life [3]. Furthermore, the location of the state of Chu (yellow in the map) is ambiguous, and indeed throughout history its location had shifted around so it's quite difficult to tell where it is. The important thing is, Chu borders Yunnan and they aren't exactly friendly with Da Liang.

Another place that's, err, difficult to place is Meiling Mountain where the instigating massacre that started everything happened. Because of NIF's explosive popularity five years ago, a lot of municipalities in China tried to bring over clueless visitors by laying claim over the site of various locations in the NIF universe. Here are all the Meiling Mountains in China:

[IMAGE](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fbao%2FkggD7AxFyy.png?alt=media&token=46299e8f-27cc-4e9e-8fcd-b8db0067dc19)

So yeah, we have to be satisfied with what we have. And really, you don't have to sweat over cartographic precision because we're not really going to war here (or are we?).

Lastly, a kingdom called Yu is mentioned in the first episode. Its location is impossible to tell, and I couldn't find historical analogues so just keep in mind that they were whom the protagonist's army was fighting before the massacre on Meiling.

###### Sociopolitical structure

Broadly, one may classify the people of Da Liang into three stratas: the __royalty__, the __ennobled__, and the __commoners__.

* The *royalty* is composed of all the relatives of the current reigning emperor, along with their husbands and wives and their corresponding relatives. 
* Below the royalty, the *ennobled* is composed of families which have served the empire in various ways [4]. These are the pool of people from which government officials are assigned, and they are also entitled to be married off to the royalty to increase their rank significantly.
* Below the ennobled are the *commoners*. While it is uncommon (lol) for them to participate in politics, by the Song dynasty they were technically able to do so as long as they passed the Imperial Exam. However, only commoners whose occupation is one of the following: scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants; and are adult men were allowed to participate in the Exam with all the others forming the "mean" class or the lowest possible social class in ancient Chinese society.



The nuances of common society should be appreciated. The Imperial Court is allowed to invite scholars regardless of background to participate in its affairs so that it can keep an aura of meritocracy. In practice, well, "There [were] no poor people in the upper ranks and no powerful families in the lower ones."  [5]



On the other end of the spectrum, contrary to popular expectations however Chinese emperors were not all-powerful. Throughout history, the hold of an emperor varied from absolute to being at the mercy of eunuchs, relatives, or the bureaucracy. Indeed, an emperor must be keenly aware of factions and politics inside his Palace to be able to navigate his own kingdom.

Da Liang's government follows the Sui Dynasty's [Three Departments and Six Ministries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Departments_and_Six_Ministries) (三省六部) structure. However there are important changes and additions:

[IMAGE](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fbao%2Fm6wjqz7jUS.PNG?alt=media&token=e946e712-58ca-4074-a545-a1efab39ad94) 

* There were no mentions whatsoever of a Department of State Affairs, and it seems the ministries are handled by the Secretariat, so I removed it from the chart and moved its subordinates to the latter. So...it really should be "Two Departments and Six Ministries".
* The Ministry of War is called "Ministry of Defense". I changed the corresponding characters as a result, but since I don't know any Mandarin I'm asking for sinologists and Mandarin speakers to help me here. 
* There is a secret police bureau called the Xuanjing Bureau (玄靖局) which is directly answerable to the Emperor. A government office like this did not exist in China until the 14th century Ming dynasty.
* There is a Censorate which investigates government officials and are allowed to speak freely in the court, even against royalty.
* There is also the Grand Court of Review which receives criminals whose cases are to be reviewed. This department has its own dungeon but actual prisons where criminals spend the most of their time are separate from it.

In addition to court officials, there's also the Inner Palace which is managed by the Empress. This bit is important, because it is the rankings of mothers in the Imperial Harem that determines who gets to be in line for the throne. As far as I can tell, Da Liang follows the Jin Dynasty ranking system, composed of the following (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Chinese_harem_system#Jin)):

* 1 Empress (皇后; *huáng hòu*)
* 3 Consorts (夫人; *fū rén*)
  * Noble Imperial Concubines (貴嬪; *guì pín*)
  * Consort (夫人; *fū rén*)
  * Noble Lady (貴人; *guì rén*)
* 9 Imperial Concubines (嬪; *pín*)
  * Pure Consort (淑妃; *shū fēi*)
  * Lady of Pure Beauty (淑媛; *shū yuàn*)
  * (淑儀; *shū yí*)
  * (修華; *xiū huá*)
  * Lady of Cultivated Countenance (修容; *xiū róng*)
  * Lady of Cultivated Deportment (修儀; *xiū yí*)
  * Lady of Handsome Fairness (婕妤; *jié yú*)
  * (容華; *róng huá*)
  * (充華; *chōng huá*)
* Beauty (美人; *měi rén*)
* Lady of Talents (才人; *cái rén*)
* (中才人; *zhōng cái rén*)

Most of the politics in the Inner Palace revolves around the top positions in this hierarchy, but due to a quirk Da Liang's situation, the hierarchy is constantly shifting. What is this quirk? Well, originally, the Empress' eldest biological child is automatically the next-in-line (i.e., the Crown Prince). However, Empress Yan (see Characters) did not bear any children and had to adopt one, Prince Yu (Xiao Jinghuan), from another Concubine who has since died. This means in terms of imperial succession, both he and the current Crown Prince Xiao Jingxuan have equal claim to the throne as illegitimate children. And this is why they've been competing for it ever since.

Well, ever since the eldest, Prince Qi (Xiao Jingyu) died, that is. I'll leave it to the first few episodes to explain what happened to him.

One thing I'd like to mention is that dynasties in China had a peculiar balancing rule: the [Mandate of Heaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandate_of_Heaven) says that only just rulers can hold onto the throne. Hence, if the kingdom is experiencing natural disasters and/or is defeated in a rebellion, then the emperor is losing heaven's favour and should thus be deposed. This means anyone, even those not of noble birth, can ascend to the throne, because their success can retroactively be justified as "gaining heaven's favor".

If all of this seems so daunting, just remember that there is a single organising principle applicable to all levels of Chinese society throughout history: **filial piety**, which "means to be good to one's parents; to take care of one's parents; to engage in good conduct not just towards parents but also outside the home so as to bring a good name to one's parents and ancestors; to show  love, respect and support; display courtesy; to ensure male heirs, uphold fraternity among brothers; wisely advise one's parents, including dissuading them from moral unrighteousness; display sorrow for their sickness and death; to bury them and carry out sacrifices after their death."

No other lens is as far-reaching, and indeed almost every aspect of this virtue appears in NIF in one way or another.

##### Characters

_NOTE: again, if you want to watch the entire thing spoiler-free, you can find it on [Viki.com](https://www.viki.com/tv/22943c) or on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtt_YYUGi1gXRt2XVJZrHDBkZECcfmuAJ). The rest of this post will be spoiling Episode 1 and some parts of Episode 2 heavily, so proceed at your own risk._

NIF wastes no time in setting up dominoes: from the very first episode, we are thrust into Da Liang's political maze. Mei Changsu (梅长苏), the alias of our protagonist 12 years after the Chiyan conspiracy, is being coveted by two princes vying for Da Liang's throne. Why? Because legend [6] says he is the Divine Scholar, and "whoever owns him owns the world". The episode then goes on to introduce 70 000 characters so if you don't want to spend the next 3-4 episodes being confused, you should refer to this post while watching!

That’s a lot! So, here’s a set of charts to help you help yourself:

##### Outro

Right, that’s everything you need to know to dive in without feeling lost (or worse, cheated). NIF is not perfect by any means (unlike, say, The Metropolitan Man) but it‘s on my List of Things I Wish I’d Written. As with anything…different…not everyone is bound to like it. Some people will be turned off by the fantastical martial arts elements, some will find the lack of world domination disappointing (for that, you need to look for _xianxia_), some will find the extended [Selective Obliviousness](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveObliviousness) off-putting [7], and some people will just plain hate watching stuff vs reading them. If so, there’s an ongoing translation project of the web novel [here](https://langyascribe.wordpress.com/chapter-index/).

Otherwise, if you want to change things up and ~~read~~ watch something completely new, then NIF might just be your cup of tea.

[1] NIF was adapted from a 2007 web novel by Hai Yan (海宴), who joined production as a screenwriter and has said that "the framework, the characters and the plot is set to no major changes...[but] 80% of the script is original."

[2] In particular, some people feel that the protagonist is _too capable_ relative to other schemers. That's true, but then again [people are really not used to dealing with someone who's well-prepared](https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1272794864413839361?s=20) (remember he spent 12 years bloodlusted). In the web novel, he is much more uncertain about his plans and his methods of figuring things out are better fleshed out.

[3] Technically speaking, there's also the similar sounding Jiangling (江陵) which became Liang's capital in its last four years, but as you can see the characters are different and it would not be consistent with relative directions to other places given in the series.

[4] All dynasties prior to the Yuan dynasty followed "two crownings and the three respects" (二王三恪) principle when transitioning from one dynasty to the other. Dynasties seldom disappeared completely upon the ascent of a new ruling family and (re-)ennobling and enfeoffing nobles of the previous one was an excellent way to smoothen this process. This is also why noble families could accumulate honor over generations, a cultural phenomenon commonly exaggerated in other works.

[5] Liu Yi, _Book of Jin_

[6] This was only mentioned in the web novel so I'll say it here. This legend was supposed to be started by Mei Changsu himself. Which makes sense, because he is friends with Langya Hall's future master Lin Chen (who appears in Episode 1, don't worry).

[7] Remember folks, not every character in a ratfic needs to be _smart_.

  Great, great story. Recommended. The TV series is superb. The webnovel requires a lot more patience; I'd recommend people go to the TV series, not the webnovel. 

  This story is "smart character with a cunning plan, versus a genuinely huge problem." *Count of Monte Cristo* with more brains, more scheming, and gorgeous ancient Chinese settings.

  It's not a true Fair Play Intrigue. There are a few unreasonable pieces of good luck for the protagonist, and a few times where he gets an Idiot Ball so things will be more dramatic. But *much* of the story is fair-play rational. (Fair play among the characters, that is. As the viewer you're not told everything important right off. Part of the story appeal is watching the secrets unfold and seeing how it all fits together.)

  Great, smart, high-stakes fun.

    I was bothered a bit by the Marty Stu-ishness of the protagonist, so I read the web novel because, well, how can such a consistent universe have such a glaring flaw? And I was satisfied to see the web novel doing a bang up job of showing more of his faults and uncertainties and methods than the series, though at the expense of NOT being able to see everyone else's scheming.

    > smart character with a cunning plan, versus a genuinely huge problem

    This is a much better copy than I could have written. Hope you won't mind if I quote you in the TLDR.

  Let me take this opportunity to ask: besides NIF (which I've already watched—seconding its recommendation!), what are some of the most rational live-action TV shows out of Asia, such as you might find on Viki? Not necessarily rational in absolute terms; just the top "least irrational" entries in the category. 

  Double points for it being a romance and managing to entirely avoid irrationality-driven romantic conflict. (My SO watches a lot of romantic dramas, and I'd love to find one we could both enjoy.)

    I'd recommend *Joy of Life* which is on Viki. It has a slow start and is more of a comedy early on, but it ramps up the court intrigue later on. It's notable in that everyone in the show is smart and have plots within plots, not just the MC.

  Hmn, I was about to resume The Rise of Phoenixes but perhaps this would be more up my alley

  Was fun to watch, but I definitely didn't consider it rational, most of the time I got the feeling of deus ex machina or magical foresight. some neat plays by both sides that were rational though.

  I downloaded the novel. Will see if it lives up to the hype :)
