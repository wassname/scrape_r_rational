## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  Naming. How does it work? Previously, I've been deciding names by "gut feeling" and did fine (though not great) on most of them. Now I'm writing my first long work with appreciable amounts of worldbuilding, and I'm noticing that gut feeling doesn't cut it anymore.

  How do you name? I'd love to have some hints or different approaches; maybe some of you even have an article to recommend on the topic, or personal experiences to share.

  ***

  Some details: what I'm writing takes place in a different world entirely; non-IRL names are called for. The culture everything takes place in is vaguely Nordic, and I'd like the names to reflect this (preferably without carbon-copying anything). The problem is that I have almost no "generative linguistic intuition", i.e. I have no idea how to come up with things that "sound" right.

    Personally, if I'm putting effort into it, I'd go to something like the [Old Norse wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Norse#Consonants), specifically the part about consonants, and then start from there. These are the *sounds* of Old Norse, and there are some guidelines to where those sounds exist within words.

    Alternately, there's a program called [Vulgar](https://www.vulgarlang.com/index.html) that can make a language for you, and if you want to go the extra mile (or just get that Nordic feel) you can put in all the vowels and consonants from the nordic language of your choice (perhaps with a few other rules) and see what it spits back out for you - if you save the results, you'll have a long list of internally consistent sounding words to use as names.

    Also, there's a book called The Art of Language Invention that I've found helpful in the past, though if you only use it for names, you're probably only using about 5% of it. Mostly you want to pay attention to which sounds the language uses, and in which order, plus for names, especially last names, include a lot of the same prefixes (e.g. O'Rouke, O'Leary, O'Sullivan, O'Neal) or suffixes (e.g. Walker, Baker, Carter, Parker, Butler), because that's part of how last names get/got created.
    ```

    The last couple characters I named, not very creatively, by adding or subtracting letters to words that happened to be in my field of view at the time. For instance I have Canje, who was born from my printer “S**canJe**t”. Another was named Limth, because I saw “f**ilm th**eatre” when I was looking for a name. 

    That’s overall fine enough for short stories in random worlds.

    If you want names in a different world you can take typical names of the inspirational culture and mangle or rewrite them. Like, swedish for instance: Linnéa, Ebba or Tove, all female names. Limena, Abbe, Ovte. I think it’s more important to have the character names thusly created to feel consistent than actually adhere too consistently to a renaming scheme. Culture is malleable, and thus are names, but at the same time they’re more united by a feeling than strict rules (unless those are dictated by alphabets, see Japanese naming schemes).

    I remember reading a novel set in an counterpart Japanese culture before the Meiji restoration, and all the names felt Japanese and consistent at the time. One of the side characters stood out, though, and only after finishing and ruminating on the book did I realise *why* he did; he was named Tomasu, adhered to the syllabic naming scheme of the counterpart culture, but didn’t… ‘flow’ as well inside it. But when the quasi-mystic religion of that character was taken into account, it did by providing one more piece to the puzzle and Tomasu revealed itself to be a japanified version of Thomas. Like I said, that revelation came only in hindsight.

    Lastly, you can go strict by rules, which is in my opinion the one with the most work behind it, because you’ll need a feel for that made-up language. One can approximate this by inventing (or taking) a dozen words of appropriate choice (flower names, landscape formations, religious figures) and adding syllables or letters, maybe gendered. Many diminutive and female forms of names end on -a or -i/-y, whereas many male forms end on -o or -e. Not exclusively, though, and I didn’t touch on unvoiced vocals, but that’s something to keep in mind. Thus you’d have:

    Word | Meaning | Female | Male
    :---------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------
    Sten | stone | Stena | Steno
    Bäck | stream | Bäcka | Bäcke
    Blomma | flower | Blommi | Blommo
    Kust | coast | Kusta | Kuste 
    Huvud | head | Huvudi | Huvdo
    Svärd | sword | Svärdlinga | Svärde 
    Älskar | love | Älska | Älsker

    This should be less restrictive/normative/prescriptive than more inspiration for you to get a feel for the naming scheme. Try names out, *sound* them out, try to get a feel for them on your tongue.

    But a bit of advice on names in general as a device: choose pronounceable names for main characters. Klaxtrikpug may be a good name inside the fictional culture, but it doesn’t exactly roll of the tongue of the anglophone reader.

    RNG until I get something I like. I don't like matching names to some narrative archetype partially because I think it's snobbery, but mostly because I'm lazy.

    If I need a fantasy name, I tend to take a "real" word, then tweak phonemes until it's unrecognizable. For example, for an RP character I got started with "Genex" (a yugioh archetype), then "Grenex", then "Grenexus". That one in particular was kind of cheesy, but it conveys the general idea of the process.

    You could always just steal names that are very obscure. Like find a Norwegian town with a population of 2000 and make its name the name of your capital. 

    Or you could combine Nordic words in a way that makes sense. If your capital is has a big fishing industry, find the word fish in Norwegian, then add the Norwegian word for city to it. Lots of real places are named like that. Tokyo for example means "eastern capital".

  I think I've figured out what makes a work rational-*adjacent*. More on that in friday's thread. But the tl;dr is that the story  needs to be primarily driven by intentional character action. Even if the rest of the story isn't quite up to snuff (stuff happening because the plot demands it, characters acting not quite in line with their motivations) a work will still typically be in line with what /r/rational enjoys.

  So given that, what's the least amount of possible change to the way the real world functions that effectively makes the life of *anyone* (who's sufficiently motivated and intelligent to begin with) an interesting rational-adjacent fic?

  To set an easily surpassed bar: giving the entire planet Log Horizon mechanics. (That is, respawning, monsters to take down, bodies with sweet new abilities, magic, etcetera.) If that were to happen, at least in the mid-term you could take pretty much anyone's life and it would be interesting to watch (eventually it would get old-hat, of course, but that would take a while). But what I'm looking for specifically is what you think the *lower* bound of change that would result in any proactive person having the incentive to do interesting things, while IRL incentives head more towards "get comfortable and/or interesting job, enjoy life."

    * Some kind of feedback mechanism, e.g. people can see their own "karma", status/rank is factual. This gives a means for agents to see if their actions are working. IRL people can't easily/reliably assess what they're doing so it's harder to optimize their actions.
    * Some kind of leveling up system. Ways for agents to improve without regressing towards the mean again. This makes training/study more useful because the results are permanent and you don't need to "work out" to keep them. IRL you can't stack skills easily, talent and other stuff makes harder for people to reliably compete and reduce the incentives to "become awesome".
    * Discrete/quantifiable events. This gives agents achievable goals that have clear boundaries (e.g. did the event happen/finish, did we "win" it). IRL things are usually unclear, it's hard to keep motivation if the goal seems too far away or if the results are not clear cut.

    I think any of these would work. Essentially they're ways to make the system more "gameable" by having exploitable aspects.

  Does anyone here know of the issues present with teraforming Venus.

  As far as I can tell the major issues present are 

  1: the atmosphere is filled with chemicals such as sulphuric acid

  2: It's incredibly hot due to green house gas

  3: It's highly volcanic
  4: The wind speed is very high

  I would like to know of any other issues that need to be dealt with for colonisation 

  This is the plan for my world. The original settlers were highly paranoid. This is why they settled Venus, because it was difficult to reach by ship. To this day, the people are highly xenophobic. They originally lived underground, but over the years they have teraformed the planet. This teraforming took the place of using tectonic activity to turn the crust into a giant ward scheme which separated the atmosphere into two layers. The ground layer is mostly habitable by humans. The layer above, however is where the fun starts. It began as the normal safe Venus atmosphere. However the Venusians decided to control it through the addition of alchemical compounds. These perform a couple of purposes.

   Firstly they absorb heat and prevent it reaching the lower atmosphere. When temperature reaches a certain threshold they vent the heat into space, causing temperature to fluctuate wildly. 

  Secondly defence.  Some substances are designed pass through and disrupt ordinary wards. More dangerous substances will begin eating the ship, possibly turning into unstable dangerous forms of matter. 

  A third function a kinetic energy leach which causes anything in the atmosphere to quickly slow down to falling speed while increasing wind speed. This maximises time in the atmosphere and contact with dangerous compounds. It can even significantly reduce speed of asteroids, through storms rage for weeks afterwards. 

  The only way down to the planet is with permission of the Venus government who can control the ward scheme enough to temporally part the clouds and make a passage that can be passed by some ships. They do this infrequently. 

  The land is not safe either but exact details are still up for debate. At the very least Venusians have built colonies around the volcanoes and use them to power ward schemes  


  So what do you think. Any other things that need to be considered when inhabiting Venus? Any obvious flaws in the defenses? Bear in mind their isn't much genetic engneering in this setting so the Venusians are still human.
