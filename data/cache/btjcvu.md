  It's always interesting hearing readers' reactions to things, especially the more dramatic things.

  Here's what this looked like from our perspective; first, the rules that players and QMs had agreed to were that:

  1. [EDIT:  At the time,] Hazō was a complete avatar of the players' will with no agency of his own. [EDIT: After this incident we and the players agreed that he would become a real character with agency who would usually obey the players.]
  2. We were solidly simulationist and willing to let him die if that was the simulationist answer.

  We had been very clear that when the quest started we were expecting Hazō to die within a few real-life months. The quest would (we thought) consist of exploring different parts of the world through the eyes of different characters, each instance building the players' knowledgebase about the world and thereby allowing them to make better decisions until eventually they managed a successful playthrough. We were astounded when (albeit with some luck on the dice), the players kept surviving. Still, they were one mistake or bad dice roll away from death, and everyone knew it.

  Then we get to the youthsuit. To put things in perspective, imagine a group of known Commie spies who betrayed their own people but have not been accepted by America, and they're being escorted around Washington DC during the height of the Cold War. Suddenly one of them completely breaks character and starts behaving in bizarre ways that align closely with a famous American agent who is well known for being utterly insane and annoying, but is tolerated due to his phenomenal skills.

  In the real world, what happens in that scenario?  Answer: He and his team are immediately hauled in for interrogation, which is what we did.

  Could we have decided that, well, it was completely unrealistic for American agents to ignore bizarre behavior on the part of their traitorous escortees, but we didn't want to ruin everyone's fun so we would be nice and forgiving and have the world run on irrational story logic? Sure, but that wasn't the deal. 

  With that disposed of, the question becomes: Did the players vote for Hazō to break character and start behaving like Gai? At this point it's down to interpretation. If you think "Buy a YOUTHSUIT!" in bold, radioactive-green letters is not a vote for acting like Gai, then I suppose you are justified in your belief that the players made no mistake.

  Personally, I think the players should have just accepted their mistake and gone forward. It would have made for some great role play, and it was hardly a character-lethal event. Later on they insulted their handler, Jiraiya of the Sannin, and threatened a Leaf doctor in front of a bunch of ANBU (special forces soldiers). THAT could have been a character-lethal event. Still, they talked their way out of it and things ended up better than before.

    From my understanding the plan wasn't "have Hanzo break character and go crazy" it was "Buy a youthsuit" (in those exact words even).  How you got from that plan to what you wrote is where the extreme punitive (I'm not touching you, yes you are / we're not punishing them, yes you are) bit comes in.    

    Any reasonable interpretation would have Hazo remember that Akane has mentioned Rock Lee and Gai wearing a uniform that represents their style, and asking to go buy a matching set for him and her because it's a very thoughtful (or "youthful") gift that ties into her interests and what she considers important.  If it's an obscure suit (rather than being a purchase available on every corner that gets you put on a watchlist,um what?) that plan alone could have taken all day, or at least a chapter.

    Story wise it would have been cool to meet some of the things Kagome is so paranoid about.  The fact that you guys took a 'hostile misinterpretation' approach to a plan you didn't originally prepare for might have even been ok though that's something better established in chapter 1 if that's what you want to do.

    The fact that you blamed (are apparently still blaming) the players for the outcome of your hostile misinterpretation (or malicious compliance if I'm being charitable) is not ok.

      As someone who isn't a QM but who did participate in the quest previously (along with occasionally still lurking) - I think you're wildly overstating what a "reasonable" interpretation of the plan was.

      Purely from context clues around discussion, one thing to note is that this plan actually represented, among other things, a massive character break, from the perspective of the plans generally put forth by the players. Most of the plans were long, detailed, covering many different conditions and contingencies, and generally being pretty strategic in general. This plan, on the other hand, had exactly no details, was well known in-thread for being a meme-vote, and was actively formatted in a manner that in no way conveyed "calmly go to the market and hand over money for clothing". That is, of course, one interpretation, but it's far from the most likely interpretation, and assuming malice on the part of the QMs violates the entire concept of the quest.

      I regret hearing that this is your interpretation.

    You are not going to prevent someone occasionally putting in a silly vote that violated expectation and rule of the quest no matter how clear you make your expectation known. The only thing you're going to get is a negative reaction. This is like having multiple signs to warn people of the bridge clearance and then wondering why people keep crashing into said bridge. The solution is to raise the bridge or make a modification such that trucks will stop crashing into said bridge, either increasing bridge clearance or force vehicles to not use enter underneath the bridge. 

    &#x200B;

    Other QMs would had set aside joke votes and went for the winning serious plan. At least this way, even if this resulted in a negative reaction, it's much more likely not to blow into your face.
    ```

    - u/MilesSand:
      ```
      It's not the silly vote, but the hostile misinterpretation of the agreed upon plan.  

      The plan was "buy a youthsuit." Every vote used those exact 3 words.

      The execution was "proceed as though one of the other plans had won, then give the main character a mental breakdown resulting in attempts of violence against much more powerful and hostile antagonists on their home turf."

      If the QMs aren't going to act in good faith with how votes are treated, just because they imagined some silliness to the concept, what's even the point?
      ```

      You're right, we're not going to prevent it. That's not our job. Our job is to provide the most realistic version of this world that we can, in the process of writing the best story that we can. If people can't understand that, or don't want to play the game we're offering, that's totally fine. They are free to take their marbles and politely go home.

      Whose job is it to prevent those votes? The players'. At this point, everyone knows what we're offering. No one can pass joke votes on their own, they need to convince a majority of the voters. All the players need to do is vote for something else while politely explaining to the newbies what to expect.

      And, before you ask: If a group of trolls passed a harmful vote, we would ignore it. The youthsuit thing was voted in by regulars.

    I think you're at a big disadvantage as QMs because you're running something different from literally every forum quest anyone's done before - even quests that are notoriously "brutal" are brutal in a fashion that makes cohesive narrative sense. Whereas that narrative rise & fall doesn't really happen in something as ruthlessly simulationist as what you're going for. This is a common thing throughout the whole quest - not just the YOUTHSUIT incident. Even as early as the first couple of chapters.

    In a *normal* story the Village Hidden in the Swamp would have worked out. Like a TV show. It's inevitable demise and inherent instability would have manifested themselves in a [Sorting Algorithm of Evil](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil) kind of way, where the protagonists were just *barely* competent enough to survive each time. You see a lot of moments like that, looking back through the story 
     - moments where the team *fails* a mission and runs, or bails on a location that, in an ordinary story, would have been home-base for the entire time. The YOUTHSUIT is just an extension of this mindset. The naive quest-goer thinks that, *hey*, we just got done with a very tense action-oriented story arc, it's filler time. *We're even in the village from canon, which finally puts us on canon rails.* Filler time means doing silly meme stuff. But in your world, story arcs don't actually exist, there is no such thing as canon or meta-knowledge, and silly meme stuff is as fucking bananas as it would be in real life.

    I'm used to /r/rational, so, that's not my biggest gripe with your story. (*My* biggest issue was worldbuilding: I think Naruto's schizo-tech is cool and don't like the feudal Japan aesthetic as much.) But if I had never read a single rational story, and also happened to be dumb enough to not notice when the QMs were getting annoyed, I totally would have voted for the meme answer, because what else are we going to do? Add to that the times that the meme answer just happened to work out beforehand, and you have a recipe for everyone in the thread simultaneously blundering into an interrogation cell.

    The Kabuto incident I don't even want to think about. That one was *more* frustrating as someone catching up to the story, because I couldn't voice my two cents. Still, it's a casualty of the same mindset. "We're in Konoha, these are the kind people from the anime, they'll understand that we're just asking as concerned citizens." If you're approaching it from that perspective, the hammer of *common sense* looks a lot like punishment, even if it's the sanest outcome of the literal actions that the voters chose to take. And I feel like you guys understand that on some level - every time Hazou does something sketchy, you have the rest of the party step in and tell him exactly how fucking stupid that idea actually is.

      Yep, I agree with pretty much all of this.

      It's true, we're doing something different and that has its challenges. It also has rewards, I think. The incredible victories that the players have won in MfD are so much more satisfying than they would be had they been granted by mere narrative.
      ```

- u/WalterTFD:
  ```
  I feel like MfD is a combination of a more typical Naruto Quest and Octodad.  Like, on the one hand we are trying to do Uplift things to the setting, but on the other Hazou must always pretend to be a normal person and not the weird thread-avatar that he actually is.

      So I have no familiarity with Nauruto at all would I still enjoy this without having seen the show?

        You would not be alone among the players in having not read / watched naruto, so no, it’s not a requirement. I think I enjoy it more for being familiar with canon, though; I’m not sure how universal that is.

        I have no familiarity with canon. And having read a fair number of fanfics, I can confidently say that MfD isn't very much like them.

        Dunno.  Might be an advantage cus the QMs put in villains but as allies and everyone who remembers the villain ends up voting to fall into the trap.

        Fwiw I think there's a Pokemon one too somewhere in that forum.

- u/meangreenking:
  ```
  Yeah, I quit reading the series over that honestly.
  The sheer lack of regard (and outright hostility) it displayed for the players was staggering to the point where I couldn't continue.

  My annoyance was compounded by the fact that after they retconned it back they asked for a bloody apology because they felt hurt by the temerity of the players *daring* to be upset at the poor defensless  QM's for deciding to throw away everything the players had done because of a single joke vote.

  I do agree however that exploring that path would be super interesting, and it would totally be a great story worth pursuing if they were to get there in a way that wasn't them basically pissing all over the players.

    I'll bite. First of all, the QMs complaint wasn't ever that people were upset. It was that some decided to channel that in rude and plainly hurtful ways. I think asking for an apology for that makes a lot of sense.

    As to the second part - well, they were throwing everything they had done too! The quest is hardly only the players' accomplishment. A joke vote winning could just as well be looked at as the players deciding to throw away everything that the QMs have done. (Or a coordination problem, which is why the chapter was eventually retconned, and QMs and players agreed on a set of new rules that give Hazo-the-character a bit more non-player-driven agency)
