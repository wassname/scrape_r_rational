## Request: Mother of Learning fanfiction (or the nearest thing to it)

### Post:

What I *really* want is a story set in the MoL universe from the perspective of a dragon, preferably one too young to know any great magic but too old to seek help as a hatchling from other dragons. It'd follow the dragon as they run around the only land unclaimed by other powerful magical creatures: human areas. But yeah any MoL fanfics would be good.

  It's certainly not what you described, but it is MoL fanfiction and it is good. If you don't mind a multicross with Homestuck, Worm, and Naruto (it's written such that you don't need to be familiar with all the source material, I'm not Naruto familiar and I enjoy it), there's [Conference Call](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/conference-call-multicross.50109/).

    Oh my god thank you for this!

    I have to say I had to stop reading where they started entering a multiplication table. Why???

      It's about exploring the ramifications and potential of the node. That's something that appeals to a lot of folks around here, me included.

  ```
  why not write one? It could be fun.
  ```

  - u/Lightwavers:
    ```
    Fair point. I may if I can scavenge up the motivation.

  If you just want to read a book with dragons in it, try Goodreads list of [Best Kick Ass Dragon Characters](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/5905.Best_Kick_Ass_Dragon_Characters).
