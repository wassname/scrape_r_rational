## [EDU] There are practical issues one must tackle if visiting another era. Language is one, a topic covered admirably in L. Sprague de Camp's "Language for Time Travelers." 1 Another is the matter of money.

  Would aluminum have worth in the ancient world?

    Sure, as long as you're between 1850 and 1888 - preferably towards the end. Before 1846, metallic aluminium had never been synthesised, so nobody would have any use for it except as a curiosity.

    If you specifically knew you were going to the mid-1880s, then an ingot of aluminium would be more valuable than gold. But everywhen else it's not particularly good for trading.

    Yes actually because aluminum was an extremely scarce material centuries ago. In fact, royalty would eat off aluminum plates while dukes would eat off *platinum* plates. However, when Hans Christian Ã˜rsted (I think?) managed to produce aluminum by extracting it from the reactions of two common chemicals, aluminum became insanely cheap. Imagine diamonds becoming cheap as bread.

    TL;DR - Yes, more than gold or silver.

  Without having read the article yet, my first thought would be:  Go to the supermarket, buy up all the salt and spices you can get your hands on.  Salt is cheaper than dirt (well, potting soil) in much of modern Western society, but was highly valuable back in the day -- Roman legionnaires were paid in the stuff.  Spices are high-value, low mass, and the small screw-top glass jars you can get them in will be valuable in their own right.  (Granted, you'll want to buy most of your spices in bulk.)

  Aside from that...hm.  Medical supplies won't be understood well enough to be valuable in much of history, although you'll definitely want some antibiotics for yourself.  Cubic zirconia might be a good option if you're morally flexible -- I don't know if anyone in the far past could tell the difference between CZes and diamonds.

  EDIT:  [I ](#s " called it on the spices, although he got much more targeted than I did.")

  One thing he brought up at the end of how to make a profit on your return.  He mentions the mass / volume limits on bringing stuff back, but there's another issue:  anything you bring back in your time machine won't pass carbon dating etc as being the right age.  Much better would be to set up multiple caches of stuff and then simply "treasure hunt" them up in the modern era.  No mass / volume limits, and everything will pass any tests people want to use, because it really *is* exactly what you claim it to be.

    I seem to recall that before the 18th century, diamonds were really not valuable.  Sure, there were some remarkable and large pieces, but small diamonds were boring.  People liked jewelry with color, like rubies, sapphires, etc.  There are artificial gemstones of other types that might be of greater value than diamonds.

    Interesting.  Reading the article, apparently Romans liked diamonds a great deal.

      Ah, yeah, you're right.  DeBeers created the value of diamonds in the 20th century, out of whole cloth.  Thanks for the reminder.

      It looks like [artificial rubies](http://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Gemstones-semi-precious-stones-man-made_229671551.html?s=p) might be a good option.  The things are ridiculously cheap today and would be as good as the real thing back in the past.

  drugs are the best bet. poppy was known since ancient times and the extraction of morphine could be achieved with roman-era alchemical equipment. sell to medics and junkies alike. hell even simpler: introduce distilled spirits as the alembic was not widely known and never used to produce alcohol until 12th century, sell vodka and disinfectant. [the CIA use viagra to bribe in Afghanistan](http://www.newsmax.com/InsideCover/cia-viagra-afghanistan/2008/12/26/id/327327/) and you should too!  sell the secret of float glass and lead oxide to roman glassmaker industry then invent the greenhouse and sell spice as it must flow.

  Assuming you can jump back and forth at will, take sufficient tools to perform a massive bank heist in a given era (or theft of gold, silver, or other valuable commodities), and then skip back five or ten years and establish yourself as a rich trader or foreign dignitary.

  If you absolutely must stay through to the time of the heist (and assuming a single timeline), it would be trivial to arrange to be seen in public in a different city by multiple persons of impeccable word, and your own known wealth would not change (ie suspiciously increase).

  As for bringing items and commodities forward in time - why not simply invest a large amount of money in the past and leave a set of instructions about how to manage and invest it over the centuries? Let compound interest and knowledge of how various industries would develop do the work for you. Have an ancient order of monks hang around for a thousand years carrying out your will.

    Even better if you can just pop into the bank every 30-50 years or so as the "heir" to the previous owner. If you can find a bank that will stay open for the duration, that you can trust, you can make a lot of money.

      bank of England is a prime candidate. even better if you invest heavily on the south sea company bubble and sell around the time stock prices were in the 800-900 pound range. Around the same time buy cheap catholic land in Ireland and government debt (they are still paying interest on it today!)

      ```
      Large banks should stay open for decades to centuries, and you can always leave instructions for the money to be transferred somewhere else a decade or so before any given place goes under.
      ```
