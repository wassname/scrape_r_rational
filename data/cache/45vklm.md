## [BST] Rational One Punch Man

### Post:

I was thinking about this today and at first my thought is that it'd be impossible, since a rational Saitama would just run through the world while one-shotting every criminal he finds. It'd just be rational Flash all over again. 

I got to thinking about the whole "If you give Frodo a lightsaber then Sauron needs a Death Star" scale afterwards. In this case, Saitama is the Death Star. He doesn't really need much else just because of how far above everyone else he is. So this means we'd give the villains a lightsaber right? Probably not. This would essentially just be writing fanfiction about Saitama either one-shotting people who try or Saitama meeting his match. Either way it's just the standard OPM formula.

But what if we made Saitama the villain? Of course, a rational villain Saitama would just one-shot the story, but we could have him stay irrational. After all, he's the Death Star. Rationality would just be giving him another Death Star, and since heroes aren't usually supposed to lose they should be the ones with rationality. 

Here's a rough scale visualization of what I'm saying

Hero Saitama Rational Fic

Rational Saitama (2 Death Stars) > Rational Villains (1 Death Star)

Villain Saitama Rational Fic

Rational Heroes (1 Death Star) = Irrational Villain (1 Death Star)

I believe the main character of this villain AU would have to be Genos. Genos' creator, Dr. Kuseno, has shown himself easily capable of replicating biological functions in cybernetic parts, even with just combat data. I believe a rational!Genos would attempt to kill his opponents while damaging the body as little as possible. Dr. Kuseno, with the abilities he's shown, should be capable of replicating that with cybernetics to upgrade Genos, causing a recursive chain.

Genos fights villain. Villain has ability Genos does not. Genos takes body into Kuseno. Kuseno adds ability to Genos after a certain timeframe.

Most of these abilities would likely be strength related, so throughout the story Genos would need to outsmart the villain, as opposed to what he usually does (run in and die). As for how Genos would end up beating or at least removing Saitama as a threat... I'm not sure.

Perhaps Kuseno would learn about [Webcomic] (#s "the Limiter mechanic") and that could be abused, but I don't think we know enough about it yet.

  The idea reminds me a lot of Metropolitan Man, where a highly resourceful, intelligent character attempts to overcome a seemingly invincible adversary. I only know the premise of One Punch Man, i.e, Saitama is bored because nothing and nobody can pose a challenge to him, but I think the idea shows promise.

  I like the idea of OPM as a villain as well. If you take away the morality that made him a hero, becoming a villain is a much better way to give yourself a challenge than being a hero. If you show up, show your invincible strength by doing something horrifying, then give the entire world a year or so to come up with something to stop you, that'd be much more effective in drawing powerful foes to you than fighting whatever random villains happen to arise.

    Indeed. Also lets not forget that Saitama suffers a lot from a "[Dude, where's my respect?](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyRespect)" trope. I mean if the entire world is treating you worse than a villain and the hero association doesn't appreciate what you can provide, well, you can always take your respect by force.

    Your second paragraph is exactly what I was thinking of when I thought about what a villainous Saitama's motivation would be, I was just pretty tired at the time.

    We know that Mysterious Beings (monsters) are appearing more often and seem to be getting stronger over time. We also know they can form organizations and cooperate to fight strong heroes. I was thinking that perhaps after a while the monsters would potentially work with the Hero Association, with the Association abusing the apparent unexplained growth in strength among monsters.

    And you've basically described Koro-Sensei from Assassination Classroom, plus or minus some differing motivations.

  How is Saitama not rational in the story?

  In my opinion any change to Saitama from his current apathetic self would not be "stengthening" so much as just making a complete different character with non of his original essence.
  The series essentially explores one answer to the question of "what happens when you really reach the top", and the answer suggested in this case is effectively "Nihilism".

    > How is Saitama not rational in the story?

    Although his attitude is perhaps rationalizable, his approach to it is not particularly so. There are clearly things he wants (eg. fame, money, dead mosquitoes) that he could get much more effectively by applying a smidgen of thought to his actions.
    ```

    - u/DCarrier:
      ```
      But he doesn't want to have to work hard. It's not that he really wants fame and money. He just thinks it would be kind of nice and he doesn't have anything else he wants more.
      ```

      - u/Veedrac:
        ```
        [Everything but the Webcomic](#s " Being S-Class would not require working harder; King proves this. All he needs to do is report the things he's already doing and he gets all the stuff he ever really wanted.")

        [](#s "Heck, it would remove his old need for C-Class patrols, which took more effort than the actual fighting. It would mean he's not kept out of the loop wrt. strong guys, which is obviously an end-goal of his. It means getting to the monsters is less laborious and confusing. The TV OVA has him lamenting needing to get a job, just after the mosquito incident. And, let's face it, the fact he didn't realize about the hero association for so long despite watching TV to search for monster news is, well, irrational.")

        [](#s "There are also many things he does that are stupid in the small, too. His actions in the most recent tournament arc are particularly non-rational. The mistakes about intent in the Road to Hero OVA is short-sighted. And, FWIW, the end of the 'boss fight' there there clearly shows his wish for money.")

        [](#s "He's also not a nihilist; he cares about things. This isn't particularly hidden in the story. He's just very nonchalant for a particularly obvious reason.")
        ```

        - u/DCarrier:
          ```
          When I said work hard, I didn't mean punch harder or punch more. He's fine doing that. I meant paperwork. And having to think.

  That'd be interesting. I admit I was toying with the idea of a Rational OPM fic before and thought, is Saitama immune to mind control? I think that could be one way to turn him into a threat that has to be neutralized before he destroys the entire world and would introduce the moral complications of stopping him without killing him.

  Heck you could write it with Genos as protagonist trying to find a way to neutralize his master without killing him and competing against the other heroes that want to stop him at any cost. There's a point where the cost of killing him may be lower than the benefit of not doing so and that can lead to some great gray morality drama.

  Then there's the fact that a villain with Saitama as thrall must be extremely smart and would be very dangerous. If he can take over Saitama, he could as well take over other heroes. Maybe it works on all but cyborns and espers though that may be too much for Genos and Tatsumaki to face.

  That could also explore the morality of the Hero Association and how unregulated they seem to take in any crack like Puri Puri Prisoner (he's a guy that admits and relishes on the idea of raping other males) or unstable people like Tatsumaki/Metal Knight that could go rogue just based on power level. What level of control do they really have over the heroes and if one of them decides to go villain, do they really got any way to stop them?
  ```

  - u/MugaSofer:
    ```
    I believe he's resisted psychic attacks in the comic using "willpower", but those weren't proper mind-control - just attempts to disable him.
    ```

  I think you're missing a reason why OPM is interesting. Being able to one-shot adversaries is NOT an instant victory condition, not the way something like time-manipulation would be. In the OPM universe it's quite possible to kill everybody on the planet - you just have to do it before Saitama notices. Saitama wins because the antagonists are Big Bads who enjoy fighting, and/or lack imagination. 

  You could plant an explosive device on Genos, rig it to explode if you die, and tell Saitama about it. If you're an alien you can meteor-bomb Earth from afar. If you're a psychopath bent on killing everybody you can detonate dirty bombs all over. 

  So basically all you have to do to keep things interesting for a rational!Saitama is to make the villain smart.
  ```

  - u/Veedrac:
    ```
    Ah, and Saitama eventually wins by eventually being smart himself. That could work.
    ```

- u/Qwertzcrystal:
  ```
  Saitama could still be the hero as long as the main antagonist gains one vital advantage over him: Saitama is just one guy. He can oneshot everything, but doing so takes some miniscule amount of time. If Genos had not had a complementary skill set to Mosquito Girl, Saitama would have had trouble with the swarm (though not MG herself).

  Now scale that up to the entire world. He can at best keep one city safe from a smart and strong villain that happens to control a swarm. I don't know, invite Skitter over and give her some relay bugs?
  ```

- u/EliezerYudkowsky:

  OKAY THAT WOULD BE HARD

  I'll think about it.

  What about that scientist guy with the numerous clones and animal based cyborgs? It seems to me that he would be the most fitting candidate for a rational protagonist. I mean, he wanted to artificially evolve humanity and eventually discovered the secret to immortality and revitalized himself as well as created a ton of non hostile intelligent clones. Plus the weird cyborgs and animals given intelligence and abilities but y'know.

  Dr Genus would work pretty well as a rational protagonist trying to make the world of giant monsters and superheroes more rational as well as saving the normal humans a la  Significant Digits style.
  ```

  - u/Overlord_Xcano:
    ```
    That's actually something I didn't think of and is a very good idea.
    ```

    - u/MatterBeam:

      I think this is the perfect premise. OPM is basically an unstoppable bulldozer, with the only thing stopping him from becoming the ultimate supervillain is that he sees himself as the hero. 

      Your protagonist has just witnessed his Hourse of Evolution (?) get trashed and his experiments killed by OPM simply because he doesn't understand what the protagonist is trying to do.
      ```

- u/MugaSofer:
  ```
  If you give the hero a Death Star, you need to give the villain the Force.
  ```

  Saitama's speed is ... inconsistent. He can perceive and react to speedsters, but he only ever acts "super-fast" in short bursts.

  The question of how to be rational with arbitrary strength is more along the lines of Rational Superman, I think. It'd be a story of how Saitama tries to use his power to enact lasting social change, or something - that doesn't sound like a sustainable longform plot, although I might be surprised. 

  Villains who can act on a large *scale*, rather than having great personal power in melee, could plausibly act as a threat to Saitama - he has difficulty getting to fights in time. Not to spoil anything, but the final battle involved far more time taken up with Saitama's attempts to track the villain down than with battling him.

  In short, I think a Saitama villain needs to be Lex Luthor.
  ```

  - u/Overlord_Xcano:
    ```
    I don't think his speed is inconsistent so much as he doesn't care/isn't trying to hurt things around him. I understand everything else you've said.
    ```

    - u/MugaSofer:
      ```
      He definitely struggles to reach fights on time, so I have trouble believing that he could have simply switched on a speedster power at will.
      ```

- u/kaukamieli:
  ```
  How to beat Saitama? Get him unconscious, and haul him off to the outer space. He could come back, if he knew where earth is.
  ```
