## A Homestuck logic puzzle about polyamorous relationships

### Post:

I thought you might like this logic puzzle that a friend of mine drew up for Homestuck. You have to figure the (numerous) romantic relationships between twelve people. 

I don't think that it needs much knowledge of Homestuck, just some terminology, so if you like puzzles, here you go: 

* Quadrants are different types of romantic relationships, of which trolls have four (compared to humans' single type). 

 * Matesprit = ♥ / Flushed

 * Moirail = ♦ / Pale

 * Kismesis = ♠ / Pitch

 * Auspistice = ♣ / Ashen

* ♥ and ♦ are "redrom" relationships. ♠ and ♣ are "blackrom" relationships. 

* All relationships have just two parties, except for auspicesticeship (♣/ashen), in which one party auspisticizes for two other parties. 

* The trolls are arranged in order of their position in the bloodcaste system, so Aradia (#2) is higher than Karkat but lower than Tavros. 

* "Vacillation" is switching between one quadrant and another. Being in two quadrants with someone is taboo, but you can get around that by being in one quadrant for a time, and then another, and then switching back again, so long as you aren't in both of them at the same time. 

 * If A and B are flushed and B and C are pitch, then A and B can vacillate into pitch, which would force B and C to vacillate in turn, break up, or technically commit infidelity.

  ooo, fun. too late to do it right now, but i'll give it a shot in the morning.

  notes:

  -pretty much ideal level of complexity, but perhaps too many variables to make solving interesting after the initial deductions

  -the ships proposed made me giggle (karkat and vriska as auspictices, haha)

  -the top left grid square shouldn't be crossed out :y

  -vacillation was probably a little underutilized, as it could have made the whole thing miles more difficult

  -maybe they could have cut down the overhead by removing the "every quadrant filled" requirement?

  So Nepeta can't even remember who she's dating?

    Apparently whoever erased Nepeta's shipping wall also bonked her on the head. 

    I'm going to blame Gamzee for this one. Always, always Gamzee. (And it has to be one of the other eleven, since they have no other romantic options).

  Do the auspiced parties of an auspistice need to be in kismesis?
  ```

  - u/callmebrotherg:
    ```
    No. Auspisticeship is actually about keeping the other two trolls from being kismeses.

      Good question, though. I recall it was a big fandom question back in the day - and I'm not sure if it was ever fully answered in canon.
