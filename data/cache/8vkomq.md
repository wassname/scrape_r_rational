  I cannot believe I didn't see the Dream Skewering being fake coming.  The Actual Cannibal would have killed any collection of earth folk from his time long ago, and the implication was there were dozens or hundreds of them.

  Also, Arthur is going to be hacked off when he finds out Juniper has no interest in going back to Earth.
  ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    We didn't know that the dream skewered were from 2017, only that they were from Earth. And then most people aren't from North America/Europe, where Shia Labeouf is popular. So only a tiny fraction would even know the name, much less mention a somewhat popular actor when there is little reason for his name to come up.

    Although this raises the question I asked last update of how the knowledge of Shia Labeouf got passed on at all, if the people who say it are murdered. How could it happen that the syllables are not only put together correctly randomly, but the name is passed on through some obscure method that is the only one that works?
    ```

    - u/sparr:
      ```
      And how many know how to pronounce it? I've seen him in a dozen roles, and I have no idea how to pronounce his last name.
      ```

      - u/sicutumbo:
        ```
        La is about how you would normally think to say it, and Beouf is pronounced like "Buff".

        The weirdness of how it's pronounced vs. written doesn't really matter. They can't even attempt to write it down, in whole or in part, so they would only ever know the name as a collection of syllables.
        ```

        - u/sparr:
          ```
          Your "they" are Aerbians.

          My "they" is the dream skewered, Earthicans. Does someone from Earth who mispronounces the name still trigger the effect?
          ```

          - u/sicutumbo:
            ```
            Presumably Arthur never mentioned the name, and the only other actual Dream Skewered came from before the 1990s. So Joon is the only person who might be able to test that, and I doubt he would be willing to given the relative risks and rewards.
            ```

            - u/sparr:
              ```
              I strongly suspect Amaryllis knows. That's stuff they would have experimented with when trying to weaponize it. Even if they just made up mispronunciations with no knowledge of English or French, it's easy to swap a vowel or add/remove stress from a syllable, etc.
              ```

      - u/CouteauBleu:
        ```
        Like you'd pronounce "Le bœuf" in French.
        ```

      - u/vaegrim:
        ```
        I just call him "[The Beef](https://translate.google.com/#auto/fr/the%20beef)"
        ```

        - u/JiggyRobot:
          ```
          That still summons him. But he now has a bad french accent.
          ```

    - u/JiggyRobot:
      ```
      Does Shia Labeouf kill everyone that is around, or 'just' most of them? If there have been any surviving witnesses then it could have been passed by written word. Also, remember that saying the name once is not guaranteed to summon him.

      How they first managed to figure out that particular combination of syllables I have no idea. Maybe the DM just planted the name somewhere?
      ```

      - u/sicutumbo:
        ```
        It's heavily impkled he kills everyone, but a quick skim didn't show Amaryllis saying directly that he kills absolutely everyone.

        Saying his name once doesn't guarantee summoning him, but if he isn't summoned then why would you link the word to anything? Nothing happened.

        The only thing I thought of was using elf luck in some fashion, because it can give the elf information that they otherwise shouldn't be able to know. Someone is about to say the name, and a nearby elf shoots their hand out to stop them? Kinda implausible.
        ```

        - u/PM_ME_OS_DESIGN:
          ```
          > The only thing I thought of was using elf luck in some fashion, because it can give the elf information that they otherwise shouldn't be able to know. S

          What about writing it down? Person writes down a thing, gets killed. Sooner or later, people will link the written word to the corpses surrounding it. Then, testing to figure it out.
          ```

          - u/WalterTFD:
            ```
            Learning it from a dead person via a recording is apparently safe.  That's how Amaryllis learned it anyway.
            ```

    - u/nytelios:
      ```
      The syllables Shia Labeouf could be a homonym or chain of phonemes in some Aerbian language.
      ```

  - u/JiggyRobot:
    ```
    The really strange thing is that there were dream skewered at some point. 6 of them at once (at least). Why would they appear then and not now?

    Does the arrival of Joon mean that more dream-skewered may have arrived at the same time (similar to Arthur)?
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I'd say that's guaranteed now
      ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Not necessarily. There was strong evidence that there was no dream-skewered who'd lived past the eighties (else everyone would know that Star Wars came from Earth). There was moderate evidence that there was no dream-skewered from after World War II, hence the lack of electronics, or that nobody before Joon noticed that the world they were in seemed pretty similar to Tolkien-inspired fantasy.

    But there could have been a collection of dream-skewered from all over Earth, from different time periods. In fact, it would have been more surprising if all dream-skewered had come from the same country and time.
    ```

    - u/JiggyRobot:
      ```
      Interestingly, we only heard descriptions of two? They both were both from the last 1000 or so years as well (and English speaking?). Given the span of human history, that seems like there might be some sort of selection still criteria still.
      ```

    - u/PathologicalFire:
      ```
      I doubt they would 'know' Star Wars and the rest originated from Earth. The simplest explanation is that things that are 'real' on Aerb manifested inside the dream for those people. This is even explicitly theorized about early in the story- joon says that he recognizes parts of Aerb as things he made, and Amaryllis suggests he instead imagined 'real' Aerbian things inside his dream.

      - u/GaffitV:
        ```
        Not necessarily. Often times in stories there's the case of a popular character from a previous story joining the group of a new story.
        ```

        - u/RiOrius:
          ```
          Even when the previous story doesn't actually exist.  Off the top of my head, FF5 and 10 both featured party members who'd been part of the group that sealed away the Big Bad the last time.  (to be clear: they were from events that we only hear about/see in cutscenes, not from a previous game)

          I mean, if you're going to have a Grizzled Old Man-type character, it's a great way for them to tie into the setting's backstory.

    Meta narratively the built in count down (there are 5 years of books left, so the world will end in 5 years) works well to motivate Juniper, it gives a reason for him to actively seek out exclusion zones and other dangers which otherwise it would be sensible for him to ignore

  Awww, but I like the idea of an institutions dedicated to studying SI characters!

  >  “I was going to say that you’d need the complicity of far too many people,” replied Amaryllis. “People -- scholars -- would come to this place and they’d want to speak with the dream-skewered, they’d want to take notes, they’d want to know things about Earth. You can’t possibly have -- how could you possibly have kept up the pretense for five hundred years?” 

  You might say the dream-skewered were... an illusion.

  And... we're going to back to doubting everything the narration tells us. Did Juniper's friends really abandon him on purpose, or were they manipulated into thinking he was going with them?

  Yay for solo mode!

    > Awww, but I like the idea of an institutions dedicated to studying SI characters!

    Yeah, I did too. I spent some (probably too much) time on a version of the chapter that preserved that, but it hadn't been part of the master plan, and in the end it seemed too much like me trying to have fun with a side concept that didn't add too much to the story. Not that I'm averse to that, but it wasn't pulling its weight.

    I think the idea I liked the most was that of second generation dream-skewered who had been born into Earth culture but only known a life on Aerb ... but that would be hard to slot into the narrative in a compelling way, and there's no reason that I can't just do that as its own separate story.

      Self Insert. While can mean the literal (I, the author, am dropped into the story), has various degrees. For example, Joon has some clear similarities with Ben Friesen / Alexander Wales / cthulhuraejepsen - he's very very arguably a self-insert of some flavour. I've seen the definitition stretched as far as "a person from our mundane earth is dropped into another world" - for example, a Russian special forces soldier dropped into Westeros or something.

    Kinda makes you wonder how many crazy things Arthur did to try to reach out for the real world, that we never get to see because they didn't amount to anything.

    - u/JiggyRobot:
      ```
      Kinda depressing to think that after all that time Arthur still wanted desperately to get home. Even with his wife and kids around him, he still didn't feel as though Aerb was his home (also hints that he didn't even consider Aerb real either).
      ```

      - u/nytelios:
        ```
        Arthur's fixation on the narrative probably brought about the escalating consequences that Masters recounts. I feel like contrasting Uther's narrative focus to Joon's decision to let go of the narrative's weight might be a clue into the nature of the "game." Uther may have been playing with the wrong strategy, so to say, because fixing Aerb's issues was never the intended end-game for Arthur (whereas it might be for Joon, who has a reason to undo all the suffering he helped create).

        I've had a theory that this game is a type of therapy. So if we work with the conceit that Arthur was sent here for some therapeutic reason, what issues did Arthur have? The only things I remember are: (1) he was the god of stories without endings and in the same vein (2) he always waffled and deferred confessing to Tiff. So maybe his issue was that he couldn't commit to an ending and the narrative kept being deferred because he went every which way.
        ```

        - u/JiggyRobot:
          ```
          I feel like Arthur's story is increasingly leaning towards showing the way that Joon /could/ go. A theme of the story seems to be holding on to the past and letting your current relationships and life deteriorates because of it.

          Joon very obviously was badly affected after Arthur's passing, and now it seems Arthur never moved on from his desire to get back to Earth. Hinting that he never really made the most of his life on Aerb, still seeing others as NPCs.
          ```

        - u/MilesSand:
          ```
          Seems like the therapy went very wrong and just made things worse. Sort of a personal hell because the therapist isn't guiding him to the right path effectively
          ```

        - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
          ```
          I feel confident that the endgame for Joon is Arthur himself. I'm not sure what Arthur's endgame was though. But it's safe to say he went in the wrong direction considering he never won.

    ```
    Oh damn, Val activating the Cannibal and then managing to get out because she's a non-anima is a great idea.
    ```

    - u/derefr:
      ```
      I was pondering that Val might be able to avoid the consequences of calling down Shia—but then, Mary did explain that she had to hear the name from a record-player *recorded by a now-dead person.* As in, even if the record-player is itself a sack of potatoes, the name could have somehow still been traced from its playback to the person who recorded it, had that person still been alive. Val might not die if she calls the Cannibal, but the Cannibal might trace the name from her to Joon.
      ```

      - u/GeeJo:
        ```
        There wouldn't need to be a trace from the playback. 

        They spoke the name in order to record it, and died shortly afterwards as a direct result.
        ```

        - u/notgreat:
          ```
          Saying the name is not a guaranteed death sentence- remember the whole probability thing (and why they didn't have to fight him when they said the name)? The fact that the record was explicitly called out as being recorded by a dead man makes me think that it can be traced through just as how giving orders to say the name are traced.

        Oh man oh man that means that Val could *bluff* summoning him!

      ```
      That sounds like a horrible, horrible risk to take.
      ```

      - u/PastafarianGames:
        ```
        Sure, but it's the kind of risk that I think Val might take. She probably has complete faith in Joon's ability to defeat him, and she knows she's safe; there's no reason for Shia to kill a sack of potatoes.

        More rampant speculation: Arthur was the first and until Joon pulls it off as well the only person to defeat Shia. The "illusion of Shia -> oh shit it's not an illusion?! -> team up" arc would be a cool fakeout.

        No doubt I am completely off base. That's fine, because I enjoy being surprised.
        ```

        - u/Bowbreaker:
          ```
          Depends on how Shia works. If he has human-like eyes and any agency he could just see this girl in his way and attempt to kill and eat her.

          But would Val be able to summon the cannibal in the first place?

- u/Rorschach_Roadkill:
  ```
  The naming sequence was so tense. Stroke of genius to keep talking about The Cannibal earlier in the chapter (btw love Fenn channeling Reimer there. I just imagine her in Order of the Stick shouting "HA HA! HALF DAMAGE!" at the universe and it working) - I was 95% sure you weren't going to unleash him on them, but then *you kept naming actors* and I just *knew* he was about to be dropped. I mean, if he's gonna say Adam Driver there's no way in hell he's not gonna say Shia LaBoeuf. 

  But then: Arthur Surprise! Or Tiff surprise actually, I didn't recognize Arthur's last name. Let out an audible "oh daaamn" at that. And then, wow that mirror scene. In order to give it the heft I felt it deserved, I read his monologue out loud to myself. Highly recommended. Channel your inner Mike Ehrmantrout for that heavy "outwardly world-weary authority figure finally saying the thing that's been weighing him down all these years" tone. I hope my apartment isn't bugged, or some nebulous deep state org now thinks I've completely lost my marbles. 

  Aaaand... yeah killing Joon is probably the right call for the rest of Aerb? Knowing this DM?
  ```

  - u/WarningInsanityBelow:
    ```
    > Aaaand... yeah killing Joon is probably the right call for the rest of Aerb? Knowing this DM? 

    The way I read the DM he has already set up the challenge and made sure that Joon has the opportunity to acquire the tools he needs to face it. I think the DM might be tweaking things a bit to keep things interesting but only to the point of maintaining plausible deniability to any hypothetical observers, but I think any big events which will occur to challenge Joon have already been set underway, and will happen regardless of whether Joon survives up until that point or not.

    One observation in favour of this is that after Uther disappeared, the threats continued coming for another 30 years, rather than stopping abruptly. Another is that the way the DM has set up Joon's harem is consistent with this approach to DMing, he set up the possibility in advance, but since Joon persistently acted in defiance of the path layed out for him, it didn't happen.

    I don't think that Joon is here because of the rising threat or that the threats are appearing because of Joon, rather they have a common cause (The DM wanted to run another campaign).

      So far Joon has always been given level appropriate encounters. The story even lampshades it too... but if the DM wasn't railroading, how could a level 2 quest like this possibly be completed at the appropriate level? Unless the quest itself changes according to PC levels?

      Then again, now that I think of it, its probably more like viridian city gym. Undertaking the quest was never really possible until appropriate progression was unlocked.

- u/Noumero:
  ```
  There's no bigger threat.

  We have little reason to believe anything past the second keyring actually happened. That outcome was pretty convenient for Masters: Juniper's allies have left, and Masters is now alone with him, up against an enormous threat. Any bets on them striking an alliance of convenience next chapter, during which they would come to trust each other?

  Elf luck was compromised. Masters likely could take control of any sense if he knows it is relevant, and he figured out elf luck even before becoming hostile. Scaring them into leaving, then fooling everyone sans Juniper into thinking that Juniper is visibly leaving with them, was entirely doable.

  They screwed up their identity confirmations, should've been continuously exchanging private information, inserting it in phrases and such. Faking that would've been next to impossible.

  (I'm not sure what's up with Valencia, though. If Masters couldn't affect her and she was fine, she wouldn't have left with the rest of the party, since she would've seen Juniper not leaving. I'd bet on her being incapacitated in the room, then taken through the portal by the rest of the party. Would explain why no-one else hesitated to leave her behind, and why Masters expected only Juniper to stay.)

  >I couldn’t feel whatever she felt, maybe because my luck was so much weaker than her own, or maybe because I had so many other things on my mind.

  Or because Masters didn't know to fake it for him, hmm? I'd assume he would have noticed an eleven on a zero-to-ten scale.

    Masters has had 500 years of experience to become a master of other magic as well as illusion, he also has access to various powerful entads. He could easily have moved her away from the rest of the party with that

    Yeah, I was wincing at how easily Joon fell into the pattern of believing all his communication was real after Masters let the illusion "break." Since Joon never detected it at first, everything suggests that the illusion is seamless.

    I think it's pretty likely that Val is still in the room, but is struggling to find any good recourse while her friends are all (presumably) babbling with barely any common thread.
    ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Mhh... I don't know. There was definitely some shenanigans happening after the second keyring (I'm pretty sure Amaryllis didn't *really* suggest they give him info), but I think there was a real external threat that somehow incapacitated Masters at the end of the chapter.

    Let's see... Juniper has access to soul vision, which I'm pretty sure Masters can't fake, which means all their movements definitely matched what we saw. So the illusion was auditory and *maybe* elf luck at most. There was definitely a portal, the others went through it, Joon didn't. Given that info, it's likely Valencia didn't go either (else she'd have dragged Joon with her), which means she's trapped somewhere.

    I think the part at the end really is the illusion cutting off. Maybe it wasn't, and Masters cut himself off mid-sentence on purpose... but I don't think he's *that* good. He's confused, he's dealing with what he thinks is Uther 2.0 and his new Knights, Joon has shown an ability to see through some of his illusions, and Masters doesn't know how the ability works and what its limits are. The scene really makes sense if you assume Masters is grasping at straws there (unlike Fallatehr, who was smooth and deliberate even after he was exposed).

    I'm calling it now, this is what happened:

    * Masters cut off most of his illusions when Joon touched his friends.

    * He tried to convince them to stay, by man-in-the-middle-ing their dialogue.

    * He was taken out, either by Valencia, or by an external force.

    * Everyone except Joon decided to leave, for the reasons we saw.
    ```

    - u/Noumero:
      ```
      I am pretty sure that elf luck was compromised.

      First of all, from Masters' perspective, it was the best sense to attack. Juniper has shown some unexpected ability to see through the illusions, with no exact limit. That meant Masters' ability to fool him *or* the rest of the part became limited: Juniper would have seen through the illusions, and if Masters targeted his teammates, Juniper would have seen them reacting to illusions. That was true for every sense, *except* elf luck.

      Fenn had elf luck, but Juniper didn't (as far as Masters knew). That meant Juniper wouldn't have been able to see through illusions targeting elf luck. That was the state of the situation — and then Fenn's sense of danger overloaded.

      Is that not suspicious?

      Second: circumstantial evidence/the timeline.

      > “Something’s not right,” said Fenn. “Not just the obvious. A little tingle came on in the last minute or so, and it’s getting stronger. You feel it too?”

      > I nodded. My own sense of it was far weaker than hers.

      *Both* Juniper and Fenn feel "a little tingle" from luck sense, immediately prior to Masters becoming hostile.

      > “Ah,” said Masters. His tone was flat, only with a slight note of curiosity. “Elf luck?” 

      Masters figures it out.

      >“You have another sense,” said Masters. “Which one?”

      #

      >“You couldn’t see them,” said Masters. “Now you can. How?” 

      #

      >“How can you still see your companions?” asked Masters.

      Masters *really* wants to know what sense he needs to compromise. Implies the knowledge would be useful to him, implies the knowledge is necessary for compromisation, implies luck is compromised.

      > “Something’s off,” said Fenn. “Really, really off.” <...>

      >“Zero to ten?” asked Amaryllis.

      >“Eleven,” said Fenn. “Not sure that portal is going to do it.”

      Fenn feels something *horrific* through her luck sense...

      >I couldn’t feel whatever she felt, maybe because my luck was so much weaker than her own, or maybe because I had so many other things on my mind.

      ... Juniper *doesn't*.

      ___

      To recap, Masters likely could compromise any sense if he knows to target it. He knew that Fenn had luck sense, but had no reason to think that about Juniper. Juniper's luck sense was enough to pick up on what Fenn's luck sense registered as "a little tingle", but then he didn't feel anything at all while Fenn was experiencing sense overload.

      As I said, I'm pretty sure elf luck was compromised. Given that, what is the likelihood that some kind of external threat *really* arrive when Masters was faking the arrival of an external threat?
      ```

      - u/sparkc:
        ```
        So I agree with this and came to the same conclusion, before asking what the goal here would be though? Twig Fenn’s elf luck so she and the rest of the group bail and leave behind a member *except* Joon who conveniently is last in line to get through the portal and decides to stay? If your goal is to get some ‘alone time’ with Joon then I don’t think this plan works nine times out of ten. I would guess this plan would often result in Joon bailing with everyone else or everyone going all out to recapture Valencia then bail.
        ```

        - u/Noumero:
          ```
          My initial guess was that he used Valencia to separate them.

          Say she is lying unconscious in the middle of the room. He could show her to the rest of the party, but continue blocking Juniper's perception of her. They grab her and put her through the portal — and now they don't have any reason to hesitate escaping, unlike Juniper. Masters creates an illusion of Juniper walking through the portal, replaces actual Juniper with Masters' image, for Amaryllis to talk to at the end, and sees everyone except Juniper leave.

          (We don't even know if the portal is actually closed, by the way. Perhaps Masters used an illusion to "close" it faster?)

          However, on second thoughts, it's conditional on Masters knowing/gambling on Juniper's inability to see her, which means he would be able to figure out soul sight, which means he would be able to fake it, which means he has absolute control again and no reason to scare them off.

          So I'm not sure.
          ```

          - u/HPMOR_fan:
            ```
            This is the other strong possibility, except I think the luck is real but did not trip for Joon because it is not a threat to him personally. I caught this line

            \> She (Fenn) looked at the portal for a fraction of a second, then darted over and placed her gloved hand on the mirror. 

            Sounds like someone on the other side of the portal told Fenn to try to put the mirror inside the glove.
            ```

      - u/russxbox:
        ```
        Obvious question: Why would Masters have "no reason to think that about Juniper"? Joon gave away his ability to feel elf luck when he confirmed the first tingle that allowed Masters to figure out that elf luck was being consulted. So why doesn't Masters use that information later unless he's intending to keep Joon there?
        ```

  - u/JiggyRobot:
    ```
    The game-layer seems to be the only thing Juniper can fully trust right now. That being said, I think that the fact he got an achievement after the rest of his party left strongly suggests that they were not in fact illusions.

    I agree that it seemed a bit uncharacteristic for them to all leave so suddenly.
    ```

    - u/icesharkk:
      ```
      He wasn't say they were illusions. He's saying the only advantage shouldn't have him is the ability to locate them. Masters could still be faking communication, faking the "break" in the illusion caused by touch. And he can still obscure Val. Hell the fact that Joon can't see Val should give masters the info he needs to ID joons new sense as soul sight.
      ```

      - u/PM_ME_OS_DESIGN:
        ```
        No, it IDs it as a magical sense. Nothing more specific, really. It could be an entad shoe that locates people.
        ```

  - u/ceegheim:
    ```
    My preferred state (most interesting narrative) would be if our party happens to be equipped with radios / walky-talkies (afaik, these exist on aerb). 

    Now, they would be in a very interesting position: Communications Joon-> party cannot be interfered with, but comms party->joon can be modified. Masters can listen to everything.

    Now we need a protocol for peaceful (almost neutral ground) negotiations. First, joon will repeat back everything he hears, both from party and from M; the latter is necessary because M is presumably not physically speaking at all. In other words, the party can catch all deceptions. In regular intervalse, and especially before every irreversible decision (e.g. revealing new info to M), Joon queries the party whether any deceptions occurred: If they spotted deceptions, tell e.g. the last name of Harry Potter's male companion; if they spotted no deceptions, tell the last name of his female companion. 

    M is informed of this protocol. He is informed that negotiations will end if he fakes any communications. If he must interfere, he is to replace by [redacted], which would be considered shitty but less hostile than replacement by lies. 

    Ultimately, Joon has no way of fighting. If M has any sense, the room is rigged to collapse into a lava pit, and J cannot quickly find the exit anyway. If joon finds val, and she is presumed immune to illusion, then the same protocol applies.
    ```

  - u/countless_argonauts:
    ```
    Except Masters doesn't know the team well enough to create an illusion of them acting in character.  That's why he had them just standing around being puzzled like Joon was.

    Most telling is Mary's comment about voting at the end.  I doubt Uther was running his group as a democracy, based both on him being king and from what we've heard about his actions in Aerb.  And Aerb doesn't have a democratic tradition that it would make sense for him to make that guess.

    So, it seems like the team Joon thought he was interacting with was really them.  And we know they really left because he couldn't have known to fake the solo mode achievement.  (We also know Valencia is incapacitated or elsewhere, for the same reason.)

    It's possible he faked the luck sense that Fenn felt, but I can't see how he could have been sure enough that Joon was going to stay behind, which was his most pressing concern at the time, if we assume no outside threat.

    It is possible he noticed Fenn's reference to Joon having luck (bad opsec there), and he may have suppressed Joon's sense at the end in the hopes he would stay.  But none of the rest of the possibilities seem reasonable given what we know of Masters's capabilities.
    ```

  For someone as apparently well versed in the Narrative as Masters is, he's *really* managed to dig himself into a hole here.

  - u/SpeculativeFiction:
    ```
    He has a pretty understandable viewpoint though. Arthur, both from his perspective and Joon's, attracted countless horrors that threatened the world.

    It's very believable that someone would notice that, and the fact that the threats petered off after Arthur left, and be very leery of a successor popping up and starting the cycle again.

    Honestly, he might be doing the world a favor by killing Joon. The DM has promised that he won't railroad Joon, but Masters doesn't know that, and the DM has already shown just staying idle isn't really an option for him.

    On another note, he mentioned he wasn't sure if Arthur could lose, and noted that despite winning every time, and talking about fate and narratives, he nonetheless *always* seemed to give situations his all. Maybe his low-key demand for information was an attempt to bypass whatever factor let the chosen one always win, by making Joon not try very hard to escape?
    ```

    - u/TempAccountIgnorePls:
      ```
      Now that I've thought about it some more, I think he's on the fence. He doesn't know if he should kill Joon or not, and he's trying to get more information out of him to help reach a conclusion.

    Same. Kinda mindblowing, too, as I tend to spend some half hour after every new update basking in the joy of knowing there's more WtC for me to read later, when I feel like it. I usually wish to extend this interval more, but then curiosity catches up and I'm fucked for another ten days.

    Speaking of which, /u/cthulhuraejepsen, If you're reading this, it probably means I'm dead, the map to the lost city is inside the globe in my library. But that's beside the point.

But you said that you aren't able, so maybe it will lift you up to hear that I know you do amazing work, you got great talent, and I keep the last chapter of WtC always open in another tab in order to refresh it with what is frankly an insane rate.

      Thanks. I'd agree that AO3 is a much harsher audience. It also tends to be harsh in a way that this subreddit rarely is; it's pretty typical for people on AO3 (at least for this work) to comment about "the author" as though they have a clue who I am or why I made the writing choices I did. That's not really a way that I tend to engage with works, nor is it a way that I like seeing others engage with works (even those I didn't write), nor do I think it's terribly productive unless there's a strong case to be made one way or another, like from biographical details (and even then). Judging the internal mental state of other people is very hard, all the more so when you're looking at something they created rather than speaking with them directly.

      I tend to approach AO3 comments in batches, and then skip past the stuff that doesn't look like it's going to be something that I would want to respond to. Sometimes there are corrections or clarifications I want to give, sometimes there's actual discussion, and sometimes (rarely) there are typos. I went through a period of just ignoring comments entirely, but I've been trying to get better about A) dealing with negative feedback in a way that's mentally and creatively healthy and B) giving people responses that I think can enhance the work. I've had some success with it so far.

  Worrying thought. If the library suggests that the world ends in 5 years, could it be that instead of some apocalyptic event that Joon just finishes the campaign at that time? No more adventures, means the DM stops writing the story.

  That or in 5 years everyone just switches to Kindles (yep, probably just eBooks. Nothing to worry about guys).

- u/WarningInsanityBelow:
  ```
  Now I'm paranoid that Val left with the group, and Master simply didn't drop the the illusion concealing her. I don't think that she was forced to leave the room the party was in since:

  * Val is an out of context problem between her immunity to most magic/poison/conventional weapons and her martial prowess. To take her down you'd need to prepare a specific counter before hand, (or be lucky enough to have something on hand, which is possible with access to Uther's vault)

  * Master seemed to be trying to avoid harming Joon's companions since he potentially valued Joon's cooperation, further complicating any attempt to take down Val.

  * What ever Master potentially had set up which could have dealt with Val, would also have to also be ineffective at preventing the deaf and blind party from escaping.

  This leaves two possibilities, Val left voluntarily (possibly to chase Master), or she didn't leave the room until Solace opened the portal (I don't think she's invisible next to Joon since that seems like it would prevent Joon from getting the achievement).
  ```

  - u/icesharkk:
    ```
    Good final point. The HUD doesn't lie which means Val is either gone or needs to be rescued
    ```

- u/nytelios:
  ```
  Did someone say they miss the paranoia from the Fallatehr arc?

  I'd bet a gram of gold that that achievement was a bit of sly DM trickery and Joon isn't really *alone* except in the narrative sense since only he can break the illusion. I'm working off the suspicion that Masters figured out Joon's soul sight (or simply applied the illusion on every level he knows) because it seemed unlikely that Solace suddenly pulled portal-making out of her rump when she previously mentioned a tree and Masters questioned it.

  If true, this suggests illusionism and social fu (ability to imitate voices convincingly) is a frightening combo. Depending on how fast Masters can process different people talking in real-time and falsify a version more fitting for his purposes, you'd be completely unable to follow the true conversation, especially if he's letting in-character "real" responses slip through to muddy the waters. Going over the conversation (if my theory's true), there's quite a few lines near the end that could've been fudged before everyone got the illusion of Solace making a portal and Joon "saw" his party jumping through. Masters might be powerful enough to create an entire scene in his exclusion zone (which now that I think about it, might be why he had no choice but to do Uther's bidding after 20 years).

      Great point about soul color. It's remotely possible illusion magic's sensorium lets him reproduce the color once he focuses on the soul aspect, since Joon seems to think only his HUD is truly safe from the illusion.

  Some random thoughts:

  - Joon didn't mention seeing anyone else's soul in the room with him. First thoughts - a non-anima illusionist? or he's really far away? Or he's fooling soulsight? Or he's actually a sentient entad a la Bethel? Or something else entirely is going on? 

  - The illusionist claims to be named Masters. Clearly this is a Worm reference, because the illusionist is a Master 12.

  - We don't know the illusionist's real name, gender, appearance, or anything else, at any level we might consider absolutely certain. They probably doesn't have any assistants or anyone else in the building.  They might be pretending to be trained that monastic discipline in order to make faking facial expressions easier - if they have trouble responding accurately by simulating facial expressions in real-time.

  - Speaking of that monastic order, they are Worth The Candle's Dûnyain, and nothing they could tell me, with their iron-clad control of their faces, would convince me otherwise.

  - Val saving the day would be awesome, she needs to save the day more, she hasn't really yet saved the day nearly as much as I'd like.

  - Joon has a limited amount of soulsight time left. Looking for unidentified souls and seeking methods whereby he can end them might work. Some of his gem-based blasting magic, perhaps? I don't even know.

  Overall, the plot twist with regard to dream skewered here was great, 10/10. And the illusionist battle looks like it'll be a great mindscrew, so I look forward to that. His opponent controls the vertical and the horizontal, but he still has a few tricks to play.

    Illusion magic seems more like Master *and* Stranger. He is controlling the illusions, but they don't seem able to do much by themselves, per se. The Stranger aspect is more useful from a tactical standpoint, as it informs people facing him that you should be prepared for deception and 'mind games' and the like, not mind-control or minions. And of course, the PRT rating system was created from an in-universe tactical perspective, not for rating 'accurately.'

    I think Master figured out Joon was using soul sight, because he couldn't see Val and the Master correctly identified what Val was. One way out is if Joon can gain access to illusion magic he might be able to level up fast enough to start seeing through the illusions.

    But this might be a challenge Joon is not meant to defeat. It happens in DMing. Joon got this quest at L2 when he would have had zero chance.

  Hey long time listener first time caller, quick question, has there been any discussion in the past about how weird it is that the world contains elements that Joon invented after Arthur's death, like Fel Seed? My assumption was always that the world was built at some point from Joon's work, and then Arthur was brought in at some point and then later Joon was brought in, and the DM guides them around. But Fel Seed indicates that there are major elements that were still being added to the world in between Arthur's and Joon's transits, assuming Arthur entered before his death.

  Anyway, w/r/t this chapter, I'm super happy to see someone dealing with illusion magic in DnD as the game-breaking power that it is, and tying it strictly to the I/O channels for the brain. It reminds of imachination, and I was always really happy with how that turned out. Great chapter, great story.

    There is no reason why DM couldn't have had both Arthur and Joon captive and just released Arthur first. No reason why they had to go to Aerb in real-time.

      I guess it argues that the DM may be someone from the post-Arthur group (Including another version of Joon). I don't think Joon wrote down enough that a random person could replicate some of their plays.

      Of course with a mind reader who controls space and time it might just be "the last and first mind" simulating Joon at the end of the universe. Who knows.
      ```

  - u/DRMacIver:
    ```
    I'm not sure if the timeline actually works for this (I don't think the story so far contradicts it, but I haven't carefully fact-checked) but I'm currently wondering if a lot of the events that happened after Arthur's death in the real world happened on Aerb during the period where Arthur was active. It requires shenanigans with the passage of time, but we already know that those happened given the much longer time gap on Aerb than on Earth.

    If so, a lot of the nonstop shit that Arthur had to deal with was drawn from Joon's campaigns during his self-destructive period, and Joon is (unintentionally) responsible for a lot of Arthur's decline.

    Fel Seed could well have happened after the Lost King got, y'know, Lost.

    ```
    joon might be the DM since those notes are on his legal pad in his handwriting. meaning this all takes place in the future and he's playing with his younger self.

    this world is probably a simulation, meaning joon and arthur could just be simulated recreations of their earth minds and bodies. any reason to think this isn't happening thousands or billions of years post arthur's death?

    i guess...it just seems so unlikely for them to have been transported rather than copied. it already seems like the DM has the power to create people and modify their memories, goals, etc.
    ```

    - u/Wolpertinger:
      ```
      Remember, he wasn't even bodily transported or created - his old body had an identity that was just murdered by the DM and overwritten with Joon. Him being just a brainscan of Joon is pretty easily plausible - even if he was 'transported' it's probably still a copy kinda in the same sense as a Star Trek transporter actually making copies and just killing the original. To put someone's mind into another person you'd have to copy the first person's brain and place it on the second's. Then whether or not it's being 'teleported' or just 'copied' is if you decide to kill/delete the original copy afterwards.

  - u/WalterTFD:

    I think the DM is also God.  That is, Earth is no 'more' real than Aerb.  He runs both of them, and can time travel and reality alter at will.

- u/PathologicalFire:
  ```
  If 'Masters' is an illusion, making it an illusion of a creature that doesn't have much facial movement/strong reactions is quite clever, as it means you can neglect the finer points of that part of the illusion without raising suspicion. 

  Going another level of recursion down, you also have to not neglect it completely, so they'll not be suspicious at the fact you're improbably-perfect at controlling your reactions. I imagine the inexpertly-trained outnumber the experts, as with...well, most things.

  >The Athenaeum of Speculation and Scrutiny was one of the smaller athenaeums, which meant that it ‘only’ had a hundred thousand students, divided up into a handful of colleges. It was a hell of a lot of people even before you added in all the faculty and staff, all of them packed onto the tip of the mountain. 

  Do you think the colleges are all on the mountain, or spread out in different countries? If it's the first, that's a lot of power to give the kingdom that hosts each Athenaum, and would make it harder for farther flung nations to send people for training.

  The latter would make more sense, but would make each individual Athenaeum less impressive from a narrative standpoint.

  On another note, Joon staying behind alone to save Valencia is likely to skyrocket her loyalty even further, especially with how easily it rises for her. I'm guessing we'll see an example of loyalty level 30 soon.

    > If it's the first, that's a lot of power to give the kingdom that hosts each Athenaum, and would make it harder for farther flung nations to send people for training.

    This is alluded to in ch 37:

    > This was then backed up by the athenaeums wielding their power against the various polities of the empire when they tried to defect from ‘sensible’ intellectual property laws and/or certification schemes. Most of the athenaeums had scholarships and departments devoted to placement of their students, which meant that there was a carrot labeled ‘we’ll pay your young people to come here’ and a stick labeled ‘we won’t send you graduated mages’, but with a lather of diplomacy on top of that basic reality. On top of that, most of the athenaeums were filthy rich and nearly nations in their own right, which meant that they could (and did) use all of the standard tactics that corporations used on Earth, like pumping money into politics, having people write editorials complaining about a politician or policy, filing lawsuits, or doing other things like that.

    Essentially, travel (and in some cases, tuition) is often paid for by the athenaeums as a way of leveling the playing field and giving greater justification for why they should remain the primary places of learning for their particular field.

    The relationship between an athenaeum and a kingdom is often more like that of a giant factory and a small town; the factory is good for the town, but it's also got much more muscle than the town does, and their relationship can sometimes be a little on the abusive side ... if it's not just a case of the athenaeum being the one in direct control of the kingdom.

  I really, really liked these chapters. A couple of thoughts.

  We now have an in-story candle. Is it "worth the candle" for Uther to return?

  "a candle he said would light his way back to me"    "The candle has continued to burn, to no effect."   "There’s a decent chance that I’m still alive. If I am, I imagine that I’ll find you soon enough."

  Is Uther coming back now? Is he the 11/10 that Fenn felt but Joon didn't?

  _Hello?_ Hardsubs! Specially since they are talking about anime on VHS here; there was an entire VHS fansubbing scene back in the 90s, and it was all done in hardsubs because that was the only way to do it.

    Not for these chapters, but in early chapters, sometimes you say 'Fuchsia' and other times you say 'Fuschia'. The former is the correct spelling.

    As a bit of trivia, the colour is named after the fuchsia plant, which according to Wikipedia took its name from the 16th century German botanist Leonhart Fuchs. So it might have to be a coincidence that the same colour has the same name on Aerb.

  I think the mirror might have been how he was projecting his illusion into the room. Which means the theories that he man in the middled them and set a situation where joon would choose to heroically stay behind are wrong. There is a huge threat coming, its an 11, everyone is gone, joon is alone in the room, this is your final exam.

  I think Joon's behavior was extremely idiotic in 109. He was just too hostile and wary. He didn't consider first wat Masters even wanted - he only spoke to escape, not actually exchange information. On the other hand, despite all that wariness, he only thought about defeating/escaping the centuries-old extremely powerful wizard within his own exclusion zone, instead of, you know, negotiating his way out. And he didn't consider what this meeting - his first meeting with a person who personally knew Uther - means from the narrative point of view.
