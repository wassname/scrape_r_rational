## [Biweekly Challenge] Elves

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/53w0yx/biweekly_challenge_memory_modification/?sort=confidence) the prompt was "Memory Modification". The winner was /u/eniteris with their story, [We Have Always Been At War](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/53w0yx/biweekly_challenge_memory_modification/d7x2ufs). Go read it now! Congratulations to /u/eniteris on your third win!

##### This Time

This time the challenge will be **Elves**. [See the TVTropes page here](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreBetter), but as always the prompts are to inspire, not to limit, so pick whichever elves you'd like to do your own take on. Reading recommendations include *The Nightmare Stacks* by Charles Stross and *Lords and Ladies* by Terry Pratchett, but obviously the ur example of elves is *The Lord of the Rings* by J.R.R. Tolkien. If you're looking for things to rationalize, you might want to think about the eleven mindset, the types of societies that would form is people lived for hundreds of years, and cross-species politics. Or write about the Keebler elves, I don't know, I'm not your boss.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, October 19th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Next time, the challenge will be **Androids**. Here I'm using the term to mean "humaniform robots". [TVTropes has this page, which provides a good overview.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndroidsArePeopleToo) There are a couple of challenges if you want to make these rational, but mostly they have to do with aspects of world-building, which I think are sometimes skippable when writing rational works. This challenge topic is somewhat obviously prompted by the recent premiere of Westworld.

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 10/19.** Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread [is available here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/562tzl/challenge_companion_elves/).

    That's a very interesting take on Elves, I like it. Rather than adapt or build a civilization to lean on, they just become the ideal Elf with no dependencies on anything but themselves in the end.

      Just so. 

      Much credit goes to Nighzmarquls and many others as well as me on the /r/r discord server for hashing out the idea.

  This has an exceptionally unique depiction of the Elvish civilization and biology.
