    I've been cataloguing every short story every posted here as a post so I could make an anthology of sorts. Maybe "Snippets of a More Rational World"?

    It's not done, but once I think I've covered every short story ever written on /r/rational, I'll make a post asking about the legality of redistributing what others have posted here as a simple, free epub. Considering the writers in question are all commenters on this subreddit, I can be really sure by asking the authors.

      You mean the biweekly writing competition threads?

        No I record those separately, I mean when people directly post some story to the subreddit that they have written. You can see some of them if you look at the most upvoted posts.

      That's because the original site where [Nonlinear Regression](http://freetexthost.com/ikucx6nse4) was hosted doesn't have the story anymore, but if you go to the [Wayback Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20160908221217/http://freetexthost.com/ikucx6nse4), you can still read the story.

  I can't help you for a *full* list, but this subreddit has a [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index) featuring many of the stories here.
