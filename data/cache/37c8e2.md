## How to deal with writer's block?

### Post:

I was writing a rational fiction but the plot got inevitably derailed and I ran out of source material and now I'm having trouble catching any inspiration for anything new while I wait for more source material that may or may not eventually be created. I tried to write yugioh fanfiction, but I could never figure out how to make it  work to my satisfaction. Also, I don't know that much science. Every time I come up with a relatively vague idea and I can't figure out how I want to flesh it out, to the point where I can't even come up with a basic concept of the plot, just the vague and uncertain impression of collections of tropes battling it out in my head as my imagination searches through them for a fun and interesting story to no avail. Any advice?

Thanks!

  Just keep writing. In the process of writing, ideas will eventually come to you, and if you look at your words and see that they're crap, hopefully you'll get some understanding of *why* they're crap, and figure out a way to fix it.

  Writer's block doesn't have to mean staring at the keyboard doing nothing, and I personally think that's the wrong way to deal with the block.

  (If the problem is that you don't know enough about something, you can alternately spend your time doing research.)
