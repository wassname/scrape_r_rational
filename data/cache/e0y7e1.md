  A: "Man, I've got it, you ready to hear me dunk on Christians?"  
  B: "Go for it!"  
  A: "In my story, somebody makes a plague and kills thousands, millions!"  
  B: "Vile! People will be sad about all the dead people in the story."  
  A: "Yeah, but, like, get this, you ready?"  
  B: "Lay it on me."  
  A: "The main bad thing in the story is that he does all this mass murder because... he is a Christian!"  
  B: "Woah, so, like, the people reading will be like, wow, Christianity leads to virus slaughter."  
  A: "Right, like, the story is mostly about hating the main character for being religious and hateful, I am just using the massacre of thousands to draw horns on him.  
  B: "Love it, but, like, could he be more loathsome?"  
  A: "And so he hires a prostitute, but, like, she's also smarter than him about how plagues work!"  
  B: "haha, nice, so he's a hypocrite against his own codes, and also incompetent! He is smart enough to make a super plague but too dumb to know how they work!"  
  A: "Because of how he is a Christian and can't get laid!"  
  B: "Masterpiece."

    I agree with the summary but my take about the moral of the story is that the Christian bit is irrelevant, it's just there to set the scene for the real moral, which is: "Complex projects can easily fail due to missing something important, and you should consider the possible downsides of failure before embarking on them."

    Nah, babies getting aids from mother is a consideration someone working as prostitute may have in mind, so when talking about super aids that everyone have, babies may be one of the first things she would think of.

    As for him, he solved this problem 6 years before release, but on his high forgot that not warning everyone would lead to shitload of deaths before pattern is found. That and him being batshit insane.
