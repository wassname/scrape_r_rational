## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  There are a few special, magical locations in my world that operate on fairytale logic. There is other magic as well, but these locations do not seem to obey the same rules as other magic. The origins of the locations are shrouded in myth, and boil down to the gods trying to control human society and shape the flow of history. The locations are also powerful seals that limit magic in some ways globally, but the details there are not important. The destruction of these special locations are important plot points in my story, so I thought I'd explain how they work and see if anyone here can come up with a method for destroying them that is similar to what I came up with.

  There is a large dome, within which anyone who willingly, knowingly lies immediately turns to stone and dies. Humans use it for international politics, very important trials, important business dealings, etc. You can change your mind *after* saying something, but it has to be true when you say it. The dome was crafted for a civilization similar to ancient Athens, a fledgling democracy with aspirations of empire and world domination. Obviously a lot of wars have been fought for control over the location.

  There is a large floating platform at the end of a rainbow bridge where any oath you 'willingly' utter binds you for eternity, similar to a HPMOR style unbreakable vow. You can't be mind controlled into swearing an oath, but you can be tortured/threatened/tricked into swearing, and it's still binding. Intent matters. The location was crafted for a civilization that believed that almost everything in life was outside of human control and subject to the whims of destiny, and that the only way to really take control of your life was to swear oaths on the things that are most important to who you are.

  A valley where emotions (Especially love and hate) are magnified to the extreme, to the point where it's basically impossible to hide your feelings. It won't make you murder that guy who cut in front of you in the store yesterday, but you'll have to practice quite a lot to not glare when you see him. It was crafted for a civilization that had historically had problems with nobles who schemed and manipulated each other horribly and who made a point of not showing emotions.

  A hall of mirrors that shows potential futures for whoever looks into the mirrors. The mirrors assume that you will not die anytime soon, so a child dying from brain cancer will still see distant future events like different career choices. The mirrors do take impending geopolitical events into consideration. If there's a famine coming, your reflection is not likely to be fat. You can't send information back in time with the mirrors, they just elucidate what sort of personality and life you are likely to end up with, with some vague intuition about what paths in life will take you there, and what current you would think of future you. The hall was crafted for a small religious cult that thought the gods were manipulating important world events and who sought to become a 'second foundation' style guide to humanity. Why would the gods give them this tool? Because gods scheme against each other too and plot reasons, that's why.

  And finally, a large garden where wounds heal quickly, plants grow big and strong, and people bodily and mentally shine with the things that they love, and depressed and suicidal people turn to ash and die. It was crafted by a sorta-honorary-god fairy queen who wanted to make one human civilization more like the fey.

  Over the course of my world's history, in each of these locations a human does something that so violates the intent and 'essence' of the location that it breaks and its magic dies. I would be interested in hearing what sorts of ideas you can think of that might qualify. If you want an example, the valley is the first to break, and it breaks because someone >!murders the person they love inside the valley.!<

    This seems... extremely open ended, and not quite up to the spirit of rational, but whatever, it seems to be an interesting puzzle.

    First one: Using it as a source of high quality statues? I mean, human life has had such a low value over history that having a permanent reminder of the general you defeated in battle would be pretty cool. That would probably pretty violently violate the intent of the place. If it needs a bit more violation of "empire and world domination", protesters with nothing left to lose talking about the ideals of whatever empire ruined them.

    Or making someone insane enough that they can answer any question with any answer, get that orwellian lesson on.

    As for the oath platform, it's all about taking control of your destiny, so pledging to follow the gods, or pledging to follow something random, or pledging to do something trivial, or a pacifist pledging to murder every last man woman and child, could all potentially work to break the platform, depending on the details.

    The mirrors are hard to misuse, unless you use them for omnicidal aims? 

    As for the garden, figure out a way to make goblins? Those are often held as the "fallen" fey, though something like dwarves would really be the opposite of the fey. Otherwise, using it to become warped and twisted?

      It is indeed open ended. It's not about finding the one true answer, I'm just trying to gauge what people think of when first introduced to the idea of destroying them. Obviously in my story the locations are introduced gradually, and the characters learn about the people that have used them and the forces that created them. 

      I've had comments before in the Saturday thread discussing how to *use* some of the locations, but I wanted to do one on destroying them.

      The violations don't necessarily have to be on purpose. For the valley, >!the guy doing the murdering is manipulated into falling in love with one person and grow to hate another as a bitter enemy, only to find out they are the same person during their final showdown.!<

    Truth Dome: assuming an essence of Honesty & Ambition. Host a big festival where everyone does hallucinogens and rambles about things that are patently untrue except to the speaker, while laying about indolently.

    Oath Platform: assuming an essence of Self-Determination and Integrity. Force people to swear to making any decision according to the flip of a coin or equivalent, or to swear obedience to anyone/everyone.

    Future Hall: assuming an essence of Control & Knowledge. Make someone Oath themselves to not allow their future to end as the Future Hall predicts, then have them view it.

    Betterment Garden: assuming an essence of Self-Improvement & Progress. Introduce as many invasive species as possible to create a self-destructive environment.

      > Force people to swear to making any decision according to the flip of a coin or equivalent

      Not bad. A character in my world trying to break it on purpose might try that, since it completely perverts the part about taking control over your life. Forced loyalty is something it's commonly used for, and that's not an issue, but the coin flip is not something anyone has tried.
      ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    Truth dome: GÃ¶del it. Have someone expendable say "I am telling a lie". 

    Oath platform: there must be some magic verifying the oaths, so maybe swear some sort of encryption oath - vow to solve something with certain parameters, then provide a solution that's arbitrarily difficult to verify so all the magic is expended on figuring out if you upheld your vow or not. Probably any civilization with both a theory of computation, access to this platform, and a supply of expendable oath-swearers is going to end up doing this though. 

    Emotion valley: put a p-zombie in there. The valley will go nuts trying to push its emotions around. 

    Hall of mirrors: parade some gamblers through it? Or maybe station some guards and kill everyone who exits the place. 

    Healing garden: engineer some magical hyper-cancer-ebola thing; the garden's powers will keep it alive while it kills everything else.

    What happens if you double-think in the truth dome? People can believe two contradictory statements at the same time. Everything would be truth to you, because any fact can be derived from a contradiction. Teach everyone who enters the truth dome the art of double-think and render its lie-detection capabilities meaningless.

    What happens if you willingly utter an oath to break your oath? Will the oath bind you to be unbound by the oath, turning the magic of the platform against itself?

    What if you take over your country and force everyone in every career to wear the exact same uniform? Would the mirrors be rendered utterly useless, since everyone would only see reflections of themselves in said uniforms regardless of their future careers?

    What if you send someone infected with parasitic plants into the garden? Their wounds would heal quickly, but the plant parasites on them would also grow big and strong, giving them more wounds?
    ```

    - u/Rhamni:
      ```
      > What happens if you double-think in the truth dome?

      If you think what you are saying is true the petrification won't trigger, but if you slip up and realize that you are saying something untrue even for a moment while talking you're gone. Trying to trick the lie detection won't break the place, but it's certainly something a lot of characters try to do. Messing with a person's memories before they go there is standard operating procedure for some factions.

      Someone taking an oath to be unbound by the oath is not how it goes down in my world, but it could plausibly work given the information provided, and someone in my world trying to break the place on purpose might try it.

      Wearing the same uniform wouldn't affect the mirrors. They do provide visual cues, but also a kind of magical intuition. Different images would still feel different.

      Lol. Poor plant infested prisoner. The garden wouldn't care, but the victim probably wouldn't enjoy the experience. Though, while plants do grow faster, it's not so fast you would see them grow with the naked eye.

    So, certain things about the action we take to break the location must be true for it to work. The first thing is that it violates the intent of the location thoroughly. The second, less obvious thing, is that it must not have been done before. Otherwise, the location would already be destroyed. This means the action must be either difficult, or be not very obvious - an obvious example is that I would be extremely surprised if there was no person angry at how a debate went inside the dome that tried to break it by saying something like "This statement is false". With that in mind, some ideas.

    The dome is meant for negotiation, presumably. It is suppose to allow truth to dominate, while punishing severely anyone who does not abide by those rules, in a twisted form of 'justice'. I would say the core theme here is, rather than truth, justice. After all, memory wiping is a common precaution, so saying something obviously false while believing it doesn't break the area, even if it is done a lot. I think that a better way to break the dome would be, rather than trying to get around the effect, to use the effect for a purpose that completely goes against justice and negotiation. If it were to be used as a form of execution might be a good start, but that is tied with the idea of law already. Instead, using it to murder someone might be interesting. Force someone to lie with the threat of torture. No negotiation, just pressure. No justice, no chance to talk their way out, just using the system of justice instated to perform an unjust deed. And if that isn't enough? Perhaps getting away with it, within or outside, would be.

    The bridge is about binding to a fate to escape the whims of the original fate, rather than escaping randomness. True randomness is very hard to come by, of course, with a lot of things that seem random being generated by things that can be predicted. The fundamental aspect is taking control of your own life. So losing control of your life sounds like a good way to break the intent. Now, obviously the idea isn't good enough on its own, if you can be pressured into it. You can't be mind controlled though, it has to be a decision you make yourself. So what is a way to leave the decision in the hands of something else in a more meaningful way than being forced, or flipping a coin? I would say that forcing yourself to make an oath that you don't know your making could be a good candidate. Swear an oath to follow the oath of the next person who makes one. You, of your own volition, have given up your own volition in a way you don't know, and won't know until it happens. You have abused the methodology to go against the intent.

    The mirrors are tricky, since the essence of them isn't really a value that can be considered a proper value as far as I can see. They were made for the purpose of allowing plucky humans to mess up the plans of Gods - but Gods were the ones that made the mirrors, so that's hard to abuse. The only thing I can think of to use the mirrors for the express purpose of not using the mirrors, since the value seems to be the in the use itself, rather than as a means to an end. It's sort of like trying to violate the spirit of something that makes money so that you can have money, instead of something that makes money so you can be powerful, or rich, or have lot's of friends. One way you could violate that sort of money-making contraption would be to use the money for the express purpose of not using the money. Slightly contradictory. You could use the money to devalue the money by flooding the economy - that might be a good way to violate the purpose, as you take a tool only you can use and use it only to make things worse. Let's transcribe that onto the mirror hall. Find some way to make the mirrors your's, and your's only. To make them only useful to your goals, such that their loss would only harm you, rather than help you. If you wanted to destroy the mirrors, you would have to do this through someone who didn't. Then, with your dominance, take the future vision provided and use it to break them. Or, alternatively, don't use them at all. The mirrors are really quite tricky, but maintaining dominance only to not use it might work.

    Finally, the garden. Fundamentally, about using growth to improve yourself for the purpose of your passions. Plants 'want' to grow big and strong, humans want to live (except if they are suicidal, in which case they want to die and thus do so). Humans want to do their passions, and so they come to glow with them in the garden. It is about fulfilling values, if I read it correctly. So the way to violate the garden would be to use the improvement as a way to stop your love for things, to block off goals you want to reach and passions you want to indulge in. Lock yourself in the garden so that you can't escape, even though you really want to, so that all the growth does is make your heart weep that you can't use it. Essentially, use the garden as a means to prevent yourself fulfilling your values. Or get someone else to do it, since you want it destroyed in the first place.

    Interesting thought exercise!

        What if you sent someone into the garden who is very depressed about living and very happy to die? The moment the person starts turning into ashes he would become extremely happy about it and no longer depressed, making the ash effect stop and making his wounds heal. But then since he's healed and continues to live he'll become depressed again and the ash effect will activate again. But then he'll be happy that he's dying now and stop being depressed in an endless cycle...

    I see the very existence of these locations as contributing directly to the destruction of all four. Holding control over these locations would provide incredible strategic advantage and I don't see them being easily available to the general public for long. I foresee a totalitarian rising in power attempting to claim all of these sites and using their powers exclusively to further their own goals.  


    An upcoming tyrant may see the subversion of the world's sacred spaces in the hall of mirrors and immediately move to seize control of the area before anybody sees what is coming. A protagonist may have seen this before the army invades and had the options of attempting to warn others and die defending the mirror hall, or run and escape to possibly save the world.

    The oath platform is the next area I would have targeted by the tyrant. It's value wouldn't be as obvious to more ethical powers, but when captured soldiers are taken to the platform for mass conversion under torture the threat would become apparent. This grand use of the take-control-of-your-life platform to rob people of control could be viewed as a subversion of intent, but from a writing standpoint I'd almost want to let them use it because ANYONE captured by them and released could be a double agent who cannot willingly reveal themselves. Likely the only way to identify spies would be to the truth dome and watch them turn to stone as their oath compels them to willingly lie... 

    How you interpret "willingly" in this case could vary. If they are magically compelled to lie by an oath they swore to escape torture, how willing is it? If their oath means that they are unable to reveal themselves then maybe the oath-slaves of the totalitarian state can lie in the dome with immunity and thus subvert the purpose of the dome. 

    Ultimately, the only reliable way to identify oath-slaves is to require all public officials to pass through the fey garden and those who have been forced to betray their friends turn to dust on entry. The pragmatic use of the garden by the enemies of the totalitarian state may be a subversion of its intent and eventually cause it to break.

  Someone finds a genie and thoughtlessly wishes for all the money in the world. The genie fulfills this literally: every single piece of money is immediately transferred to his possession. A massive cavern is magically created under his lawn to store all physical currency. All records and memories of any financial debts he owes are magically erased. At every bank, all accounts are merged into one under his name. Bank cards do not get teleported, but no longer connect to any account. On the other hand, valuable items that aren't actually money, like gold bars, art pieces, company stocks, etc. are not affected.

  How would you respond to this crisis if you are the leader of a powerful country?

    Repudiate all former currency, reboot the economy. This is, basically, a jubilee. The wisher is now in possession of.. a lot of paper. And a lot of metal. About the only way for the wisher to actually benefit at all is to become a scrap metal merchant. This will likely be less disruptive than you would think - Rebooting monetary systems has been necessary before, and while disruptive, it does not end capitalism or anything.

    I was just thinking that the removal of all digital accounts would be a nightmare, backups are at best digital but air gapped now, but if the magic didn't change processing histories they should be able to reverse engineer people's accounts. If it wiped all that too it's a mess where only big companies and the mega rich people can force accounts to be recreated and credited to them. Also only everyone's positive accounts are lost: all the debt records remain.

  I have a group of superpowered individuals who needs a spaceship capable of reaching the outer solar system in a sane amount of time. I'm wondering if they can build, operate, and maintain a viable vehicle, relying on their abilities, and if so, what details I'd need to be particularly aware of. The precise limits of the powers are somewhat changeable, so long as this wouldn't break anything else about the setting or story.

  There are effectively 10 powers involved, though none were designed with this in mind, so not all are going to be equally useful.

  * The one that seems most relevant, fwict, is the guy who functions something like a portal to another universe. I've put more thought into the rules and physics recently, but there's still gigatons of handwaving involved (something something exotic matter hidden in higher dimentions something mumble). The important part is that he has effective telekinesis within the hidden throat of the sorta-kinda wormhole, and this extends a short distance beyond either end, with much more effect on the exoverse side. He can adjust the size and orientation of the connection, to a limited extent - the Earth side radius maxes out around 1m, and the exoverse side takes doing to move away from the star it ... orbits? My idea is to direct matter / energy from the star through the connection, and use that to propel the ship. Ideally, with him anchored to it rather than pushing, and him somehow not being melted or flattened. I assume that the momentum of the exhaust won't do anything to push him or the wormhole, so some kind of rocket would have to be built around him. While I can imagine this working so that he's being pulled by the rocket, and his powers protect him from direct backsplash from the exhaust, the part of the rocket he's anchored to would probably get impossibly hot rather quickly, and while he *can* store coolant, etc in the exoverse, he can't access it and provide thrust at the same time. Also, his air supply is probably limited to a volume similar to that of the wormhole, and I have no idea if he would experience any time dilation while doing this.
  * Someone has something like tactile telekinesis, only affecting metals. I say "something like", because the effect is more one that falls off with distance from her body, probably with the inverse square but that's not set in stone. For this reason, it seems like using as much metal as possible in the ship's construction would be good, because she can fix or modify those components on demand, and can provide additional structural support to some degree. I should note that the range limit is for activating the effect, not for how much of the metal she can manipulate once touching it. I'm not sure how much force, what size metal objects, or how different metals vary. Ideally, she'd be as close as reasonably possible to the part she's affecting.
  * A power I'd sum up as Alchemy. This character can basically do whatever to most chemical bonds in range. Range is similar to the metalkine, but the increased efficiency means that, in practice, the effective range is larger. I don't want it to be too large, but it can be changed if need be. I'm imagining something like 10cm from her body, but this is hard enough to use in combat that it might stretch a bit farther. I mostly see her acting as an extra air-scrubber, but I've probably missed something significant. And no, she's not efficient enough to provide infinite energy by repeatedly burning / unburning things. She mostly only does that when the burning part is immediately necessary.
  * Plain telekinesis, not anything like as dexterous as would be necessary to compete with the other powers in their domains. I don't like the idea of this character flying around like Jean Grey, but I also concluded they can probably exert about 1.5g on 1000kg, so no reason they can't fly willy nilly. Those numbers are, though, changeable. My current best estimate for the mass of this ship is 30000kg, which is probably on the low side. Their range is more like a few metersâI'm not sure how manyâand I tend to imagine the effect generating a small amount of light. And the more I think about it, the less I like that maximum force. They shouldn't suffer any side-effects from using their power on otherwise dangerous materials. How effective they are through barriers is unclear; I'm currently thinking that extending through a barrier requires that they physically touch the barrier.
  * Someone who can absorb / emit light. They have a weird issue where they can't easily emit higher frequencies than orange-ish. Might be able to handle infrared and radio, and can absorb more than they can emit. I see these powers being mostly useless for ship-related things.
  * Power over sound. Potential secondary power to convert between sound and radio, because of in-universe backstory which this comment is too narrow to contain. Other than muting people being annoying, I'm not sure how helpful this would be without the radio part. I should note that the sound manipulation applies mostly to air more than through solids; it's something like a very specialized form of aerokinesis. If he does get the radio thing, I could see some value in converting engine noise into radio if the energy involved is high enough to be useful, but I'm not sure if that would be the case. This did make me like the idea that they'd want an ion drive as a backup, or for maneuvers that don't require firing the main engine. Not sure how difficult that would be.
  * There is another person with a connection to an exostar, but without the skills in using this that the first guy has, and probably not capable of safely using it this way. Included for completeness.
  * The remaining 3 are more nebulous. The least defined is probably the most limited, but for these purposes, we can treat that one as a combination healer / monitor / effecacy booster to the others. The other two are somewhat like the two wormholers: one far more capable than the other. The former being able to basically generate / control fire / plasma, and to a lesser extent electricity. The energy for this, and fuel for the flames etc, comes from mumblemumble magic exotic matter in his skin. I bring that up only because it has generally been self-replicating when certain currents or forces are applied, "metabolizing" whatever it can. This is not an issue under most conditions, but that can't be said for aboard a spacecraft. While he *can* probably generate enough energy on what's available to power a much weaker rocket, that would probably be an agregiously\[sicc\] inefficient use of this ability. He has demonstrated the ability to do something that looks sorta-kinda like tk via EM shenanigans, and there are a few other possible exploits due to the nature of the stuff, but the limitations are too nebulous to do anything with.

  I have no idea how viable a custom spacecraft with this crew would be. It seems like there are probably tons of wholes in it that I'm not sufficiently informed to have identified. Obviously, throwing together several tons of sheet-metal and strapping wormhole guy to the inside of a rocket chamber isn't going to cut it. And I'm not sure what velocity the propellant could/would have. This entire concept might be unworkable, and I'd need to find a more conventional way to make this trip happen.

  Ideas / criticisms welcome.

  One more thing: the exoverses can be used to store things for later use. When not being actively accessed, they catch only high energy particles and photons, and let through whatever's on the other side. I'm undecided on whether this requires equivalent energies, or if there's a scaler (put in x, get out kx), or if actively moving things just draws on the same energy supply as the tk. We can assume the wormholes have no or insignificant gravitational effects under most conditions.
