## The Two Year Emperor book 2?

### Post:

So I finished reading book 1 of  The Two Year Emperor, [available for free as the author promised here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3xe9fn/ffrt_the_two_year_emperor_is_back_and_free/)

u/eaglejarl also mentioned in that thread that book 2 would be released after polishing, anyone know where I can grab that? The link to the draft he provided is dead now.

    I thought this was the link to the second book and got really excited for a brief moment

  It was for sale at some point, I don't know where / if it can be purchased these days.

  Just FYI, it has a very different tone than book 1.

  I'm flattered you're interested.

  No polishing was ever done, I fear; never got to the top of the projects list. I do have a few new books since then, however. :> The latest one is "The Patchwork Realms: Arrival"; it's still in progress, with 8 chapters available [on RoyalRoad](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30636/the-patchwork-realms-arrival/chapter/464681/chapter-1-arrival) and a ninth sitting on my hard drive, hopefully to be finished today.
