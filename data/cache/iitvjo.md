## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You are Superman. 
  You can exert a maximum of 10^21 joules of energy.
  Your heat vision is as hot as the surface of the Sun (5778 K) and can be applied in an area evenly of a square kilometer. 
  Your ice breath can freeze a square kilometer of ocean water ten meters deep. This ice breath can also blow at hurricane speeds of 150 mph.
  His speed: Anything up to 99% the speed of light.

  Task: Stop a Category 5 hurricane. Similarly stop a F5 tornado.

  It’s often been told in fiction that Superman can stop hurricanes and/or tornado. But how exactly would he accomplish this without causing harm to humans or sea life? Would he just cool the ocean water? If so wouldn’t there be a huge release of heat that would come out as a giant explosion? It wasn’t until I saw the size of Hurricane Laura and hurricanes in general that I realized Superman’s efforts could easily result in thousands dying.

  Is there a way he could do this without causing harm to humans or, at the very least, causing minimal harm? Could be just fly in the opposite direction?

  Scenario 1: The cat5 hurricane is in the middle of the ocean. Similarly the F5 tornado is in the plains miles outside of the nearest town.

  Scenario 2: The hurricane is right next to the Gulf of Mexico and or near Florida (within twenty kilometers). The tornado is approaching over a town.

  Thanks for taking the time to answer.

    So some quick googling gives a hurricane's energy as 6.0 x 10\^14 Watts or 5.2 x 10\^19 Joules/day.  You didn't give a time interval for the 10\^21 joules number, but I assume that is within a single usage of heat vision/ice breath.  So Superman easily has the power output to match a hurricane.  Does the ice breath cheat thermodynamics a bit by generating cold without just transferring around heat, or otherwise transferring heat so thoroughly it doesn't matter (to another dimension, across a several light year volume, or something along those lines)?  If so, I think he has this.  Flying at relativistic speeds against the hurricane might be dumping more energy into the system overall, even if it disrupts the hurricane but he has his ice breath to get rid of excess energy.  I think the procedure would be something like, cool the ocean water just right, enough to slow the growth of the hurricane but not enough to cause ecological harm then fly against the hurricane at relativistic speeds, ice breathing the air that gets super-heated by his passing to counteract the waste heat. This can handle Scenario 1 hurricane okay.  

    For scenario 2... I think you need to calculate what hypersonic booms look like in terms of damage and what the microclimate of ice breath usage in the middle of a hurricane looks like, which is a lot messier.
    ```

    - u/DrMaridelMolotov:
      ```
      Thanks for the answer. I was going to make it as hard science as possible by saying that the ice cold breath would release heat as a by product and thus cause an explosion if used too quickly, but I suppose then. there’d be no point for it then.

      I suppose then the best answer would be cooling the hurricane and/or punching the clouds that make up the storm. The 2nd scenario would probably result in some people dead though if he tried punching the clouds away.

        Someone else suggested Superman’s frost breath works by absorbing the heat into himself.  If you went with this case, it would limit Superman’s frost breath once he had absorbed too much heat and he would have to dissipate it somehow (heat vision maybe?).
        ```

        - u/DrMaridelMolotov:
          ```
          Yeah that could work. He could dump the waste heat in space through his heat vision. Thanks!

    Depends on the specifics of how his super speed works. Because some laws of physics must be bent in order for super speed to not do things like create nuclear fusion reactions with the air or destroying the planet with massive kinetic energy input.

    "Canonically", for some definition of canon in the giant mess of comics with continuity issues everywhere, relativity seems to apply, since superman can move so fast that he can travel back in time. This would be the simplest, safest solution for stopping a hurricane since he can go the time before the hurricane starts, then ice breath/heat ray things until the conditions for hurricane formation are destroyed.

    With a 99% light speed cap, that option presumably goes out the window. So the next option to try is super strength. Superman somehow, always applies exactly the right amount of strength. He never accidentally pulps a robber when he beats them. He never hurts Lois when he catches her in midair or flies around with her.

    That implies that he has (1) incredibly precise control over the amount of force he exerts, (2) amazing calculation and observation abilities to let him compute exactly how much force he should apply, (3) incredibly quick mental thinking since he can react to changes and recalculate in no time.

    Putting these together, he could use his super speed and strength to apply precisely enough force to stop every air molecule dead, effectively stopping the hurricane.
    ```

    - u/DrMaridelMolotov:
      ```
      But wouldn’t that result in vast destruction, potentially the destruction of Earth? If he stopped all the molecules in the air that quickly by meeting each one with the force required I think the movement alone might affect the rotation of the Earth bc he’d be moving at relativistic speed. I’m not sure though if that’s correct. I’m trying to go for as hard physics as possible.
      ```

      - u/scruiser:
        ```
        Googling rotation kinetic energy of Earth, I can see the number is 2.138*10^29 joules.  Even in the absolute worse case, in which every joule of the hurricanes energy was moving with Earth rotation and every joule of the hurricanes’ energy Superman stops pushed against the Earth the energy output of a hurricane over an entire day is only in the order 10^19 joules (as I mention in another post).  This means 10^10 (10 billion) times more energy in the Earth rotation than in a hurricanes’ daily energy.  If Superman stopped 100 hurricanes in the absolute worse way for the Earth rotational energy, this would still only be 1 millionth (.0001% of the Earth rotational energy). 

        Except that is the worse case.  In a more reasonable case, hurricanes move in different directions around the globe (so overall it might cancel out) and a lot of their energy is in temperature difference so only a small percent of the energy being stopped would actually affect the Earth’s rotation.

        So tldr; the energy is negligible compared to the momentum of the Earth.
        ```

      - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
        ```
        Well yes. That's why I said this:

        >Because some laws of physics must be bent in order for super speed to not do things like create nuclear fusion reactions with the air or destroying the planet with massive kinetic energy input. 

        You can't have hard physics + super speed in an atmosphere + no vast destruction. Just can't.

        Affecting the Earth's rotation is one more small problem on the giant pile of NO.
        ```

        - u/DrMaridelMolotov:
          ```
          Yeah I guess using super speed is out then. I’m gonna try out the idea someone else suggested of the ice breath being a result of him literally sucking the energy out sf something and then dumping it out as waste heat through his heat vision. Thanks for the idea though. I’ll be sure to use it.
          ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    After thinking about it, a cool explanation for Superman's freeze breath would be him taking energy out of a system and storing it inside himself.  If his body was always doing that autonomically, it might explain his powers better than sunlight.
    ```

    - u/scruiser:
      ```
      It would still generate huge amounts of waste heat. Unless the energy transfer completely breaks thermodynamics... well Superman does that anyway so that explanation isn’t any worse as a unifying explanation than the tactile telekinesis explanation.

      One unifying explanation for the frost breath had Superman’s tactile telekinesis extending within his lungs to the atomic level such that he could remove all the kinetic energy from the air in his lungs while simultaneously compressing the air then when he released it, the high pressure near absolute zero air would rapidly decompress further cooling the environment around it.  

      But the scale of effect described in the original post is beyond the tactile telekinesis explanation, I don’t think the air could be compressed enough without even more exotic physics effects beyond molecular level tactile telekinesis.
      ```

      - u/DrMaridelMolotov:
        ```
        If the air he’s blowing is near absolute zero then when he’s blowing it out into relatively warm air wouldn’t that cause a huge explosion like when cool water meets a lit light bulb but much worse?
        ```

        - u/scruiser:
          ```
          With the light bulb exploding, isn’t that from the glass rapidly cooling and thus contracting causing it to explode?  With the frost breath, I’m not actually sure how the thermodynamics would work out.  PV=NRT would make me think that if the frost breath started at high pressure and low temperature then it expanding out would keep it at low temperature as it mixed with the regular air, but the conditions are extreme enough I don’t know if PV=NRT would accurately describe them over the short term.  Averaged out and given enough time, it means the frost breath would mix with and cool the surrounding air, but in the short term it might cause explosions as you said or maybe more like implosions as the frost breath mixed with the regular air and rapidly cools it.
          ```

    - u/DrMaridelMolotov:
      ```
      That could work I suppose. But if he’s absorbing the energy of the hurricane would he be sucking in the heat instead of blowing out cold air?

  Munchkinry to counter negative incentives!

  You can get any "street-level" (try to be reasonable with this constraint) power previously described on a Saturday Munchkinry thread or Wednesday World building thread but in return other people in the world will randomly also get this power.  The random selection of people that get this power will be biased/weighted towards "petty assholes".  The people that get this power will be more powerful/skillful (shorter cooldowns, longer usage periods, more precise usage) by a small but consistent amount if they are "petty assholes".  The powers will be partially genetically inheritable (say a 1/3 chance for each offspring that they inherit the powers if one or both of their parents have powers), but will increase in inheritably (up to 3/4) chance if people intentionally practice dehumanizing eugenics (let's say minimum level of dehumanizing is marrying people according to an algorithm with no allowance for love/romance or stopping marriages for love).  The powers will be slightly more industrially utilizable if the industry utilizing them has large negative externalities (pollution, cultural erasure, dehumanization, etc.).

  By petty assholes this includes a combination of:

  * tendency to be rude (even when it is not beneficial or useful)
  * tendency to be selfish
  * low empathy towards others
  * believing themselves to be innately superior/better/smarter than others
  * tendency to vote in ways that are more harmful in a utilitarian sense
  * tendency to incentive other people into being petty assholes
  * tendency to maximize and hoard their own wealth, especially when unproductive towards society as a whole

  Note that by tendency, this refers to it being part of their basic personality, and not something they are doing just to get more power (although if they work at it long enough they can change their personality enough to fit).

  So what power would you chose that would still make the world a better place?  

  Or what power would you chose anyway?

  Or are you going to dig out some obscure thread in which someone described powers tied to morality in a positive way to counter the whole point of this thought exercise.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    This is actually surprisingly hard, because a lot of the powers that you would want to give people that would, in theory, benefit everyone, will naturally tend to concentrate power in the hands of the petty assholes. An ability like allowing them to open up a portal to a world that's basically like Earth but with no people in it would give us vast amounts of resources ... but you'd be making a lot of petty assholes very rich, which would result in them gaining power, which would result in them *using* that power, which might make it a wash. (Note: I know that's (probably) not a street level power.)

    I would have to dig to find if it was *actually* a topic of one of those threads, but if petty assholes are the problem, then an empathic superpower would probably be a good one, because it would encourage the petty assholes not to be assholes, and help them see things from the point of view of others. Telepathy or mind reading would be worse options, because of the potential for abuse and/or negative feedback that would reinforce behavior.

    The second big option is a power with a lot of positive externalities, such as being fueled by global pollution, waste plastic, nuclear waste, or something like that. Again, not sure that it's ever come up in one of these threads, but there are probably other positive externalities that plausibly were. They would still be petty assholes, but their incentives would be such that they would end up helping the world anyway.

    Finally, I think there's an argument to be made for helpful service powers, like healing. Yes, the petty assholes would charge for it, but if they were able to cure currently incurable diseases, or if they were bad at coordination, or if their prices ended up being a lot lower than existing medical technology. In part, whether this ends up good or not depends on how many petty assholes we're talking about, and I would posit that the more, the better, since that means they each have less individual power. Generating materials and/or food is also usually street level, and could work similarly to help alleviate poverty.

    Oh, and you could also pick something like "transported to another world", but that's likely outside the bounds of street level. It would get rid of all the petty assholes, *and* I would get to go to a fantasy world. Win-win.

    I guess this one: [https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a8lgsu/d\_saturday\_munchkinry\_thread/ecbry7v/](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a8lgsu/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ecbry7v/)

    I would classify this as street-level since it isn't going to let you take over a country or anything. It doesn't even help you much in combat. All it does is give you a lot more time to think about things, and make investigating murders easy.

    I suppose it also gives incentives making corpses, but anyone with a brain would realize animal corpses are far better in every way.

    Overall, even if the power mostly goes to petty assholes, I expect crime levels to drop just because its now so much easier to solve murders.

    (And personally, I would be abusing the heck out of the time freezing part. I have a lot of thinking that needs to be done and pathetically tiny amounts of time to do it.)

      I would be worried about a power disproportionately belonging to petty assholes being used heavily by law enforcement.  As for reducing crime... Serial killers and premeditated murders might be able to figure out how to work around it, and a lot of other crime isn’t driven by a careful weighing of risks and punishments.

        > I would be worried about a power disproportionately belonging to petty assholes being used heavily by law enforcement.  

        Why? What could a petty asshole law enforcer do with this power that he couldn't without? I suppose it makes it easier for corrupted cops to blackmail culprits or suspects to pay up or be arrested, but they can and probably do already do that anyway.

        Also the power by itself hopefully wouldn't be enough for a conviction, because it would just be another witness testimony, and witnesses can be mistaken (or lie). 

        >As for reducing crime... Serial killers and premeditated murders might be able to figure out how to work around it, and a lot of other crime isn’t driven by a careful weighing of risks and punishments. 

        Still makes it harder to commit murder, makes it less fun for the serial killers, makes it harder for the impulsive murders to cover it up after the fact, etc. (It even lets spiteful victims kill themselves to reveal the criminals with their corpse.)

    most of the powers you could give them would be tempered with capitalism. If the Petty Assholes are selfish and wish to maximize their wealth, they will naturally use their powers to do something people want to pay for, which is usually beneficial for the people.

  In 5 minutes, you'll be permanently transplanted into a parallel universe almost identical to this one... except for the fact that in that reality, yourself, and everyone in your extended family, never existed (e.g. your grandparents never met).

  You're still in the same city. It's probably not very different from the city you know, since your family probably wasn't super influential. If you had friends, they probably still exist although their life and personality might have taken a different course since they never knew you. Your house would probably be occupied by some other family, your neighbors may or may not be the same.

  Basically, you've been completely erased from this timeline with everything that entails. You won't exist in any ID database - you're effectively a non-person.

  You appear safely in approximately the same geographical location you are currently. You bring nothing with you except your current clothes. 

  How would you attempt to survive and bootstrap your life from scratch again?

    Well, first things first, let's get some money. Walk around looking for Help Wanted signs in diners/restaurants/cafes/shops, explain to the managers that you were recently robbed of everything including ID and need enough cash to feed yourself while you sort out your affairs. 

    Unfortunately your best bet is to sleep in a homeless shelter or just rough it for the first few weeks while you save up enough to rent a shitty apartment. If you're in an expensive area, work til you have bus fare and head somewhere cheap. 

    It's not a very sexy answer, but honestly you'd just have to work at whatever under-the-table jobs you can find until you have enough money for good fake documentation. Once you have enough cash to buy a laptop you can start doing some research on how to buy a dead person's identity, which is probably the only way for you to get established in i.e. social security databases (which is required if you ever want any sort of high-paying job). 

    Theoretically I guess you *could* show up at the DMV or wherever and say "I was raised in a cult and never got a birth certificate or SSN." If Tara Westover did it, you can too, though it'll be tougher for you since you won't be able to furnish any verifiable information about where you were raised.

    EDIT: I forgot to ask, how far back does the family-erasure go? Because all living humans are the descendants of [Mitochondrial Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_Eve) and [Y-chromosomal Adam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-chromosomal_Adam), if it extends back to them, then all humans in your new universe might look very different from you. That poses a whole new set of issues.

      Great answer. I was going with 3 generations, so your grandparents still exist but never got together. Your parents, uncles and siblings won't exist. 

      Would your answer change if you had prep time? Say a week instead of 5 minutes, so you have time to travel and research in your original universe beforehand.

        Thanks! Got it, I see what you meant in your post now. OK, so we don't have to worry about walking around with a totally unknown phenotype, that's good. 

        I assume the only prep that will survive the shift is info you keep in your head, right? So you can't i.e. leave a lockbox buried in the woods with a bunch of cash and the best fake IDs you can find with a week's notice? If stuff like this counts, then there's a lot you can do to help out future-you. 

        Assuming the only things that stick around are your memories and the clothes on your back, then say goodbye to your loved ones and buy the best multipurpose set of clothes you can find. If you can i.e. make a shirt out of $100 bills, do that; then wear a big warm jacket that can double as a sleeping bag/blanket, plus the pocketiest cargo pants you can find (preferably the kind that zip off into shorts if it's going to be warm when you shift). 

        After that it's pretty much going to be the same deal. Transporting money with you will let you skip some of the drudge work/sleeping rough, but you'll still need to snag a functional ID to get any kind of real career going. This would be much easier if it happened pre-internet.

        >grandparents still exist but never got together. Your parents, uncles and siblings won't exist.

        that would actually cause a massive case of Butterly Effect, since this means easily 50+ years of divergence points. Yeah, most of our grandparents were not important people, but they interacted, however briefly with hundreds of thousands of people, and with hundreds of millions indirectly.

        - u/fish312:

          You'd think so, but a lot of the society that we live in today dates back far further than three generations - collectively i'd think that it has a *lot* of inertia. Very rarely do things hinge upon the actions of a single person. 

          Yeah, your lottery tickets are useless and stock prices are probably inaccurate. Your town might have a population difference of an additional hundred or so. That MacDonalds is now a Burger King.

          But major world events? If Princip didn't assassinate Archduke Franz Ferdinand, someone else would have. Or maybe nobody did, but some other catalyst ignites WW1 anyway. If the plane that hit the WTC was delayed, the attack might still have been carried out the next day... or the next week. Small ripples dissipating in a very big pond.

          Of course this is completely speculative, and we have no way of knowing all the roads not taken.
          ```

          - u/Freevoulous:
            ```
            I understand your point, but I disagree with your conclusion. A great lots of events have a lot of causal fragility: change them by a second or by a millimetre, and completely rewrite the timeline:

            - influencing the conception of someone, even by a split second will result in a different sperm winning and thus different person be born. So, every child of people who interacted with the parents and grandparents is now not born or 50% chance of being the opposite sex. Same goes for kids of those kids, and everyone they interacted with in an exponential manner.

            - deadly accidents, car crashes, plane crashes, etc are prevented AND caused differently, killing or saving millions across the globe, just from a single tiny interaction

            - completely different set of people win the lottery

            - different teams win matches, thus moving millions of $ in different directions

            Take your WW1 example: if a different person kills Franz Ferdinand, then the whole timeline and causality is shifted by a fraction, and completely different set of people survive the chaotic trench warfare of WW1. This means that completely different set of people fight in WW2, if it happens at all. Hitler very likely dies, or has a different war experience. Every major European, Chinese, Japanese or American celeb or politician from now one is different, not born, or has changed personality.

              Hmm I never considered that. You make very valid points and I'm inclined to accept your conclusion. 

              Makes me wonder how far such a timeline could diverge from our current reality. Certainly most of the nation states should still remain intact, and there's probably not enough time for any significant language drift. I'd assume many of the big banks still exist in similar form as they have for centuries but the tech scene would probably be wildly different in that case.

              Or I dunno, maybe we belong to the 1% of realities that survived the cold war and most others end in nuclear holocaust. It's hard to know just how many safeguards there were and how close we came to tripping them all.

  You can temporarily change the laws of chemistry in a relatively small area, specifically increasing or decreasing the chemical potential energy of any configuration of atoms. You can't break the laws of thermodynamics, but you can "store" around a hundred thousand calories by making reactions that lose energy relative the normal rules, and draw from that to make reactions that would otherwise create energy. You can make effects conditional, but the condition-evaluation has limited computational power and can only condition on low level physical configurations, like "Is within N nanometers of [specific transcription factor] attached to [specific DNA sniper a few tens of bases long]".

  You can control this either in real time directly with your brain, or hook it up to a computer controlling it faster and with more precision using an API, but you need to actually acquire the computer and write the code. With a lot of work, you might be able to mass produce machines that have this capability. Regardless of where and how it's used, it consumes a significant amount of energy, be prepared to need to eat more or have beefy power supply and cooling on the computer.

    Hmm. This grants you and anyone else in the area of effect immunity to a wide range of poisons, since a lot of them work via chemical reactions that you can just shut down completely. Given the rarity of such poisonings, it probably wouldn't cost too much power to set up lots of computers that generate such poison-immunity fields everywhere.

    Taking things a step further, you could even shut down various drugs. No new addicts can be created when the drugs do literally nothing after you stop them from reacting with anything. The "war on drugs" would be won with relative ease. (Except for those drugs that are used for medical purposes.) (Maybe don't put the field over hospitals?)
