## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  [Stl_Manifest](https://twitter.com/Stl_Manifest) is tweeting very short obituaries of Jews who were [denied entry to the US in 1939](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005267) and, after being sent back to Europe, eventually died in german extermination camps.

  Short of the visits I've made to the camps themselves, this is probably the most striking reminder of the Holocaust I've seen. Actually knowing their names makes a huge difference to the emotional impact; each tweet feels important, and the seemingly unending stream overwhelms.


  Just... don't look at replies to their tweets.

  If you found yourself in an SI story or another universe in which souls exist, what tests\experiments would you try to do to determine how their existense is possible at all and which parts of your worldview need to be changed?

  Additionally, since “souls” are given a rather wide variety of meanings by different people, which phenomena behind that word would you think to be logically impossible to exist even if you were directly facing a world where they seemingly did exist? And in this case also, what experiments would you try to do to point out the logical contradictions and find out what is really happening in that universe?

    Conversely, if you were writing such a setting, and you had an audience grounded in materialist thought, how would you hint to the audience the nature of the soul without going on any drawn out expository descriptions.  Hints can take the form of events, superpowers, cryptic comments by an unreliable narrator, etc, just so long as you don't outright tell the audience everything.

    > which phenomena behind that word would you think to be logically impossible to exist even if you were directly facing a world where they seemingly did exist?

    "Epiphenomena".  If you have a belief about an epiphenomena it is meaningless or else it is not really an epiphenomena in the first place.

    > what tests\experiments would you try to do to determine how their existense is possible at all and which parts of your worldview need to be changed?


    To play devils advocate... I don't think we've really absolutely ruled out souls in the real world in the first place.  Sure we can say they are highly unlikely given materialist priors and our current scientific knowledge but outright impossible?  I don't think, for example, that we have simulated neurons at the molecular level well enough to absolutely rule out that there isn't anything special going on at that level, much less the entire brain.  So if the souls connection to the brain is sufficiently subtle under most circumstances, your SI will need better resources and tools than science currently has, or else a way of reliably inducing circumstances were it isn't subtle.  And creating those circumstances might start to require actions that would be fitting for a mad scientist, or at the very least exceptionally weird from an outside perspective*.

    *IRL I heard a seminar lecture about epigenetics where the researcher had a depression model in mice and to test if it was from nurture or other factors (the mice were inbred to be genetically identical, but DNA methylation is apparently inheritable) that the mice passed on the depression vulnerability/resistance, ended up artificially inseminating the female mice and then having them have sex with a sterilized male mice to isolate the variables properly.

      > "Epiphenomena". If you have a belief about an epiphenomena it is meaningless or else it is not really an epiphenomena in the first place.

      Despite being almost certainly false, epiphenomenalism as an idea is in fact logically consistent (e.g. it's possible to write a computer simulation of a universe in which there's a secondary "layer" of reality that can be affected by the primary layer while being unable to affect it in return). What *is* logically impossible is the idea that "qualia" (or whatever you want to call those sensations that we as conscious beings experience) are ontologically fundamental. This is logically impossible because sensations are *complex*, and for an ontologically fundamental object to be complex is a contradiction in terms. There is no such thing as an object that both (a) exhibits highly complicated behavior, and (b) is not "made of" simpler components. As such, even if it turned out that non-physical souls *did* exist and had some sort of measurable impact on the real world, those souls would *by necessity* have to consist of smaller, non-conscious components.

      **P.S.** This, incidentally, is why epiphenomenal theories of consciousness (apart from being extremely implausible on priors) *don't actually solve the Hard Problem of Consciousness*--all they do is kick the problem a level back, onto a layer of reality that is inaccessible via any physical means. The actual *workings* of consciousness, however--how and why we experience sensation, what sort of processes might result in such a thing--[are left completely untouched by such "explanations"](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ip/fake_explanations/).

        Right, I was replying to the part asking what would be meaningless or absurd even given the existence of souls when I mentioned epiphenomena.  I agree that it could be "true" but even if it was, by its very definition, it wouldn't be relevant, as you mentioned by its failure to solve the problem of consciousness.

        That said:

        > There is no such thing as an object that both (a) exhibits highly complicated behavior, and (b) is not "made of" simpler components. As such, even if it turned out that non-physical souls *did* exist and had some sort of measurable impact on the real world, those souls would *by necessity* have to consist of smaller, non-conscious components.

        It is true that every phenomena observed by science has so far been, in principle reducible to smaller, non-conscious components.  That said, is there really any fundamental rule of logic that says this has to be true?  It is incredibly unlikely, given everything mankind has observed and experienced, but is it impossible?  And even if they "soul" was reducible to non-conscious simpler components, if those component, were say, an order of magnitude or two more complicated than the current known laws of physics, it would still be effectively the same situation to modern science.  Figuring out the brain and mind in the real world is  already hard enough, and the brain runs on physics and chemistry that we in principle understand.

          No problem! I find this sort of stuff to be a lot of fun to discuss anyway--and if helped you come up with some ideas, all the better!

          > It is true that every phenomena observed by science has so far been, in principle reducible to smaller, non-conscious components. That said, is there really any fundamental rule of logic that says this has to be true?

          Well, I don't think there's a handy name for the concept, but the short answer is yes. Here's a (relatively) brief explanation as to why:

          Consider a computer program. At the most basic level, every computer program is merely a collection of bits--little 0's and 1's that act as instructions for the processor. Now, these bits are an example of something *ontologically fundamental*. What this means is simply that *bits are not made of anything else*--they just *are*. (Well, at least from a computational perspective. Physically, of course, most computer chips use currents and circuits to represent the 0's and 1's--but that's a matter of representation. When we consider the computer program *as a mathematical object*, the bits are fundamental.) This is all well and good--it's perfectly fine for bits to be fundamental. This is because a bit is a very simple mathematical object--in fact, a bit is the *simplest possible mathematical object*.

          However, suppose you're a (rather dull) programmer who's been programming in binary all your life. One day, while entering strings of 0's and 1's into your terminal, a jolt of realization strikes you: *there appear to be some sequences of bits that occur repeatedly across all of your programs*. Moreover, you realize, the reason these sequences appear so often is because they accomplish some task that needs to be performed a *lot* by your programs, in all sorts of different contexts. So, you reason, wouldn't it be nice if, instead of typing in the same sequence for, say, integer addition every single time, you programmed the computer to recognize a certain string of characters--say, "ADD"--and automatically run the corresponding bit sequence? You do this, and it turns out that you were right: it *is* a lot easier. Eventually, this innovation catches on amongst your colleagues, and soon everyone is programming using these shorthands. (Note: This is not a historically accurate parable.)

          The important thing to note here, however, is that despite making programming much easier, those shorthands are still exactly that: shorthands. The underlying processing still occurs using bits; at no point does the character sequence "ADD" ever appear in the bitstream. Because of this, we say that the ADD command is *not* ontologically fundamental (although it's still simple enough that people feel mostly comfortable treating it as though it were); it can be decomposed into simpler parts.

          Now, try to imagine a command that both (a) gets the computer to recognize it and do something, and (b) does not correspond to any bit sequence. If this seems impossible... well, that's because it is: no such command exists and no such command ever could. (More formally: for any action the computer can execute, there exists a bit sequence that, if entered, would cause it to perform that action. From this it trivially follows that there is no action the computer can execute for which there is not a corresponding sequence of bits.) And this situation is *exactly analogous* to the claim that I originally made: that there exists no object that both (a) exhibits highly complex behavior and (b) does not consist of simpler components! Complicated objects *cannot* be fundamental, because it is always possible to represent the behavior of such an object using a simpler description. (Corollary: sensation cannot be ontologically fundamental, because sensation is a very complicated thing indeed.)

          Hope that helps!

            Your argument isn't as strong as you suppose it. The mathematical model of a computer built on logic gates is defined in terms of small fundamental units, such as bits and gates, but we know that to be so because that is how we formally defined it to be.

            This analogy is known to break down in at least two ways. The first is that mathematical models do not correspond to physical reality; the actions a computer can execute are distinct from its mathematical model by the vagaries of its implementation. This reduces it to a physical model which is, as far as we can observe, far more complicated than basic logic gates.

            Secondly, there is no rule against having mathematical models which include complex fundamental actions. Oracle machines are one good example. These can implement arbitrarily complex, uncomputable actions that are explicitly not decomposable.

            One flaw in your thinking largely arises from the confusion of fundamental behaviours with simple behaviours, which turns the argument into a thinly veiled circular one. In essence you seem to suppose that because each fundamental truth is self-descriptive, they must all be equally self descriptive. This need not be true, as an oracle machine demonstrates.

            That said, I highly doubt we are in a world where a process as complex as conscious thought is fundamental; the possibility seems ruled out by sheer statistical implausibility.

This reduces it to a physical model which is, as far as we can observe, far more complicated than basic logic gates.

              First off, I should note that this has no bearing on my main point. Second of all, I actually _pointed it out in my original comment_:

              > (Well, at least from a computational perspective. Physically, of course, most computer chips use currents and circuits to represent the 0's and 1's--but that's a matter of representation. When we consider the computer program _as a mathematical object_, the bits are fundamental.)

              I'll reiterate what I said then: the fact that physical computers in the real world are implemented using real-world physics (duh!) does not change the fact that any mathematical model of a computer holds bits as fundamental.

              > Secondly, there is no rule against having mathematical models which include complex fundamental actions. Oracle machines are one good example. These can implement arbitrarily complex, uncomputable actions that are explicitly not decomposable.

              > One flaw in your thinking largely arises from the confusion of fundamental behaviours with simple behaviours, which turns the argument into a thinly veiled circular one. In essence you seem to suppose that because each fundamental truth is self-descriptive, they must all be equally self descriptive. This need not be true, as an oracle machine demonstrates.

              You are confusing a formal system with its model. It is certainly possible to define into existence mathematical objects which are uncomputable. For instance, Chaitin's constant is explicitly uncomputable, and yet we have no difficulty talking about it. However, this simply passes the buck down a level: even if you want to posit the existence of uncomputable things, those things still must be _well-defined_. To talk about any mathematical object at _all_, you must have a computable, finite description which is capable of uniquely specifying that object out of all other possible objects--and this is true regardless of whether the object itself is uncomputable.

              Your mistaken assumption was that I required all objects be _computable_; this is not the case. What I _do_ require, however, is that all objects be _describable_. Certain models of hypercomputation involving oracle machines, for instance, are well-defined, if uncomputable. If you walked up to me and said, "Let's talk about Zeno machines!", I'd happily acquiesce. However, if you walked up to me and said, "Let's talk about this arbitrary mathematical object that does a bunch of things in an extremely complicated manner which I can't describe to you because there's no computable description," I'd simply give you a funny look--because at that point, you're not _referring_ to anything with your words.

              It's possible (conceivable) that consciousness is uncomputable. If so, however, its description must _still_ be simple in the Komolgorov sense. Crying "But, uncomputability!" doesn't solve the problem at all. You still have to provide me with a well-defined mathematical function which behaves like consciousness--and _that_, in turn, means decomposing it into something that is decidedly _not_ conscious.

              (Incidentally, I should note that I find the notion that consciousness is uncomputable extremely implausible--but that's irrelevant to my main point here, which is that even if I were to grant that consciousness _was_ uncomputable, that still wouldn't change the fact that it cannot be fundamental.)

                This is not true. For example, chaotic systems exhibit highly complex behaviour yet are descriptively simple. Similarly, there is no intrinsic reason I know of that consciousness couldn't be *descriptively* simple, yet directly produce complex behaviours.

                That said, I also disagree with your assertion that fundamental laws must be descriptively simple. Your analogy of me going to you and saying

                > "Let's talk about this arbitrary mathematical object that does a bunch of things in an extremely complicated manner which I can't describe to you because there's no computable description,"

                is painfully reminiscent of trying to talk about qualia, where the overriding concern is that nobody really knows what it is or how to describe it.

                  I think you're misinterpreting my original statement (which is understandable, since I wasn't very clear when making that statement). Basically, what I was trying to say is that there is no such thing as a complicated object whose behavior cannot be described _in terms_ of simpler components. This statement (which is what I was originally intending) _does_ in fact apply to chaotic systems.

                  > Similarly, there is no intrinsic reason I know of that consciousness couldn't be _descriptively simple_, yet directly produce complex behaviours.

                  Well, I mean, if we had a simple description of consciousness, the Hard Problem of Consciousness would already be solved. (Actually, I'm beginning to suspect that you and I have no real disagreement here, and that any appearance of disagreement is simply a difference in terminology.)

                      I was about to do that myself, haha. Okay, so, let's consider the set of all possible mathematical objects. Suppose we order the set in terms of Komolgorov complexity, so that objects with lower complexity appear closer to the beginning. In that case, I make two claims about this set:

                      1. There exist certain objects that are "universal", in the sense that for any non-universal object there exists a configuration of universal objects which behaves identically to that object.
                      2. There are only finitely many universal objects.

                      This second claim is the most important. What it implies is that somewhere in our list of mathematical objects ordered by complexity, there is a *last* universal object, past which everything is non-universal. This in turn means there is something of a "complexity threshold" in our list. There might be non-universal objects *before* this threshold, but if an object falls *past* the threshold you can instantly say--without even looking at it--that it's non-universal.

                      Okay, those are my claims. Here's how they connect to my previous statements:

                      I consider universal objects to be "ontologically fundamental", and non-universal objects to be... well, not. Whenever I talked about something being "fundamental" in my previous comments, this is the property I actually had in mind. Moreover, any objects that fall past the complexity threshold defined by the last universal object in the list are "complicated", and therefore automatically non-fundamental.

                      At this point I should note that when I was first typing up my original comments, none of this was explicit in my mind; I came up with this just now in an attempt to capture the (vague) intuition that was originally powering my argument. However, I do feel that the explanation given here is an accurate representation of what I was thinking at the time. Hope this helps.

                        You've already jumped the gun :P. Komolgorov complexity isn't a well-defined property on its own, since it depends on the choice of a language.

                        So, then, what language are you using? How are you mapping from computations in that language to statements about or descriptions of your mathematical objects? I feel this step is one of the most important ones you need to make, yet you've skipped it entirely.

                        > Okay, so, let's consider the set of all possible mathematical objects.

                        I'm fairly sure this isn't a well defined thing. First of all, there are (far) more mathematical objects than there are programs (the later is a countable set, after all). Second, this doesn't jive with #2, since there are unboundedly many fundamental axioms that one could posit, given the lack of restrictions on axioms.

                        Even if ignoring these problems, that doesn't immediately help with your argument because it makes no claim on how large the finite set of universal objects can be. Unless you consider consciousness to be unboundedly complex, and it seems you do not, consciousness could still be in the set of universal objects without violating any of your assumptions.

                          Any universal language will do. Because the overhead caused by using one language versus another is a fixed constant, this means that as you go down the list the effect of this overhead will be dominated by the increasing complexity of the objects you're describing. In other words, your choice of language will only ever affect the ordering of your list slightly, and even then only near the beginning of the list. The overall thrust of the argument, however, remains intact no matter what language you choose.

                          > I'm fairly sure this isn't a well defined thing. First of all, there are (far) more mathematical objects than there are programs (the later is a countable set, after all).

                          Now, this, on the other hand, is a legitimate problem you caught, mainly due to imprecise wording on my part. So, in the spirit of my earlier reply to you, let me amend my statement from "the set of all possible mathematical objects" to "the set of all _describable_ mathematical objects" (where "describable" simply means "capable of being uniquely specified by a finite string of characters in a language with a finite number of symbols").

                          > Even if ignoring these problems, that doesn't immediately help with your argument because it makes no claim on how large the finite set of universal objects can be. Unless you consider consciousness to be unboundedly complex, and it seems you do not, consciousness could still be in the set of universal objects without violating any of your assumptions.

                          Well, no. Consciousness, as always, is capable of making any argument murky--and this one is no exception. Of course I have no formal proof that consciousness is a "non-universal" object. (If I did, I'm pretty sure I'd have solved the Hard Problem of Consciousness already. :P) However, intuitively speaking, I'd be extremely shocked if it turned out that it's impossible to express consciousness in terms of simpler processes; it just doesn't _feel_ to me like something that could be universal--not in the same way that logic gates feel universal.

                          (Great discussion, by the way; I'm having a lot of fun with this.)

                            If anything this is the distinction I was trying to make when I said it was ruled out by statistical implausibility rather than strict logical deduction. The most obvious one is that there needs to be evolutionary pressure to evolve conscious thought, and evolution works on gradients.

For any formal system with a finite number of axioms, there exists a Turing machine capable of computing any mathematical object describable by that system. Additionally, *universal Turing machines* exist and are capable of simulating the behavior of any other Turing machine, given the right input. So to describe a mathematical object in my schema, all you would need is (a) a universal Turing machine, (b) the formal system the object exists in, and (c) a specification of the object itself within that system. It doesn't really matter which universal Turing machine you choose (which was the point of my last comment), but if I had to specify *one*, I'd probably go with whichever one happens to give the lowest average complexity for the set of universal objects.

                              As for the discussion of consciousness, I think I'm going to need to think about this a little bit more. There's still a niggling part of me that isn't satisfied with "statistical implausibility", but I haven't yet reached the stage where I can express the reason for that feeling in words. So I think I'll leave that particular thread dangling, at least for now.

                                The problem here is that Komolgorov complexity isn't an intrinsic measure of the complexity of a physical thing, as much as a measure of the complexity of *computation*. But descriptions aren't themselves computations. Descriptions are relations between concepts you know, which in this case are the symbols the Turing Machine (or equivalent abstraction) produces, and the concepts being described in terms of them, which in this case are the mathematical objects.

                                Thus if the language-in-translation was chosen to be that way, the Komolgorov complexity of any described axiom in any formal system with a finite number of axioms *could* be 1. This is true *regardless* of the complexity of the system from a mechanical standpoint. All of the meaning can be hidden in translation! This ruins the deductive power of this argument.

            Good point!  Of course there is no rule saying the mathematically "simpler" description has to be the most intuitive for humans to think of.  Indeed, I think physics has already gotten past that point.  For the purposes of world building the mathematical description may be entirely unreachable to the characters in-universe.

            And actually.., thinking about your point some more.  "Complicated" is a relative term.  Are quantum mechanics and relativity more or less clear complicated than maxwells equations and Newtonian mechanics?  Even the most fundamental rules can still be messy and complicated relative to human understanding.

              Well, there are a couple of formal measures for complexity in computer science and information theory. The most relevant measure here is probably [Kolmogorov complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity). The simplest way to think of it would be this: to determine how complicated a mathematical object is, you write out a computer program capable of simulating that object in its entirety, compile it into binary, and then count the bits of the resulting program. The more bits there are, the more complex the object is. By this metric, quantum mechanics (that is to say, the Schrodinger equation)--as well as any other physical theory--is actually quite simple, since mathematical equations are remarkably easy to reproduce in code. To figure out whether a particular physical theory is simpler than another, of course, would require you to actually perform the task I described above (not an easy thing to do by any stretch of the imagination), but one thing is clear enough: because physicists only consider hypothesis that can be described by mathematical equations, the sort of hypotheses they tend to consider are simpler _by far_ than any other competing set of hypotheses. This is actually where the divide between "naturalistic" and "non-naturalistic" hypotheses comes from: not from some sort of rigid rule that unfairly discriminates against certain hypotheses, but just because there's a certain class of hypotheses that *starts out* with an advantage, merely by virtue of being simpler.

                Though I appreciate the point you're making, do note that this is a conjecture, not a known fact. We do not know that the universe is Turing computable, and in fact it is not clear whether the universe's laws suffice to compute the universe itself!

That would be non-trivial, like trying to recover a single fragment of the initial state out of billions, after that state has been iterated countless times. The best you're likely to get is "save a copy of me before I join the hivemind, return that copy when I am ejected".

          As for deciding when to leave, you don't meaningfully have any free will as part of the hive mind, since "you" no longer exists as a distinct entity. If a hivemind wanted to permit people to leave at will, the best method would be similar to the above; save a copy, periodically query it to see whether it would leave given the current situation".

        Yes, there aren’t many stories with well thought-out hiveminds that aren’t evil, sadly.

        All I can recommend is [*A Song for Lya*,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_for_Lya) [*the Ender’s Saga,*](https://www.goodreads.com/series/43963-the-ender-quintet) and the [*Doc Future trilogy*](https://www.goodreads.com/series/179564-doc-future) — and even then only the first one has hiveminds in the centre of the story. Both Wikipedia and TVTropes have lists collecting such stories ([1,](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/HiveMind/PlayedStraight) [2,](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentalFusion) [3\),](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_mind_\(science_fiction\)) but in the overwhelming majority of such stories the hive mind is just used as a plot device, and often depicted in a ridiculously lazy and flanderized fashion even then.

        Regarding the original question, I think it would depend on the exact nature of hiveminds in the given universe. We’re thinking about them from a human’s perspective, so we are projecting the human assumptions about psychology onto something that is inherently not a regular human mind.

        For instance, while multiple personalities are regarded as a disorder by human psychology, they shouldn’t necessarily be seen as something bad by a hivemind as well. 

        So depending on the hivemind, when a new brain is joining them the individuality inside it can be wiped out to just leave the brain as an additional part of the mega-brain network, or that individuality can be preserved and cherished as something giving a valuable new perspective to the group-mind as a whole.

            ```
            I think it becomes just a problem of definitions by that point. If the individuality of the members isn’t being suppressed, then the hivemind and the telepathic individuals are not mutually exclusive any more. People could be calling groups of people connected through telepathy (or some other means) a hivemind as they are calling a group of crows a murder, or a neighbouring group of cells an organism. 

            Or, for that matter, as they are calling a group of people a nation\country\etc. In fact, the existence of such hiveminds would likely introduce a new dimension to the political landscape: many people would be both citizens of some countries and members of some hiveminds.

            Of course in-universe, if the word “hivemind” had some negative connotations then I can see members of a “free-hivemind”, if you will, trying to distinguish their structure by avoiding calling themselves that.

          As for multiple personalities, I guess it still would be necessary to merge them somehow, otherwise the decision making process would be very slow (Probably.

    Depending on how the hive mind is distributed and how much it subsumes people, Homogenization of ideas leads to less creativity.  At one possible extreme, the hive mind is no more creative than a single individual person. More moderately, perhaps the hive mind society has a tendency to fall into group think easily.  To avoid this maybe individuals have the capacity to temporarily reduce their connection strength so they can think of new ideas.

    A more interesting idea, particularly if the hive mind is organized to catch creative thoughts and maximize them: a single insane component of the hive mind have the potential to pollute the rest of the hive mind.  Like imagine if everyone could share the perspective of a paranoid schizophrenic.  Sure everyone else should know better, but the insane perspective is absolutely convincing.

    Slowdown. If communication between nodes isn't speed-of-light (and that's is a lot to ask of biology, nerve impulses only do about 400m/s), it may take hours or days for a thought to travel across the mind and propagate to every node.

    Even if it is speed-of-light, there needs to be some infrastructure or organisation to make sure that information goes where it needs to. The Internet struggles enough with routing, and at least its data packets have a uniquely identified destination. Imagine if a thought had to be addressed to "anyone who knows computational geometry" - how do you organize it so that nodes don't spend most of their time reading and rejecting messages that aren't meant for them?

      I think you found the clearest disadvantage of the hive mind. It seems that upon expanding, hive mind will either process things slower or split into multiple separate hive minds.

      Both outcomes bear severe negative consequences and thus hive mind will most likely concentrate its members on the smallest possible territory to reduce communication problems. (At least, this seems like a reasonable course of action. I am not a hive mind to know for sure!)

      > Imagine if a thought had to be addressed to "anyone who knows computational geometry" - how do you organize it so that nodes don't spend most of their time reading and rejecting messages that aren't meant for them?

      Maybe keep 'supernodes' that have vast amounts of relevant information about all the other nodes? Since there is no privacy in the hive mind, such tables may be very detailed. When the hive mind grows, 'metanodes' are introduced. Metanodes keep statistical information about groups observed by each supernode. I guess this scheme still creates a lot of unnecessary data packages.
      ```

      - u/Chronophilia:

        That approach or something like it is the most sensible. However, it also creates single points of failure, which mitigates some of the advantages of a hivemind. If too many supernodes die at once, the rest of the hivemind is left in disarray until it can make or train some new ones.

        Having backups will help. But against an intelligent enemy, who can spot nodes that are sending and receiving a lot of data and knows to target them, it won't do much good.

  Skipped last week intentionally, tho perhaps I shouldn’t’ve.  At any rate, nothing visible got done, and I didn’t want to post “still pluggin away!” with nothing else to show.


  The design for how all of this is supposed to work with mods is starting to come together.  The real breakthrough was in sitting down and making a mock file directory that contains placeholders for all the various mods and systems involved.  It’s really helped me to figure out exactly how the different systems need to be divided, both from one another and along the system/mod spectrum.


  [The current feature document is located here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SlYaK6vZ0OmkQsuVOMCIOMb6nPIU9I1vKMTFMEL0Wk8/edit?usp=sharing). It’s still woefully incomplete, but things are starting to come together, and I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.


  The document is organized into five levels: Engine, Mod System, Mechanic, Balance, and Lore.  This is a rough priority system, as well as a “you must be *this* technical to make suggestions” hierarchy.  Anything pokemon-related is to be constrained to the bottom two levels: Lore is largely going to be the realm of text-based content (quests, dialog, fluff) and “story bible”, while Balance are the specific values given to the Mechanics to give them a particular look and feel.  Mechanics, for instance,  will define that types of things exist that can affect one another differently based on nothing but type, but Balance will call some of those things Fire, Water, and Grass and give them the shape we know and love.


  Once I’m convinced I haven’t missed any major systems, I’ll go through the old feature document(s) line by line and sort them all somewhere in this document (mostly under Balance). Then I stick them all in a spreadsheet, clarify and sort a bit based on priority, and I’ve got myself a master to-do list! Fun times.


  As suggested above, I’m not convinced that I’ve got every single system listed here that’s going to need to exist.  If you are familiar with this project, (and especially if you aren’t), I’d much appreciate it if you could give this document a look-over and yell at me for missing something so trivial and obvious as X, so I can add it post-haste.

  The question of special vs physical was brought up again this week, as these things do, and I think I've happened upon a solution that finally makes the puzzle pieces fit.


  ATK is one's physical prowess and is basically STR, while DEF is one's physical durability (these haven't changed).  SPATK is one's focus and finesse in controlling the elements (or mental powers), and SPDEF is the ability to resist the non-damage aspects of special attacks, so basically a CON save.


  All moves have stats that they scale off of, stats that resist the damage, and an optional set of status effects that have a % chance of being applied.  With this tweak, "special" moves will be those with a significant chance or the primary intended effect of applying status effects of all kinds.  This demands the creation of additional status effects, such as a "waterlogged" effect for special water attacks (something that decreases temperature, reduces speed/evasion, makes more susceptible to electric attacks).  


  Moves will not naively be purely physical or purely special; this division wouldn't even necessarily exist in code and would be more a sort of design guideline that has no mechanical enforcement.  Each of these variables would be tweaked per move (although I expect 80% of them would be exactly what you would expect from canon).  


  Some examples: Alakazam could use Telekinesis to throw a boulder at its opponent; this would scale off of SPATK and be resisted by DEF. Charizard uses flamethrower; this scales off of SPATK and is resisted by DEF, but the chance to burn (significantly higher than in canon) is resisted by SPDEF.  Gengar uses Dream Eater; this scales off of SPATK and is resisted by SPDEF.  Hitmonchan uses DYNAMICPUNCH; it scales off of ATK and is resisted by DEF, but the chance of confusion is resisted by SPDEF.  Magmar uses Fire Punch; it scales partially (60%) off of ATK and partially (40%) off of SPATK, and is resisted by DEF, but the chance to burn is resisted by SPDEF.  


  Status effects in general will be more flexible, in particular with the ability to stack some effects over and over.  Sleep, paralysis, and waterlogged are some statuses that can stack, having heavier and heavier effects on the user until a limit is hit.  SPDEF will likely be involved in partially resisting these stacked effects in addition to a binary "evasion" of simpler effects.


  Naturally with these changes, there’s no need for a separate CON stat anymore.

  "What non-US bank is most likely to refuse to give your money to a US authority trying to seize it, if something goes very wrong under Trump and you have to become a refuge? Besides Bitcoin.
  We are not concerned with tax evasion; we're fine with this bank honestly reporting everything to the IRS. It's likewise good if this is a reputable bank that doesn't raise eyebrows when you properly file the IRS form to report a foreign account.
  We just want this bank to not give the IRS or Justice Department all your money without you having authorized the transfer; likewise not freezing it because a US authority claims you're a "terrorist".
  (The bank also needs to be able to authenticate your identity even if your passport has been revoked.)"

    The main worry is that no one knows what to expect. That hasn't really changed.

    It's still unlikely that he will have life-changing impact; but there are more paths to America becoming a heavily policed autocracy today than there were a year ago.

    The biggest thing you need to take out of this first week is that he is in fact working off of precedent. If it's not an atrocity for President Obama to abuse the executive order, I see no reason to be suddenly alarmed that President Trump is doing it as well. And every president since FDR has had an active first hundred days. The fact that Trump is trying his damnedest to *actually* build a wall and make the Mexicans pay for it at least tells me he's more honest about his campaign promises than the last couple of Presidents. Whether any of it actually pans out is not up to us to tell.

    I'm not so sure that his election is the end of the world. At worst, it might have sped up our path towards tyranny, but the result of another Clinton presidency would have been a guaranteed slow trot to the same place. This way, at least I get to criticize the President without getting compared to the Birthers.

      No, it doesn't? Most politicians do try to address issues their campaign agenda was based on; Trump's claim that everyone else is as much of a liar and demagogue as he is ridiculous. It's just that most of those issues are not as obviously ridiculous as the wall, and so them falling through seems like the politician not trying, rather than the task being hard.

      >If it's not an atrocity for President Obama to abuse the executive order

      [Obama signed less executive orders per year than any president in over a century.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/23/obama-executive-orders/)

      People need to stop repeating conservative ~~propaganda~~ talking points without doing their own research.

      I personally don't think people can objectively look at Trump's campaign and first weeks of presidency as anything remotely like those in recent history. Sure, if you look at all of American history, there's some other crazy stuff, but if you have to go back to the pre-radio days to find this much craziness in a presidential election, that probably says something in itself.

      Overall I'd say that normalizing him is far more dangerous than all but the most extreme alternatives (I don't think he's going to start WW3: I do think he's going to weaken a number of important geopolitical ties that will make WW3 more likely).

      > I think Trump is going to build a wall, and Mexico is going to pay for it. Whether that payment is direct or indirect seems up in the air right now.

      I'm pretty sure the American taxpayer will pay for it. 

      Trump is asking Congress for the money, so in the immediate future we *are*, without a doubt, going to pay for it. 

      Mexico is not going to cough up a giant tribute so Trump will place a massive tariff on goods coming from / manufactured in Mexico. Companies that were buying from / manufacturing in Mexico were doing it because it was the best balance of efficient/inexpensive for them. When that changes they'll move to other sources which will, by definition, increase their costs. The companies will pass these new costs on to us in the form of raised prices. 

      Mexican manufacturers will no longer be making as much by selling to us, so they'll start selling to others as much as possible. This will reduce the income from those massive tariffs, and lower supply of those goods in the American market will drive up prices. 

      It's coming from us in the short term and it will come from us in the long term as well.

    Trump may not have said anything homophobic himself but Pence is a homophobe's wet dream. Given that Trump offered Kasich the chance to be in charge of "all domestic and foreign policy" (aka everything) there's a good chance Pence is the one doing all the real work.

    >What's actually going on here

    The attempt to create a fascist dictatorship out of the US presidential system.

    >what kinds of things should I actually be worried about from the Trump administration?

    Dictatorship, civil war, world war, ethnic cleansing, and quite possibly (if they actually let Trump use nukes) the end of the world.  The saying that's been going around is, "When someone shows you who they are, believe them."  This applies to Trump, but it applies doubly to Stephen Bannon, who is trying to create a clash of civilizations between Christian-dominionist capitalism and the entire Muslim world.

    I tried it a while ago and enjoyed the results—even now I tend to avoid "it." I definitely avoid the sub though, since their claims range from "plausible" to "optimistic" to "wishful thinking" to "cultish attribution of holy power to semen." 

    That being said, I can't imagine that exercising one's discipline and practicing delayed gratification would have *negative* effects. So I don't think there's any downside to trying it. I might do it again.

      One plausible benefit that I think most people don't mention:

      Trying to abstain is an excellent way to see *just how quickly* your mind starts to create rationalizations for certain behavior.

      You get a really quick crash course into what it feels like to precommit, decision instability, and time-inconsistent preferences.

      Because of trying this out several times, I think it's given me a lot of personal insight into how my brain tries to rationalize things, as well as what credible commitments might require.

      EX: I'm now much more skeptical of willpower and believe that "shaping the path" and things of that nature are far more effective for combating temptations.

      I've seen a number of studies over the years that correlate beneficial health effects with, ah, periodically cleaning the piping, so to speak.  One where I'm fairly confident of the recollection was a 40% reduced rate of prostate cancer among men who purged the plumbing 5+ times per week, though I can't remember if that was just in comparison to 4-, or some lower bound.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        My initial gut reaction is that both the 40% reduction and the 5+ times number seems a little high.

        I don't have studies to back this up, though, except for an anecdote: I recall someone asking their urologist how often was good for prostate health. The urologist said that wet dreams apparently covered most of the benefits, so additional effort wasn't needed.

      People self-report a lot of things on the subreddit. I'm fairly skeptical of those, though.

      My general goal is to decouple associations my brain has with online stimuli. I've also had a mental "ugh" to this sort of thing, and I suspect my preference preferences have something for this.

      So it also just feels good to finally act on those.

  I have been watching A Series of Unfortunate Events despite not being a fan of the books and also having major plot points spoiled for me. I'm not sure how I feel about it. I didn't like the stupid story at first, then the offbeat humor kind of grew on me, then I started getting annoyed by the child acting and subpar production values. 

  I probably shouldn't like it since the comedic moments don't always make me laugh while I'm not very invested in the serious moments, but for some reason I keep watching even though I'm not even sure whether the story's claim to be dark and depressing is ironic or not. What do you think?
  ```

  - u/lsparrish:

    Pretty sure it's intentionally ironic. The narrator is somewhat unreliable, being a Noir Detective parody himself, and the story is one where most of the adults are too stupid to breathe because that's the genre (or perhaps the genre being parodied). The story isn't meant to actually depress the listener, being too wacky and full of problem solving for that to be the case.

    Much of the material about grammar, the correct definitions of words, and so on fits my idea of rationalist fiction as "intelligent person wish fulfillment", in that we get to see cool authority figures go on and on about pet peeves like "it's/its" or "figuratively/literally" like they are actually important.
    ```

    - u/trekie140:
      ```
      I like that interpretation, but if that's the case then the writing is weirdly meta about it. Snicket's presentation of the story has the same odd quirks as the story, as if the fact the joke is being told is part of the joke. I don't know if that makes it better is just an excuse for when the writing is genuinely unsatisfying. Anyway, I'm having some fun.

    - u/trekie140:
      ```
      I don't think it's that the kids are bad characters, it's that the actors playing them aren't very good. The way the deliver their lines makes them come across as more bland than they should, so I don't really care about what happens to them when it's supposed to taken seriously. Except for the baby, though. Her facial expressions have been on point in every scene and her snarky commentary has consistently made me chuckle.
