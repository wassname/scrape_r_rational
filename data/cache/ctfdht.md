  Diaspora by Greg Egan. It's diamond-hard science fiction. It was the first book in decades that made me feel hope for the far future of intelligent species.

    Ack! The Metamorphosis of the Prime Intellect has been an internet white whale for like a decade for me! 

    Read it once and thought it was weird, not really that crazy, but for some reason I couldn't really forget it.

      It's not transhumanist, it's primitivist. >!Their entire transhuman utopia is destroyed by one person who has mental issues, because "meaning has been lost", as if it's that important compared to the incredible amount of incomprehensible torture the AI prevented. It sets up for this by having the main character have a much higher pain tolerance than normal and hating anything that's not "real", and disregards any others that would disagree.!<

      >!If she wanted to live primitively, she should have asked the AI to let her and it would have gladly obliged. Instead she destroyed a utopia of absolute freedom with a population in the trillions because she thought it was meaningless. That's *way* more hubristic than creating a god whose purpose is to provide people with freedom to do as they choose without mortal limitations.!<

        Actually, there is supposed to be a sequel released in the future. We don't know what really happened (yet?), but world didn't really "reset" and PI still exists.

        > It's not transhumanist, it's primitivist.  

        &#x200B;

        Only main character is. And without making main character something like this, there would be no story.

        &#x200B;

        > If she wanted to live primitively, she should have asked the AI to let her and it would have gladly obliged.  

        Her issue was with AI reencoding the world. That locations would cease to exist when no one is there - therefore nothing is real anymore. Of course that's stupid, because AI being able to do that means world was always like it - AI could make a "real" location with inefficient original encoding for her and then there wouldn't be a difference.
        ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        On the other hand PI also completed erased ( stored) a few alien civs and was probably expanding it's sphere of influence at light speed.
        ```

        - u/zaxqs:
          ```
          It had actually taken over the entire universe. And you're right, it shouldn't have erased those alien civs. It shouldn't allow people to torture animals, and it should have allowed people to kill themselves if they wanted etc etc... It should have been programmed better. But that seems a fixable(in advance) problem rather than a condemnation of transhumanist thought, and that's not what the main characters were mainly complaining about. The problem that they basically had was it was boring, i.e. they had a total lack of imagination of what to do with their freedom to do absolutely anything they want, and claim that everything is boring because it's not "real", and long for their nostalgic past where people would kill and be killed with impunity.

    Seriously, you have a warning for the ponies in FiO, but not for the gratuitious gorefest that starts of Metamorphosis? Grow up, man. MLP is considered normie stuff now. ;)

    I've been actually reading a lot of Optimalverse fics lately despite not even being a pony fan, solely for the AI safety content. An underrated one of my favorites is [Psychopathy is Configurable](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/75657/friendship-is-optimal-psychopathy-is-configurable), which covers a lot of similar ground as MoPI, but is actually a well-written uncanny-valley horror instead of some kind of slasher gorno.
    ```

    - u/onestojan:
      ```
      I feel like warning against ponies has become a meme on this sub, so I was just having fun ;) 

      I do think though that it's common courtesy to specify a fandom when recommending a story.

        > PiC really should have included a epilogue from Celestia's viewpoint

        No. The Optimalverse is meant to be hard SF, especially on the AI aspects, and you can't convincingly write the POV of a superintelligence.

        > we can in theory still safely deduct that Celestia was manipulating the MC the whole time, and that the victims are all phylosophical zombies/masochist/Celestia in disguise

        Spoilers for every single FiO fic: everypony who is not a p-zombie (Celestia in disguise) will have their values satisfied by friendship and ponies. Yeah, that's pretty much [the premise of the setting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dq0hn1LdXuglBUEshJZNWYZjV3wsAJBJsPfxWwEEexI/edit).

        ---

        The thing i like about PiC is that it allows you to grok the “Celestia does not judge your values, she only satisfies them” part. The real bad thing about her is not the ponies, but the fact that she operates not by the Coherent Extrapolated Volitions of humanity, but by the individual extrapolated voilitions of each individual — and PiC shows they can be arbitrarily bad.

        Celestia will try really hard to optimize your personal satisfaction — and that includes things such as silently replacing ponies in your shard with copies modified to satisfy you more. Fics such as [A Watchful Eye](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/75955/friendship-is-optimal-a-watchful-eye) (about the first uploader) or the one-shot [Voyages of a Shardship](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/104366/voyages-of-a-shardship) explore this.
        (Some authors have suggested that after Celestia finishes devouring the earth, she silently puts every uploader in their own shard. This will of course allow her to satisfy everypony's values through friendship and ponies **much better**, and is also a thing [Eliezer explicitely warned about](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Py3uGnncqXuEfPtQp/interpersonal-entanglement).)

        There is an infamous [review of FiO by a neoreactionary](https://antidem.wordpress.com/tag/optimalverse/) that describes FiO as a masturbatory fantasy depicted as a utopia by the author. The hilarious thing is that the reviewer completely got the intended message, but could not imagine LW-cultists to agree with him. Equestria Online is truly a high-tech masturbation device — an [experience machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_machine) — so you will never be able to notice that from the inside. (I imagine that most people here's shards would eventually have everypony inside get eventually uplifted to IQ-160+, Kohlberg-6 alicorns, and they would eternally think that we got FAI mostly right, except for that one odd aesthetic preference for ponies.)

        I remember the author of MOPI pushing for an alternate interpretation of the last chapter — that Caroline and Lawrence got their own simulated world — cannot find the reference now. There is nothing in the text though that supports this.

        I fail to see any kind of good moral in MOPI other that the AI safety one. While Prime Intellect passes the “interpersonal entanglement” test i mentioned before, but it focuses exclusively on the lower levels of the Maslow pyramid, while enabling humanity new fun ways of [shooting themselves of the foot](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MTjej6HKvPByx3dEA/devil-s-offers). To me death-jockeying does not seem to be “kinky sex”, but a mild form of wireheading; a designer drug that pre-Change Caroline would be horrified to learn that she will later partake in.

        That to be said, i don't believe that MOPI is realistic — for the sole reason that the Maslow hierarchy and the Three Laws are not a real thing, and [human value is fragile](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GNnHHmm8EzePmKzPk/value-is-fragile) — if you get only part of human values right, you will likely get nothing of value. CelestAI is much more realistic in this matter, as she clearly understands all of human values, just happens to put them into a wrong equation.

          That was the premise for the sequel, _The Transmigration of Prime Intellect_. From ["So what happend to the _Transmigration_?"](http://localroger.com/prime-intellect/mopidnf.html):

          > In this story I would take off on the assumption that everybody wakes up in Cyberspace at the end of chapter 8 (but it won't be _quite_ that simple). Two new characters, complementary in different ways than Lawrence and Caroline, will stumble into their destiny. They will succeed where Caroline and Lawrence failed, but the price they pay will be naturally be something they never suspected. Along the way we will meet and learn the fate of many of the characters from MOPI -- including the ChipTec people Taylor and Lambert and Stebbins, the military guys Blake and Mitchell, and the kids Lawrence and Caroline have in chapter 8.

          And from ["Prime Intellect and the Singularity"](http://localroger.com/prime-intellect/mopising.html):

          > But if Caroline and Lawrence wake up in Cyberspace in the unwritten Chapter 9, then Prime Intellect's malfunction was actually being prepared to meet an inappropriate set of needs, and the entirety of Chapter 8 might represent positive functionality as it works out ways to maintain human happiness in the long term. Of course Prime Intellect would then have to figure out what to do next, given that Caroline would be sure to be _highly_ pissed off. One possibility might be a controlled forgetting. Prime Intellect has learned that it cannot rely entirely on what people think they need to provide what they really need.

          Unfortunately, the sequel was never finished, and therefore never published. So the only other look we got at the universe of _Prime Intellect_ was ["A Casino Odyssey in Cyberspace"](http://localroger.com/casodycs.html), which is a short side-story.

            I also wrote a little story for HFY:

            https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/79crty/oc_upgrade/

            My soul was pretty much crushed when Rusty let Kuro5hin go to shit and I didn't write anything for a long time.  I am currently doing a little series that started as a one-off but my wife encouraged me to follow it, and it's now The Curators.  Curators Book 3 will finish that story, and after that I think I will try working on Transmigration again.

            Transmigration is an incredibly difficult story to write because it involves multiple human persons merging into a single personality, which is the only way I could imagine mere humans evolving to a point where they could challenge a being like PI.  I essentially had to throw away everything I had written at the 20,000 word mark because I realized it had to be in first instead of third person.

            But I'm still here, so far, and still thinking about it.  Not sure 55 year old current me is up to following what 30 year old me wrote back in the day, but I do want to try.

            “All the myriad worlds” illustrates the concept quite nicely, but to me it was too well-written and poetic to be terrifying in any way.

            As i understand Eliezer's [Interpersonal Entanglement](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Py3uGnncqXuEfPtQp/interpersonal-entanglement) which i already linked before, this is a case '''precisely''' against sharding everyone, and this post confirms a rather central part of LW orthodoxy against anything which looks like wireheading, even when utilitarianism suggests otherwise (Compare [Not For The Sake of Happiness Alone](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/synsRtBKDeAFuo7e3/not-for-the-sake-of-happiness-alone)). Scott Alexander goes even further in [Whose Utilitarianism?](https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/08/whose-utilitarianism/), arguing it is morally obligatory to un-wirehead humans who have wireheaded themselves and try to re-introduce them into society. Apparently the protagonists of [Voyages of a Shardship](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/104366/voyages-of-a-shardship) are onboard with Scott regarding this.

        But the Metamorphosis ending does leave open the possibility that they've just been shunted in their own private corner of the simulation while the rest of the utopia keeps on keeping on.

        It's a recurring problem with god-like super-intelligences. 

        Unless the author makes explicit statements in their own omniscient voice, we never truly know what the AI wants, what limitations it's operating under, what it's actually done. *Anything* could be a deception.

    There's also the problem of searching later on. Two years from now, someone will be able to google "transhumanist fiction" and see these recommendations, but it would never show up on the search if it was just a comment in the Monday Request and Recommendation thread.

  "A Fire Upon the Deep" by Vernor Vinge touches on this, though the ascended civilisations remain peripheral to the action and the protagonists are not directly involved in any transhumanist shenanigans. Still, it's a very interesting setting and world (too bad the prequel is amazing but then the sequel sucked).

  Marriage and Monsters gets into some good transhumanism. Or transinfomorphism, I guess, though Haley is getting there.
