## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Picked up Super Supportive after a while of ignoring it and man that initial blurb on Royal royal does not do it justice. I do recommend checking it out, its a very fun read.

    Seconded. I ignored it for a long time due to the name, etc. It's really good and pretty rational.

  Can anyone report on good finds from the Royal Road writeathon? Some good fictions came out of it last year.

  I don't hear it discussed too much on here, possibly because it's published on a really annoying website, but I've been enjoying Shadow Slave. It's some kind of translation, or has a translation or non-native English vibe, but the worldbuilding and atmosphere is well done. The vibe is kind of Dark Souls meets post apocalyptic, the main character has an interesting skillset and has to squeak through a lot of really difficult situations to survive and grow in power. It's quite long, so if you get into it you'll have something to read.

  I don't recommend reading on that website, but it's the canonical link. If you're struggling to find places to read it, reach out, that's all I'll say on the topic.

    The writing is a bit funky on Shadow Slave, but I absolutely love the setting. The Dream Realm is dynamic, fantastical, and dangerous as hell. I'll easily second the recommendation.

    The author's first two languages are Ossetian and Russian, but he writes in English, from what I've gathered.

      Yes, it's actually pretty good, with some odd diction and general bad editing, but his pace of publication is very fast so I find it mostly forgivable.

    Shadow Slave has been mentioned here a few times.  I was avidly following it until about two months ago (shortly after the MC had entered the 4th nightmare).  I was constantly curious to see what happens next, until I wasn't curious anymore.  The entire Antarctica arc was interesting, but also depressing and had a somewhat unsatisfying conclusion.

    --------

    It is definitely the case that some of the word choices leave a lot to be desired. For instance, the inter-dimensional (or inter-plane) connection between normal realty on Earth and where the nightmare creatures come from is referred to as "The Spell". Whereas I tend to think of a spell as some singular magical effect, like a fireball spell, or Cure Light Wounds.

    There is also a summoned familiar named Nightmare, which is not exactly a nightmare creature.  And is not exactly related to nightmares, which are how you advance in rank (cultivation level, for humans it goes: sleeper -> awakened -> master -> saint ). Similarly, there is a summoned familiar named "Saint" who has the same rank as various saint-rank characters, but is otherwise not related. 

    There is also a second progression ladder separate from ranks based on the number of soul cores a person / creature possesses.

    The Shadow Slave wiki documents this, but it is a fandom.com site... you were warned if you don't have an ad blocker.

      I have to disagree on the first two of these. The word "spell" is a lot more flexible than you're making it out. Like a lot of magic etymology, it basically just refers to saying words. (For example, "enchantment" is basically "inward intonement" or "inward saying of words." According to the OED, the older meaning of "spell" is "a formula or verse." In the lore, the nightmare spell is, indeed, a product of someone's sorcery, so it's even pretty accurate in a prosaic sense.

      Perhaps his use of "nightmare" is confusing given his other uses of the term, but a mythical steed that visits dreams is where we get our own term for bad dreams, so it's not an inappropriate word choice on its own. Obvious, but a mare is a horse.

      I do agree the two sets of words for analogous systems (for monsters and humans) are confusing.

    I don't think I *get* RR's writathon. I sort of thought of it as an off-brand NaNoWriMo, until I saw a story which proudly listed that it was a participant in six consecutive writathons. So it's not really a NaNoWriMo situation, is more just... a story which has releases during the month? Doesn't that make the "ongoing" list and the "writathon participants" list nearly identical?
    ```

    - u/hi____nsa:
      ```
      I'm not sure about that particular author's situation, but I know for fact that for a fic I was writing to be included in the writeathon it had to start during the writeathon and hit a certain word limit. Fics that started before the writeathon were not allowed. 

      They might have changed the rules for certain writeathons, but the general spirit has always been to push new writers to try writing something and for old writers to use the opportunity as chance to start something fresh.
      ```

    - u/Amonwilde:
      ```
      You have to hit a minimum word count, which is usually higher than a story would usually publish. So it's not just ongoing fics, or it would have many more participants.
      ```

    ```
    I would like to recommend [To the stars](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/76430/to-the-stars). 

    It has been very interesting so far.

    >Alex Orz was a normal sort of guy.  It was just that abnormal things kept happening to him

    After a lifetime of strange things happening to him, finally the strangest one happened. He was abducted from Earth by a space-exploiting megacorporation and put to work on an impossibly large space-train, He has been given the task of fixing, well, everything.
    ```

    - u/-main:
      ```
      I will check it out. 

      Someone should inform the author though that, while it is a touch generic and might reasonably reoccur, that name has been in use for quite some time by a [lengthy, high-quality, and ongoing work](https://archiveofourown.org/works/777002/chapters/130325554]) (which I *highly* recommend).  If they want to fight for the name, I don't think this new RR one will win, just saying.

          Right. Well, let's throw them into a pit melee, and may best work of fiction win. Everyone else can take qualifiers or extra words for their name. I'm rooting for the Madoka fanfic, even if it's got poor odds...

        The first SF author to use "To the Stars" as a title (that I know of) was L. Ron Hubbard. His novel was serialized in *Astounding* in February-March 1950 and appeared as a standalone book in 1954. The next one was [Robert Moore Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Moore_Williams), a prolific second-tier genre author, who used the same title on a short story published in *Fantastic Story Magazine* in May 1953.

  Here's a few stories I started reading on RR. They aren't all good but they are interesting and I'd say worth trying. 

  [Eye Opener](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/74400/eye-opener) is about a Kickstarter ARG that went silent for a few years and suddenly came out with a closed beta. The protagonist plays the game for the hell of it, and finds out that it's weird and mysterious. Kinda reminds me of a mix of magik online and Dice the cube that changes everything. The dialogue and characterization is very good, but imo the mystery feels a bit *too* stretched out, and sometimes the fact that these people are so serious about a (seemingly) video game takes me out of it. I recommend it though. 

  [Archmagion](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/73861/archmagion) is a secondary world urban fantasy. The protagonist awakens to an intrinsic ability to do magic, and decides to become what are basically superheroes. The setting and worldbuilding is very well done, it's a very interesting combination of magic surveillance state with a high wealth disparity, but also magic being used in every facet of life. The writing chops are there, but the story feels a bit too YA with how the author handles characterization. Maybe the author takes the story seriously later on, but I found the comedy to be a bit too much when contrasted with the amount of fridge horror the author casually throws around. There's also a romance subplot that imo happens way too fast to feel natural. I have only read to about 2.6 though, so not far enough to know whether or not these things get better. 

  [The Homunculus Knight](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/48770/the-homunculus-knight?sorting=newest) has a dark medieval feel to the setting, while also having pretty progressive values. It's a weird combination that... kinda worked for me. It's about a paladin that travels around the country bringing proper rest to undead. The story starts by him visiting a town that's under the control of vampire nobility, and finding some funky stuff going on. The author has some cool ideas, but the writing and character interactions weren't all that good to me, so I stopped reading.

    Thirding Eye Opener. Picked it up because of this rec and couldn't put it down. The characters feel very real and remind me a bit of my own friend group. I could totally imagine events of the story happening to me, down to "taking it a bit too seriously."

  Found a great worm fanfic recently: [*Fun-house Mirror*](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/fun-house-mirror.963049/threadmarks) / [*Knock Off, The*](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-knock-off.973687/threadmarks) by WafflesAndCoffee (120K+ WL so far). 

  It has thematic and stylistic similarities to [*Rick and Morty S05E10*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/RickAndMortyS5E10RickamuraiJack) and [*Transdimensional Brain Chip*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TransdimensionalBrainChip) (prot's speech style, methinks).

  PROs:

  * great plot, characters
  * no canon stations
  * the dialogue is hilarious at times
  * characters aren't as sanitised in regards to sexuality as in many other fics

  CONs:

  * some minor typos and grammar errors
  * not finished yet
  * (?)some intrinsic wormverse implications and setting elements

  ####(2)

  On the other hand, [*Back and Forth*](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/back-and-forth-oc.1055118/threadmarks) by TryingItOut (200K+ WL) isn't as good plot- / prose-wise, but has great fight scenes.

      I find that Back and Forth has two important problems: An unappealing start and big hiatus periods. 

      Aside from that it's a surprisingly funny and interesting story, with a neuroatypical MC that's not (only) used for laughs.
