  The "how not to get killed by the monster" video was great. Especially "if it looks like you want to have sex with it, you don't" and "broke rule 7". 

  For something as high-quality as this series has been, you get a lot less love around here than I think you should. The Black Swan arc is not really to my tastes, but it's well written enough to enjoy anyway. The rest of it is excellent.

    Thank you.

    I think the range of reactions is natural, and Fall wasn't intended just as rational fiction--it's a big, sprawling, science fiction superhero fantasy adventure mystery thriller bildungsroman romance with picaresque asides, set in an inherently messy world.  And it's not tightly focused.  People are going to like (and dislike) different parts of it, and some are going to stop reading because some particular element makes the whole thing not work for them.

    There are people who like Black Swan and hate the romantic elements, people who like the relationships but find the physics tedious, people who have no trouble with superheros and monsters, but who find the UPPfones break their personal willing suspension of disbelief, and folks who are here for the plasma and shockwaves when Flicker cuts loose, and wish there were more of that and less of all the talking 8-).

    And that's all fine.  I started writing for myself--everyone else was a bonus.  Even if a reader likes just 'Phone Tag', 'Zenith', and chapters 29-33 of Call, they've still gotten enjoyment from my writing.
