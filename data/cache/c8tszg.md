  For anyone who doesn't recognize who Will Wight is, he's the author of the Cradle series. This means that July 4th, the entire series will be free!

      Will has four largely independent series:

      * Cradle: starts with Unsouled, is the series everyone recommends
      * Traveller's Gate: Will's first published series, starts with House of Blades. It's very good IMO, has a bunch of really interesting magic systems.
      * Elder Empire, series A: starts with Of Shadow and Sea, is about a largely amoral assassin lady. She occasionally runs in to the guy in EE series B. 
      * Elder Empire, series B: starts with Of Sea and Shadow, is about a fantasy Malcolm Reynolds type sea captain. He occasionally runs in to the lady in EE series A.

      Cradle is westernized xianxia, Traveller's Gate is pretty standard heroic fantasy, and Elder Empire is kinda pirates vs ninjas vs lovecraftian elder gods. 

      All of these series can be read independently of each other, though Cradle is kind of poised to become Will's Gunslinger (the story that ties all his world's together).

      The two EE series are a bit more closely intertwined, but you can still read them in isolation of each other.

        Is this just speculation based on the scale of the Cradle setting, or are the current books already linked together?

          ```
          They're linked by one of the entities in Cradle series.

            Oh, cool. If I've read all of Cradle and Traveller's Gate but not EE, have I just missed it?
            ```

            - u/RedLetterDay:
              ```
              Easy to miss - in one of the first Cradle books S mentions how they will always try to protect 4 different iterations above all. Cradle was the first, second and third are EE and TG... Fourth was the core iirc

  Until seeing the comments, I parsed this as ([(Free Will)] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will) [(Wight)]  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wight)) Books, rather than Free ((Will Wight) Books), since 'free will' is such common phrase.

    "Free Will Wight is a series of existential fantasy novels exploring the adventures of an independent-minded spirit who haunts a graveyard full of dead Calvinists.  The first book, *Who Controls the Zombie?,* debuted to widespread critical acclaim in 2009."

    Free Will is an illusion, but Free Will Wight books are not!

  Will W. Books got what he deserved, and letting him go free would be a miscarriage of justice.

  Having now read most of Unsouled, I think I can safely say that Xianxia is not for me. All the *constant* whining about honor got tedious quickly, as did the unending constantly escalating power levels. How on Earth am I meant to take any of this seriously?
  ```

  - u/Penumbra_Penguin:
    ```
    The whole power level thing seemed pretty weird to me, too. There are tons of books where the main character and their friends are at power level X and they need to beat the evil villain who is power level X+2, but this is hopeless, so they go on a quest to get to power level X+1 and then are really clever / lucky / teamwork-y, so they manage to beat the villain. Does it really matter if X is a bit higher for each book in a series?

    To be fair, the books are light and fun so I enjoy reading them anywhere, and it's possible that the large-scale plot will make the power level stuff worthwhile.

    Also to be fair, it might just be that the power levels in this series were too explicit to be believable. I do like, for instance, Worm, and that's got pretty constantly-escalating stakes.

      > Does it really matter if X is a bit higher for each book in a series?

      The real issue for me is that instead of X rising for each book, it seems to rise every couple of chapters. Lindon is weak compared to the copper guy, who's weak compared to his father, who's weak compared to the clan elder, who's weak compared to the school of Heavenly Glory, who's weak compared to Yerin. 

      Every time the story takes a moment to assure me "this new guy is exponentially more powerful than the last guy", I struggle to take it seriously because I know I won't even have time to get settled into this new dynamic before I'll be introduced to someone new who's exponentially more powerful than *them*.
      ```

        Yep, agreed.

        (And looking at my last post, the portion you quoted was supposed to mean "... so I don't see why the series focuses on it so much", not "... so I don't see why you're complaining about it".)
