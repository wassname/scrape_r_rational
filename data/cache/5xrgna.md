  Oh My Goddess! This series doesn't have plot armor!?! If this is true, I will so happy....although I'm waiting to see a dead body first.

  Funny, I never thought I would actually *wish* for a favorite character to die. Sorry Norman, but in the interest of top-quality writing, you need to go.

    Why  Norman has to die for the writing to be good?

      I think it's more that the commenter means "main character heads to certain death only to make it out anyway" is an overused trope to say the least.

        Exactly!

  I wonder if there is some information that we could get from the numbers in the kids and in Isabelle and krone
  ```

    I vaguely remember someone analyzing it in a different thread before.

    If I remember correctly the numbers correspond to what farm you're from and then individually IDs you from there. Someone guessed that Sister Krone and Mama Isabel are from the same farm based off those numbers.

    But I didn't actually check into it myself and I don't have a link. So, you know... grain of salt.

  ```
  Say does anyone have experience with parkour to be able to tell whether Norman's rope trick to get to the top of the wall is feasible or not?
  ```

  Wow. 

  I really don't know if Norman is going to get out of this. How much is plot armor worth in this series, and who actually has it? 

  I guess we're about to find out.
