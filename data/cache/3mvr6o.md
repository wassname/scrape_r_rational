## A more rational line of Inquisition

### Post:

You are the Inquisitor, alleged Herald of Andraste and last, best hope for the people of Thedas. However, it occurs to you that while the plans of your subordinates might work, you might do things more.. sensibly.

That's right, it's rational Inquisition! Assume in character knowledge only - that is, no "real world" knowledge. Use what's in the setting only. And have fun!

  This might be an interesting post if you gave any sort of context for it. In addition, even when referencing an outside work, it's best to give an overview of the more critical elements like the setting and characters involved. With a canon to reference and sufficient background to describe our character's ends and means, we have enough to work with. The post as it is is like throwing a two-week-old kitten into a pool and saying "Have fun!" with roughly the same tone as the end of your post.

    I can't even guess which work it's referencing. Warhammer?

      Dragon Age. I only found that out by googling "Inquisition Andraste."
