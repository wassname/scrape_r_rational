## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  The first meeting of my Applied Bayes group went pretty well! Thanks to those who offered [mascot suggestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dekobl/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/f2yg8c2/)! Advertising the group was a bit *too* successful, if anything -- the classroom we were in was packed, with people having to line up along the walls. I think that contributed to its major failing: it went well for a *lecture* but not a *discussion*, and the 5-10 people who participated primarily engaged in 1-on-1 conversations with me instead of the broader audience. For some reason a solid third of the attendees consisted of math / stats PhDs, postdocs, & PIs, despite my advertising the group as 'beginner friendly' and 'non-rigorous'\*. That probably didn't help overall math anxieties (a lot of questions to me were prefaced with 'this is probably really stupid / basic / simple').

  Gonna try a few things to open people up in the next meeting and make it more group discussion-y (e.g. include alcoholic options in the snacks / refreshments). We'll see how it goes.

  Also chatted to a director of the broader program and was told that while I definitely wouldn't be competitive for their "*senior* research data analyst" positions, if I were to stick around I should definitely consider applying to their *junior* role. Which gives me hope that after graduation I won't be hopelessly unemployed & destitute (or, well, mooching off my wife's residency stipend wherever the match puts us).

  \*(where they were for the previous, more technical iteration idk. Although it can't just be the level of rigor -- my deep learning group from last year was decidedly basic & received a tenth the interest, if that)

  edit: in unrelated news, we recently upgraded our coffee machine to a Breville Barista Express (BES870XL) and I've been really enjoying my morning lattes. Coffee connoisseurs might scoff, but to my indelicate palate the shots I pull are definitely comparable to those I get from the 10x as expensive grinder & espresso machine we have at work. Big fan of it overall!

  Just completed my first marathon! Happy to have finished, not so happy I was mentally weak and walked some parts so I missed my time. I really thought all the "20 miles is the first half" comments were jokes, but they weren't.

  I would recommend any lower impact exercise over running, but I do think the marathon was a good experience in self suffering for me.

  - u/LazarusRises:

    Thanks for your perspective. I've run a couple of halves with minimal excruciating pain and managed to hit my goal for both of them, but a marathon is another beast entirely. It's on my bucket list but my drive to train needs some serious work.

  There's something I've been thinking about and maybe I'll make a topic later if it warrants it.

  &#x200B;

  Basically munchkinry tends to be either immoral, or illegal IRL. e.g tax evasion, cheating, manipulation, lying, deadbeat dads, cuckoldry, nepotism etc. Those are all in some way or another exploits that if used with proper planning and creatively could give an immoral actor big advantages with little to no risk.

  &#x200B;

  Yet we inherently consider those things immoral, even if rationally some could be used while causing little harm and suffering. Do you think characters in stories where munchkinry is possible in ways we don't consider immoral would see them as inherently immoral ?

  &#x200B;

  It's interesting, because when you actually think about potential exploits in our own world in a vacuum without our biased morality lenses, many do exist and could be easily applied but most good people would never even consider using them. We just see them as inherently immoral and evil.

  &#x200B;

  Our rational MCs attempting to exploit anything would probably be either severely reprimanded, ostracized, or jailed, for even suggesting the use of said munchkinry. To the npcs it'd likely be akin a colleague casually suggesting you team up to scare some travelers into giving you some snacks, and justifying it by saying the travelers will barely miss it and nobody will actually get hurt.

      Great comment. This is why we should share our thoughts people..

      &#x200B;

      Some examples of less commonly used real life munchkins that some of us could actually apply and why most people don't use them:

      * Skill focused learning. (It's hard, and requires access to information and enough humility to be willing to learn).
      * Exercising. (it's hard, requires a system, habit or planning to do consistently, requires being comfortable standing out).
      * Live frugally, save money, retire early. A.k.a FIRE (Saving money is hard, living frugally is hard, having high paying jobs accelerates the process by a lot).
      * Hire people to work for you, pay them less than they make you, get free money, repeat until it becomes inefficient. (What most businesses are built on, requires an efficient way to turn labor hours into money, it's hard and risky).
      * Buy a duplex, or bigger as your first home. With some special loans for first time home buyers people can buy houses that actually make them money and live for free without needing insane amounts of money. (Saving money is hard, credit ratings, lack of information, housing market needs to be good, people have different priorities when buying homes \[neighborhoods, school districts, location, status\]).

      If anybody has more of these, please share them with us ;)

        I'm honestly not really seeing the point you're trying to make.

        To quote SMBC on this, "You already know all the good advice. Brush your teeth, exercise regularly, save money. There's no secret trick, you just need the discipline to do it."
        ```

        Economies of scale to get more for less effort - need to coordinate more people to work towards a bigger goal, any risk is magnified by the bigger size of the project, flooding the market could crash the price.

        Marry a rich person to get rich - tons of competition, feeds into the problems of socioeconomic inequality (rich people have better selection of mates to choose from), spouse has reduced incentive to be faithful.

        Hypnotize yourself into the ideal person - hypnosis isn't as powerful as people think, risk of unintended side effects, risk of delusion.

        Start a cult that does good things - likely to backfire, successful cults tend to have sociopathic leaders that teach insane things.

        Train the brain to work like a computer then "download" skill books and study them in your sleep - brains are bad at memorizing large amounts of data, you'd need megabytes worth to be much use.

      An example of immoral munchkins in fiction is necromancy, isn’t it? It’s basically free labor that can enhance productivity, but is seen as distasteful because of the raising the dead thing.
      ```

  - u/xachariah:
    ```
    It would have to depend on the situation.  IRL, we can't munchkin anything because all the low hanging fruit has already been taken.  The only things left to munchkin are things that are immoral.  I think the same holds true for fictional worlds.

    However, a lot of the time characters are able to munchkin because they're categorically different than the the non-main-character.  In HPMOR, Harry can munchkin because he's got access to a unique depth of knowledge.  In Worm, Taylor can munchkin because she's the only one able to control a million bugs at once.  In MoL, Zorian can munchkin due to multiple unique circumstances.

    But in D&D where anyone can create an infinite loop of Wish spells?  You better believe there's a reason nobody does that, and your best case scenario is a quick and painful death instead of a more eternal punishment.
    ```

  - u/RetardedWabbit:
    ```
    You're cherry picking examples using the criteria of munchkin AND illegal/immoral, when you should be looking for legal munchkins of which there are plenty but they are pretty "common sense". 

    Most real life munchkin's are just specialized professionals, like corporate accountants. Corporations are great at munchkining within the law to maximize profit. For example there's a government grants for the common person munchkin named Matthew Lesko, he publishes books and has a website to help people find and get government grants for things you would never think there are grants for like LASIK.

    Most of life's optimizations for laypeople are small, or have high costs. We still have revolutions from new optimizations, but they aren't as dramatic as in fiction.

    I used to think that things like eg. manipulating others by telling anything but the literal truth was somehow morally wrong. The problem was - I actually acted on that belief and the results were horrible for me and the people I cared about. So clearly there is some “munchkinry” (ie; using your brain) which is totally fine to apply to everyday situations. But you’re right that stories tend to focus on combative situations because, ... uh... it’s more interesting?

    I’ll give you an example of “munchkinry” applied to the real world that I did: the scenario was that I was depressed and my flatmate’s cat (which he loved) was missing. For me, it was a substantial effort just to get up and make breakfast (as things are when one is depressed) and I saw a brief glimpse of the cat while doing so. I wasn’t close with my flatmate - we pretty much did our own thing. But I thought - if I write a quick text (30sec of my time) that’s gonna make his day (and I quickly got a reply saying exactly that), and since I myself enjoy making people happy then it improves my mood significantly too. This, pretty much costlessly, has in all probability made both me and my flatmate significantly more productive (him because less cat worry and me because good start to day where I accomplished something real) - and all it took was a quick text.

    When you look at it like that, it seems like an impossible hack - two people getting something (long-lasting benefits) from essentially nothing. But I find the point of view which produces these results in the real world is rare.
    ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Aside for u/xachariah's (quite accurate) answer, I'd say people do munchkin and get rewarded for it in real life.

    We live in a culture that places a high value on entrepreneurs, and especially start-up makers, people who see an optimization that hasn't been done before and think of ways to apply it at scale.

    We have a vibrant, extremely developed ecosystem for finding these people and giving them guidance, funding and leverage; in some countries, we even have the government treating these people has a strategic assets worth subsidizing.

    This is nothing new either. The concept of entrepreneurship, and gathering capital to invest in upscaling new innovations is in large part what led to the industrial revolution.

  So I just finished Storm Front by Jim Butcher on Audible. I enjoyed the narrator but the character himself was wobbling back and forth between me enjoying him and me calling him an idiot.

   Does the series/character improve as it goes on? He seems to handle the idiot ball in quite a few ways that I wouldnt expect someone that describes themselves as a "powerful and experienced wizard" would. 

  I DID enjoy him as a person though. His humor is dry enough that I enjoy it and I like that he doesnt just complain about everything the whole time.

  Secondary point, Ive listened to The Nightmare Stacks by Charles Stross on a recommendation from a few users here. How is the rest of the series comparatively? I was thinking of getting book one and reading through them all.

      Dresden is pretty rational but not extremely intelligent, I think. His emphasis on preparation is very strong. The inciting event of Ghost Story is a particularly strong example. He also regularly attacks problems with a [hacker mindset](https://old.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/c0nqg7/people_seem_to_think_thieves_should_lockpick_or/er6huvz/?context=2), IIRC, although no examples come to mind since I haven't read any of the books in a few years. Having values such that he's not willing to sacrifice innocents to save innocents doesn't speak to the quality of his thought processes, so I don't think you should count it against him.
      ```

  - u/kraryal:
    ```
    It's worth pointing out that the earlier books have a different main character, but the quality is pretty consistent throughout. Perhaps the Jennifer Morgue is an exception; I enjoyed that one the least as it didn't seem to follow the rules of the setting as closely as I'd have expected.   


    Reading from the beginning gives a lot of nice running jokes and back-references, it's probably worth it.
    ```

  - u/VorpalAuroch:
    ```
    Dresden gets better at taking exploits and power as the series goes on, and matures into the talent he has at the beginning. But the people around him are the rational ones - Johnny Marcone, though he falls in prominence, and Thomas Raith, who is introduced in Grave Peril (book 3). If you read through Grave Peril or already know the important spoilers about Thomas ( >!he's Harry's half-brother!< ), then check out the novella focused on him, which is called Backup and is published alone and in the collection Side Jobs. (Be warned, the short description of the novella on its Amazon page reveals that spoiler.) It talks about a secret Masquerade-within-the-Masquerade with a war which is conducted much more like a rationalist story.

  Do we ever see a sith deflect blaster bolts? I'm not sure how often we ever see them getting shot at in the first place, but I had the thought and didn't immediately feel like going through a days worth of movies. I guess video games or the tv series-es is acceptable, but i'm primarily thinking of the movies.

      Oh yeah and in the opening of episode 4 when he's crushing the Rebels. He uses his hand in both occasions though. And whatever Kylo Ren did at the start of episode 7 with the freezing of the bolt. There really aren't that many times where they got shot at unless i'm forgetting some.
