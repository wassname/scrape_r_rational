## [RT][C] Porry Hatter - a Russian HPMOR predecessor from 2002

### Post:

I want to share with you an English translation of the book I loved as a kid. Despite being a straight up Harry Potter parody, I consider it to be a predecessor of modern ratfic genre. It also contains a fair-play whodunnit mystery, so give it a try! The translation is not mine, but it looks okay from what I've seen.

Intro blurb:

>A literary parody on the famous Harry Potter book series provides an unexpected point of view on the world described by J.K. Rowling. Porry Hatter is an ordinary boy from the prosperous wizarding family. Shortly after his birth, his parents were shocked to discover that he has no wizarding powers at all. Meanwhile, Lord Mordevolt, the renegade wizard, is terrorizing the wizarding world; he believes that the future of the humanity lies in scientific progress, and therefore, all wizards must be turned into moodles, or otherwise, people incapable of using magic. But the attempt of demagizing little Porry ends up with the downfall of Woe of Wizards; Mordevolt loses all his powers, and all them are transferred to Porry. 11 years later, instead of enchanting, conjuring and casting spells, Porry is obsessed with building anti-gravity devices, conducting chemical experiments, and turning his magic wand into a proton radiator. Hatter visits the Perverts Wizarding School just to be expelled as soon as possible and to go an enroll to the communications college. But the dramatic whirlpool of events changes everythingâ€¦

  ```
  Rational magic goes back to the '50s at least with Randall Garret's _Lord D'Arcy_ series, and Fletcher Pratt and L. Sprague de Camp's _Compleat Enchanter_ series. Arguably some of Dean Koontz' work qualifies as well.

  Reminds me of [The Last Ringbearer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Ringbearer).

  I knew HPMOR was popular in Russia which makes sense if there was a sort of prequel ahah!

- u/darkaxel1989:
  ```
  I heard it was full of russian propaganda, things like elves being freed and now not finding anything usefull to do and start stealing and being lazy instead of being productive. Sounds like a fun book, but I don't know how much I'd put it in "rational" category
