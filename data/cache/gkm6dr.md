  Wooow. I just got this.

  >The war hadn't evolved beyond minor skirmishes in New Zealand but the entire country and most of the world was under lockdown. No one was allowed to leave their homes unless it was absolutely necessary or they felt bored.

  The hard-hitting realism is what makes this fic what it is.


  But seriously, Jesus _Christ_ Mrs. Jewel. An incredibly wretched and piteous portrait of a woman broken by her inability to connect with her daughter.

  And Mahuika is almost an alien intelligence. She doesn't seem to want or need or notice things like maternal affection. Her priorities and thought processes differ from ours _radically._

  But I mean, we knew that. She vapes. She _vapes_. She **_VAPES_**--

  > Marama reached into her pocket and recovered a soft hairy egg. She found a good patch of dirt on the roadside and forced it into the ground, where it sprouted into a large tame Kiwi bird.

  Ooof, some hard hits at NZ's island naming schemes
  ```

- u/Fruan:
  ```
  An extremely minor quibble on the naming of the islands of New Zealand - You would never say "took the ferry to South Island". You would say "took the ferry to the South Island". In speach they really are treated like descriptions rather than names. It's super weird.    
  Other than that very minor point, absolutely everything in this chapter about the naming scheme for New Zealand is completely 100% true and had me laughing harder than I ought to admit.
  ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  The story is getting really sloppy though. I mean, these margins of error are *ridiculously* permissive.

  ```
  > The Auckland Islands are a tiny archipelago in New Zealand. The largest island in the Auckland Islands is Auckland Island. Auckland, the most populous city in New Zealand, is not located on Auckland Island, which is in the Auckland Islands. No one lives on the Auckland Islands.

  I was very surprised to find with a quick Google that this is actually true.

  What's more, one of the Auckland Islands is called Disappointment Island.  If that detail had been included I might not have googled at all, as it would have assumed it was all 100% made up.

  What even is reality.

  > Mr. Fantasticer Fox's true identity was a secret, even from Marama's family, and whenever he came over to see Marama they met in Mahuika's room. It was the most secure room in the house, since no one aside from Mahuika ever went there, with a one Marama margin of error.

  Does this mean that Mr. Fantasticer Fox is either Marama or Mahuika?

  - u/gazemaize:
    ```
    No, no one in the Jewel family.

  I just binged through this fanfic yesterday.... and today I watched Snowpiercer followed by a YouTube video explaining how Snowpiercer is a sequel to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, then I saw this fanfic updated.  Oh and last week I read a roleplay of Matilda getting Isekai’d into Years of the Trees Valinor and meeting Feanor as a child.  It’s an interesting juxtaposition going on inside my head...

  So yeah this chapter was great, except I want more.  Is that ungrateful?   Sorry not sorry, because this story is so good I would always want more.  Please don’t kick me off the tour into the rationalized Roald Dahl universe.

- u/immortal_lurker:
  ```
  Man this story pivots, and pivots hard. I was not expecting to read the story of a mother having her heart broken, and a child who couldn't feel anything.
  ```

- u/IICVX:
  ```
  Is "Makuika" a typo for Mahuika?
  ```

- u/wren42:
  ```
  the hitler "subversive story" is interesting, given Dahl was openly anti-semitic.
  ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  I took me two readings to realize what Mr Fantasticer Fox's secret identity was.
  ```

  - u/cthulhusleftnipple:
    ```
    Maybe I'm being stupid but isn't Mr Fantasticer Fox obviously... Fantastic Mr. Fox? Like, this doesn't seem like a deep clever hidden name, no? What am I missing?
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      I thought it was just a regular fox, but that works too.

        I don't know. Sounds like the kind of whackadoodle reasoning that could lead somebody to believe President Definitely-Not-A-Sentient-Table was a wooden kitchen table.

      Yeah this has been my impression the entire time.
