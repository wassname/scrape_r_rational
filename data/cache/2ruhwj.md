  *That's plenty of power.*

  So in the next chapter, Voldemort tries to talk his way out of a Box.

    "Voldemort tries to talk his way out of a Box." - this made me laugh :)

    edit: Though nobody has the ability to let anything out of The Box yet.

      This will probably be the only thing that saves them.

        This is MOR!Voldemort.  He'll invent a way with Harry's help, even if it is impossible for him to think of entirely new things.  On the plus side, this might help save everyone else.

          True, he cannot innovate. But it's canon that he's been planning for over half a century. Even with a lack of innovation, he will still have access to his past innovations. And based on his note, he's bound to have already created multiple plans based around his death, which he will still have access to. In addition, I believe, based on what was said, that ghosts can still deductively reason, especially if they've spent enough of their life time doing this, even if they can't learn, or spawn entirely new ideas.

      As somebody said in another thread, he has 2+ horcruxes And the ritual to restore them
      ```

      - u/kaukamieli:
        ```
        If the dementor ate his soul and it didn't go to ether, he shouldn't be found by the stone. IF destroying the dementor freed him to go to ether, the horcruxes should also work already so he is out of the box anyway. If he is summoned as a soul, it shouldn't in itself do anything with the horcruxes.
        ```

    ```
    You know, when Cadmus started reporting *his memories of prior summonings*, I think Harry should probably have asked what Riddle talked with him about.  (Because surely he would have gone for Cadmus as well.)

  I kinda hope this fanfic isn't ending. Want more.

  This is awesome. Can't wait to meet Quirrell again. :)
