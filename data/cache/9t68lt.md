## [Biweekly Challenge] Spooky

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9p3joo/biweekly_challenge_afterlife/) the prompt was "Afterlife". Our winner is /u/Aabcehmu112358, with their story, ["Here"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9p3joo/biweekly_challenge_afterlife/e8h6skm/). Congratulations to /u/Aabcehmu112358!

##### This Time

This time, the challenge will be **Spooky**. We did "Rational Horror" three years ago, so you can do something in that vein if you'd like, but ideally it should give a case of the spooks, whether or not it's actually "horror" per se. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, November 13th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided. (This mostly applies to calling for outside parties to vote.)

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

##### Next Time

Next time, the challenge will be **Tragedy of the Commons**. The [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) refers to a situation in which individuals acting in their own self-interest destroy a commonly held good, to their own eventual detriment. For the game theory form, see the [CC-PP game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CC%E2%80%93PP_game).

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 11/14**. Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or chit-chat [is available here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9t6lv7/challenge_companion_spooky/?).

    Please forgive this ignorant peon.  What the heck was scary about that story?  There's something I'm completely missing about the simulations

      I think the implication here was that the sapient life being simulated wasn't merely a statistic, and the actual qualia being simulated in that last case was (eight million years of) suffering.

        Interesting, thanks. I had understood that the simulation was supposed to accidentally be sentient life but had no idea why they were allegedly suffering.

        That link helped, thanks

    (It would be nice if Mark put in some time to make an analytic dashboard that measured Dukkha; rather, it threatens my suspension of disbelief that no one has thought to do this in all the dashboard-making that has happened so far, particularly that no ethics committees have been involved in doing this, specifically in that Mark represents that some people do think about and worry about Dukkha.)

    &#x200B;

    ((Or maybe the dashboards were all home-coded by the other small-sample-size number of researchers--in which case there's even more reason for it to be plausible that he could make another one himself--and Mark is the first person introduced to them who cares about that (as many others do), putting him in the position of a subject of a Milgram experiment; in that sense, it's a fun alternative-headcanon to imagine that the whole thing is actually a psychology experiment studying *him* (and presumably others like him), to see the horrors that he could be convinced to do with a minimum of duress.))

    &#x200B;

    For myself, I liked the delayed-horror aspect of the built-in pause for looking up the terms, to first understand what they're taling about--'oh, the values they care about are low, and he's worried about some other value they aren't measuring'--and then to look up the unfamiliar terms and find out how cataclysmic (there should be a better word) the thing they're discussing is.

    &#x200B;

    The only major misunderstanding I had is that for 'straight lines at zero' I was imagining the (0,0) coordinate, and without quite understanding, the true meaning didn't click until the word 'flatlines' later on.  Taking a problem solely on my end as the null hypothesis, wording such as 'always at zero' or 'almost never rises above zero' might have been understood faster.

    &#x200B;

    I was amused at my emotional reaction in that I felt the most horror at the suggestion that someone might want to *turn it off*, representing the extinguishing of so many minds (in contrast with messing with it to try to improve things)--though it's also possible that the term could be used for a resume-possible action.  That said, the suggested reaction to it being turned off sounded in line with having to start all over again (losing all the time/resources already put into it), rather than just wasting a little time until the decision could be made.

    &#x200B;

    ...I'm imagining two people, one apathetically doing nothing, and one looking over with pity and concern and 'compassion' as he steps nearer and nearer holding an axe and the thing I'm screaming most at the first person is to *save me from him* and the incredible relief as she holds him back...

    Hello,

    I found this quite interesting but I am not aware of most of the technical terms used and therefore may have missed the significance of this exchange:  
    >“But look, Jess. Sentience emerges here.” He pointed at the Atman chart. “And sapience here. What do you see?”   
    “I see... a straight line.  
    "You’re absolutely right, Jess. Atman is a straight line. At zero. That’s my whole point. There’s a tiny blip here, see, maybe half a million years after the emergence of sapience. Since then, nothing.”  
    “So what?”  
     “It’s not just Atman. It’s Bodhi and Dhyana and... It’s all of them, Jess! They’re all straight lines at zero.”  




    I did google some of the terms, read the wiki on Dukkha, and understand them somewhat now. But I still can't intuitively get the horror that Mark feels; I don't completely understand why he's horrified and I want to. So far, i understand that the sims are suffering, but how sapience and sentience plays a part, idk. 


    Would it be possible for you to give me some insights?
    ```

    - u/SamuelTailor:
      ```
      The idea was that the simulations are complete, real universes. The software recognizes and identifies the emergence of sentience, or the ability to feel, which means animal life, and also sapience, the ability to think, which means human (or human-like) life. Animals can suffer (Dukkha) and humans can suffer even more.

      The software also tracks positive qualities that emerge among the thinking population, including soul (Atman), enlightenment (Bodhi), and successful meditation (Dhyana). I used Hindu and Buddhist terms because I was hoping to show a society that pulls the best ideas from multiple cultures, but using these terms was a mistake; they're too obscure. 

      The simulations are supposed to help the researchers (Diaz and her students) identity universes that have high levels of positive qualities. This would help them figure out what actions/approaches lead to successful universes. Like running a drug trial on an entire universe rather than on a mouse. Today, a failed drug trial means a mouse dies of cancer. In this dystopian future, a failed simulation means a quadrillion thinking beings suffer for eight million years.

      The bigger idea was to show how our moral wisdom doesn't scale with our technology-enhanced power. Jess and Mark are literally gods. They control universes containing quadrillions of thinking beings. But they prioritize their own plans, their own skins, their own careers. Now, this is insane from a utilitarian point of view, but makes sense based on how humans actually make choices. I find that disconnect disturbing (think of the insane moral quandaries companies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook are facing; their decisions impact billions of people). 

      In other words, because of biases like scope neglect and vividness, our brains may simply not be able to make moral decisions correctly in a highly technological world (the White Christmas episode of Black Mirror is a particularly chilling example, IMO). 

      Obviously, I didn't explain any of this clearly in the story. Therefore, the story fails, but hopefully it is a failure I can learn from. My apologies for the poor writing.

        This story tackles a concept that I've been rolling on the top of my brain for quite some time. And I think your story doesn't even come close to the actual depths of horror that would be possible in such a world, or in such a future. What if a sadist simulated human minds only to fill them with suffering, just to get fleeting satisfaction out of it? What if the amount of suffering a simulated mind was capable of feeling had no upper bound? What if the sadist had hardware powerful enough to simulate trillions of minds? What if, in order to keep up with their progressive desensitisation, the sadist increased the suffering of those simulated minds in increments? In increasing increments?

        And related to that, what if you combine this problem with the tech to copy the brain of a person onto a digital support? How improbable would it be that key people in political or military roles were briefly sedated, copied, and then have their secrets tortured out of them in the safety and darkness of the torturer's PC?

        These thoughts are not imminent enough to keep me up at night, but they come close.
        ```

        - u/SamuelTailor:
          ```
          yes. completely agree.

          edit: Actually, let me caveat that slightly. I worry that what you describe will not solely be done by sadists. It may be done in ignorance, because we haven't evolved to view simulations as real beings. It may also be done - or aided and abetted - by people like you and me, people who think they're good, but who, in the moment, will face enormous internal and external pressure to bow to expediency or comfort or the status quo or fear or the idea that "I can't make a difference so why bother".

        hey, no worries! thanks for explaining. It was interesting.
