  What a weird and confusing sociology.

  I want to hug Arthur a lot. Metaphorically. By which I mean leave them alone to do the stuff they enjoy. Possibly talk about exciting tech topics.

  It's kind of weird that the best this future can do about "this person does not want to play social games" is "force them to play social games anyways."

  It kind of has a Rapture of the Nerds ambience of "just because this is _future_ doesn't mean it's _better_".

    Note that the future in question is heterogeneous. It's not the best that the future can do, it's the best that this particular highly resource constrained tiny corner of the future that is optimised for social unity does.

    (But yes, the future in question is very explicitly non-utopian. It's better in some ways, worse in others, and just different in yet more)

      This is probably the best you can expect for a sublight starship, or a low tech space colony, or any other environment where continuous obsessive resource management and infrastructure repair is required for basic survival.

      You're not going to get the libertarian-in-space future that a lot of American SF authors write about for a long time, if at all. A military authoritarianism is much more likely.
      ```

      - u/DRMacIver:

        100% agreed. The trade fleet (or at least this part of it - I don't know how uniform they are in this regard) are a little better than that - they're not so much military authoritarianism as small scale communism with a fairly rigidly enforced consensus - but they're very far from a libertarian free for all.

        This story is loosely inspired by Vernor Vinge's Qeng Ho, but one of the things I realised fairly early on in writing it is that I didn't really believe in his social model for them at all (Vinge is solidly in the libertarians in space camp), so I ended up with something very different.
        ```

        - u/ArgentStonecutter:
          ```
          I hadn't really gotten the impression that the internal structure of the Queng Ho was really well described in _Deepness_. The ships themselves seem to be mostly independent, but internally they seemed to have a pseudo-military organization.

          The Beyonders in _Fire_ might be a different matter, but they have resources and redundancies that are far beyond the technology level I'm talking about.
          ```

          - u/DRMacIver:
            ```
            Yeah, TBF the Qeng Ho are less explicitly libertarian than almost every other society Vernor Vinge has ever written, I probably just projected his general politics on them as the defaults.
            ```

  - u/DRMacIver:
    ```
    A thing also worth mentioning that I forgot earlier is that most of the unpleasant parts of this particular chapter are not the result of the ship's focus on social integration. This is mostly just plain old fashioned gossip mongering.

    The only way the social games system plays into it is that they have a reasonable expectation that Arthur might have noticed something was up before being told.
    ```

  ```
  Suddenly I realize that this chapter would be a very good entry for the challenge thread on Weirdtopia.
  ```

- u/brmj:
  ```
  Good chapter.

  This is of less relevance to this chapter than some past ones, but I recently finally got around to reading *Ancillary Mercy* and found myself wondering if the way the ship (doesn't) handle gender was influenced at all by the Radch?
  ```

  - u/DRMacIver:
    ```
    Not explicitly, but I'd read Ancillary etc. before writing this so it's probably at least partly an influence.

    The more direct influences are that I have a fair number of non-binary and otherwise trans friends and figured I'd like do something a bit different than just replicating 21st century western gender norms in space.
    ```

    - u/brmj:
      ```
      Fair enough. Good to see more of that sort of thing in any case. The relevant norms are evolving quickly enough in progressive and/or nerdy circles right now that just copying the status quo into a far future society seems a bit uninspired and implausible at best, and probably isn't going to age too well in any case.
      ```
