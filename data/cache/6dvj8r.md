  ```
  Is it just me or are these chapters following a bell-like curve? Short, short, medium, long, long, medium, short short short short. The latest ones are all short. 

  Also, I really liked the 50% part. Ha! I didn't get it either at first.

    Brutally, brutally handicapped.

  - u/mooderino:
    ```
    What do you mean? The last two chapters were both over 5K words!
    ```

- u/MultipartiteMind:
  ```
  (Winced a little at the Hogwarts 'before any other interested forces can be brought to bear, the day must be saved by a small group of plucky students' circumstances.)

  (That said, regardless of the truth of the matter, once the dust has settled I'm quite curious about what those forces are going to do to the Headmaster regarding his cooperation (again, intentional or unintentional).)

  ```
  SO.  MUCH.  RISING.  TENSION.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  idk, I didn't liked this last chapter. 
  Nothing happened and no world building.
  Or maybe I was expecting too much of it.
  ```
