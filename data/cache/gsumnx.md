## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  Almost four months ago, I was sent, after a conversation where I mentioned how much I wished there were more stories written with special focus given to intelligent characters and internal consistency, a link to this community.

  I was almost happy when the quarantine was announced. 

  I have been enraptured with many of the stories here; I have been an avid reader of fanfiction for over fifteen years and never have I been this satisfied. Luminosity, Radiance, The Metropolitan Man, Branches on the Tree of Time, A Bluer Shade of White, Pokemon: The Origin of Species, Friendship is Optimal, and now finding myself rapidly approaching the current end of Animorphs: The Reckoning, I cannot have enough of it. I feel spoiled. It's all wonderful.

  A gracious thanks to the authors of these works and this community. Soon, I hope to offer my own contribution.

    Welcome! We're all a little crazy here, but don't get intimidated.

    Also, if you liked The Metropolitan Man (and BotToT and ABSoW), you'll probably like Alexander Wales' other works. I recommend The Dark Wizard of Donkerk in particular.

    Also, Wildbow's works (Worm, Pact, Twig, Ward, Pale), are very popular. They're more divisive though: the story is usually less focused on decision-making than most works here, the pacing is really intense and chaotic, and it gets really dark. Also, they're really long.

  Something I'd like to see in a rational fic, especially a LitRPG, is situations where characters intentionally weaken themselves for a long period in order to become stronger later on. I don't mean "my build isn't good now, but wait until I hit level 50!" cases where their power growth is exponential so it seems slow at first. Instead, I mean cases where they become weaker than they were. Where a graph of their power level over time would look more like a roller coaster than an incline, albeit one where they eventually end up higher than they started. The characters only getting more powerful can be monotonous, and this could allow them to revisit old monsters with their new knowledge. Then the characters can beat the monsters via knowledge/experience, rather than higher damage, and the reward could still be meaningful. 

  One idea I've thought of that would allow this in a satisfying manner would be "prestiging", where the character sacrifices some of their abilities/stats/power/level/whatever in exchange for a theoretically higher growth rate or power cap, or a rarer ability. This would also allow them to get rid of abilities that the character never/rarely uses. After all, how many characters get an ability in chapter 10, use it for 3 chapters, get a better ability in chapter 13, and never use the first one again? This would allow for a rational explanation of this behavior: they traded up. Maybe they sacrifice their high level fire skills and ice skills for a low level temperature control skill, that, once leveled up, is more versatile or faster or something. Maybe this is how hybrid skills are created in that universe?

  Anyway, if there are stories with this element already, please let me know.

    Sounds like a xianxia novel. The protagonists often "restart their cultivation" in order to gain power a new way and raise to greater heights.

    Unfortunately, xianxia is one of the most aggravatingly irrational genres out there - or, at least, mainly consists of aggravatingly irrational authors. However, rational takes on the genre would be a good place to start with in looking for something like this, since it's already an established trope.
    ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    I read a D&D-inspired story (in French and not particularly rational) in which a character got regularly level-drained by vampires so she could grind levels at a less steep area of the XP curve. Later she got all the drained levels back with Greater Restoration and jumped straight to epic.

    (Probably doesn't work in the real game. Then again it was 3.0 so who knows.)
    ```

    - u/VorpalAuroch:
      ```
      Something very similar to that does work in 3.5, and is the basis for one of the truly absurd feats of CharOp, [The Wish and the Word](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/The_Wish_and_the_Word_(3.5e_Optimized_Character_Build\)). Not quite on the Pun-Pun/Infinimancer level, but the next tier down.
      ```

  - u/RetardedWabbit:
    ```
    I think this is a really interesting idea. I've always thought that MCs stumbling into powerful or overpowered builds is absurdly lucky. You show up in a new world and single handedly outsmart everyone at the system they all Iive their lives by. It's the equivalent of a modern person sent to medieval times becoming the best swordsman in the world by luck, but even worse. Having them reset their levels/build to exploit or fix past mistakes would be much more realistic and entertaining.
    ```

    - u/CreationBlues:
      ```
      Yeah, I've always wanted to do that right. Like, Xianxia is based on ancient china, which means nobody has glass. So a glass cultivator would basically be an ocp.
      ```

  - u/Trew_McGuffin:
    ```
    I once read a xianxia crossover fanfiction into the Narutoverse where a high leveled (not in the LitRPG sense) cultivator took their cultivation and gave it back to the world to both appease/bribe it and use it as a springboard to travel to another world which happened to be the Naruto world. 

    The world traveling was done so they could grow because they basically reached the level cap of their world. I recall that if cultivators took their cultivation with them something bad would happen. 

    They effectively become mortal and when they get to the Narutoverse they see chakra and ninjas as novel but a bad way. 

    Like someone messed with the bodies of the people to basically make them cripples in their eyes. 

    Anyhow the mc's plans in the Verse would have put them into conflict with the main cast. >!I think it was eating the bijuu!<

    But other than that I don't remember much. Which is to say I don't remember the title, where it was written, how I found it, whether the mc was a chick/dude or if it was rational.

    All in all giving up power in the present for rewards sounds cool and to be it sounds like the sort of thing a system could also have in the form of a gacha interface/minigame.

    Thinking about it further this concept I see working in time travel works as well? Like in Reverend Insanity the mc as you put it 

    >the characters can beat the monsters via knowledge/experience, rather than higher damage, and the reward could still be meaningful.

    Though it's more applied to people than monsters. But 'prestiging' doesn't happen.

    I can also point out a couple of VR novels (novels about Virtual Reality wit LitRPG elements) where the mc gets sent back to the past and then uses knowledge/experience to get ahead.

    But in those cases (the VR novels) the choice to go back in time is usually unintentionally and not done with the purpose of getting a higher level cap/skills but is instead a side bonus on a quest for edgy vengeance. As a result they all sort of blend together unfortunately. Also no 'prestiging'.


    In the end I recommend Reverend Insanity, a Chinese translated WN due to the mc giving up their cultivation and blowing themselves up in a bid to time travel with a less than 10% success rate. 

    Be forewarned though, the mc is unapologetically amoral. Though as a consolation prize no one seems to hold an idiot ball. Oh and 1687 chapters.

  I'm trying out a mid-year NaNoWriMo. 

  ...

  I'm two days in, and what I've written so far isn't particularly rational, though it is mainly in the direction of hard SF. I'm mainly writing it to get into the habit of writing, rather than to try for quality; I expect that what I end up with is actually going to be terrible. And I'm okay with that.

  With work and some luck, after about a month, I'll have gotten enough of a routine ingrained to start focusing on quality rather than quantity.

  If you're masochistic enough to want to see what I'm writing as I write, send me a private note, and I'll send you a link to the GDoc.

      After a good amount of time dealing with depression, it feels like I haven't written anything in years, and I've lost just about all the useful writing habits I might have had.

      That said, over the first two days of trying to get back into the habit, I seem to have written 8,467 words. ... I'm pretty sure I'm not going to keep up that rate, since it's mostly infodumping some background I've already been thinking about, and now I have to spend time both writing and planning what to write.

    LW has RSS feeds which only output posts which have passed certain karma bars; I believe they have 30, 50, 70, and 90. This filters out the dreck and would get you a sample of 'what LW considers good ATM', which is probably far more useful for seeing if it's to your taste than a random frontpage sample.

  Now the social distancing is almost evaporated where I live (don't worry, we have had 0 cases of community transmission for like a month. We're in a very lucky part of the world), I'm no longer going to be working from home 2.5 days a week. 

  I started the couch to 5k running program using the extra time I was saving by not having to commute (I normally cycle, so traded one exercise for another, more intense exercise). I went from barely being able to jog a minute to being able to jog for 25 minutes straight in about five or six weeks. It's absolutely shocking to me, the amount of progress I've made. I don't love it yet, but I like it fine, and I seem to be losing more weight than I'd expect given the relatively modest calorie expenditure (but I suppose ~300cal extra a week adds up? I think I've lost 2kg/5lb). 

  Protip: I invested in an expensive sports bra and it made such a difference. 

  I'm really worried, I guess, of going back to work... because I want to keep running. I was hoping that the semi-lockdown would stay long enough for me to get to the point where I can run 6km, which would let me commute on foot, but that's another month or so away I think.

  I don't know really what I want to say here. I was talking to my psychologist about how everything seems to be coming up MagicWeasel during this pandemic, and I feel kind of bad about that. She told me not to, because it's good that I'm happy. And... heck, I'm glad I improved things. I'm glad that my local politician has been doing the right thing and lead to us being able to slowly scale back the restrictions with hopefully no continued community spread. I'm happy? 

  I hope you guys are too. Or as much as can be expected.

    Also I had a mild weak-sauce cold but got tested for COVID because they test everyone with mild weak-sauce colds. Throat swabs and BOTH nostrils on the one swab. The throat swab was fine, but the nostril ones ... look at a picture of how the swab looks in terms of where it goes, it feels just like it looks in those diagrams, which is to say that they swab your fuckin' brain stem it feels like

    [](/runningdashie) I have it on good authority that one potential solution to the running dilemma is to do said running at around five or six in the morning, *before* going to work.

    Alternately, perhaps you can persuade your employer to allow you to work from home one day a week? Make your day a Wednesday, and you can run on weekends and in the midweek.
    ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      > Alternately, perhaps you can persuade your employer to allow you to work from home one day a week? 

      ha ha ha ha ha

      even in peak pandemic social distancing, we were only allowed to work from home 50% of the time. I'm honestly surprised we were ever allowed to work from home *at all*. My industry is unfortunately impossible. Even if we pretend I was allowed to work from home, during non-pandemic times I would need to have a dedicated room in my house that I only use for working, which I don't have the space for. 

      And yeah, one day I woke up at 5:10, just completely randomly and couldn't go back to sleep, so I went for a run before my morning routine and going to work. I think the way to actually keep it would be to have a beeminder goal and then I'd have to do it after work sometimes like I do with my reading goals now
      ```

      - u/CCC_037:
        ```
        Clearly an entirely different approach. Here, in peak social distancing time, it was actually illegal to go to work unless your place of work was classed as an 'essential service' (e.g. grocery stores, doctor's offices, and so on); though one was always allowed to work remotely, and thus virtually anyone who *could* work remotely *did*. (As of today, most sectors are allowed to return to work but remote working is still encouraged by government).

        And yeah, after-work runs is another practical solution to the when-to-run dilemma.
        ```

        - u/MagicWeasel:
          ```
          > Clearly an entirely different approach. 

          Yeah, we were very fortunate in that out of 2.5 million people, we've had less than 600 total cases and only 15 cases of community transmission. It never got that bad for us, thankfully. (Turns out being isolated is... actually a good thing?)
          ```

          - u/CCC_037:
            ```
            ...congratulations!

            Yeah, being isolated is good at the moment. Here, we're somewhat isolated, but we have - no, wait. Wrong word. We *had* a bustling tourist industry, for people to visit our beaches and stuff, and apparently enough of the virus got into the country that it started spreading, and despite a very firm lockdown it *still* hasn't stopped yet. We've got about twenty times your number of people, and our known infections (in a per-person count) are already about three times what you've just claimed - though a smidge over half of those have now recovered.

            - u/MagicWeasel:
              ```
              Yeah, we closed our international borders in mid-march and our state borders a few weeks after that after it became clear that cases were entering our state from others. Now we have mandatory hotel quarantine for all new arrivals, and that's where all our new cases are coming from (and a live export ship from the UAE, but that is hopefully going to remain contained fingers crossed)

  Thoughts sloshing around, whimsical fiction:

  \-----

  "The sea of bitterness has no end; turn back to the shore."

  He's telling me what they've all told me--there's no end to this, just give up.

  The corners of my mouth go up, and I chuckle for him to see.  As a scene from years ago seems to overlap in my mind with what my eyes report, I raise my arm and reply--  "The sea of bitterness is vast and infinite.  The sea of bitterness is LIFE.  A struggle without end is exactly what I'm wishing for."

  &#x200B;

  His eyebrows lower sorrowfully, and even as he brings his staff into a ready position he speaks once more.  "Put down the knife and immediately become a Buddha."

  As my breath quickens, my pulse thuds in my ears.  The overlap becomes stronger, the second scene before my eyes clearer with the increased memory-resonance.

  Blood all around as I kneel on the floor, shaking.  A different man walks toward me, smirking.  Calm, complacent.  In the corner of my eye, the last fragments of my attention that haven't descended into gibbering terror or despair are fixed on a small butter knife, fallen under the table.

  In front of me in the present, a man with a staff running towards me.  Once more, "Put down the knife and immediately become a Buddha!".

  In front of me in the past, a man with a cruel smile walking towards me.  "The sea of bitterness has no end; turn back to the shore."  He's telling me to give up.

  In my ear, or maybe in my mind's ear, in the past, a whisper--a scattered thought that I cannot yet call my own--  "He's going to kill you.  PICK UP THE KNIFE!"

  &#x200B;

  I'm terrified, as I was back then.  The man in front me of me now is also quite a bit stronger than the one back then.  But...  the knife in my hand is also quite a bit sharper.
