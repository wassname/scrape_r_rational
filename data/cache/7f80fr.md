## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

    You could try to chat with your sister and listen to and respond to her concerns maybe? Might be good for her to have a trustworthy and sympathetic ear (also, I hadn't read your 3rd to last sentence when I wrote this -- so I guess what prevents that trustworthy adult from being you? You could skype or call them or something without much difficulty). And it'd be good to teach your younger siblings good financial/budgeting/spending/saving habits so they don't learn from your parents, though I guess it sounds like you're doing ok? So maybe that's not as necessary (especially if they're coming up with money-saving lists on their own).

    Assuming your parents are having basic needs met (and aren't buying digital goods while starving or something) and the concern for retirement is they eventually won't have $ to meet those basic needs, you could consider starting a secret retirement fund for them instead of sending money to them directly, maybe?

    Out of curiosity, you say you "came to terms with that," and I have to ask: how much effort have you put into making them aware of this issue? What have you tried, and is it possible that bringing it up anew with this fresh bit of perspective might help them recognize the harm?

      A lot of effort, and every adult child of my family has put in some effort as well. Any serious talk, no matter how gentle, to get them to even see the issue just ends with them feeling terrible, promising to do better, and immediately not following through. Bringing it up with this context would just make them feel like failures.

      While I was living with them, I tried going through their budget to balance it, doing all the shopping to prevent overspending, and cooking all the meals to prevent shopping/ eating out when we had food in the house. They compensated by spending more elsewhere.

        Okay, that's not as bad as I feared: it sounds like they're at least ostensibly aware they have a problem, instead of denying it, getting angry, or insisting it's their money to spend as they please.

        Have they tried therapy? It sounds debilitating enough that they might need professional help to recognize why they can't control their spending or stick to budgets.

        Or persuade them to cut off their access to credit - ask them to buy everything in cash? (Then they might still spend everything, but they'll find it a lot harder to spend money that they don't have)

  I really enjoyed My Hero Academia. The music is great, the action is great, most of the characters are interesting. But that can be said for a lot of shows: objectively My Hero Academia is fairly standard "great" anime, if that makes sense. I just know it connected with me on some deeper-than-usual level because I was tearing up by the end of the second episode: the last thing that made me cry that quick was Ender's Game.

  I think the premise is what really sets it apart. Not the premise of "high school for superheroes," that's fine but nothing too special. I mean the premise of "what does it mean to be a hero in a world where 80% of the population has super powers?"

  In most fiction with superheroes and villains in it, the people with powers are heroes because who else will be? "With great power comes great responsibility" and all that. Those stories occasionally explore what it means to be a hero on a deeper level, but the focus is still on the superpowers, because outside of people like Batman and Iron Man, Step 1 is always "Have powers." In their case it's "Have lots of money," which is just another way to say "Have power."

  But in a world like My Hero Academia, almost EVERYONE has powers, having powers doesn't make you special. Sure some Quirks are pretty terrible for crime fighting and some are awesome for it, but even if yours is something as non-combat focused as making objects lighter, or talking to animals, the drive to be a hero as opposed to just working in construction or at the zoo or similar civilian tasks is what sets a hero apart. This is what it means when the protagonist gets chosen, despite being Quirkless.

  I think the real focus of the show is that, in a world where everyone's special (and so nobody is), learning to be a hero means more than just learning how to use your powers. It means everything else: the desire, sometimes the *need* to act when no one else will, or the spirit of sacrifice that goes beyond that which others expect of us, or even what we expect of ourselves.

    My partner and I watched the first episode (or two) and it didn't really grab us, so we moved on to other animes. Do you feel you were intrigued from the very beginning, or did your enjoyment build over time?

    [Ah, so just like the real world, then!](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/miscellaneous/cb12-134.html) Though I guess the baseline IRL superpower package tends to be pretty uniform -- the booooring "walking squishy brick" -- supervision, superhearing, superstrength, superspeed, supermobility, superanalyticalreasoning, etc. and further specialization is more often the result of practice than anything else (except when you filter your reference class by "practice a helluva lot" -- then most of the variation obviously goes back to being attributable to "inborn superability", though even there the variation has often shrunk to barely anything relative to the whole population). Some supertechnology has given people even more superpowers, and inequality in its allocation seems to exacerbate matters somewhat, but still...

    > but even if yours is something as non-combat focused as making objects lighter, or talking to animals, the drive to be a hero as opposed to just working in construction or at the zoo or similar civilian tasks is what sets a hero apart

    aww, but I think if you can talk to animals you can be a much better hero campaigning for super-well-informed welfare reform, or setting up comparative-advantage trades with different nonhuman populations, or even working as a zoo veterinarian, than trying to fight crime through direct combat

  (potential) ~***WORM SPOILERS***~

  I had [an interesting discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/7ese00/batman_vs_contessa_with_30_seconds_of_prep/dq7hw9h/) recently on how Contessa (or, more generally, PtV) would fare in various contests, e.g. fighting Batman or playing darts or picking large numbers. It reminded me of another question I'd had about Worm when I'd first read it years ago (but never got a satisfactory answer to): is the Worm multiverse stochastic (as implied by Dinah's power, some [interpretations of QM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics#Comparison_of_interpretations), etc.) or deterministic (as implied by a strong interpretation of PtV or Coil's power, ignoring "blind spots" which imo should very rapidly cloud the future even in a deterministic universe without overwhelming preponderance of negative feedback due to sensitivity-to-initial-conditions reasons, trapping their users in some local minimum of future-space or some entirely foreign possible timeline, respectively)? Does precognition in Worm generally allow for total knowledge of the behavior of every particle in Worm (I guess the consequences would be similar if probability is a property of the system sensu stochasticity or a property of the precognitor's mind)?

  (related) ~***REAL WORLD SPOILERS***~

  This also relates to another question I've had regarding initial-conditions sensitivity and the nature of feedback loops that structure interactions and processes IRL. Note: IANAP, so apologies if this question is ill-conceived or poorly specified. If the universe at small scales is stochastic -- how long would it take for two identical earths, duplicated at this exact moment in time, to diverge such that one could [spot-the-difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot_the_difference) visually at the macro scale (or if that's too vague -- until you have the case where a person is dead in one universe, but alive in the other universe "10 minutes later" in their reference frame)? Since in recent centuries we've constructed tools that allows super minute effects to be amplified enormously, how would the distribution of times-to-noticeable-difference change if stuff like geiger counters didn't exist, e.g. the duplication happened not now but 1,000 years ago?

  *Alternatively*, if our universe is deterministic -- say you have the same duplication and spot-the-difference condition, but now there's a slight difference in the two universe. Where the first looks as it should, the second is missing a single hydrogen atom from the center of the planet Jupiter, and is in all other respects identical. How long before the two universes visibly diverge? Obviously it would need to be at least .5-1h for gravity from Jupiter to propagate as far as earth, but can we say anything the order of magnitude of time it would take for macro-differences to arise (a year? a million years? my intuitions fail me)?

    When it comes to how quickly quantum scale randomness would make its way to the macroscopic level I'm of the belief it would happen quite rapidly. Because there's quite a few things like brownian motion that ought to be directly affected by quantum randomness due to being highly sensitive systems (like double pendulums but far worse). Which means I suspect in perhaps a few weeks the weather ought to be noticeably different since weather being highly sensitive is pretty well accepted.

    However I think things may well diverge in other macroscopic ways more rapidly than that. More generally I expect _any_ system that's highly sensitive to initial conditions (ie the sorts of systems that are hard enough to predict they seem random) to probably diverge rapidly. This is just because even relatively simple computer simulation of sensitive systems can rapidly diverge simply because of a difference in initial conditions of one part in a million or less as is mentioned in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp8wGQW-Y48).   

    So I suspect the number of systems that will be close enough to quantum scale effects to be affected is pretty large. Importantly however there will be many more higher scale systems that are within enough orders of magnitude of _those_ systems to also be affected and of course further systems affected by _those_ systems and so on up until you reach macroscopic levels.

    Anyway I suspect that in addition to weather (though that takes weeks so it's not _very_ rapid) and things like lotteries that deliberately try to be as pseudo random as possible there would be many systems that would diverge within a day such as:

    * Human behavior: I suspect some of our behavior is going to be affected by the brownian motion of individual neurotransmitters. So if the brownian motion is different then some neurons that would otherwise have reached the threshold for firing wouldn't or vice versa. How noisy particular people's behavior is however is hard to guess at.

    * Things highly susceptible to _any_ difference in human behavior: If the noisiness of neurons is different I expect things like dice rolling which are fairly pseudorandom to not go the same as in another timeline.

    * The specific behavior of pretty much any life: The point about neuronal noise applies to other vertebrates however even single celled organisms are going to be a little bit noisy because of brownian chemical motion.

      Thank you for responding!

      > Because there's quite a few things like brownian motion that ought to be directly affected by quantum randomness due to being highly sensitive systems

      Hmm well, Brownian motion in itself is a stochastic process, so that's putting the cart before the horse a bit imo, and it also has the Markov property and expectation (0,0...) so I don't think any non-Brownian perturbations would really affect it any. Unless you mean to say that the quantum foam itself behaves in a manner that's roughly Brownian?  

      > the weather ought to be noticeably different since weather being highly sensitive is pretty well accepted

      Is this well established? Some of weather's current unpredictability might just be due to model misspecification and insufficiently granular observational scales -- I wonder if we could do a better job of predicting the weather if we had e.g. some ultrasophisticated mechanistic model and microdrones measuring conditions of every single cubic meter of the earth, or something. Climate certainly seems fairly predictable, but averaging chunks obviously removes variance. Maybe within some climatic range variation is chaotic? (e.g. you're very confident the weather in superstabledesertland is going to be sunny and between 110-111F exactly ten years from now, but can't say where in (110,111) it is -- likewise, you can be quite confident the earth won't freeze to absolute zero a century from now, etc.). Lorenz said something similar in his '72 talk but presumably the field has progressed quite a bit in the half-century since. IDK.

      > This is just because even relatively simple computer simulation of sensitive systems can rapidly diverge simply because of a difference in initial conditions of one part in a million

      Eh just because it's easy to implement a model with a certain property doesn't mean the property holds with respect to any real world process. I took a pop eco class a few years ago and we coded up a bunch of these positive Lyapunov exponent models but the instructor made plenty sure to distinguish between math-world and real-world dynamics (e.g. models of community structure fail to account for all the negative feedback loops in actual animal behavior afaict). Has it been super well established that these systems behave as they do IRL? edit: actually a double pendulum isn't a bad example here -- in math-world super chaotic, swinging to-and-from all willy-nilly, but in real-world I can very accurately predict where it'll be at some distant future point (at rest, due to negative feedback loops in the form of air and kinetic friction).

      > many systems that would diverge within a day such as

      I'd say human behavior is pretty stable and balancing, actually! Most of my every-day behavior feels rather railroaded -- e.g. I check both ways when I cross the street, eat when I am hungry, strive to maintain other equilibria/homeostasis, etc. IDK much about action at the molecular level but it seems brains have a fair bit of redundancy, too.

      My go-to examples of small-to-large amplification have always been: germline mutation generating novel phenotypic variation, and the filtering of hundreds of millions of sperm to just one during fertilization (which seem to get all swirled up during ejaculation, and if nothing else usually a couple hundred sperm are solid contenders during the actual egg breaching iirc. There might be some vaguely Brownian effects on their travel, too!). Though these might not have direct repurcussions until a few weeks into the pregnancy (where alternative embryos might impose different nutritional demands on the mother).

        >Hmm well, Brownian motion in itself is a stochastic process, so that's putting the cart before the horse a bit imo

        I mean I was addressing the question of assuming quantum randomness how rapidly does that propagate up to noticeable macroscopic differences. As for quantum phenomenon behaving randomly in this context that seems basically settled, unless you want to stray out of well established models. In Copenhagen it's random, and in Many World's it's random from the perspective of any given Everett branch.

        As for weather I was just referring to specific details not large term stuff/trends (though some pretty large stuff like specific hurricanes seems likely to be highly sensitive to initial conditions).

        >Eh just because it's easy to implement a model with a certain property doesn't mean the property holds with respect to any real world process.

        I probably should have explained that with more detail: The models like that weren't deliberately designed to be random. The one mentioned in the video was designed to model weather they discovered that changing whether you rounded at the 5th decimal or 6th (or something like that) would totally change things. Yes it's a simplified model, of real world phenomenon, however I wouldn't expect a vastly more complicated one to be _less_ sensitive to initial conditions since that's not generally the trend in chaos theory.

        When it comes to human behavior yeah you're right people are for the most part fairly predictable, which is why I was careful to caveat that this applied much more to some behavior than others. However it's not like you can deny that some aspects of human behavior can't be predicted with near certainty beforehand since everything is running on slightly noisy hardware.             
        For instance I frequently make decisions where I have no strong opinion one way or the other, and so I suspect my final decision is down to neuronal noise. Though I also frequently use [a quantum random number generator](https://qrng.anu.edu.au/RawBin.php#) to make those decisions.

        As for which people are born, that is also one of my go to's for a really obvious example of the butterfly effect since it seems like any change in initial conditions will probably change which if any sperm meets the egg and it's something which is much easier to point to than a combination of many tiny changes adding up.

          ah, but they're afaik not even unintentionally random -- they're still very much deterministic, just really sensitive to where you start them. Kick em off in the same place and they'll go to the same spot every time. Though I think you can approximate a chaotic process with a stochastic process, and you can also propagate your initial uncertainty through the model to get some distribution of outcomes at the end. But that's perhaps a different sort of probability than that of stochasticity.

          >  however I wouldn't expect a vastly more complicated one to be less sensitive to initial conditions since that's not generally the trend in chaos theory

          eh, I don't see this really. As mentioned some dead simple models can exhibit chaotic behavior, some really complex models do not, and in the end it seems like plenty of real world processes are rife with negative feedback and drawn to particular optima. But I'm not that familiar with chaos theory so if it's the general trend are there examples (like, you some somehow increase the # of parameters in some particular model in some unbiased way and it gets more chaotic?).

          > However it's not like you can deny that some aspects of human behavior can't be predicted with near certainty beforehand since everything is running on slightly noisy hardware.

          Well, in plenty of cases the noise is self-correcting -- e.g. a leaf falls on me and slows me down, but then I speed up slightly to compensate.

          > Though I also frequently use a quantum random number generator to make those decisions.

          Aha! So you'd be a quick avenue for divergence in my original question if we live in that sort of stochastic universe! Though it does say "The hardware is constantly generating random bits at a rate of 5.7Gbits/s. Currently, the rate at which the live bits are streamed is being limited by the bandwidth of the internet connection." so draws from that site are still pretty deterministic at especially small time-scales.
          ```

          - u/vakusdrake:
            ```
            When it comes to the fact the computer simulations used for chaotic systems are generally deterministic that doesn't really matter much for our purposes since the important thing is that it's highly susceptible to initial conditions. As for these sorts of systems getting more chaotic with more complexity that will depend on whether the relevant influencers are convergent or divergent. But with something like a double pendulum adding more pendulums will only exacerbate the chaos in a lot of circumstances the more chaotic connected systems there are the less predictable things are.

            >Well, in plenty of cases the noise is self-correcting -- e.g. a leaf falls on me and slows me down, but then I speed up slightly to compensate.

            Sure but that only works for systems where the relevant variables are converging on a particular target. Whereas in circumstances where they aren't, internal feedback loops may well amplify noise.

            >Aha! So you'd be a quick avenue for divergence in my original question if we live in that sort of stochastic universe! Though it does say "The hardware is constantly generating random bits at a rate of 5.7Gbits/s. Currently, the rate at which the live bits are streamed is being limited by the bandwidth of the internet connection." so draws from that site are still pretty deterministic at especially small time-scales.

            I mean whether that counts as deterministic would depend on what you're using that word to mean. By the standard you seem to be using anything that's not _directly_ connected to a source of quantum noise would count as deterministic, since one could hypothetically look at the quantum noise before it affected the system in question and thus predict the outcome in advance.                 
            In another sense however it's obvious not deterministic, since you couldn't predict things in advance of the generation of the quantum noise.

      Yeah, I have to second this. I tried the oculus rift DK2 a while back and it was "cool" but definitely still at the "toy" stage of things, rather than anything seriously worth using. The resolution is the biggest drawback right now-- these displays are a fair sight worse than 1080p per eye, even though they have great refresh rates. I'm thinking it'll take at least another generation before the screen resolution is up to par (at least 2000x2000 per eye, and probably a fair bit more), and probably a generation after that to get the form factor and control surfaces down pat. So looking at the relatively slow pace of development so far, VR isn't going to be very useful for consumers until the mid to late 2020's.

  Weekly update on [The Tesseract Engine](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vIWf3Nqudgh18j4RK8bm4zOTSKUFl6l9Igvdg1adzGE/edit), my ongoing game engine project.

  ---

  I'm running out of clever ways to say "I haven't done anything, but I've planned to do things really hard. You know, in the future." If this continues, I might have to *actually do some work* so I can actually have something to write here.

  The most concrete work I have done recently is write Trello cards; two weeks ago, I said "I should probably make a plan before next week"; well, I skipped a week (more on that in a sec), but at least I am officially done with the planning phase!

  I've also contacted a friend to ask him for help staying motivated and focused; my plan is to work on the project at least every Saturday for the next while; the arrangement would be "we have a visioconference every saturday morning where I explain to him what I intend to do that day/week, and a debriefing every saturday evening where I talked about what I've actually managed to do". So kind of like what I'm doing here, with the same pre-commitment flavor to it, but more focused and more personal.

  ---

  My long term worry now is whether I can stay focused on the project long enough to actually achieve something.

  The thing about developing a video game is, it's hard. Like, __*really*__ hard. If you, average person reading this sentence, were to try making a video game, even if you gave it an honest try, made an actual effort with the actual intention of making something good, you would probably produce something shitty and worthless (and I say that with a few years of experience seeing enthusiastic students produce shitty games, and not doing any better myself).

  Same thing for making a game engine. It's a lot of work, and it's extremely complex. Now, the thing with coding complex systems is, it requires a sustained effort. You need to get into "the flow", where you can visualize enough parts of the problems and how they interact to build something that meaningfully addresses these problems; if you don't visualize them, you build flaws in your design that catch up with you sooner or later. You need to stay in that flow, not for hours, but for days or weeks or months.

  Once your immersion is broken, all the mental architecture you've built is lost. You forget critical details that you didn't bother to write down, the notes you did write no longer make sense to you because they're based on assumptions you don't remember making, etc. You're not back to nothing, per se; you've still written some code; but you now have to do the same mental work of understanding the problem that produced the code in the first place (which is why people say that understanding someone else's code can be as hard as writing your own).

  Now, if you're working in a company on the same problem every day, that's okay. It can be a pain in the ass to be asked to debug something you produced 6 months ago, but otherwise, you're unlikely to be interrupted before the project is over.

  I'm a college student working living abroad and working on this project in my free time (which I'm lucky enough to have a lot of). I'll soon have semester exams; sometimes I get depressed like last week, and can't bring myself to work on anything (I'm asking a friend for help to hopefully work through those periods); I've let schoolwork pile up, and I'll need to address it at some point.

  I'm not building up to a specific problem that I'm expecting. With some luck, it'll all be okay, and I'll just develop my project at a slow rate until I reach my two-months vacation in January, where I'll pick up the pace. But with that in mind... a lot of key parts of this project exist only in my brain so far, and that feels increasingly like a house of cards that could collapse at any moment.

  I guess that just means I need to work sooner and faster.

  I’ve posted here before about how I’m better at dealing with internal sources of stress than external, but the worst has finally come and I need some advice to survive this weekend. I currently have **15 dogs** visiting my house for my Mom’s pet sitting business, none of which will listen to anyone when we tell them to stop barking and tripping us.

  I can barely walk around or sit on a chair because of how much space they take up, every time someone opens a door or there’s a noise down the street they sound the alarm, I spend half my day manning the door to the yard because they can’t decide whether they need to pee, and I can leave them alone for 5 minutes without something happening.

  After 4 days of this, I can barely think straight at this point and have gone emotionally hollow. I’ve repeatedly screamed myself horse in frustration and am on the verge of a anxiety attack unless I find some way to relieve this stress. I’m afraid to read or watch something relaxing because being interrupted might set me off and it’s hard not to focus on how *temporary* the reprieve would be anyway.

    Um. Why in earth, heaven and all the 7000 hells would you tolerate that for even a weekend? 

    Tell your mom to fuck off, and carry her responsibility on her own shoulders?

      She’s suffering as much as I am, asked for my permission before she scheduled the appointments, and I agreed to help her out with them because I didn’t expect the dogs to be this crazy. The ones I helped her watch before aren’t usually this bad and the new ones were last minute emergencies from desperate clients. It’s a mess we walked into together and we have to face it together because neither of us can abandon the other.

    That's rough to hear, I'm sorry you and your mom have got to go through that for the holidays.

    My suggestion may be to do something like splitting half of them or more outside (don't know how big your yard is) and rotating with your mom, maybe sit outside in a chair and just read a light hearted book or comic, something that doesn't require too much concentration. The constant attention they need while indoors seems like it's the main problem, whereas if they're allowed to just run around outside and do their business if needed would make it not as stressful, maybe?
