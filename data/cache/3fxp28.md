## [Weekly Challenge] Clones, Clones, and Clones!

### Post:

## Last Week

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3f39xs/weekly_challenge_the_chessmaster/?sort=confidence) the prompt was "The Chessmaster". /u/Kishoto is the winner with his story ["Requests"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3f39xs/weekly_challenge_the_chessmaster/ctlc8kg), and will receive a month of reddit gold along with super special winner flair. Congratulations /u/Kishoto! (Now is a great time to go to that thread and look at the entries you may have missed, especially the late entrants; contest mode is now disabled.)

##### This Week

This week's prompt is "Clones, Clones, and Clones!". Whether through literal cloning, time travel shenanigans, or multiplication superpowers, one person (or multiple people) ends up with multiple copies running around - perhaps with divergent goals. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, August 12th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given a week in advance.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in [the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3), and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). If you think that you have a good modification to the rules, let me know in a comment [in the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Week

Next week's prompt is slightly different from the usual; instead of a trope or genre, we'll be doing a specific canon of work. The theme is "Disney Movies". Pick you favorite Disney movie and write the rational version of it! (Depending on the response, we might have more of these in the future; if you have a canon you really think would work well for a challenge, add it to the list.)

**Next week's thread will go up on 8/12.** Please confine any questions or comments to [the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3).

    This is excellent.  Has Robin Hanson seen it yet?
    ```

    - u/eniteris:
      ```
      I actually read through Hanson's draft for the Age of Em (where a fair bit of the inspiration comes from), although I haven't shared it with him yet.
      ```

      - u/EliezerYudkowsky:

        Do you want me to send it to him?

          That would be nice.

          Although I did get irritated at him once in the comments of Overcoming Bias, and provided conflicting names (I don't like giving my real name out on the internet.)

          Tell him it's by "Jennifer".

    Excellent. Got a bit lost with some of the names halfway through, but it made more sense after that.

    Wow.  An excellent use of Eigenselves...

    This was a pretty good read. I got a bit lost in the middle with all of the esoterics but I think that's more a problem with me being tired and not fully appreciating and processing the work. Overall though, a good read. Could qualify as Rational Horror too, IMHO.

    So, did that one guy only use that other guy?
    ```

    - u/eniteris:
      ```
      Which one guy?

      Allfather is using someone  else's backups and spawned Hymn and Deckard.

      Hymn spawned Weir and Knott.

      Deckard spawned Batty, in addition to Loyalty Box Deckard and Refactored Deckard, as well as restoring Refactored Hymn.

      Given that this is a story about clones, this is an amazing question.

    Strip-mining artists is a thing I have thought of. Nice to see it elsewhere. But then you take it a step further and iterate. I imagine the quality would increase if they learned from themselves.

    Quite nice, a mashup between assembly teleportation and the existence of an afterlife.

    Though I'm a bit iffy on the zombies; didn't add too much (the Buffets are nice), and symptoms of aggression seems a bit contrived.

    Although why aren't the Buffetts zombies all zombies? (if they're using N2s five times a week, wouldn't they all have progressed Mover's Sickness?)
    ```

    - u/Kishoto:
      ```
      Note: [](#s "Keep in mind a lot of what is said about the rich people in this story is biased. The residents here hate the rich, because their overuse of N2's leads to a lot of Ragged running around and a lot of rich people clones running around. In this story, the rich tend to just stick together with their own duplicates and form their own communities. So the Buffets involved in the attack aren't zombies. They're the community of clones of the Buffet family, with varying degrees of fraying. And fraying CAN be recovered from, albeit slowly, unless you go Ragged. So you're left with communities of clones of rich people. 
      Also, they don't literally use N2's five times a week. But they do over use them, that's undeniable. As far as the zombies go, they aren't actual zombies. It's an expression Noah used, as it conveyed the general idea. Large amounts of unreasonable humanoids that vary anywhere from complete zombie to socially conscious pack animal. 
      The idea is that as the *soul* degrades, the humans resemble humans less and less. I defaulted to the aggression because it's more exciting than having a bunch of roaming listless cow-people.")

    I'm going by trains. Forever. Sheldon had the right idea.

    I like it! Again, feels a little like a beginning of a larger story, especially when you start realizing what's going on.
    ```

    - u/Kishoto:
      ```
      Yes! Thank you! That's what I was going for.

      On the surface, you just have Square, Sam and Noah explaining New-C's new lot in life, with a little hint of danger at the end.

      But if you look deeper, it's the start of a fairly complex narrative, even if you ignore the changes up above. 

      Pangea. Why do they call it that? It's an iconic, historic name, what does that imply? You have the threat of the Ragged, wild infected that vary in sanity and biology (although, just to be clear, it wouldn't get as crazy as Resident Evil's advanced zombies, but there'd definitely be some superhuman strength depending on the type)

      Then you have the clones. It's made clear that there are bunches of rich people down here and they tend to form communities. Who better to get along with than yourself(ves), for those who are able to do it. But that comes with its own problems, depending on how unhinged/selfish/narcissistic the originals are. And it also depends on what kind of day they were having when they stepped through the N2. Also, what does that imply for the middle class and poorer clones? 

      And lastly, the Naturals. They're brought up exactly once. But they're the people that come down the normal way. By dying. What does that imply about who's actually down here? Are people immortal here? Could you go find Alexander the Great, Hannibal or Jesus down here, if you really wanted? ;)

      I tried to cram a lot of things into the background, to really make it clear how deep the implications of the N2 and the soul's existence is in this world.

      I suppose it is a bit of a cynical outlook. Is it good, though, as a story? This is really my first time writing anything, so if anyone has any suggestions for how to improve, I'd love to hear them!

    Humans will be humans, I guess. Yay procrastination! Or not yay, as it were, I suppose...
