  >[bacon], cream cheese, hummus, and guacamole bagel

  Truly a setting alien to us

    Just to check, did this break immersion? I feel like if I say "steak" I can assume people will infer like tauros or miltank meat, and if I say "bacon" they'll infer it to mean grumpig and piloswine.

        I thought it sounded delicious, and I don't eat meat.

        I'm assuming you dislike one of those ingredients, but if not, I highly encourage you to try it :) The blend of flavors is divine. If you want to go the distance, add on a tomato slice and some onion too... mmm. Made myself hungry.

          You've got soft on soft on soft; you won't even be able to taste the more delicate flavour of avocado over a strong hummus and get no textural benefits from mashing it into a guacamole.
          ```

            The bagel should be toasted, and the bacon adds extra crunch :)
            ```

      A setting that doesnt discover bacon of some sort seems much, much, more immersion breaking than the alternative. Ain't no place bacon doesnt make things better.

  We do have Mewtwo's POV on his mental shield:

  >It is a hard thing to keep my mind **partitioned**. To let the false-hope, the harmless-hope, show on the surface for Sabrina to read, while inside the desperate, anguished, starving hope rends at me. I sense her concern as my mask leaks briefly, and some of my true feelings go through.

  >...Again I struggle to keep my mental mask in place, remind myself of all the false hope Iâ€™ve been fed before. 

  >...She sends humor, concern, trepidation. I carefully add resolution and eagerness to my mask. Yes! Thank you for telling me, Sabrina.

  So it's partition based, and the main unique thing is Mewtwo's maintaining two separate partitions/thought patterns at once and hiding one of them. Though he's putting in conscious effort and having emotions leak between them, which is sort of weird if he needs to explicitly add emotion to his "model" mind.

  Also interesting that Mewtwo talks about "surfaces" and "masks" in the sense of entry rather than depth, which hasn't really been a concept in these psychic rules I think? The only kinda similar power is Red's unique ability to notice intrusion attempts that only hit his "surface", which'd explain why no one's explored this area yet. Guess it's possible Mewtwo's learned HPMOR-style ~~legilimency~~ occlumency and is using "partition" loosely (not like he has access to psychic literature to know the proper terminology).

  Huh.
  ```

    ```
    I continue to think that it is just partitions.  Like, Past Red will truthfully answer questsions about depression, so will Present Red.  The psychic will read both as sincere, but they will not be the same answer.

    &#x200B;

    That said, the mention of Psychic Pokemon being able to do tricks that humans just can't might well be the answer as well.  Like, the quote above was him a while back.  Modern Mewtwo may 'mask' his intentions by altering the memories of those reading his mind or something similar.  His combination of human level smartness and pokemon powers has never existed before, so his exploit may not be discoverable by human exploration, like a MaChamp coming up with a 'new wrestling move' that was easy with 4 arms but impossible without.

      > I continue to think that it is just partitions. Like, Past Red will truthfully answer questsions about depression, so will Present Red. The psychic will read both as sincere, but they will not be the same answer.

      Does Past Red have memory of everything Present Red sees? What happens if Present Red deletes a memory, does Past Red also lose that memory?

      This question is for anyone reading.
      ```

  - u/anenymouse:
    ```
    I wonder how much of it is from some inherent bit of Pokemon brain/capabilities in comparison to human ones. Like they upfront say in the chapter that there are inherent differences in both mentality and in psychic abilities. I mean they even go so far as to reference the inkay line which is psychic/dark. 

    Maybe it's even something like a distributed nervous system is enough to "ping" back in a way that is different enough from the human perspective to not be seen the same. 

    Or I guess in more psychological terms maybe there was enough difference between the subconscious mind and the more surface level thoughts to be good enough to lie, but again be able to be read as lying by Giovanni.
    ```

  - u/CrystalShadow:
    ```
    It sounds to me like a mix of most of the listed ideas.

    A partitioned mind, running in parallel, relaying emotion states from a true mind to a surface one. Maybe with a bit of ghost stuff to hide the existence of the true mind running underneath
    ```

- u/ForMyWork:
  ```
  Aww, Red, was it really that long ago? I'm having a bit of trouble picturing what Blue and the rest were doing other than the change of arena in the footage. But I suspect the second will be right in Blue coming there soon.

  I'm liking the exploration of the psychic phenomenon, and I'm glad we have a concrete tie between Red and Mewtwo storyline now, possibly with Leaf and his mum coming into it from their angles too. 

  Seeing as though the project is almost certainly about Mewtwo, it could be a mixture of Red and Rei's theories realistically, or even Rowans, it'll be interesting to see what they come up with.
  ```

  - u/AweKartik777:
    ```
    I think the second scene was about coordinated trainers defending a central location from a wave of incoming wild Pokemons, like near a Legendary's Pressure.
    ```

    - u/ForMyWork:
      ```
      Oh yeah, I thought it would be something like that, something about working a system for group battling that works under pressure and with obstacles. Just had trouble picturing the specifics.
      ```

  ```
  Welcome back everyone! I'm out of town until the end of the month teaching at SPARC and ESPR again, so edits will come a bit slow. Hope you enjoy the chapter, and as always all feedback is welcome!

    The fact that Sabrina brought it up at all makes me think it's trivial for psychics to pick up on.

  Typo thread!

    >Rei nods, and even smiles at him briefly before turning to Jaso and Satori. "Objections?"

    Should be Jason

    Guessing that should be Rei looks around the table

      Woops, fixed, thanks!

  - u/Roneitis:

    > "Maybe a better way to put it is to hide signal in noise by holding such a wide scope of emotions and thoughts at once that some are hard to pick up in the mix."

    >"Why?" Tatsumaki asks. "Not my specialty..."

    Seems like it was intended from this and the context around it that there should be some line where Rei mentions Tatsumaki by name.
    ```

  - u/tokol:
    ```
    > "Thank you all for coming," Rei says as soon as the lasts of them is sitting at the table.

    lasts -> last

        I'm surprised I got that many, I mentally smooth over typos really hard unless it affects meaning. I miss every "the the" ever if I'm not skimming one word at a time.

  Some very engaging conversations here. Getting little flashes of social anxiety from Red's arguments for his idea.

  ```
  I think I'm missing something, but isn't the amnesia technique already powerful enough to allow one to lie perfectly?  Just forget the truth.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Sort of, psychics can detect partitions in others, but not what's on the other side. More importantly though, if you actually forget the truth yourself, you would have to forget a lot of connected things so that a sense of having forgotten something doesn't come up too. Even then, you can't lie *strategically,* and you can't really mislead people nearly as effectively, if you totally blank that part of your mind, even assuming that level of self-editing wouldn't result in super obvious changes.
    ```
