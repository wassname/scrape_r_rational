Right, first chapter of Wise Blood's second arc! We meet Tabby's family, watch some home movies, and in general enjoy some deep lore. This chapter I think is particularly important, as it's where we start to see why I think Wise Blood is part of the rational fic genre. Hopefully you'll all agree, and enjoy. 

Also, for anyone who's following my projects, I'm going to try and start alternating updates between The New Humans and Wise Blood. Hopefully that isn't a bother for anyone.
