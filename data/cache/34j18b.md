  On a similar note, I felt that [Tucker and Dale vs Evil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_%26_Dale_vs._Evil) was a surprisingly rational horror movie, with an intelligent and funny twist.
  ```

  - u/SegfaultVulcan:
    ```
    [SPOILERS](#s "What I like about Tucker and Dale is the main duo are not presented as the best people. They drink and drive, they're very dumb, Tucker is kind of sleazy \("Tucker! You're being a peeping tom!"\), Dale is easily manipulated. But it's still entirely the fault of the prejudice and unjustified fear of the college kids that things go so poorly. A very rationalist moral I think.")
    ```

  The problem is that a lot of it isn't actually all that sensible. There's nothing wrong with playing with a Ouija board in an abandoned insane asylum. On the other hand, in a world where that sort of thing is dangerous, people would notice and there'd be statistics on exactly how dangerous ghosts are.
  ```

  - u/philip1201:
    ```
    Other than that it's trespassing.
    ```

      ```
      Plus being abandoned it may not be up to safety code. Nothing quite like dying by falling through rotten floorboards in an abandoned building you have no good reason to be in.
      ```

    - u/DCarrier:
      ```
      But it's abandoned. Don't they stop owning it at some point?
      ```

      - u/philip1201:
        ```
        Depends on what country you're in. In the Netherlands, the state can't lose ownership, and the state would be the most likely owner of a mental asylum.
        ```

  - u/notentirelyrandom:
    ```
    On the other other hand, while there's nothing wrong with playing with a Ouija board in an abandoned asylum there's also nothing wrong with not wanting to. Maybe that one guy just doesn't see any appeal, and is being perfectly logical about pursuing his own goals.
    ```

    - u/aeschenkarnos:
      ```
      Which apparently do not include being invited to do something thrilling by an attractive woman.
      ```

      - u/The_Entire_Eurozone:
        ```
        My libido is through the roof, and I wouldn't do something like that.  It's just common sense not to go in an abandoned building.
        ```

      - u/ArgentStonecutter:
        ```
        I'm not getting the "thrilling" part, unless "ouija board" is a euphemism for something.
        ```

      - u/notentirelyrandom:
        ```
        Apparently not.
        ```

    - u/DCarrier:
      ```
      But that's less being rational and more having different tastes.
      ```

      - u/gridpoint:
        ```
        Unless the rational is what appeals to him.
        ```

    <shameless_plug>
    I actually wrote a [rational horror story involving a ouija board](http://www.amazon.com/Pay-Attention-novella-psychological-horror-ebook/dp/B00V4ZIEMQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1430533122&sr=1-1)

    - u/DCarrier:
      ```
      It's harder to imagine something more horrifying than the concept that ouija boards do absolutely nothing because people cease to exist when they die.
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        I gave it my best shot, and I think the version I came up with is pretty horrible.
        ```

- u/RolandsVaria:
  ```
  It was an amusing and moderately clever video. However, the premise of this "movie" runs into trouble once you throw a wrench into their clever little plans.

  Want to drive off and go somewhere else? Sorry, your tires were mysteriously slashed. And you only have 1 spare, it doesn't matter how smart you are there's only so much room in the car.

  Carlos skips out on the trip, but the girls head to the mental asylum anyway.

  Video tape that kills you when you watch it? Sounds fun for a laugh, after all everyone knows something like that couldn't possibly be real. Only someone very superstitious or someone who knew they were in a horror movie would say no if someone pressured them about it.

  Using a rocket launcher to destroy the monster could easily backfire if you haven't been trained in the use of one.

  And so on.

    Reminds me a bit of Cabin In The Woods. They tried to escape but the whole was rigged against them.

      You *think* you are safe but the truth is that now that you've seen it you are *doomed to die*...*eventually*

  ```
  Help, my sides.
  ```

- u/rthomas2:
  ```
  Hell yes.
  ```

- u/Sailor_Vulcan:
  ```
  Then they wake up and find out they're still trapped in the mirror.
  ```

- u/Sailor_Vulcan:
  ```
  Also I want to see this or something like it, if it's done well.
