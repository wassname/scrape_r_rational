## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You can create a cube of iron with a 5 inch side once in 24 hours.

  The iron is elementally pure, and the surface of the cube is smooth (but not perfectly smooth). It is otherwise unremarkable and indistinguishable from any other iron cube.

  It will be created at will between your hands held in a specific way to "hug" the cube at the opposite corners, no millimetre precision required.

  The cube will completely replace whatever fluids existed in its space prior, gas or liquid, including air. Any solids would block the power without "wasting" its use, but particles smaller than a millimetre are ignored.

  You must be conscious and intend to do it, you cannot be tricked or made to do it involuntarily (but it's possible to threaten, bribe or blackmail). You won't accidentally use this power while asleep, drunk or drugged.

  You can't "save up" and make a bigger cube by waiting longer than 24 hours.

  The cube will have zero velocity in your own reference frame. 

  **Edit:** none of the measurable aspects of this power are consistent enough to be used as a precise measurement sample and have a slight amount of variation (i.e. the size of the cube is not exactly 5.00000.... inches, the waiting period varies by a few nanoseconds and so on).

      Wouldn't that mean you have to TOUCH the nuclear waste with your bare hands? Or at least get within 2.5 inches of it without any kind of radiation shielding, since any shield that small would need to be solid. That seems pretty suicidal, especially if you are going to do it every day.

    Build a long solenoid, live somewhere very high up, drop one down a shaft, generate... 1.5 watts of power from the tip of the Burj Khalifa.

    There has to be a good way to use this violation of conservation of mass to do something crazy though.

      At the very least, if you can live past the singularity and get immortality, you can try to avert the heat death of the universe. A 5x5x5 inch cube of iron should be about 16 kg, which if completely annihilated is equivalent to 1.4 x 10^18 Joules per day, or 1.7 Ã— 10^13 watts, which is very close to the total amount of electricity used over the whole earth currently.  So at the very least you could power a large colony forever, though whether it ended up housing thousands or trillions of people would depend on whether you have people walking around and needed to use power to grow food since you don't have stars anymore, or if everyone is uploaded into hyper-efficient computers.

    Erase quantum information (e.g. replace some liquid/gaseous qbit with your cube). Example: prepare qbits in the state 1/sqrt(2)*(|01>-|00>), erase the second qbit: => 1/sqrt(2)*(|0x>-|0x>)=0 => universe destroyed. If you can't prepare your qbits in exactly that state (which should be the case) you merely made your own reality more "improbable" on a multiversal scale. Could still allow for weird trade and blackmail. 

    Fix 1: Automatically re-scale the amplitude to 1. As the quantum states are imperfect you will end up with a bigger-than-expected probability for the state |1x>. Might be useful for quantum computing.

    Fix 2 (which is rather sensible): Make the cube interact with the matter it replaces, absorbing its information. No more quantum-information-sorcery. 

    Fix 3: Simply assume that quantum multiverse-theory is wrong (replaced by Bohmian mechanics or something else). Quantum mechanics as we know it wouldn't work without fix 2 anyway, as information ought to be preserved.

      Okay, this one I'm officially too dumb for. How does destroying some qbits destroy the universe?
      ```

      - u/Joern314:
        ```
        Think of the universe as consisting of exactly two qbits.
        Then reality is just a state

        a|00>+b|01>+c|10>+d|11> with coefficients a,b,c,d whose square means something like "probability to find the universe in that state". 

        Now by destroying the second qbit in a universe like my post described, you end up with the state

        0=0|0x> + 0|1x> where x symbolises destroyed qbits. In reality x stands for "many electrons and quarks arranged in the shape of an iron cube", which actually are many qbits. It's just replacing text and adding more summands with coefficients that are all 0. Similarly the real universe is a collection of many qbits and produces thus many coefficients that are 0 as well.

        Important is: the probability to find the universe in *any* state is now 0. Which practically means non-existence.

          I can't follow your reasoning; aren't you just removing basis vectors by destroying states, meaning the combined wave function is no longer normalized?
          ```

    - u/JohnKeel:
      ```
      Some problems:

      Who exactly are you going to manage to threaten? An effective threat requires fear, and saying "Don't shoot me, I need to explain quantum computing" isn't going to be particularly effective.

      But more importantly: I'm pretty sure quantum effects don't scale like that.

    I suppose you could kill someone with this.

    Just wait until they enter a water drinking contest, drink as much water as they can stand and win the first place prize, and have the cube appear in their bladder replacing the urine as you hoist them in the air by their hips out of "joy" for them winning.

    Since bladders can inflate up to six inches in size, the cube should just fit in their body killing them.

    EDIT: Nevermind. I just reread the requirements. I thought the cube could just appear between your hands no matter how wide the distance between your hands. I missed the part about having the hands in position to "hug" the corners.

    Well if you live long enough to see anti-aging tech or a singularity developed then you could use this power to push back the heat death of the universe indefinitely. Since [the mass energy in an iron cube of this size could power a digital civilization of truly stupendous size in the degenerate era](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qam5BkXIEhQ). 

    Plus in all likelihood since the 24 hours is probably based on your own subjective time you could generate vastly more energy output: Simply having your mind running extremely quickly (this is extremely effective but may not work if the power is only concerned with your relativistic reference frame), and by having the rest of your digital civilization orbiting extremely close to small black holes. This would effectively mean as far as they were concerned you are accelerated in time and producing energy much faster (with you being a digital lifeform at this point as well, so you could offset the time dilation with a faster clock speed).

    In the short term however you could use this power to become extremely famous on the grounds of being the only documented supernatural phenomenon. This level of fame would automatically afford you enough wealth to live very comfortable without needing to work. Plus since your iron blocks are created magically people will probably be willing to pay a lot of money for them, even if there's nothing actually remarkable about them other than their method of creation.

  You are able to chose any DIN A4 sheet of paper you can see and make it the target of your ability. Only one such target may exist at any given time, so doing so while another sheet is affected will remove your ability from that (previous) sheet. The ability furthermore wears of on its own if the sheet ceases to be in a state in which it would be a valid target of this ability.

  As for the effect of the ability, you are able to perceive when someone else looks at one of the surfaces of this sheet of paper. This applies even if the surface is only partially seen. 

  It also applies if it is seen via proxy (a photo, video, etc.) while the ability is still active on that specific sheet, in this case however at least one of the surfaces must fully be visible and the depicted sheet must still be DIN A4 - photoshopping it to be green would not undo the ability, but altering its dimensions would.

  Whenever you notice someone looking at an instance of your sheet, "time freezes" such that (and ONLY such that) your conscious may freely create any physically possible appearance of that sheet. To their perception, the sheet (in all of its instances) will from then on have that appearance, so long as this ability remains active on that sheet, and they will no longer trigger the ability. 

  You are ONLY informed of the fact that someone perceived the sheet, nothing else (at least not by means of this ability). Not who, not which instance, not where.... just the fact that it happened. You can make the sheet appear transparent or reflective.

    > Whenever you notice someone looking at an instance of your sheet, "time freezes" while your conscious may freely create any physically possible appearance of that sheet.  

    Time FREEZES?! As in, you have unlimited time to think of an appearance for the sheet?

    Can you use that time to think about things other than the sheet? There's plenty of stuff I need to think about and nowhere enough time for me to do so, so this time freeze would be super awesome. You can spend an eternity working out new mathematical/logical theorems in your head, writing songs and novels and poems, etc etc. The only limit would be how much you can keep in your head at the same time, which is again something you can train using unlimited time, or just brute force memorize through endless repetition.

    It seems like there's two different benefits here, one short term one post-singularity. In the short term you could get quite wealthy from the fame associated with having the only documented supernatural ability, plus you could use the ability to massively assist in art. Since for instance you could make people who see a given sheet through a proxy see it as a perfect 3D screen with them just viewing the page through a display which wraps around their entire field of vision. This means that you can use this ability to create perfect visual VR movies with graphics and special effects all being indistinguishable from reality.       
    So by making people pay to see these VR movies (since you can only have one playing at a time) you could easily become one of the wealthiest people alive. After all as many people can pay to see these movies as currently spend money in the global film industry and people would probably be willing to pay far more for this, so overtaking Jeff Bezos in wealth seems possible for you.

    The time stop power could also be used to beat the heat death of the universe if you live until anti-aging tech/a singularity. Since after all free computation is fundamentally equivalent to free energy and [can be turned into free energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon). Notably since you can gain potentially infinite amounts of subjective time during this (so long as it's in _some_ way related to altering an A4 page's appearance) there's no limits on your potential energy outputs. Additionally in the far future when you would be a digital superintelligence, you could basically act as a hypercomputer. Able to run entire universes lasting for arbitrary subjective time.        
    So once heat death started to be a concern, in all likelihood it might just make sense to have the entire rest of digital civilization switched to being run by you. That way you could have everybody switch to existing in a timeless hypercomputer and thus not even worry about the physical/computational constraints of reality. Basically this would mean you could become a benevolent god running an entire multiverse of infinite universes full of utopian worlds for infinite time.

    Does this trigger once per person and allow for different people to see different things at the same time? For example, if your sheet would be in a room with 10 people who haven't seen it yet, and they look one by one, do you get 10 separate events? What if they all look at the same time?
    ```

    - u/Neomachina:
      ```
      Once per person per use of the ability, "resets" are inderectly posible by reapplying the ability. You get 10 instances if 10 people look, always. (So yes, different people get to see different things if you so choose.)
      ```

  - u/hh26:
    ```
    This power would be subject to fewer unintended exploits if you just have to schedule the visual effects ahead of time, the time freezing is unnecessily broad.
    ```

  - u/dinoseen:
    ```
    Does the information you get about the sheet travel faster than light? What about the changes you make? If so, that's obviously useful.
    ```

    - u/Neomachina:
      ```
      You are immediately informed, and to the observer the appearance of the sheet changes to your chosen design before they are ever able to notice the original appearance of the sheet.
      ```
