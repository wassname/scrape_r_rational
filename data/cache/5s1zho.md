  I would say it that isn't. I preface this by saying that I only read the first arc and that was almost a year ago. Normally I wouldn't post because of that, but I wasn't seeing much of a response to your post.

  Quick Summary:
  The story is one of those the game-life type stories with the premise being the entire world suddenly becomes an RPG game with levels and stats screens. The protagonist, Hide, and anyone who was in the building at the time is trapped in a high school "dungeon": unable to leave until the boss is killed. Monsters periodically spawn in certain rooms, and they immediately kill almost everyone because the world paid no mind to putting everyone into areas with low level monsters.

  It becomes quickly apparent that the main character and all who follow him are going to the most powerful wherever they go.  The protagonist who is presented as a shy loner in the prologue immediately acquires a one of kind ability as is typical of these game-life series. He then gains a psychopath trait to fix that shyness of his and pave the way to glory. The first two girls he meets are also immediately given one of kind abilities right of the bat. Essentially anyone who becomes his ally gains incredible amounts of strength in short periods of time. At the very least, Hide makes plans and uses physics sometimes, but at the end of the day all fights end with the law of the fist. 

  The author tries to explore darker themes and ideological conflicts, but I don't think he really succeeds. Mainly because in order to do so he attempts to apply emotions to the main character who is supposed to be a literal psychopath.

  Change:New World is a story with a unique twist on the same premise that had high release rates during its earlier stages of writing. In my experience, it is about what you can expect out of the vast majority of the popular Royal Road stories, and rational generally doesn't meet that description.
