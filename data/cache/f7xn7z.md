    I'm confused, what does this have to do with friendship is optimal?

    Annnnnd done! 

    I loved it. Even without the quotes from Nick Bostrom, Eliezer, Scott Alexander, and Scott Aaronson at the beginning of many chapters, it would be obvious that the author is a rationalist and a transhumanist. If nothing else, it was extremely refreshing that there was no pointless waffling about the ethics of uploading. The author just skipped all the boring questions and moved on to the interesting ones.

    In the end though, this is a character story, and it's a very well written one. Strongly recommended.
