## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Like last week, I'm looking for reincarnation fics where the protagonist maintains their adult wisdom and doesn't lose them to plot contrivances. Something character focused showing how different and alienated an adult in the body and life of a child would feel would be nice.

  Another request, anything like Only Villains Do That but with a less annoying protagonist? I've finished book 3 and I love how smart the protagonist and antagonists are, as well as how even the side characters feel human. But by god is this the most aggressively unpleasant "good" protagonist I've read lol. I guess the overdramatic bard protagonist build isn't my favorite, although I do think he is a very well realized character.

    [Re: Trailer Trash](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21322/re-trailer-trash) comes close to your first ask. The protagonist is quite alienated from their past self and forgot a lot about the time.

    The initial few chapters treat her past self and family as scum, which I found quite a turn-off. This will be justified in-universe later. Still, could have done without it. The story is still being continued as far as I know. Multiple arcs are finished.

    Reverend Insanity meets your first request. However, it has a villain protagonist and is a translated Xianxia. The protagonist is also centuries old and has a somewhat inhuman mindset.

      I support the recommendation, but only if xianxia-related themes (in general, not just the cliches) aren't against the reader's preferences. 

      >villain protagonist

      I wouldn't call him a villain. Ruthless, amoral, and an antihero — sure. But his actions are a result of a ruthless setting, not a personal whim. And (IIRC) he never goes out of his way to needlessly kill or torture either, his actions are pragmatic, directed at achievung their end-goals.

  I recently stumbled across [*The Adventures of Rania Mortal the Perfectly Normal Elf*](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/59503/the-adventures-of-rania-mortal-the-perfectly-normal) which follows the titular and Perfectly Normal Elf, Raina Mortal, as she and her band of adventurers undertake strictly narrative-compliant adventures. 

  I haven't laughed this hard while reading in quite a while and this story hits all of my buttons. Metafiction, funky stuff with AI, magic, a competent cast, etc. I highly recommend it and I'm always looking for more fun stuff to read. 

  Here's one of my favorite sections

  > "That's exactly what I mean. Please stop that." Rania said. "I would really prefer to be in a story that is appropriate for all ages. That way there would be a bigger audience, and we could be more popular. And it would be much safer for us, too."

  > "...what?" Atrog said.

  > "Think about it." Rania continued. "Doing R-rated things increases the chance that you are in an R-rated story. R-rated stories can have more bad things happening in them than stories rated for younger audiences, because too many bad things would make the children cry."

  > "Therefore," Rania concluded, "you can't do anything adult until well after we are done with plot-relevant stuff, or else you will invite disaster on us all."

  > "I mean. Probably." She admitted. "It's not an exact science."

  > Lilian was amazed. This had never occurred to her before, but it made an odd amount of sense.

  > "That is so weird." Galanys said.

  > "It is not!" Rania responded. "It's perfectly obvious if you understand anthropic reasoning."
  ```

  - u/vaphyren:

    Interesting concept, but shoddy writing with kinda bad dialogue that's rather unnatural at times. From chapter 1:

    > "Alright. You have convinced me, professor. You sound like you know what you are doing, and I don't think that it will be a problem even if your reflexes have grown rusty. The three of us can already handle ourselves in a fight, and someone knowledgeable with ruin delving will be very valuable."

    > "I'm glad to hear that. Truth be told, I am not entirely convinced if I want to join your team in particular, though. Your own credentials are impressive, but I do have some concern about your teammates, and they don't seem to be here for this interview."

    > "Well, I can't say I'm surprised to hear that. Galanys and Rania must sound pretty shady on paper, if the adventuring bureau gave you their profiles. They are actually both busy at the moment, but relatively close by. How about we go get them right now, and I will make introductions? You can ask me any questions you may have on the way."

    > "Sounds good to me. Please lead the way." Balron responded, and the two of them left the office.

    Skimming ahead, the story has some neat ideas but the writing just puts me off.

  I'm about 3/4 through "The Flower that Bloomed Nowhere," https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28806/the-flower-that-bloomed-nowhere and while I've seen it mentioned from time to time here (I got the rec from going back through old Monday threads and finding it), I'm a little surprised that it's not talked about more. So many of the premises are like crack to this community - philosophical discussions about the nature of being human and self, insanely detailed world building, a sci-fi-magical setting, a murder mystery with plenty of hints so people can figure things out in advance, moments of psychological and body horror. The given description from the author is: "This story is a time loop murder mystery with a slow pace and a focus on psychological elements." 

  I think I can identify why some people might not like it, though. Probably a combination of:

  * The given description is very inaccurate. The time loop part is mentioned at the beginning, and then a bit later on by a single character, but there's been no explicit time looping after 85 chapters (out of a bit over 110). This is not Mother of Learning, with a reset every arc, so calling it a time loop may eventually be shown to be accurate, but it's context for the story, not an actual focus. It's like calling Harry Potter a series about war: yes, wars are important and eventually show up in flashbacks and at the end of everything, but the story isn't about that. 

  * Same with the murder mystery. The first body isn't found for dozens of chapters in, and is treated as a suicide. The next doesn't come for dozens of chapters more. The mystery can be summed up as "this organization has weird people and everyone has an agenda," but none of the mysteries are about murders for most of the story because people aren't dead until much later.

  * Soooo much buildup, so slowly. It's impossible to know what is a hint, so everything needs careful combing to sift through what seems relevant. Makes things progress slowly, which if it hadn't been advertised as "time loop murder mystery," I don't think it would feel that way. You'd read through quick, maybe occasionally noting a weird phrase or reaction, but not realizing until the end that "holy moly, that's what it meant all that time ago!" And rereading would be a fun hunt. But knowing from the start that careful reading will be rewarded makes everything seem tense and suspicious... But slow to have anything happen.

  * Su might be forgiven for not have genre savviness - she doesn't know she's in a timelooping murder mystery from the start, unlike us - but she still makes some incredibly dumb choices, especially for all the times people are told she's really smart and has a great mind for remembering things. She forgets things constantly. She gets clear hooks to follow up on and drops them. She'll share inconsequential errata forever but won't share major relevant points for no discernable reason. It's frustrating.

  * Some people seem to hate the Playwright/Writer interludes. I LOVED the concept, but judging by comments, it brought a lot of people out of the flow. But I see this as something similar to Umineko When They Cry, which makes the asides with the Playwright and Writer similar to Beatrice and Battler (except without direct intervention). It's a performance, and their rules fit the show well.

  Anyway, I'm really loving the story but after so long and still no real resolution (and no time loop), I'm wondering if the reason it isn't talked about more is because it flubs the landing. That would really suck if so. I think it could do a lot better, but the world itself is fascinating, as are all the different views on the world.

  Anyone else read it, and can give some insight to what they like/disliked, without spoiling the last quarter of the story?
  ```

  - u/Dufaer:
    ```
    > Anyone else read it, and can give some insight to what they like/disliked, without spoiling the last quarter of the story?

    When I tried reading it, the zeroth chapter hooked me. What followed was a lot of chapters of students on a school trip bantering about various stuff that didn't make much sense without context. There was no conflict and I started skimming. I finally dropped it when >!they were staring down a hole in an asteroid, or something!<. IIRC, they were like "Wow! This should be impossible!", but it didn't mean much to me, because the limits of the local magic were not explained clearly enough before to make me recognize it as something extraordinary.

    I do plan to try reading it again, but I am not exactly pumped to do so.
    ```

    - u/AurelianoTampa:
      ```
      Yeah, there's a lot of "tell it now, explain it later" going on, but even then the magic system is clearly categorized but not clearly defined. A Glossary gets introduced eventually (just checked, it's literally after chapter 85 lol), but scanning it early kinda blunts the reveal of certain plotpoints like what induction is or what a Prosognostic Event is and why it happens. Until then you start with assumptions: people learn magic after going through induction, and people wear veils in public because **bad things*" can happen if they don't. They're true, but not truly explained at first; and eventually it makes you go "OHHHHH, wow, huh, so that's what happens," when the full scope is revealed. It's a nice payoff, but not necessarily worth wading through the word salad and not having context for scores of chapters.

      Even the part you mentioned is like that. You don't quite understand the Empyrean Bastion, but that's because you don't quite understand the Planes, because you don't know what the Tower of Asphodel is... Etc. It does get explained later - well, the gravity part gets explained right away IIRC - but why it takes them aback gets explained better. Though it basically boils down to "you kids are the smartest of your generation, but you're also like 1/20 - 1/10 the age of these folks, so when they tell you something about how the universe operates, they're dumbing it down or lying. Stop being so shocked."
      ```

  - u/AviusAedifex:
    ```
    I adore the world building, I like the characters and their interactions and I love the mystery of what finding out what's happening, but I don't really care for who the killer is. Like you said, it takes so long for the murders to happen, that by that time it happens I was already fully invested into the story so it doesn't change my mind either way. 

    And I didn't really like the Playwright/Director interludes originally, but looking back it works a lot better. The first one felt weird, but that's because I haven't really seen it anything like it besides Pathologic.

  I posted this as a reply in last week's thread, but it was Sunday afternoon so probably didn't get seen by many, and I realized it might actually be a decently broadly applicable rec:

  The Talos Principle is a puzzle game about what it means to be alive, what has meaning, and what is important. It's both a fantastic puzzle game with interesting mechanics and fantastic story, it is 20 (ish) hours to beat, especially if you don't particularly care about 100% completionism

  Also, a request: I loved Horizon: Zero Dawn (you loved an immensely popular award winning game? Shocker), but I mostly cared about the story. Slowly having the backstory of the world revealed was one of the most rewarding video game experiences I've ever had (maybe not surprisingly: Talos Principle has a similar-ish feel as far as how the story is revealed). Does anyone have any recommendations for games that are similar in that one respect? The game-play etc. was....fine, but not even close to the main reason I loved H:ZD and I'd love to find more games with similar story elements (or an equally good story told in similar ways, not necessarily a similar story)

    >Slowly having the backstory of the world revealed was one of the most rewarding video game experiences I've ever had

    I would highly recommend Outer Wilds for this. It's essentially a space archeology game, where you explore and try to figure out the world and backstory. If you do play it, go in cold.
    ```

    - u/lillarty:
      ```
      Important caveat is that a significant number of systems have terrible input delay when playing Outer Wilds, and there is no fix for it. If you start it up and find it's giving you a headache, either quit now or learn to ignore it.
      ```

      - u/cthulhusleftnipple:
        ```
        How much input delay are we talking? Personally, I am very, very sensitive to latency (50ms is too much, IMO), and I had no problems. I did play it on pc, though, so maybe that helped?
        ```

        - u/lillarty:
          ```
          I played it on PC as well. I didn't precisely time it but I'd estimate it at ~300ms, it was genuinely unplayable for me. I spent far too long trying to fix it and eventually just gave up entirely; there's only so many times you can reinstall graphics drivers and swap out hardware before you just decide a game isn't worth the trouble. From talking to others that had problems it seems as though it has no correlation to performance, as there were plenty of people whose hardware ran the gamut of performance.

              Yes. I originally had a paragraph writing about how I was running it at 300+ FPS when uncapped, but I felt that the same message was conveyed by the final sentence of my post. I'm not trying to convince you that your version *will* run into issues, just that it's a known issue with the game that has no solution.

    *Games I have played that might fit:*

    **Inscryption**: You are trapped in a cabin with an shadowy figure and forced to play a card game in a loop. To escape you might need to do more than just win. (95% positive reviews on Steam)

    The start of **Prey (2017)** at least is amazing. You wake up in your apartment; get to your appointment. Things turn to shit; you wake up in your apartment again. What's going on? (90% positive reviews on Steam)

    **Can of Wormholes**: There is a crash in a wormhole and your can has to dump all its worms to evacuate from the big worm, or something? By the end, the opening will make sense and you will learn to exploit all the edge cases of the snake/sokoban puzzle everything in this world is built around. (99% positive reviews on Steam)

    **Noita** is a side-scrolling roguelite dungeon dive, right? Don't pay attention to the giant tree outside the dungeon entrance. (95% positive reviews on Steam)

    (*Noita* is brutally hard. Use cheats to circumvent permadeath, if you want to finish it in anything approaching a reasonable timeframe.)

    *Games I haven't played that might fit:*

    **Heaven's Vault**: You are an archaeologist reconstructing a lost language. (90% positive reviews on Steam)

    **The Forgotten City**: A time loop mystery in ancient Rome, apparently. (96% positive reviews on Steam)

      ```
      From the makes of "Baba is you" and "The Swapper"

      [Noita](https://store.steampowered.com/app/881100/Noita/) is truly brutal. A good run can last several hours and you can die in seconds. But I keep coming back to it because it can give you an experience that nothing else can. A sense of exploration of not merely the world, but the very mechanics of magic itself.

      When you play Noita, you're not there to win, or even to survive. Hell, most of the time you will kill yourself with your own magic, but for every step you learn something new, which will motivate you to persist.

      But the best aspect is the magic. It is made from a few hundret building blocks that are easy to understand. Then emergent behaviour kicks in and the logic of it comes together to become a topic that can be Studied. This is a childhood fantasy for me, where I can finally unleash abhorred creation of magic upon the Denizens who have brought torturous days upon me. Where I can seek deep truths of the great work through countless hours of study and willingness to sacrifice even my life for knowledge. Where with a keen mind the rumoured barriers of you world can be broken.

      An entertaining introduction is [Noita, a roguelike for the mentally deranged](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhetH7PwVh8&ab_channel=Albino).

      The game is too hard even for me, so I use [Spell Labs](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2297568811), [Glowing Hearts](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2191848289) and [Wand Dbg](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2572385079) from the Steam Workshop. For those who don't want to invest hundreds of hours in this game, [Dead Isn't Dead](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2007426411) is a good option.

      [Noita](https://store.steampowered.com/app/881100/Noita/) is a really good game and you should all give it a try.
      ```

      - u/Makin-:
        ```
        My main issue with Noita, and it's a BIG one, is that every single game starts the same way. With games like Binding of Isaac, the gameplay can change drastically with a single item, but with Noita you'll get sick to death of taking the same actions over and over until you get a synergy.

    I never was able to get far in The Talos Principle, but I loved H:ZD. For each of these games there's a natural unraveling of the world that comes about as you play and complete the game, but none are really as cutscene heavy as H:ZD. You'll get more for your mileage if you really dig into the environmental story-telling/NPC's in the games. Let me know if you have any questions on the below!

    **Tunic** has some great Zelda/Souls-like gameplay with very challenging puzzles that might appeal to you. The story is good, but much more barebones and up to interpretation than H:ZD. 

    **Outer Wilds** is a space exploration game where you're a new astronaut looking to find out everything you can about the small solar system in the game. Amazing story that requires you to piece together the mysteries yourself and rewards you with major aha moments throughout. 

    **Immortality** is by far the least "gamey" out of the above recs. It's three interactive movies where you can jump from scene to scene by highlighting an object or person that shows up in another scene. The goal of the game is to find out what happened to the lead actress of the three movies. There's an element of randomness involved here but I found it provided a similar sense of aha moments to the above two games when you finally land on a scene that you've been following the thread of.
    ```

  - u/CodexesEverywhere:
    ```
    In terms of slowly unravelling a mystery of what happened, I would recommend Obra Dinn.

    &#x200B;

    And add my rec to Outer Wilds, which has cemented itself as one of my top 10 games of all time.
    ```

  - u/FaereOnTheWater:
    ```
    I liked The Witness.  Don't go in looking for a narrative- it's more of a thematic game, it's definitely saying things (sometimes directly to the player!), just not by embedding a traditional radio-play/movie/novel-style narrative.  I found the way the mechanics elaborated really beautiful (and rational in the way the best puzzle games are- you figure/are guided to trying to model the rules of the puzzles you're solving through experimentation).  

    If you played the Talos Principle and found yourself trying to get through the puzzles to get to the narrative, you probably won't like it- I think the game sort of disdains the idea of 'rewards' for solving puzzles.  Your reward for solving a puzzle is more puzzles, and also there's a really beautiful island to walk around on and look at, full of things to notice.  If you'd like something that's akin to taking all of the words out of the Talos principle and trying to say what it's trying to about [talos principle thematic spoilers] through the quasi-language of puzzles and environmental imagery, you might love it.
    Some people really bounce off of the game, some really like it.

    I haven't played it but a friend highly recommends Pathologic for its slow backstory unraveling. (and  theres a culture of youtube essays prizing this quality in the game).

  - u/TheAnt88:
    ```
    I would recommend: The return of the Obra Dinn and perhaps to search youtube for lists of best mystery games as I played this one off of a youtube recommendation and loved it. It is a mystery adventure based on exploration and logical deduction where you have to figure out what the hell happened to the ship, its crew, and all its cargo. It was a good weekend game and very similar to what you are looking for.

  Just caught up to the two new chapters of Book of the Dead, and found myself wanting more. This is the sort of Necromancer story I’ve been looking for. Are there any other novels like it, published or web?

  And by that, I mean a traditional necromancer raising the dead, and using them as the primary form of combat, instead of wacky bullshit like Sylver Seeker and Saintess Summons Skeletons. I also love the angle of the MC being good, but ostracized and hunted down for a sinister and evil seeming class, but it’s alright if the novel doesn’t have it. Is there anything out there quite like this? Surely there’d be at least a few amazing necromancer novels out there.
  ```

  - u/hoja_nasredin:
    ```
    Can you tell me more about that book?
    ```

    - u/TheTruthVeritas:
      ```
      In that world, people get their ordained main Class in a ritual where they touch a special rock. The MC gets the Necromancer class, which is illegal. He doesn’t want to give it up, and wants to become a great hero like his parents are, and runs away. He learns about his class and grows as he’s constantly hunted and despised. He struggles with morality in his actions as he seeks to do the right thing, being uncomfortable with trapping people’s souls for ghosts and revenants, or even in killing thieves and captured enemies(they escape and try to kill him again).

      What I love is that it really stays true to the concept. The MC specializes in skeletons, and it focuses on him struggling to survive, scraping hard to find complete skeletons to reanimate, dealing with the issues of quantity versus individually stronger opponents with strategy. The litrpg isn’t very obtrusive, and the power system revolves more around his understanding and expertise with abilities.

    RavensDagger's Dead Tired just came off a long hiatus. It features a traditional necromancer raising the dead and using them as the primary form of combat (including discussions of the logistical differences between living and necromantic armies) but also plenty of wacky bullshit. The MC is good, but necromancy is not well regarded.

    Very NSFW. Incomplete and Inactive, but still a very long story.
    Main Character becomes a necromancer because she has no better options, and has to fight being shunned by society. I think she does a very good job of planing and doing the best she can. Great worldbuilding too.
    Though all of this is from memory. It's been like 10 years since I read the story...

    [An Undertow of Sand](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/an-undertow-of-sand-percy-jackson-and-the-cthulhu-mythos.941042/) by Shujin (PJO x Lovecraft Mythos), by far my favorite cross. It fuses both settings incredibly seemlessly while simultaniously using this to patch the many flaws in PJO's worldbuilding. And it just updated today!

  Is anyone up to date on Beware of Chicken? I dropped it a while ago because it was going kind of slow and I wasn't as interested in the story. Did it ever pick up again?
  ```

  - u/chiruochiba:
    ```
    That depends on what you think "pick up again" means. The story just completed a major arc (the Dueling Peaks arc), and after that it went through a slice-of-life heavy denouement which brought fulfillment to several hanging plot threads in a satisfying way. The denouement also contained a few stories about tangential side characters.

    Currently the story is in the early stages of a new arc which addresses plot elements that were introduced near the end of the Dueling Peaks arc. Bi De and some companions are traveling to investigate >!the Shrouded Mountain sect to see if they will be a threat in the future!< while Xiulan and her group are traveling to work on >!uniting the sects of the Verdant Hills!<. Chapters focused on those adventures are interspersed with slice of life chapters showing Jin's peaceful life with his newborn son and extended family.

  In light of the strides and waves GPT-4 has been making recently,  I'd like recommendations for stories that heavily feature AI. Said AI does not need to be a main character, but it should play a major focus of the story. Story doesn't have to be long or strictly rational so long as it is engrossing and mostly makes sense. Examples of what I'm looking for from on both the friendly and non-friendly spectrum include >!Dragon!< from Worm, AM from I have no mouth and I must Scream, and Cassandra from Alexander Wales' Boxed-In.

  Side note, I've kept up with the news surrounding GPT-4 as best as I can and it's astonishing how quickly things are unfolding now. I've done some reading up on Less Wrong and other internet spaces on what public opinion is from those who are informed about the technology. If anyone here has any suggestions for more non-fiction reading to do on the topic, that is more than welcome as well.

    Fiction-y stuff:

    * I second the [*Crystal Society*](http://crystal.raelifin.com/) recommendation. If you want engrossing stories centered around AI, this is the perfect fit.

    * You might also enjoy [*The Gig Economy*](https://zerohplovecraft.substack.com/p/the-gig-economy); some AI-centered near-future cosmic horror.

    * Can't go wrong with Charles Stross' [*Accelerando*](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/17863), either: depicts a soft-takeoff singularity.

    * Ohh, gwern's [*It Looks Like You're Trying to Take Over the World*](https://gwern.net/fiction/clippy)! A detailed depiction of a hard-takeoff scenario centered on a near-future LLM (i. e., a GPT-4-like). Lots of paper citations to show how various features of it are plausible, sort of straddles the line between fiction and non-fiction.

    * [This post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AyNHoTWWAJ5eb99ji/another-outer-alignment-failure-story) by Paul Christiano is of a similar type, and is written in a very compelling manner.

    > If anyone here has any suggestions for more non-fiction reading to do on the topic, that is more than welcome as well.

    What specifically are you looking for?

    * [Simulators](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vJFdjigzmcXMhNTsx/simulators) provides a good framework for thinking about how LLMs work. (But don't take it *too* literally.)

    * [SolidGoldMagekarp](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aPeJE8bSo6rAFoLqg/solidgoldmagikarp-plus-prompt-generation) and [The ‘ petertodd’ phenomenon](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jkY6QdCfAXHJk3kea/the-petertodd-phenomenon) depict an investigation into so-called "glitch tokens" — a pretty creepy and mysterious emergent property of modern language models.

    * [The Waluigi Effect](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/D7PumeYTDPfBTp3i7/the-waluigi-effect-mega-post) explores a less creepy, but nonetheless interesting, emergent property.

    * [Zvi's weekly AI newsletter](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/zvi) (look for posts that start with AI#[N]) is a pretty good way to stay up-to-date on the latest happenings in the AI sphere. Very long, though.

    There's the WWW trilogy by Robert J Sawyer. It's about an AI that is spontaneously born on the net, and how it learns to cooperate/coexists with humans.

    It's a bit old (first book is from 2009), but I remember enjoying it when I first read it.

  [https://omnybus.tumblr.com/post/697053854902140928/indeed-one-of-my-least-favorite-tropes-is-the](https://omnybus.tumblr.com/post/697053854902140928/indeed-one-of-my-least-favorite-tropes-is-the)

  It is about the evil character treating their subordinates kindly and with respect. After all you don't want to lose good help! Also the above link is a short comic.
  ```

  - u/Bartimeaus:
    ```
    You should try the “Dire” series. Its not necessarily about a villain treating there subordinates better, it’s about a person who decided she needs to take over the world because she’s the only one who can make it better. As a consequence she treats her people very well because “it would be beneath Dire”

    It started as a worm fanfiction [dire worm](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dire-worm-worm-au-oc.300816/) then lead to  a series on amazon books thats definitley worth a look. I would describe it as a serious super hero comedy, if that makes sense

    Over in manga-land, a major villain in [Mahou Sensei Negima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negima!_Magister_Negi_Magi) is some sort of magically-created homunculus who works for the final boss. His hobby is rescuing orphaned children from war zones. He then escorts them to safety and pays to send them to a boarding school in ~~magical Switzerland~~ a country that's geopolitically neutral and heavily armed, and therefore untouched by war. He doesn't have minions; he has people who are helping him because they love him.

    (In the sequel, it's revealed that the final boss is a perfect utilitarian who telepathically feels all joy and suffering in the solar system, and is trying to wipe out humanity after many centuries of trying to alleviate the woes of the world, and still finding that the sign of the utility function is negative. Another villain is trying to maintain a stable population, and declares in the middle of a big fight scene that the best thing that has happened in all of human history is the invention of the Haber-Bosch process for ammonia synthesis, which made it possible to permanently escape the Malthusian trap. At this point I'm convinced that this author doesn't know how to write characters who are *actually bad people*, and he compensates for it by giving all of his villains weird galaxy-brain reasons for what they're doing. It's oddly charming.)

    [A Young Woman's Political Record](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-political-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.660569/reader/) is probably close enough to what you're looking for, and I enjoyed it a lot. Probably a bunch of other Youjo Senki fics would also fit the bill, Tanya's character is conducive to that sort of thing.

  I've been really enjoying [Hero of the Valley](https://www.goodreads.com/series/336418-the-hero-of-the-valley), it's a litrpg with cultivation elements. The MC is competent and rational. There's thought put into builds, skill selection and synergies, he goes to mentors for advice on his build. 

  &#x200B;

  It's really focused on combat, and specially on having a realistic representation of sword fighting while also skipping the boring repetitive parts of it. The author apparently did lots of HEMA or something similar, and it shows.

  &#x200B;

  The main thing it lacks is character, he gets a sidekick at the end of book 3, which also coincides with the big reviews on the overarching plot and worldbuilding, before then it's mostly him delving dungeons, journeying and sometimes making friends. 

  &#x200B;

  The plot is generic power fantasy cultivation / litrpg, but done competently and with capable actors. 

  &#x200B;

  This is my jam, one of the best things I've read this year, if you're here and like this type of story you'll probably enjoy it also, as it is exactly it but done remarkably well.
