    Not necessarily off the table yet.  They ruled it out because Zach doesn't go off and do things consistently on each restart, but what if Red Robe is near him at the initial restart?

    Zach and his caretaker don't get along.  Zach even went out of his way to attack the caretaker on the restarts where he left.  Maybe he found out the caretaker was working for one of the enemy factions?  And maybe the caretaker is good at mind magic?

    So it goes like this;  Zach suddenly acts weird due to loops, Caretaker checks up on him with mind magic, finds out about loops, plants a memory packet (possibly spending several weeks preparing to plant it before end of loop), next loop Caretaker finds the packet when doing the scan and can take advantage of it from then on, as long as he can track down Zach and fix the packet by the end of the loop.

    It would explain why there are long bouts of no activity from RR.  Those are resets were Zach doesn't act strange enough for a memory scan or simply leaves without confronting the caretaker or something.

    In conclusion:  Illuminati, Half Life 3, Jet fuel can't melt time loops.

    Rea and Nochke being cat shifters is pretty much sealed at this point.  I feel like that scene and the Red Robe speculation were devoted to shutting down fan theories while the characters worked their way through their own questions.  Which isn't a terrible method, and didn't feel particularly awkward as long as it doesn't get overused.

    I think Zorian has killed a few people already, but now we are seeing his (unintentional) mind crush powers.  He actually has a good way of dealing with Red Robe permanently if he is still in the loop.  He would still have to defeat him first though.

    Xvim is interesting

      Oh yeah, I hadn't realised that. He could melt Red Robe's brain out his ears or fill him with compulsions or *anything* really. Mind magic is scary in a time loop.
      ```

    - u/SpeculativeFiction:
      ```
      He also knows where to get a spell to recover Zach's memories.

        I mean at the end of the story Zorian mindrapes some people to death. That's what not shielding yourself gets you.

            I imagine you neatly fixing their cute little bowties and folding their hands on their chest with a slight tapping on the shoulder while saying that.

          Xvim is one of those "suspicious coincidences." I agree that it's not unfair to assume that, since he is unusually aware that mind magic is a threat, he might have additional, undetected defenses or contingencies other than the mind shield.
          ```

        - u/Ozimandius:
          ```
          What bothers me in addition to that is that Zorian's passive mind detection and empathy which he is pretty much constantly using should have turned up a blank to him or if not then he should have mentioned if there was any internal reaction on Xvim's part on an emotional level.  

          The fact that he leaves any mention of his empathy out seems odd to me (especially since he implies the only way he could know if Xvim noticed was if Xvim said something...)  So either Zorian didn't bother using his empathy sense (weird) OR the empathy sense wasn't working on Xvim (in which case why would you try a mind probe or be surprised when it didn't work?).  Very confusing.
          ```

        - u/FuguofAnotherWorld:
          ```
          It might be the same type, or it might not. Zorian doesn't know for sure from the outside. Presumably it's possible to disguise an advanced shield as a simple shield.
          ```

        - u/SpeculativeFiction:
          ```
          There are a few types of defensive mind magic--most of which are easily gotten around by telepaths, as the spells don't really change patterns (per novelty or the matriarch.) Mind shield is simply the most effective (besides the one that cuts you off from the "great web", and makes you go crazy, which he can't be using)--and is more effective if the caster has good shaping control...which xvim probably has.

          >But then Zorian's next thought is worrying that Xvim might have detected the probe

          One of Zorian's defining traits is paranoia. It's not *that* weird a reaction.
          ```

  - u/Charlie___:
    ```
    I dunno, I still think the most plausible explanation is that he just doesn't like young people.
    ```

  - u/SpeculativeFiction:
    ```
    The fact that he's never been seen during the invasion is pretty weird on it's own. His lack of surprise at Zorian's talents might be explained if he was also Damien's tutor/advisor.

    The constant mental shield goes well with Xvim's attitude of perfection. It's a tossup really. He's definately not Red Robe--i'm pretty sure that's [](#s "Veyers Boranova.")

        It seemed obvious on my second read through. There is a ton of foreshadowing in the early chapters.

        1) The author is really good with foreshadowing and conservation of detail. Most plot points are hinted at before they appear (Zorian's empathy, the red-headed girl being a wolf shifter, Kirielle's family troubles, etc), and virtually no fluff is present. Is something odd is mentioned, it's probably going to come up later. Mentioning Veyers as an old bully of Zorian's is foreshadowing *something.*

        2) Red robe pretty much had to be on campus when the time loop started (during the first festival.) That pretty much just leaves a student, a teacher, or one of the politicians at the dance. Zorian would have noticed a teacher mysteriously being absent, and the politicians have *no* characterization--it wouldn't match the author's style for one of them to be Red Robe. It can't be anyone who actually shows up on campus, as Zorian isn't hiding his progression, and Red Robe has no reason to stay on campus--Like Zach, he has better things to do.

        3) Boranova *passed* his exam--the reason he isn't in Zorian's year is because he lost his temper during a disciplinary hearing. We don't know when that was, but it sounds a lot like Zach's regular fights with his mentor.
        ```

  - u/FuguofAnotherWorld:
    ```
    I think if Xvim knew what was going on he would take actions that were actually helpful. Like telling Zorian how the hell to sense the damn marbles instead of letting him fail for who knows how long without the slightest bit of guidance.

  Finally stuff is moving forward. Too bad he can’t do memory packets yet, but that other skill is already good enough. I wonder if this chapter starts a trend of him relying on other people to help him. Other than the Aranea he seemed to ignore people outside of training.

    >Zorian just started hurting people because he knew the loop would reset it. 

    They're cultists seeking to bring about Armageddon and actively helping an army of necromancers invade. They need to die eventually anyway, to prevent them waking up the primordial.

    Also, they're asleep when it happens, so it's not like they'll feel anything.

- u/MoralRelativity:
  ```
  I'm glad to be getting into some action after such a long (but interesting) time building skills. It still came as a shock to me that Zorian could be so ruthless. Yes, it's all going to get reset soon but it didn't fit my mental image of Zorian.

  And then the bombshell in the last two paragraphs! Wow, I can't wait for more.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Theory on Red Robe - he doesn't reset. At all. He travels linearly through the time loops, unaffected by the resets.
  ```

  - u/elevul:
    ```
    How would that work?
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      His marker isn't purely spiritual and mental - it's physical as well. It's how he killed the aranea, by killing them not in looped time but in linear time. Whatever the spell is, though, it's not resetting just Zach and Zorian - it's resetting everything, including their bodies. Red Robe just dodges the effect of the reset. He's not ever "leaving" anywhere, he's already wherever he was when Zach's death or the time limit triggered the reset.
      ```

      - u/ZeroNihilist:
        ```
        My theory about him killing the Aranea is that he *didn't* kill the Aranea. Instead he shunted their souls out of the loop (thus they appear, inside the loop, to have been immediately dead).
        ```

        - u/elevul:
          ```
          Yeah, that's the most common theory, and the one that makes the most sense.
          ```

          - u/ZeroNihilist:
            ```
            And here I was thinking I'd had an original thought.

          - u/FuguofAnotherWorld:
            ```
            I just assumed he ate/destroyed their souls or something. Souls seem to be persistent throughout the loops after all.
            ```

            - u/elevul:
              ```
              It was stated within the story that souls cannot be destroyed in any way.

          Not really - it's just an idea that would explain some things, you know? Feel free to pick holes in it. For example, Red Robe doesn't act like Zorian or Zach, often focusing on different areas, but not originating in an easily-found point. The simplest explanation is that he's moving purely in space, and not at all in time.
          ```

          - u/FuguofAnotherWorld:
            ```
            Or just teleporting and they don't know where from.
            ```

      - u/GeeJo:
        ```
        Wasn't Zach training for the equivalent of 20 years before Zorian got included in the loop? Maybe Red Robe's just keeled over of an age-induced heart attack and that's why he isn't around these days.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          ...he's a soul-magic specialist in a universe with phylacteries.
          ```

          - u/GeeJo:
            ```
            it was kind of a joke.
            ```

      - u/Gurkenglas:
        ```
        Huh, that reveals the dichotomy between each new repeat being appended to the end of the timeline, or branching off from a global divergence point. The way to test this would be seeing after the end of the loop how much time has passed in the outer planes.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          That, or it's a single point of divergence - a single timeline in which the loops repeat, before eventually rejoining with the main one after the total sum of time has passed
          ```

  - u/darkflagrance:
    ```
    That might explain Zach s random movements. If Red is traveling outside the loop but calling Zach to him at each loops inception, it would cause a set of apparently random teleports.
    ```
