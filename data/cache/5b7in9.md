## An interesting paper -- how well do people bet when they know the exact rules of a rigged game?

### Post:

The exact title is "Rational Decision-Making Under Uncertainty:
Observed Betting Patterns on a Biased Coin" by Haghani and Dewey. 

Here's the game -- "you are offered a stake of $25 to take out your laptop to bet on the flip of a coin for thirty minutes. You're told the coin is biased to come up heads with a 60% probability, and you can bet as much as you like on heads or tails on each 
flip. You will be given a check for however much is in your account at the end of the half hour."

Who were the subjects? -- "The sample was largely comprised of college age students in economics and finance and young professionals at finance firms. We had 14 analyst and associate level employees at two leading asset management firms. The sample consisted of 49 males and 12 females. Our prior
was that these participants should have been well prepared to play a simple game with a defined positive expected value."

The Results -- "Our subjects did not do very well. While we expected to observe some suboptimal play, we were surprised by the pervasiveness of it.....We were surprised that one third of the participants wound up with less money in their account than they started with. More astounding still is the fact that 28% of participants went bust and received no payout."

This is particularly interesting to me, as it's a topic I touched on (lightly) on Ch 13 of Draco Malfoy and the Practice of Rationality (although that game's players did not know the rules).

And ... as a bonus ... it tells you the optimal strategy (making certain assumptions about your utility function).

  It's reasonable to assume that people won't instantly know the Kelly Criterion so wouldn't play "perfectly" optimally.  And in fact it's I'm not completely sure that it's truly optimal in the case where a maximal cap exists, if you bet a smaller pecentage more time by betting very quickly (since you know you're always betting heads and it's computer simulated, I think you can bet as quickly as you can type in what your bet is) you might be able to hit the cap more consistently, I'm not completely sure.  And also it would be a waste of time to calculate the precise percent of your current worth between each bet (unless you're using something easy like 10%) some approximations are fine.

  But I think it's pretty intuitive to scale your bets with your current value, and never bet 100%.

  And "always bet heads" is obvious to anyone who knows anything about probability.  There is no excuse.  I am astounded and disappointed and angry all at once.

    From the paper:

    > We programmed the coin to be in a flipping mode for about 4 seconds, to create some suspense on each flip,
    and also to limit the number of flips to about 300.

    ```
    Most of the players didn't even figure out a constant % betting strategy. My initial strategy was 10%, which is below the Kelly criterion value, but still the right strategy.
    ```

    - u/PeridexisErrant:
      ```
      Always betting a constant proportion is the optimal strategy; what the proportion should be is determined by your risk appetite.  (assuming a reasonably linear utility:dollars at the relevant scale)
      ```

    - u/zarraha:
      ```
      Even if it's not obvious that "exactly constant" is the correct solution, it should be pretty clear that your betting amounts should scale upwards as your total money does, and downwards as it drops, so that you never end up betting everything you have.  My initial strategy was a vague "let's throw in $5 to be safe and then adjust as necessary" which starts at 20%, but I would probably bet $5 the first few rounds and only update it to be proportional again every few bets.

  I was curious about the game, and started reading the paper.

  In the paper, they tell you the optimal betting strategy in detail before actually giving you a link that would allow you the play yourself.

  If you want to give it a shot yourself, without spoiling the ideal strategy, here's the link: http://coinflipbet.herokuapp.com/

    I wrote a quick JS version since this seems to be down. I replaced the 4 second wait time with the bet limit it was intended to enforce, but otherwise I imagine it should be roughly the same.

  My strategy would come from mistrust of the digitally controlled coin. I have no idea if the 60% is true, and the coin could be rigged; rules changing based on bet and bank size, etc. There could even be a human on the other end deciding the results.

  My strategy would be to bet a single cent every time until time runs out, or I noticed the results moving away from 60% heads. Either I'll statistically walk away with a small amount of winnings, or I'll catch on to trickery and stop playing before I lose more. Sure, this isn't optimal for the goal of maximizing winnings, but you can't play optimally if you can't trust the RNG.

    There's a significant opportunity cost to this strategy.  You're playing with house money and your maximum possible loss is $25.  If the expected value of the experiment is greater than $50 then you are losing money by not taking them at their word and playing aggressively.

    Put differently:  you're playing with house money and cannot possibly walk out the door with less money than you had when you walked in.  Why would you *not* assume that they're telling the truth and play to win?  Or, alternatively, just take the $25 and leave immediately without making a single bet?  What are you trying to achieve with your strategy?
    ```

    - u/Psychobeans:
      ```
      If it was house money then I misunderstood. I was under the impression that it was my money. I wouldn't bet at all if it was house money, and take the $25.
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        OP says "you are offered a stake of $25". The paper says that they gave out the money.

        You realize that you're saying you would give up $225 that you are statistically almost guaranteed to get because you assume that someone who wants to do an experiment is definitely going to cheat you?  I'm sorry to hear that; it sounds like a tough way to think.

          > OP says "you are offered a stake of $25". The paper says that they gave out the money.

          I skimmed to the rules of the game, but is there really a difference between betting my money and money given to me? The moment they say I am given $25 to start, the $25 is now my money, and I am investing it into gambling if I play.

          > you assume that someone who wants to do an experiment is definitely going to cheat

          No, what I assume is: it is possible that what is being tested is not actually what I am told is being tested. For all I know, they could be testing for how many people are actually willing to play when presented with a gambling game with odds in their favor, or maybe they are testing how people react to losing and the coin is rigged to make them lose. The point is that I can't know for certain.

          I'm not saying they are trying to cheat me out of my money, I am saying that I would rather walk away with a guaranteed small payout than risk it. I can't know for certain that they aren't testing something else entirely.

          Distrust of a game is a valid reason to decide not to play.

            So what you're saying is you would never make an investment in which the payout is all but assured? That sounds like the only way for you to ever make money is salary employment.

                ```
                So because you participate in an experiment your expectations of getting cheated are much much higher than real life? Why is that? Are scientists conducting an experiment, in your experience, less trustworthy than average?

                  Let me explain differently: Experiments are designed to collect data from subjects. Sometimes, it is necessary to trick, lie to, or mislead subjects to collect the data. I, currently, have no information on the frequency of trickery experiments versus non-trickery experiments. Therefore, if part of the rules of an experiment I am participating in is "you can walk away now with cash", I will likely walk away with cash.
                  ```

                    > I, currently, have no information on the frequency of trickery experiments versus non-trickery experiments.

                    If you have no information, why assume a 100% trickery instead of investing a bit of the cash in order to investigate?
                    ```

  - u/Magnap:
    ```
    If the coin is rigged to 60% heads, to even show it's rigged, if you want to do significance testing with p < 0.05 and 80% power, you'd need *188* flips.

    EDIT: In case the point I was trying to make with this wasn't clear: proving deception with limited resources (time and money) is difficult.
    ```

    - u/sparr:
      ```
      They had time to make 300 flips. 200 to make sure it's rigged and then 100 to play for max profit would still do better than most of the players did.

  - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
    ```
    Since participant trust in the experimenter is a commons, and economists know what a commons is, economic psychologists *do not lie* about experimental setups to subjects.

    (No such rule or reason holds among cognitive psychologists generally, unfortunately.)

      ```
      Ah, but how do you know that it's not a cognitive psychology experiment masquerading as an economics experiment?

  - u/Dragonheart91:
    ```
    I honestly didn't consider deception and I totally should have. It would probably be worth it to bet a single penny approximately 40 times to determine if the 60% probability is holding before starting "real" bets.

    My betting strategy before reading the guide would have been 50% of my pool each bet. After reading their explanation I can see that my instinct is too high lol.
    ```

    - u/Psychobeans:
      ```
      The problem with the possibility of deception is it might not activate the deception until you start making "real" bets.
      ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      That strategy assumes that the researcher lied about the odds your coin, but told the truth about every single other aspect of the game. What's to say they won't "switch" the coin with a different one halfway through the game? That might be part of an interesting experiment, to see if people notice conflicting evidence or something.
      ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Never heard of the Kelly criterion before, but no lie, my instinct was to bet 25% of my stake per flip (proper answer is apparently 2*0.6-1=20%, but I tend to live dangerously anyway.)

  EDIT: Not noticing this was half a month old is what I get for browsing reddit with insomnia.
  ```

- u/gwern:
  ```
  It's not that surprising a result. In all these sorts of experiments, whether it's the RAND studies on the prisoner's dilemma or calibration training, people initially perform terrible on tasks which are not ecologically valid or they have done before, but then gradually improve their performance. This takes more than 300 flips, though, which is not much for trying out various strategies with such a small edge. For example, calibration training requires at least that many items for most people, and their test items are much more informative than binary coin flips (eg one can update a lot from predicting 99% on a false item; one doesn't update nearly as much from one out of many strategies in betting $2 and losing on a 40% chance). So you would have to use play money, which I don't think would seriously damage the results' validity.
