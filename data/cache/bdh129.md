## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I've been playing through Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney after its release on Steam, and it's got me wanting something that at least *tries* to be realistic to how courtrooms and the law actually work, rather than effectively being a detective game in a courtroom setting. Does anything like that exist? A courtroom game where you could make actual/accurate objections like "question lacks foundation" or "relevance" or "hearsay" or something like that?

  (Though I've been happy enough with PW:AA on the basis of what it is, it's just not got a lot to do with actual law.)
  ```

  - u/Robert_Barlow:
    ```
    They don't exist, probably. Things like that are subjective, or carried by the lawyer's persuasive ability. And real courtroom procedure is designed to be as boring as possible. The Ace Attorney Investigations spinoff is good in that it is just a straight detective game, where (hypothetically) you combine facts into logical statements, and logical statements into hypothesis. But if you want actual lawyer shenanigans you might need to make that game yourself.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      Oh, I'm already thinking about how I would design a more correct legal game. It would probably take a ton of work just to do a proof-of-concept first case, but you could have a jury selection phase, opening statements, witnesses, expert witnesses, closing statements, etc. Maybe more than that, if you wanted to expand outside the courtroom, like, I don't know, being with your client as they're answering questions with the police.

      And yes, a lot of being in the courtroom is boring, and a lot of arguments are subjective/nuanced in a way that doesn't lend itself to selecting different dialogue options. But I'm thinking about the way that *Return of the Obra Dinn* did things, and I'm thinking that you could get something close to that. Maybe each line of dialogue could be objected to, with reasonableness rankings for each of the options, e.g. you could object on the grounds that it's hearsay, or irrelevant, and whether or not the objection was accepted would depend on the background numbers assigned by the developer. Sustained objections then help to alter either a global meter, or an individual meter for various parts of evidence and/or witness/defendant credibility.

      (You'd still have to (or want to) play fast and loose with courtroom procedure, since the typical case isn't filled with objections, but it would still in theory be closer than Phoenix Wright is.)

      Edit: Obviously, I'm hoping that someone has already made such a game.

        This [courtroom sim](http://www.makeyourcasegame.com/) should be right up your alley then. Or if you want a (not very engaging) legal roleplay in objections, [Objection! Your Honor](http://texaslregames.org/games_web_eng/objection_your_honor/objection_your_honor.html) might be interesting for a few minutes.

        Anecdotally, there might be more games or similar resources aimed at criminal justice majors in the future, apropos of a lunch chat with a bar president about pattern recognition and AI's impending takeover of the legal system. Algorithms are supposedly slated to replace judges in sentencing suggestions and will probably be relegated more duties wherever empirical pattern matching can improve the subjectivity of "justice." So if AI doesn't outright replace the industry, there oughta be more stuff. It seems the textbook-adjacent industry has already got [a money-grubbing foot in](https://www.objection.com/sub-page/products/all-games/). These "games" might not give the same dopamine kick as an ace attorney saving the day though.
        ```

  - u/turtleswamp:
    ```
    It's an intersting idea.

    I suspect the main limitation will be financial. You'd have to hire at least one lawyer to consult on your plot and game design, and lawyers who're any good get expensive fast, while independent game development tends not to make much money.

    &#x200B;

    That games like MS flight simulator, Kerbal Space Program, Fam Simulator and Bus Simulator make money, implies at least a niche market for a highly detailed law simulation game probably exists. But I can't guess at how big that market might be.

    &#x200B;

    The otehr problem would be that there are laws about non-lawyers providing legal advise, and a game that lets you run a legal case of your own crafting in a  simulated courtroom and get a simulated verdict which you present as being "realistic" is close enough that you might want to be carful about it, as if any profession is going to make an effort to defend their protectionist laws in court it's lawyers.

  I'd like to recommend [All Night Laundry](http://www.all-night-laundry.com), a webcomic with themes of time travel, eldritch horror, and genre-savvy protagonists. The author committed to a page-a-day at the start, and it has been running for *seven years* without missing a beat. It looks like it's finally, *finally* wrapping up and seems to be tying up all the loose ends, so now is a good time to jump in and ride out the final few months.

  Beyond that I don't have much to throw out right now. It's a bit of a dry spell for me- every serial fic I'm reading is either on break or updating very slowly, and I haven't come across much finished work that I haven't already read or dismissed in the last year.

  Maybe it's time to start writing a serial fic of my own with all this free time.

    Oh, nice! I've had that on my to-read list for a long time, because I didn't want to read it and then see it die later. Thanks for letting me know.

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    Heh, I'm waiting until they finish to post it as a top-level post here. I really think it's very well suited to this subreddit. It reminds me of >!Worm with multiple arcs that threaten to destroy the protagonist with ever escalating threats, but the tone is so much more optimistic and the protagonist could not be any more opposite to Taylor's personality and mindset.!<

  Some time ago someone recommended [Embers](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5398503/1/Embers), an Avatar: The Last Airbender fic.  It's definitely worth reading, even if the story itself is a bit mediocre and ends in a disappointing manner.  The original premise is that the Crossroads of Destiny episode of the original show does not result in >!Zuko betraying Iroh and the Avatar!<, but the fic starts somewhat before that episode so that it has time to ensure the dominos result in that effect, and it eventually ends up diverging fairly hard.  It starts shortly after the start of the second season, with Iroh and Zuko traveling the countryside alone as fugitives.  

  (Oh, and I'm quite certain that this isn't readable if you aren't familiar with the show; if you weren't able to follow the above paragraph in your head you won't be able to follow the work.  Entire episodes occur mid-text without much more than a passing reference, even after it begins to diverge.)

  The real benefit to the work is the high-quality worldbuilding. The entire world of Avatar is reframed and fleshed out: the various factions, kingdoms, and movements are tweaked to be more consistent, more distinct, and have much more of a cause-and-effect relationship.

  As an example, Sozin's warmongering is due to >!Sozin having too much draconic ancestry, making him vengeful and bloodthirsty!<.  The Fire Nation is forced to follow him due to the Fire Nation being bound to the whims of a single Fire Lord (>!rather than the feudal system of old, which was self-correcting!<).  The Fire Lord's position was created by decree of Avatar Kyoshi, which has spiritual weight.  Kyoshi made the decree due to the Fire Nation not accepting the responsibility for rogue pirates staffed by ex-citizens.  And Kyoshi only got involved because >!one of her own was killed by those pirates!<.  None of the major events in Embers (or the parts of the canon show that it borrows) exist in a vaccum; everything is someone reacting to something, and once details are revealed it's usually the case that everyone had at least a shred of justification.  It feels very realistic, politically.

  The Air Nomads benefit the most from the reworked worldbuilding; their pacificity is both explained and lambasted (the author frequently mentions that they have a hard time steelmanning Aang's position, yet does so admirably anyhow).  The Water, Air, Earth, and Fire nations borrow heavily from the real-world Inuit, Buddist, Chinese, and Japanese cultures they were based on to great effect.  The spiritual ramifications of "bending is a gift of the spirits" have much more concrete results (and even weaknesses!), and spirits in general are much more 'real' and present in the world than just as Avatar-bait.

  The author does an excellent job of weaving their new lore in with canon quite seamlessly, to the point that I'm certain I'll have a hard time keeping it straight from canon in the future.  As an example, >!Sokka at one point notes that when the Gaang find Monk Giatsu's skeleton among others at the Southern Air Temple, there were no child bones in spite of the temple having a large youth population.  After confirming that the Northern Air Temple did have such skeletons (buried out of respect by the earth kingdom inhabitants of that temple), he suspects that either the Air Nomads had prior warning or the Fire Nation did something with those survivors.!<  The real reason that's the case in canon is Doylist, but it's a perfectly justified Watsonian observation, and this ends up a subplot of its own.

  All in all, A+ worldbuilding, A- characterization (the character's voices are an excellent rendition of the show's), B- pacing (it's slow, albeit satisfyingly so), C- plot and ending, tho for what it's worth this is only obvious in retrospect; the plot was engaging enough until it was over.  

  If you're looking for an example of how to make the setting of a work rational, or how to make characters think and still have conflict, this is it.

      I don't know if I would say that - the vast majority of things that are posted here on a day-to-day (or month-to-month) basis aren't collected into official ebooks at all. 

      I posted this question after finding qntm's *Ra* on Kindle, and rediscovering how much of a better reading experience a dedicated e-reader is than a browser. 

      Also, I'd rather not bias the recommendations by specifying a specific preference, since I kinda like looking in to whatever people have been enjoying recently. 

      So I guess to re-frame the ask for recommendations: have you recently read a story you'd recommend to this subreddit on Kindle (or other e-reader app)?
      ```

        I agree that reading on kindle is a far superior experience. I transfer all webnovels and such to my kindle. [Here's a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/afwmz5/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/ee32znj/) I made a few months on easy ways to do that. 

        As to books I'm enjoying at the moment, I'm reading the final book in the [Book of the Ancestor](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25895524-red-sister) series, it's very good. I highly recommend the series. Interesting, original worldbuilding, good characterization, kickass action scenes, and very tight pacing. 

        I also read [Super Minion on Royal road](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion) recently. Pretty good, though unfinished. I was waiting for a bit more story to be released before recommending it here. You can easily download it with the [WebtoEpub](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webtoepub/akiljllkbielkidmammnifcnibaigelm?hl=en) extension, or one of the other methods I outline in my aforementioned comment.

    Going to un-rec [Oh This Has Not Gone Well] (https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/61ya08/oh_this_has_not_gone_well/?st=juirw8ix&sh=eec4f900), a fic which I learned about through this thread a while ago. I have a *strong* antipathy towards "The summoned hero is a smug douche who fucks his way through the harem cast while Mary Sueing his opponents into oblivion," even moreso when the author seems really uninterested in exploring the *consequences* of that behavior. This fic was the worst kind of Isekai- the kind that is entirely a self insert "Boy I'm so smart and interesting, I'd start a sexual revolution *and* conquer half the known universe if you just sent me back 800 years, also let me tell you how good I am at video games" wankfest. Kill me now.

      I also read this from a rec here. I also found the MC insufferable, with the setting and supporting characters seemingly engineered solely as a vehicle for him to distinguish himself as a special snowflake(common with these r/hfy stories). 

      Worst for me is that the very long-lived elves are basically just short longer living humans. That's it, no thought was given to develop them beyond that. And then we find out that (iirc) wealthy elves can pay magic users to be ageless and healthy. Also no apparent societal repercussions. 

      How different would a society be if the ruling class were basically immortal? How would they function, how would things change? How would the outlook of a person who doesn't have old age mortality to motivate them be, with regards to ambition, family, conflict resolution and so on? Would people resist risky occupations, if death were a comparatively bigger deal? Would they institute mechanisms into their society to prevent stagnation, or would they even have a negative connotation to freezing conventions and failing to change? 

      To all this and so much more, the answer is: No, they're not at all different to just pointy eared, short humans with magic. Blergh.
      ```

      - u/GeneralExtension:

        Only the ruling class? That's a product (almost) everyone is interested in (and those who don't aren't around very long) - and everyone knows everyone is interested in it.

          It's been a while since I read the story in question, but if I recall correctly the price of the immortality procedure is pretty high and has to be reapplied every year. So out of reach for most people.

    [Wearing Roberts Crown](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11861559/1/Wearing-Robert-s-Crown) was enjoyable. GOC SI on Robert Bearatheon. I don't think that it was significantly less wish fulfillment than other SI's but the fact that you see it from the perspective of everybody but the SI makes it appear much more plausible. I don't think that I would enjoy many books with this approach because it did make me a lot less invested in the SI but the newness was refreshing.
    ```

    - u/ketura:
      ```
      It was definitely a novel viewpoint and honestly did much to help cover up any sue-ness. I've never watched the show or read the books, so all I knew about the original storyline was through osmosis; that said even I could tell that there was a checklist of plots being thwarted, characters being saved, and problems removed before it was too late. Everything was just a little too perfect, until it suddenly wasn't.

      (which. The idea that the SI had his mind merge with Robert rather than replace him sort of explains *why* the world wasn't uplifted more; dude was probably a nerd that knew Westeros like the back of his hand, but probably didn't know much more about engineering societal ills than "put the poop and tanners somewhere we don't walk".) 

      >!I have to say I didn't expect the SI getting killed, especially so finally. You can kind of see how the author didn't know what to do after that, tho; everything meandered and I'm not sure what was being worked towards beyond some big climactic battle. !<

    I read the Bobiverse series as recommended here ...

    https://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/b83kq9/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/ek2l1o3/

    There’s some fun examination of some rational topics.  I’ll give it a soft rec because there are some irritating anti-rational tropes: 

    * Bob is an easy-goin’ guy who stays easy-goin’ even when knowingly engaged in a conflict where all sides have access to exponential growth tech.  Bob’s growth delays should be fatal.  

    * Bob picks a winner in an evolutionary race due to emotional attachment (“prime directive, bah!”), then plays tribal deity for tens of thousands of words.  It could have been an interesting uplift sidestory, but is largely cliche filler.

    * virtualxhuman romance sidestory so cringeworthy, I almost stopped reading.

    * no one wants to upload despite the physical human race being threatened with >!imminent total extinction!<.

    * >!relativistic kill vehicle!< is super secret “hail mary” option that only the protag considers, instead of being a core military consideration by all parties.

      That book's been recommended a few times here. I think most people tend to enjoy it because it's a newish idea that's well executed and fun, but it's definitely not rational. Just the events with the Deltans(iirc) is enough to disqualify it. You have a superpowerful AI, with cognition many times faster than a regular human, perfect recall, and a factory capable of producing pretty much anything he can imagine, including atmospheric entry craft and interstellar spacecraft, and despite all that he gets repeatedly wrong footed by what's basically dumb space gorillas. Just ridiculous. I couldn't get past it, ruined the book for me.
      ```

      - u/JohnKeel:

        Did you miss the explanation of how it takes time to set up production with sufficient precision to actually do those things? The logistics there couldn't handle the time crunch well enough to just build all those things in large numbers right now without hamstringing future production.

        And as to "superpowerful" - yes, each Bob is running faster than a normal human, but he still is basically a human in terms of cognition. You can't make perfect predictions based on imperfect information just by having 10 times longer to consider.

          The whole thing took days or weeks. He had time to build several probes and send them down, and he could have weeks or months of dilated time if he wanted to think of better solutions. 

          With that in mind, do you really think it's possible to be repeatedly surprised by animal attacks when you have nearly unlimited cutting edge technology in your toolbox? Right now we have the capacity to read someone's phone screen from high orbit, what do you think he would have hundreds of years in the future! He was incapable of building even infrared cameras, night vision, or radar, and that's tech that's 50+ years old!

          And then there's his inability to build weapons, so he uses his  probes to ram the space gorrillas **at low speeds**. LOL. On top of that, these fucking things break down from repeatedly ramming flesh and bone? Really? Capable of atmospheric entry and high speed acceleration, but break down when bludgeoning some meatsacks. Very plausible. 

          Even putting aside the arbitrarily fragile probes, why not put sharp blades on them instead? Make it retractable, if necessary. Or better yet, take these probes capable of going supersonic and just accelerate them at the ground like fucking cannon balls and make a gorilla shaped crater. Or even better, USE THE PROPULSION JETS TO FRY THE GORILLAS AT CLOSE RANGE. 

          Holy shit, the 5 minutes it took to write this comment just made me even more aware of how stupid this part of the book is. It's been years since I read it, and I still remember these details because *it's so so dumb*. It's possible to enjoy dumb shit, I do it all the time, but that doesn't make it not dumb. And this book is dumb as fuck.

    (review without spoilers)

    I've been reading the aSoIaF fic 'King Robert's Crown', [recommended last week] (https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bauwc6/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/ekeb177/?context=1).  It's a solid fic, I've enjoyed it. The writing is pretty good, particularly in the beginning. The innovation of having the SI not be a POV character is interesting, it definitely gave the fic a different feel to most Self-Insert fics. I was about 60% of the way through and rapidly losing interest, but then the author finally started to throw down some curve balls and stuff started to go wrong, which reignited my interest enough to finish . 

    Thanks for the rec,  u/XxChronOblivionxX!

    It does have its problems, mostly in that it takes almost 100k words to really get to a significant point of diversion from canon, in terms of major events anyway, if not characters. Additionally, the SI is totally a mary sue(as usual), and the fic feels very much like a fixfic for most of it, which I would normally hate, but it's something I've never encountered before with aSoIaF so I was able to persevere until shit started to go south. Also, the timeline is often confused, chapters have very little exposition outside of dialogue, and the author writes with no regard for establishing characters or setting. If you never read the books or watched the show, I imagine this fic will be very dry, but that's a very common fault with fanfics, so no points off. 

    Finally, I wish the SI would have introduced more innovations. What captured my interest in the first place was that I thought there would be more "uplifting", but that was very low key. I can only think of three or so things off the top of my head. Oh well.  

    **Verdict:** A solid aSoIaF SI fic that tries something new, and pulls it off decently well. 4/5

    -----------------

    Additional thoughts: I would like to someday read an actual rational fic of aSoIaF that tries to plausibly explain how the world of aSoIaF is the way it is, beyond the doylist "GRRM is a middle ages/chivalry weaboo who's bad at geography and logistics". How does a feudal society that spans a continent larger than north america remain so (relatively) stable with early medieval tech and political institutions? Even with dragons, I don't think it would work. How did technology fail to advance? Have they been stuck in 12th century european technology for what, 4 centuries? Longer? Add to that the unpredictable seasons... 

    How do low tech humans survive even 1 year of winter, let alone 5 or 10 years. It seems to me that people wouldn't venture too far north with such a massive disincentive without a substantial upside to living in a land that's so deadly. The less affected southern regions would dominate the northern regions, if only by virtue of being able to sustain a much larger population that doesn't half die or starve to death every arbitrary number of years.

    It would be interesting if all the north would have built castles on geothermal sites like winterfell, rather than it being a special feature that's unreplicable. Such a boring trope. Congregating at these sites come winter would go a long way to explaining how the north manages to survive. 

    How do animals and plants survive that? It would be interesting to examine the adaptations that the local flora and fauna would have.
    ```

    - u/RetardedWabbit:
      ```
      Playing devil's advocate in defense of canon:

      The government "stability" was due to dragons: unbeatable, terrifying, and magically fast flyers. Tyranny isn't too unreasonable when you can fly out and roast anyone anywhere without real resistance. Also the winters incentivize strong central governments, anyone who doesn't have one to stockpile and defend them dies in winter.

      Technology isn't always progressing like we are currently used to, for most of human history the "golden ages" were in the past before they fell and things fell apart with tons of examples in Egypt, China, Greece and Rome. For most of history technology ebbed and flowed to an extent, horse's were the best transportation until less than a hundred years ago now. Also again, the winters and magic probably knock everything back periodically.

      I think all you need to make the world's food logistics possible is magically rich cold/winter hunting:

      1. Winter warping government and culture answers a lot of questions, we hear a lot about how they've survived in the past and are preparing for the next one (a lot of tell don't show in my opinion). They've survived insane winters by having strong governments that stockpile astronomical amounts of food, not being urbanized. You don't need much tech to just hunker down with enough food, hunt (magical?) winter animals, and defend against those animals. Southerners stockpile more, northerners hunt and tolerate cold more.

      2. My understanding of the North, and people's hatred of them, is they survive largely by hunting, raiding, and fishing. There'd have to be some magic supporting wildlife numbers to support them all or an abundance of seafood we don't hear about. When it gets colder they just move down as they get uncomfortable, thus their nomadic styled life and southern people's hatred of them. They don't get crushed due to low tech levels, warrior lifestyle, and homefield advantage cold (that periodically travels south).

      3. Agreed that I wish there were more heat forts since presumably every other northern fort has to get abandoned every long Winter. A cave fort, volcanic, or just natural springs to normalize the temperature would add cool themes. 

      4. With just a few efficiency tweaks animals could super hibernate through it, or be like woodland frogs and literally freeze then come back. A lot of our plants as seeds can survive for absurd amounts of time without growing, Michigan State University has an ongoing experiment with seeds 120 years old that still germinate, without any direct selection. Aside from these, wildlife could just migrate south or recolonize North every cycle.

      TLDR: Magic away the food logistics (imagine trying to keep vermin out of years worth of food!) and it might work. Culture is incredibly flexible and could explain the rest.

        From checking the wiki, the last dragon in westeros died 130 years or so before the events of the novels. So the argument that they provided stability doesn't really fly(hah) for almost half the reign of the Targaryen's 290 year reign. I agree with the rest. 

        In the middle ages famines were pretty common and devastating. Imagine a famine the year before a long winter... I think a decent explanation for the sustainability of their society would be no crop pests and a more consistent climate during the seasons. Pests reduce yields by a lot, and unseasonable weather in springs and summers caused a lot of famines, even up to recent history.

        - u/RetardedWabbit:

          Yikes, 130 years is a long time to rule without your superweapons. Fear of them hatching new ones certainly helps for awhile after, the only other explanation I can think of is inertia? Relying on dragonpower prior leaves them with a very fresh, although green, military and people that haven't been able to think about organized rebellion against the dragons for generations before. Throw in some divinity/magic and decent rulers (that got worse every generation)?

          I'd actually expect them to handle famine pretty well, since they need to be stockpiling huge amounts whenever it's not winter. What's one bad year when you're always preparing for a possible generation long winter? 

          They'd also have less blights. They can't have huge long term monocrops outside of the deserts due to periodic winters and the variety of climates going from South to North, unless the blight can survive on the stored seeds or food it would get wiped out every winter. The winters help get rid of parasites and insects (I actually don't recall any insects in the show?) so that would significantly help low tech yields.

          So yeah, maybe yields could be high enough without magical food sources. (I guess you could also cheat and just claim their plants/soil are just better than ours too.)

        I think that's too creative for GRRM to have come up with it originally, though he might make it canon nowadays just as a fuck you to all his detractors. A more modern take on the "it was a dream all along" trope.  

        Maybe you know this, but one of the more popular theories as to why the climate is so random is that the it's set on the inside of a sphere. I think that raises more questions than it answers, but again, wouldn't put it past GRRM at this point. He must be desperate.

        That's a good point. I think we take it for granted that incremental progress is a natural part of civilization because that's the narrative given to history. In the west, at least. 

        I will say that westeros is a good deal larger than China is or ever was. The equivelant of going from Sunspear to Winterfell is farther than New York to LA, for example. Also china has a long tradition of civil service and bureaucrats, as well as sharing similar cultures and history and a sense of nationality(somewhat, anyway). Westeros is basically 9 different countries that all hate their neighbors which is ruled by jocks, and their bureaucrats (maesters) seem pretty sparse.

          Population wise I think westeros is smaller than China. China had plenty cultures and places like dorne and the North are more like tributaries than the same.

          Look at Joseon with Qing for example of people hating their masters. Actually pretty few people liked the Manchu so they're a great analogy

    [Seventh Horcrux](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux) is a comedy HP fanfic with the big sticking point being that the MC is a dick.

        Yeah it's great because although the concept of the story is "what if Voldemort was shoved into Potter's body back in 1981", this Voldemort is a very sensible person. That leads to exchanges like this: 

        > I snorted. "If Malfoy were the Heir of Slytherin, he'd be bragging about it. All the time. He would be right here, in our faces, bragging."

        > "We're in the girls' loo," Hermione said.

        > "Like that would stop him. He would follow us into the girls' loo *just* to brag about it. I mean, honestly, this is Malfoy we're talking about here. There are two things he mentions in every conversation: his father and his money. If he were the Heir of Slytherin, there would be three things he'd mention in *every* conversation."

        > Hermione pouted. "So, that means we don't need to brew an illegal potion with stolen ingredients, knock out three of our classmates, tie them up in a closet, sneak into the Slytherin Common Room, and interrogate Malfoy?"

        > I gaped at her. "Was that your plan?"

    Someone recommended Birds of a Feather about Hermione being born and growing up with Tom Riddle and its one of the best Harry Potter fanfictions I've ever read. Absolutely phenomenal characterisation, great use of setting (lots of small realistic touches that really make the 1930s films look amateur). Everyone acts according to their motives and there's some genuinely heartwarming moments along with a nice dose of humour. 

    I'm in love with how Tom is portrayed and Hermione too it's great.

    I found it alright. I couldn't finish the second book, there didn't seem to have any plot, conflict, or meaningful happenings or surprises. I think it's for people who like 'slice of life' type stories with a leisurely feel.

    I'm told [The Wayfarers](https://www.goodreads.com/series/170872-wayfarers) series is similar in feel, if you're looking for more.

    The first book was okay, but the entire second book is softcore femdom where the protagonist unlocks his sexual confidence through the power of designer clothing (I kid you not).  Unless this is your specific fetish, this is a definite “don’t bother.”

        > The girls comment on it

        You write this like it is some throw away line in the book, instead of the entire book revolving around his designer clothing.  They get aroused as he tries on designer clothing.  He literally performs a stage show for them - if the author could have justified pole dancing, he would have danced.  He has a nigh spiritual experience due to his designer clothing that washes away his insecurities.  He has the confidence to approach a woman at a bar because of his designer clothing (this is emphasized).  She becomes interested in him largely because of - you guessed it - his designer clothing.  When they have sex, she wears his designer clothing, etc, etc.

        \^\^\^ this is the content of the book.  I’m not kidding, this is what you will be reading if you read the book - other than descriptions of how aroused he gets submitting himself to powerful women - oh, and his superpower is that he is good at being tested.  All well and good, but there is very little SciFi aspect here.

    Side comments about Magical Me:

    Magical Me as far as I could be bothered reading into it was way too full of itself (which is crazy considering the guy is taking over Lockhart) and morally righteous to me. The villifying of Dumbledore and the SI being right about literally everything and never making a mistake was a bit annoying. If Dumbledore is that evil (at some point the guy is like Dumbledore needs to go before he tackles Voldemort and I'm just like what??? even if you think Dumbledore isn't good surely this is a Chinese United Front situation not a Princely State infighting while British conquer the continent).

    I think Lockhart could be a good funny full of themselves SI, you have a lot of opportunities to be funny with the arrogance, but the problem is the SI keeps it up in their internal monologue and it's so grating. I think I got to chap 8 or 9.

    At least for me, YMMV.

      I appreciate the recommendation. While I absolutely love MoL, I don't feel that it dives deep enough into the mind magic aspect. Reading other people's memories and thoughts are all fine and good but that doesn't really explore it. 

      On the pure technical level I would love to see learning/trading skills from people, enhance learning ability, enhance certain important memories and remove other irrelevant ones to maximize storage capacity, put in conditional orders, having a semi-sentient mental weapon developed for mental attacks, mental combats that involve more complex patterns than just comparing attacks and defence, etc. On a more societal level I'd also love to see how a society can be functional with advanced mind magic being widespread.

        ```
        Weaponizing advanced mind magic makes for a lot of paranoia... so if it's an entire society, it might be a constant state of cold war if defenses aren't equally adequate (mind-melded coalitions?). I don't know of any fiction that goes deep into the magic aspect, but you might be interested in mind magic in real life, AKA mentalism. There's a lot of quacky stuff out there, but for the layman, methods of manipulating perception and instilling suggestions are as good as magic.
