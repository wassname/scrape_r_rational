  **Synopsis**

  After the Changeling invasion, Celestia and Luna make the decision to have Twilight investigate the Elements of Harmony and solve the mystery of their power.

  A thousand years later, Rainbow Dash awakens in a world she does not recognize. She has no idea how or why she came to be there. She does not know the language, the geography or any of the rules of this new.

  **RT/RST qualifications**

  * First off, while we see Twilight investigating the Elements of Harmony onscreen, each chapter opens with a passage from the book that she eventually wrote and the characters are in the process of rediscovering the things that she learned (and possibly going a bit deeper). [spoiler] (#s " Also, Max Cash has a copy of the book and is doing...something with it.")
  * There are plausible reasons behind the characters' actions. 
  * Likewise, the characters make mistakes but learn from them, and consistently apply their resources to the problems that they encounter. 
  * The factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values rather than just being "good" or "evil." [spoiler](#s "An exception might be Max Cash, but he's a lying liar who lies, so I don't believe his story and am sure that he's up to something more than the straw nihilist shtick that he's offered as his motivation.")
  * There are consistent rules to this world, and the story sticks to them. 
  * We are absolutely being given sufficient information to piece together what's happening.

  Still unfinished, but currently reaches 544,462 words - the length of eight normal-sized books, or two-and-a-half *Wheel of Time* books. I stopped partway through the last time I read this, about three years ago, because it moved too slowly for me.

  It opens with a lot of very interesting mysteries. Solving them gradually takes a back seat to worldbuilding and introducing new characters; the story introduces new plot threads more often than it resolves the ones it already has, which I found frustrating. Some excellent fight scenes and cosmic horror, though they're relatively rare. Doesn't have a whole lot to do with My Little Pony, the setting is completely different from the show's Equestria and all but a small handful of characters are Sharaloth's creations - read it as a standalone fantasy series, not as fanfiction.

  If you liked this, I can recommend *[Background Pony](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/19198/background-pony)*.

    It's definitely slow, but I found it pretty interesting in its own right. Interesting characters and a reasonable mix of action. Things are always happening. Though, it definitely needs to be read as fanfiction- a lot of the plot points are nonsensical without a basic understanding of the show and its major characters.

    Also, I found Background Pony moved far slower than this one...
