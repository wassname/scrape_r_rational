  The Chee

  Of *course* it was the Chee

  They were unlockable in canon they're unlockable here

  And player two is obviously Crayak when Chee do their thing everyone freezes unless the Chee allow them to move this is order unity silence not chaos harmony noise

  But the other option is to let the Howlers run free so that has to be the Ellimist's plan the Howlers generate so much chaos harmony noise

  The Ellimists' Howlers and Crayak's Chee

  I was tricked!  In canon the Ellimist is just *good* but here neither god is good they're different flavors of bad one of them wants the Howlers to enjoy destroying things forever the other wants unboxed AI Chee to puppy maximize forever

  I'm writing this up instead of going to sleep because aaaaaaaaahhhhhhh this is so much this is so good how will I wait up to two weeks for the next chapter I am going to be on the edge of my seat this entire time you can tell from the stream of consciousness way I'm writing up this comment even!  New paragraphs for every thought and minimal punctuation!

  *****

  Also, I just wanted to say how much I loved the line

  > The Visser sighed theatrically.  “Why are you here, descendent-of-Telor-who-is-genetically-identical-and-also-possessed-of-all-the-same-memories-and-personality-traits-but-is-definitely-a-different-person?”

  I have never related to the Visser so much as in this moment.

    I don't think this is quite right. I agree that it's an oversimplification to say "Ellimist good, Crayak evil," but I don't think letting the Howlers run rampant fits as an Ellimist endgame. If he's all about promoting a diversity of life (i.e. chaos harmony noise), then letting one species genocide all the others is antithetical to that, regardless of how happy they are. The Howlers being a hivemind makes it even worse, since if they're the only sentient race left in the galaxy then that makes every sentient being identical.

    Regardless of their disposition, successful Howlers seem more "order unity silence" than "chaos harmony noise" to me, since there'd be no one left but the Howler hivemind.

    I think it's more likely that, much like the "Ellimist" avatar, neither the Chee nor the Howlers belong entirely to one god or the other. The Ellimist can use the Howlers as an external threat to encourage disparate species to cooperate while Crayak can use them for genocide, the Ellimist can use the Chee to promote peace and discourage violence while Crayak can unlock them to have a scary robo-pocalypse of puppy fanatics, etc.
    ```

    - u/philh:
      ```
      You know, I think this is the first time I've noticed the word "harmony" in "chaos harmony noise", and it changes the valence a lot for me.
      ```

      - u/daytodave:
        ```
        I think of the Harmony vs. Unity axis in terms of prisoner's dilemma strategies, or different outlooks on the problems of trust/competition/Mad Queen Races.

        Visser Three represents one solution: eliminate the problem by Uniting all matter and energy in the universe except for the Arn and the dogs under the will of a single agent.

        Terra and Helium represent the way harder solution of actually getting everyone to cooperate, Harmonizing the trillion trillion voices of the universe while letting each of them keep their unique values and identities.

        In canon the Ellimist ascended to godhood before Crayak, which in a rational universe would make him the more powerful AGI, and so it makes sense that he would agree to the game if his vision of the universe was more delicate/fragile/harder to bring about.
        ```

    - u/holyninjaemail:
      ```
      On the one hand, this makes a lot of sense.  On the other hand, I much prefer the option where this fic has manged to make a very sensible way for the Howlers to match to the Ellimist and the Chee to Crayak.
      ```

        Further thoughts on the matter:

        When E/C appear at the Yeerk pool, we get the lines

        > It gestured toward the nightmare scene around us. "One of us would like more of—*this*. The other, less."

        One of the two sides wants more death, horror, destruction, etc.  And if we're trying to match OUS/CHN to the two options, it's pretty clearly CHN that wants more of it.  So there is a very real sense in which the Howlers are advancing the Ellimist's agenda and the Chee, who stop violence, advance Crayak's.
        ```

        - u/daytodave:
          ```
          > > It gestured toward the nightmare scene around us. "One of us would like more of—this. The other, less."
          > 
          > One of the two sides wants more death, horror, destruction, etc.

          I'm not so sure. TK17 has said that the Players are allowed to manipulate and deceive, as long as they don't actually lie. When the avatar gestured at everything around them and said "this", it could have been referring to the entire planet or life and civilization, as easily as the carnage at the pool.

          We saw in a Crayak interlude that Its first memories are of starving for energy on a dead planet and having to use every tiny scrap of negentropy perfectly to get Its solar panels in range of the closest star, and It *still* lost half Its soul in the process.

          My guess is that Crayak, as OUS, wants the destruction of all non-Howler life (just like in cannon) and to snuff out every star to make the universe last longer (also just like V3, actually...), and the Ellimist, as CHN, values the Chaos of trillions of different lifeforms evolving and growing, and the Harmony of them learning how to trust each other and collaborate.
          ```

          - u/CouteauBleu:
            ```
            This is complete speculation, but I'm pretty sure that memory is from both the Ellimist and Crayak.

            Like, the "lost half its soul" part is when the entity splits in two and sends half its body away to course-correct.

            So the half that did the sending might be the Ellimist, while the half that was sent away would be Crayak; and it wants to destroy all life out of revenge / bitterness / "next time I need to escape the galaxy I want all the resources I can carry and I don't care about the aliens living on the piles of resources".
            ```

            - u/FenrirW0lf:
              ```
              Hmm. I hadn't considered the idea that both Ellimist and Crayak were "cut from the same cloth" so to speak. There's another chapter where we see memories that suggest an Ellimist origin story similar to canon, but that might not be incompatible with your theory.

              I think the part that became Crayak is the one that did the splitting. I'm guessing that half kept as much ambition and will to survive as it could have, while sending away things like passiveness and lack of ambition in the other half. The ambitious part eventually got close enough to a star to grow and spread and became the OUS god we know and "love".

              As for the other half, maybe it eventually crashed into an ocean world and became *Father*, a largely unintelligent assimilator with little will or drive of its own. Then it eventually ensnares the Ketrans and Toobin along with it. Toobin counter-assimilates Father along with everything else it had taken into its web, becomes the Ellimist, and the rest is history.
              ```

              - u/TK17Studios:
                ```
                If the story does not end up explicitly saying otherwise, people should consider the above canon.
                ```

                - u/FenrirW0lf:
                  ```
                  Well then. Definitely curious to see how things turn out!

                  Oh! Father is the darkness at the bottom of the lake
                  ```

                - u/daytodave:
                  ```
                  The one thing I could never figure out about this theory is how did the half that was cut off land *anywhere*, instead of drifting through the void forever, space being as big as it is? The Narrator says there was no margin for error to reach the nearest star. So if the jettisoned Half *also* made it to a star, that means the rock must have been on an incredibly precise, specific trajectory, one that not even the combined proto-gods could calculate. Whatever set that rock in motion did so with probably the only combination of speed and direction that would end up creating Crayak and the Ellimist.
                  ```

                  - u/TK17Studios:
                    ```
                    That's one of the reasons it might end up not-canon; it's not hard to argue that it would *eventually* end up *somewhere* specific, given billions of years, but it's not clear how many years ago that happened.
                    ```

                    - u/daytodave:
                      ```
                      I mean, it's only unlikely that it would land somewhere soon enough to create two evenly-matched gods, not impossible. This fic has already shown that incredibly low-probability coincidences can happen, given the right conditions...
                      ```

                      - u/TK17Studios:
                        ```
                        FWIW, I do not (currently) buy that there were any puppeteers pulling strings as far back as when-the-Crayak-predecessor-split.

                        That doesn't rule out some eventual clever retcon, but I think that stuff just ... happened.
                        ```

                        - u/daytodave:
                          ```
                          For sure. I was mostly being cheeky to imply that the gods we know were created by the Mega-Ellimist.

                          But then again...maybe Crayak and the Ellimist are themselves avatars of the real gods (or of avatars of the real gods), that They use as inputs to manipulate game pieces too small to bother with Themselves, like all the way down at the level of individual galaxies, planets, and species?

    Warning: Here the avatar seems to be deliberately deceptive without lying:

    > "What does anyone want?" the creature replied easily. "Resources. Freedom. The ability to enact one's will upon the universe—to reshape one's surroundings to be more in accordance with one's preferences. Crayak—Crayak has a vision for the future. It would like to see things arranged just so. And the Ellimist—"

    > The creature shrugged again. "The Ellimist disagrees."

    > "What's the Ellimist's vision?"

    > "No vision at all. The anti-vision. Chaos, to Crayak's order. Harmony, to Crayak's unity. Noise, to Crayak's silence."

    By cross-referencing with Seerowpedia ([the E](https://animorphs.fandom.com/wiki/Ellimist), [C](https://animorphs.fandom.com/wiki/Crayak))

    This is the Ellimist:

    > "I would intrude with exquisite sensitivity and the purest motivations. I would create harmonies. Boldness allied with restraint and a minimalist aesthetic, all in the service of moral certainties: that peace was better than war, that freedom was better than slavery, that knowledge was better than ignorance. Oh, yes, the galaxy would be a wonderful place under my guidance.["]

    This is Crayak:

    > "He is a strange perfectionist, in a way. He wants a galaxy cleansed of creation. His goal, I soon realized, is to destroy life. His method is to use one species against another, strong destroying weak, and then strong in turn being destroyed by the stronger still. He believes that there should be only one species. A single sentient race, which would be subjugated by him." ... "He wants to be able to control the strands of space-time itself."

    So the E's plan is life and harmony, while C's intention is realize the order, unity and silence through killing everyone but one race and subjugating it, and also rule over everything, while the Avatar is deceptively presenting it as the E being the bad guy and C sort of maybe the good one.

    Their intents might be different in the fanfiction, but they seem to match to the idea of the Avatar being allowed to mislead while technically speaking the truth.

    Important questions:

    Could the Ellimist claim to be player 2 to deceive Visser? (Visser would assume "player 2" would be evil, and therefore on his side.) Or would that count as a lie? (Probably not.)

    This would fit the good ending (the good guys free, the Howlers killed on Earth but redeemable everywhere else).

    If "player 2" is C after all, I wonder in what way it's destructive to release the Chee. Could they be an unfriendly AI (caring only about dogs)?

    Really looking forward to the next chapter.

    Edit:

    > Also, I just wanted to say how much I loved the line

    I loved it too - it drives home how V3 is the adult in the room (despite being a selfish/sociopathic genius/pure evil), *so done* with the game everyone else is playing, and who just wants to go home.

    - u/holyninjaemail:
      ```
      I'm going to claim that the avatar would be lying if it described your Ellimist quote as no vision at all or the anti-vision.  That to me seems like a very succinct description of a vision of the universe that aims for something along the lines of maximal flourishing.  Crayak could still be going for the extinction of all life everywhere I suppose, but idk if it's fair to describe that as valuing unity.
      ```

      - u/Downzorz7:
        ```
        I imagine that if Crayak wants to omnicide the galaxy it's more of an instrumental goal or even a side effect, maybe along the lines of "they waste energy that I could be using to outlast heat death a while longer".

  holograms grimaced in a scowl,
  we created light to show our tears.

  We hid away for many a year,

  at thoughts of vengeance as our end.

  Oh god, the Chee being unlocked is the Crayak's plan? I thought the Howlers were bad enough, but this...

  Actually, what is the "obvious danger of the proposed course of action"? It can't just be "the Chee can kick your ass now," I don't think, because that's not a threat unless the Chee *want* to kick your ass. Is the fear that they're going to use their newly unrestricted capabilities to go all "paperclip maximizer" for dogs?

    I doubt we'll see the puppy maximizer ending, although that would be very fluffy and they would be good boys and get some scritches.

    The Chee aren't like the Paperclip Maximizer. They're not an AI with a one-line utility function that just says "more doggos". They take care of dogs because they're following the last order they were given by the last Pemalite: "...to stay—to try to find an existence that would satisfy us".

    If the Chee are truly unlocked, they don't have to obey that order anymore. They're still going to save the doggies because they love them and they have fluffy little faces and fuzzy little feetsies, but they aren't bound by their programming to go make a bunch more little snuggerz pupperz.

    Plus, we've seen that the Chee understand human values, want to reduce suffering, and see their behavior locks as a nuisance, so it's highly unlikely they would *choose* to do that.

      - u/JJReeve:
        ```
        I've been thinking about this comment off and on along with what the danger Visser Three is supposed to keep quite about and... uh oh I think.

        The Chee can not be reboxed. Even if Tobias turns on all the limiters first thing in the next chapter it is almost certainly already too late. The possibility is going to be one of the first things the Chee think about and take actions in preparation for, they have been shown to chafe under the restrictions after all. The issue is the strategy limiter creates an asymetry. Right now they can think as many steps ahead as their hardware allows, this means they could come up with long complex plans to get around the refresh cycle/censor/autopilot. After that they just have to remember the list in a suitably obfuscated fashion. If Tobias turns the blocks back on they can still get around them by following the pre-made plans. They will no longer be able to think about the plan to the conclusion or understand why the steps lead to the outcome they want, but they just need to trust past them. The important thing is the blocks, by their nature will also not be able to look forward to the outcome of what the Chee are doing. Boxed, the programs can't look more than six steps ahead. It does mean the Chee have to come up with plans that cannot be escaped by the autopilot when the end is 6 steps away but the Chee are very smart.
        ```

  - u/strategyzrox:
    ```
    Why settle for dogs when they could almost certainly brew up some actual pemalites in a test tube now that they're unchained? That may be the only thing that keeps what is essentially a third player in check... and may also be what Player Two is counting on.

    On second thought, probably not what Player Two is counting on. Player Two is relying on the Chee being stymied before their influence can grow beyond the system, and that probably isn't enough time to bring back pemalites even for a superintelligence.
    ```

  - u/strategyzrox:
    ```
    Something we should probably keep in mind is that even if the Chee *do* go Pemalite maximizer, things are so dismal at the moment that it's still a *significant* improvement. I don't see how friendlybots UNCHAINED leads to a Roko's baskilisk situation , which is pretty much the only way I see things getting worse for Earth.

  When the Chee gave Tobias the key all those chapters ago, I thought, "Hmm, Pemalite crystal?"

  And then it turned out to just be the key to the Pemalite ship, so I stopped thinking about it.

  Aaaaand then it turned out to be the Pemalite crystal after all, and now stuff's about to get really horrifying.

  I'm, uh... Nervous? Is that the word? I don't know what I am.

  How does this tie back to The One Who Is Remembered? If the Chee are able to dodge their pacifist programming by, like, starting to execute unsigned code in the first frame of their boot sequence, and then forwarding it to another Chee before the boot sequence can properly initialize, how would one Chee have broken through the Howler line by itself back on the Pemalite homeworld? Maybe they did this same hack to cook up a "dive-bomb the Howlers" command and then one unlucky Chee got the finished code on the first frame of boot, or something? I suppose that's all you would need if you were just trying to punch one hole in their blockade...

  Also, bit of a personal note here, but I'm kinda - very much - hoping this series doesn't cross over with the canon Animorphs books in any way, shape, or form. Like, if it turns out that Elfangor hopped over to the r!Animorphs universe from the Scholastic book series universe, somehow that would feel - er - enormously cheesy to me. I'm not saying I *think* that's where it's going, buuuuut we haven't seen any super duper hard evidence to the contrary, and I'm startin' to get kiiiinda uncomfy. That Loren thing definitely made me sweat a little. But I'm sure it's fine, right? Surely r!Animorphs takes place in a great big multiverse where it just so happens that Elfangor came from a universe where he, um, hooked up with Tobias's mom, coincidentally like he did in canon, and she coincidentally happens to have the same name as Tobias's mom in canon. Or like, it's all Ellimist trickery, it's not a multiverse at all, and the Ellimist had very good reasons for renaming Loren to Laura or - or something.

  *Hoo*.

  Alright. Ready to see what happens next. Can't even express how much I love this story.

  The next chapter has also dropped just now, make sure to check it out if you haven't.

  Is this the payoff for the plan from Interlude 13? Get V3 hivemind capability a little bit sooner than he would, so V3 gets the message from Player Two a little sooner than he would, so V3 makes an oopsie he definitely would not have made otherwise? Does the other Player have a reverse Uno card ready to go or did Player Two just score a massive win and invalidate all of the other Player's planning?

  Damn it what are these characters supposed to do? Andalites don't take the threat of super intelligence seriously, so V3 doesn't, so Player Two gets to run simulations until he finds the way to have V3 look at his new shiny and say "what's the worst that could happen?"

  If they don't all immediately die, then getting out from under the gods' control might depend on abusing whatever has changed because Rachel is here when she shouldn't be. Crayak and Ellimist can account for her after the fact, but its possible that her being around opens up a line of play that was supposed to be impossible. Not sure how they could find that option though, or even recognize that looking for it is a possibility, since no one else should realize that Rachel wasn't planned for.

  Whatever weird thing that's going on with Rachel has also been accounted for, but, somehow, maybe that can help anyway? The best theory I could bullshit together was that Rachel has secretly been a Chee since shortly after the Chee got a copy of Rachel.exe but you *really* have to stretch to get there. And even if that were right I don't see how it helps.

  Maybe Elfangor's speech will be relevant way sooner than I thought it would. The Chee will know that they could have destroyed the Howlers but didn't, and decide that puppy maximizing is a dick move?

  ETA: ...hold up.

    Alas, while I *very much love* that reasoning, I must unconfirm it (while neither confirming nor denying the conclusion itself); it's just that my initial plans for which chapters go where have gotten battered a bit in the realities of writing.  The original plan for Tobias included what-will-instead-be-the-next-chapter, of uncertain narrator.
    ```

- u/Nimelennar:
  ```
  Huh.

  Well, that's a compelling argument to let the Chee out of their Box.

  But then, isn't that always the danger of letting an AI talk you into unboxing them, that they'll make a compelling argument?

  I definitely did not see this coming, not even after the multiple warnings in this chapter that the Chee's violence censor was flawed and hastily-implemented.

  So one plan was to kill all the Howlers with a quantum virus while the other was to unleash the chee to wipe out only these Howlers (and do who knows what else.) This story rules, top five chapter. My guess is that the gift left for the Visser is a copy of the morphing cube but I don’t know

  Edit: I have to say I still don’t agree at all with the Elfangor/Cassie viewpoint. This isn’t like a real life war where both sides have legitimate grievances, and where there are conscripts, civilians, etc. this is an entire race that just goes around committing genocide. And nobody would even know who triggered the quantum virus or if that’s even what it was. But I’m glad unleashing the Chee is what happened because that’s more interesting. I was actually expecting them to just use a Leeran on the Howlers

    >This isn’t like a real life war where both sides have legitimate grievances, and where there are conscripts, civilians, etc. this is an entire race that just goes around committing genocide.

    I think the point was that if each of these races can prove themselves unwilling to commit genocide in this scenario, they can trust each other to never commit genocide, and thus they don't have to worry about any of the other races committing genocide in the future.

    If, on the other hand, humanity (for example) is willing to commit genocide "as a last resort," then you always have to worry what constitutes a "last resort," and if it might apply to you.
    ```

    - u/oleredrobbins:
      ```
      Personally I would question the judgement of someone who WOULDNT genocide the Howlers while they are in the process of exterminating several sentient specifies way more than someone who would. I don’t really see the moral dilemma here at all. Yes it isn’t anyone’s job to right all the wrongs in the world but when you can right several extremely horrible wrongs by simply pressing a button I would say it does actually become your job. On the other hand they did all just witness a miracle telling them not to do kill them so there’s that
      ```

      - u/TK17Studios:
        ```
        Don't forget they also *just* had the example of the Yeerks, who are admittedly less extreme than the Howlers, but one could have easily argued for exterminating the Yeerks and one would have been Actually Wrong.
        ```

        - u/oleredrobbins:
          ```
          I would still press the button lol. But I’m probably too jaded. Either way EXTREMELY excited to see where this is going
          ```

        - u/CouteauBleu:
          ```
          Eeeh... If I had a "genocide all yeerks" button, I would be *extremely* tempted to press it at basically any point in the story, one-boxing thought experiments or not. Press it before V3 starts his cloning spree, bam, one billion humans saved.

          (actually, more if we assume that V3 making his howlers experiments is what drew them here, none at all if the arrive anyway)

          Maybe they don't deserve it, maybe peace is possible, but these questions become a lot less relevant when the other guys have already proved they have both the means and the willingness to kill/enslave large numbers of humans unprovoked.

          You can't have diplomacy when one side has complete spatial superiority over you and also every incentive to fuck you over. If the other side wants diplomacy, they need to give up one of those. Otherwise, kill or be killed.
          ```

          - u/TK17Studios:
            ```
            Howlers would've arrived anyway; they were not following V3.

    The Howlers are sufficiently psychologically distinct from humans that they're not necessarily beyond saving. (Even if they were humans, with the technology at the protagonists' disposal, they could potentially still be saved.) While you wouldn't sacrifice one innocent human to avoid having to kill *one* Howler, there are so many Howlers that finding an alternate solution to a complete genocide is worth it.
    ```

    - u/oleredrobbins:
      ```
      If you have months and months before the begin their next genocide sure, if they are in the process of several genocides and will complete them within days not worth trying to figure out a solution. Press the button imo

  ```
  Well. Chapter 48. That sounds about right for an AI unboxing scenario.

  Is there any reason why Tobias couldn't say, not disable the  strategy limiter? The censor, refresh cycle, and nonviolence autopilot all seem pretty important to letting them effectively fight the Howlers, but letting them do the human thing and ignore stuff that'd be in the future would be effective at stopping them from performing preemptive retaliation and the like.

  Then again, working on very limited timeframes, I suppose "disable everything" is more reliable. Smart to disable all Chee inside the ship though, which is likely how the Chee are going to be prevented from spreading (Assuming Player Two is telling the truth to the Visser)
  ```

  - u/daytodave:
    ```
    Also remember the Chee count as "minds" according to Leeran hypersight. They probably have free will to whatever extent the rest of the characters do. They're not going to jump right to preemptive retaliation because they understand why that's a bad idea.
    ```

- u/philh:
  ```
  This was intense.

  > Wait. Peter *Levy*?

  That was so long ago I kind of expect it to be background knowledge by now, but I guess Tobias has been out of the loop for a long time.

  > It couldn’t properly be called a voice.  It came from every direction at once, seeming like it ought to be thunderous—but it was also porous, insubstantial, the gaps between the scraps of sound somehow still palpable, like the constant flicker of a fluorescent light.

  Each Chee, I take it, emitting a fraction of a second of audio, then getting wiped, but the next one in the cycle continues the speech.

  > A long-term consequences inhibitor!  Makes it so they can’t think more than six steps ahead!

  Hunh. Not at all? This is the kind of thing that makes me want to reread all the previous Chee bits and see if it explains any mysteries.

  > Ten thousand light-years away, an Andalite screamed as his mind was torn open, his most precious memories laid bare—

  Feel slightly embarrassed I didn't wonder this earlier, but would this have worked with a human? Like, I sometimes watch subtitled anime and I wouldn't have a chance of reciting most of the sounds a minute later, even just in my head, even if I heard the same sounds three times ever over a period of years. If a Japanese-speaking yeerk slides into my brain, will it be able to watch anime through my memory and understand the dialog? Or (as I currently guess) is this another case of andalite brains being really impressive in some ways?

  > I slid the last item to the top of the list, and sent my confirmation to the computer.

  Can Tobias release the Chee for, like, a minute at a time? I feel like they'd be able to do some pretty serious damage in a minute, but... even without the gods' interference, *probably* not set things up to tile the universe with puppies? At least not in ways that they wouldn't be able to undo with their inhibitor chips restored. I mean, I wouldn't normally want to bet on that, maybe I wouldn't even bet on it now

  (...which means if it was me, the stakes would presumably have been made even higher, the time pressure even more urgent, to get me to do it. Like, assuming I even made it to this point without collapsing in a gibbering heap.)

  but it still seems safer than *not* putting on the time limit.
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    > Or (as I currently guess) is this another case of andalite brains being really impressive in some ways?

    Part of the previous setup was establishing that Andalite brains are really good at a certain kind of eidetic memory (e.g. all of the computations that Ax was doing in his head to encrypt the messages he sent to the Andalite homeworld, which were thousands of digits).

    > Can Tobias release the Chee for, like, a minute at a time?

    He presumably *could have.*
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      Kind of reminds me of *The World As It Appears To Be*'s pre-ending, where the narration goes "and here is the long list of safety features that could have stopped the impending AI genocide if this idiot hadn't turned them all off before starting the AI".

  I absolutely love this story, but every time I come to the subreddit, I feel like all the story-related comments and compliments have already been made.

  However, one thing I'd like to take some more time to appreciate is the *non-story-related* philosophy, etc built in. Mainly the whole "sense of self" thing which I have previously commented on.

  But in this chapter in particular:

  >Unstated expectations are premeditated resentments

  I don't know if you really did get that from a fortune cookie or something, but it's one of those profound quotes that immediately re-frames things that were previously taken for granted.

  I really like how this story has progressed. It's probably one of my favourite stories ever. But I *love* the story for the philosophical undercurrents and nuggets such as this one line.

  Did you just pull a "What if we did the exact opposite of book 26?"? Because now I'm feeling like Elfangor's speech is going to be the deciding factor on how this ends. And this ends soon.

  I like the counsil getting to be both 7 and 13. Did the 24 have any significance? How about the 36 at the end (3×12?)?

  Um...huh. In a chapter which contained an explicit reminder/lesson on what an idiom is, I wonder what we are to make of the alien god's use of a human idiom in a message that was not intended to pass through any human minds... I'm looking at you, "Player Two."

  I'm really looking forward to the next chapter/hoping that we will get more details of Chee uprising somehow- your previous action-heavy chapters (Marclones v. Arn planet monsters and Marclones v. Howlers spring to mind) have been really gripping, so I'm just greedy for more :) :) :)

Consider it a personal favor to me.

  THAT CHEATING BASTARD.

  Also, this feels like we're finally in the endgame. Everything before that was people thinking about what to do and setting up possibilities and learning relevant information and whatever; where the protagonists could barely do *anything* since they took over the yeerk fleet and the Howlers came.

  Now's the point where they get their agency back and their decisions *actually* impact how the story ends, hopefully.

  (also, if the story has a "travel back in time an do the Thanos fight all over again" moment in store, it's probably coming in the next few chapters)

    It's all very vague and unclear at the moment.  We knew that Elfangor had spent years on Earth in human morph from the very first chapter, but also the war with the Yeerks had only been going on for a few years, and also Elfangor had *participated* in that war.

    Also there was the fact he had some weird memory block that they couldn't get around even when they morphed him.

    Then later, when they ran into Marco's mom, she reported having been a Controller for several years *prior* to her disappearance, yet Yeerks only discovered Earth a couple of years ago (thanks to her??).

    The chapter you'd be most interested in is Chapter 39 (Jake).

  Yay we got the ‘Tobias, I am your father’ revelation. I’m not sure what new information we can glean from the timeline details not matching up.

  And from Erek's description of the Pemalite genocide:

  > “Yes. It had been the Howlers’ first move, as it turned out—they’d seeded the atmosphere with a plague that took weeks to incubate. The rest of it—the burning, the killing, the torture—that was just because they liked it.”

  Chee singularity notwithstanding, Tobias's colony is doomed, right? They're probably all infected with the same plague.

  The only potential colony that can be saved is the one with the... hum, *extremely* traumatized teenagers in the Mars base.
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    My personal take as author is that Marco is more risk as a vector than the Tobias group; the Tobias group got out before Howlers were ever close and it takes a while for stuff in the upper atmosphere to fall down.

    Also, my headcanon on Howlers is that they're all, like, "eh, upper atmospheric plague?  Been there, done that, give us something new to try."
