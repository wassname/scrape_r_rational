  Andrew Rowe ([u/Salaris](https://www.reddit.com/u/Salaris/)) is the author of the Arcane Ascension series and he's coming out with another book, *How to Defeat a Demon King in Ten Easy Steps.*

  >For thousands of years, there has been a cycle: a Demon King  rises and conquers, and a Hero is reborn a hundred years later to defeat  him. Each time, civilizations are ground to dust beneath the Demon  King’s hordes, but humanity has remained secure in the belief that a  Hero of legend will always save them. There’s just one slight problem.  It’s only been 23 years since the Demon King’s latest rise, and this  time, he’s already conquered more than half the world. If humanity  simply waits for the Hero’s return, there may be no world left for him  to save.  
  >  
  >And so, Yui Shaw sets out with an ambitious plan. A 10-step plan.  
  >  
  >She’ll find a way to obtain the Hero’s legendary sword. She’ll  earn obscure classes, gain levels, and increase her skills. She’ll  travel to the meticulously-crafted dungeons that seem designed for one  specific Hero to complete. And, if she’s truly (un)fortunate, she might  even find a fairy.  
  >  
  >She might not be a Hero – but if she can fake it long enough, she might still be able to save the world.

  So I figured since people here already loved the previous books he's written, you guys would want to jump in and preorder the audible before it comes out on April 30th.

  So far, I don't know if the book is audible only or not. It doesn't appear to be coming in epub or mobi formats, but I don't know. I've already left comments on the website asking about it and I'll post an edit here later when I find out.

  EDIT: It'll be a [year](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClimbersCourt/comments/g7hkt1/how_to_defeat_a_demon_king_in_ten_easy_steps/fohkkdl?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) before it gets released into text.

    Hey, thanks for posting this here! There's definitely a lot of the same kind of lateral thinking and weird rules exploits stuff that I generally write. It's a comedy/parody, so keep that in mind, but it's probably something  people who are in the mood for a light rationalish work might enjoy.

    Also, free for the first few days for Audible subscribers, so that's a plus.

      No problem. I think I should have waited until it was out though. People here seem to think getting news about preorders to be spam.

        That's kind of weird to me, since it's only a week off. But hey, I suppose every subreddit has a different culture.

          I'll say thank you for posting I appreciated the free audiobook, and will probably buy it at some point in a mobi or epub, because I like the bag mage and Zelda parody.

            Awesome, thank you for the support! It's looking like the Kindle version should be out around November 1st.
