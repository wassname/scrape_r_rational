### Comments:

- u/everything_is_rigged:
  ```
  I thought I would post a "My favourite reads from this year list".

  1. [Wandering Inn](https://wanderinginn.com/table-of-contents/): Consistently my favourite fic for the last few years. I am astonished at how this story can still make me grin like an idiot or make my heart race after so many years and ten million words. Even after so long, there are mysteries that keep me guessing, fights that I would have never foreseen the results of, genius blocks of worldbuilding and new layers to characters I thought I had seen everything about. It's a miracle story and I have no idea how pirate keeps their idea factory running while writing millions of words each year.
  2. [Only Villains Do That](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40182/only-villains-do-that): Isekaied Musician who feels strongly about social issues have to become a "dark lord". I used to read Gods are Bastards. I left it to accumulate chapters for a while but when I came back to read again I heard that it was put on hiatus and that was sad to hear. What I am not sad about is OVDT. Seiji's a great main character. I love the schizoid-sounding rants he goes on for completely reasonable things. I love the alien isekai world. I usually hate "All Aristocrats Are Evil" in fantasy because it's so easy to do but I love it here for some reason. I think my favourite thing about the story is how the world already has a framework for "Dark lord" and "Heroes" and the complete seriousness with which it explores the geopolitical consequences of the existence of these figures. 
  3. All stories by '[IdeasGuy](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6856237/Ideas-Guy)': I love almost everything from him. Especially See No Evil (DC SI, with mafia-style intrigue set in Gotham) that concluded this year and Legends Never Die(Ahistorical Gamer, Viking boy with Civ-style gamer system) that started this year. All of his stories are proud power fantasies. Even most brazen LitRPG titles with "Grizzled veteran OP MC" are not this indulgent in making their main characters seem like the coolest thing ever and I love his stories for it. It's like he takes everything that makes Shonen Anime compelling, cuts out the annoying pieces mandated by the usual forms in which media is consumed and makes something completely new each time. Furthermore, his stories have actual thematic depth and most of them feel like they are moving towards something substantial. Warning, Harems (and sex on the versions hosted on NSFW websites).
  4. [Doors to the Unknown\(Worm/DnD\)](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/doors-to-the-unknown-worm-d-d-fusion-crossover.1001110/): Taylor, Brian, Dean and Chris land in DnD Ebberon and High-level DnD scholar-mage-psion end up in Bet. I have never seen this amount of thought put into constructing fanfic worlds before. There are so many little fun things in each chapter that makes me go "that's genius". I love the dual stories of both Taylor and Valigan. Each contrasts to build up to a satisfying narrative. DttW makes Worm feel fresh for someone who has read hundreds of worm fanfics. And it reminded me that Taylor was once written as a real person, not the memetic escalation Taylor she had become in my mind. Valigan's interactions with Bet and the modern world are a treat to read about and I was also surprised to see how well Taylor's mishmash team worked.
  5. [This Used to be About Dungeons](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/45534/this-used-to-be-about-dungeons): New story by Alexander Wales. I didn't think he was made for SoL before I started reading it. I adore the main characters, they are probably the most three-dimensional dungeon party I have ever read about. Wales has also made a world I personally would love to explore. And it's hard to feel that way for similar "Game worlds".
  6. [The Metropolitan Man](https://alexanderwales.com/the-metropolitan-man-1/): I hadn't read this before this week but this is probably the story that kept me thinking about it longest about it after I finished it. Makes me feel like adaptations of Superman should always be set in the thirties or the forties. Loved the ending.
  7. [Evil Eyes](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13969877/1/Evil-Eyes) (Naruto Sasuke SI) and [Man off the Moon](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12904733/1/Man-off-the-Moon) (Mass Effect/Fate, with EMIYA trying to "save" ME): If I had to say what I love about the author's style then it would be the feeling of motion. There is this frenetic movement in all of his fight scenes. When Sasuke zooms around the battlefield swinging on his ninja wire or whatever, You really feel it. Also, Man off the Moon had this scene where EMIYA has a cooking competition with an Asari chef and it was the best cooking scene I've ever read.
  8. Everything by [cliffc999](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/members/cliffc999.14102/): There is no one in the fanfic scene who writes battle of wits better than cliffc999. I feel like even dumb plans sound smart and sophisticated when written in his brand of long, detailed sentences. Not that his protagonist's plans are dumb, they are usually pretty smart and fun to read. He is also great at writing technobabble and tense scenes. Now only if he could finish a story...
  9. [With This Ring](https://questionablequesting.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-fourteen.8938/page-1976#post-6372141) (Young Justice SI): Rational-ish SI with an orange lantern appears on Young Justice DC earth. Loved it at the beginning and approximately 600K words into the story. But at some point, the alt-timelines got far too much and my favoured method of reading(epubs with TTS) didn't work with all the coloured text and had to drop it. But I did love what I read and I will go back to read it if I can figure out how to alternate TTS voices by colour.
  10. [Vigor Mortis](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40373/vigor-mortis): This would be higher if I hadn't read this early this year and hadn't gone back to it yet. I remember loving the atmosphere and that the main character was aggressively lovable.
  11. [Dark Legend of Potter: Crimson Demons Awaken](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dark-legend-of-potter-crimson-demons-awaken-konosuba-x-harry-potter.958832/) (Konosuba x Harry Potter): It was exactly what it said on the title. Just as charming and funny as I expected and nothing more.

  There are more stories I liked but the list is already too long. On a whole. I feel like I am reading way too many fanfics. I love them but I would not want anyone IRL to learn how *many* I read. I should read more published works next year.

    As usual, seconding OVDT, my favorite ongoing work on RR. It's an excellent reconstruction of isekai in a world where everyone and their dog tries to *de*construct the genre. Definitely a breath of fresh air. Fair warning though, it's very slow-paced. I found that great because it allows to develop its multitude of characters and rich worldbuilding, but YMMV.
    ```

    - u/FeO_Chevalier:
      ```
      When you call it a reconstruction (especially as opposed to a deconstruction) what do you mean?  My recollection of reading the first two “books” as they released before dropping it was that it’s exactly the same kind of schlocky wish fulfillment fantasy as most other (Japanese) isekai, just aimed at a slightly different audience and with a slightly different wish that it fulfills.
      ```

      - u/NTaya:
        ```
        Reconstruction takes the cliches and creates solid justifications for them. E.g., there's a harem, but there's an in-universe explanation for why having it is rationally the best thing to do, *and* it's not a part of wish fulfillment by any means. I actually can't say the story is wish-fulfilling unless your wish is for everyone to knock you down a peg.
        ```

        - u/FeO_Chevalier:
          ```
          I’m not asking for a definition of a reconstruction.  I’m asking in what way you think OVDT is a reconstruction.  Which problematic fantasy isekai cliches does the story manage to uplift? 

          Your stereotypical fantasy isekai is wish fulfillment for young males.  They get plucked out of their dull lives and get to be someone special, to do valorous things, and to achieve romantic success.  OVDT is wish fulfillment for terminally online doomers.  Seiji gets plucked out of his empty life and gets to be someone special with a purpose, to burn down corrupt and oppressive systems, and to amaze everyone with his sophomoric takes on politics and sociology.  Sure, Seiki is probably suffering more than the average isekai protagonist, but virtuous suffering is part of the fantasy being peddled.

            >Seiji gets plucked out of his empty life and gets to be someone special with a purpose, to burn down corrupt and oppressive systems, and to amaze everyone with his sophomoric takes on politics and sociology. Sure, Seiki is probably suffering more than the average isekai protagonist, but virtuous suffering is part of the fantasy being peddled.

            That is not an accurate representation of the story.

            Seiji is not happy to have been plucked from his life and is in fact extremely pissed and resistant to the process.

            So far most of his attempts to "burn down corrupt and oppressive systems" have had as much failure as success, resulting in huge amounts of collateral damage and suffering to the people he wanted to protect. It's obvious to everyone, including Seiji, that he is flying by the seat of his pants, which is why he starts delegating to other, more competent people as soon as he gets the option.

            Regarding his "sophomoric takes on politics and sociology", Seiji definitely isn't amazing everyone. So far his monologues have been effective at rabble-rousing to build up his follower base, but all of the intelligent people in the story routinely poke fun at his oversimplified, inaccurate and misanthropic take on the world. In fact, the most recent arcs of the story make it clear that Seiji's short-sighted focus on theatrical oratory is leading to negative consequences.

            Seiji is not a protagonist designed to act as a reader surrogate. Instead, the story shows that he's a pretty terrible person who is only gradually getting better (and in some cases worse) as he messily learns from his catastrophes. That's why OVDT is not the wish fulfillment you claim it is.

            ----

            As for the reconstruction aspect, /u/Ntaya already mentioned one trope common in isekai that gets an in-universe explanation: the harem trope. Other reconstructed tropes in the story include: monster girls, dungeon loot mechanics, fantasy land economy, etc.

            But there are also tropes that get subverted in the story: Monster races typically depicted as sub-human turn out to be advanced civilizations. The corrupt guard captain turns out to be hypercompetent. The heroic paladin isn't a one-note do-gooder. Citizens have a hard time telling the 'Dark Lords' apart from the 'Heroes'. There's no romantic/hormonal attraction to the 'harem' members, etc.
            ```

              >Seiji is not happy to have been plucked from his life and is in fact extremely pissed and resistant to the process.

              Sure, he's verbally resistant, but he's the same as most other isekai protagonists with regards to not having any ties to the world he left (he has no career, no real plans, no friends, no family- sure he claims to in the first couple chapters, but he never really reminisces about them or showcases how their absence affects him).  His reluctance seems to stem more from his generally abrasive personality than it does from a reasoned evaluation of his current lot in life.

              >So far most of his attempts to "burn down corrupt and oppressive systems" have had as much failure as success

              He fails upwards pretty consistently, with poor plans that succeed largely on his own overwhelming magical might (until they start relying on all of his enemies being generally incompetent).

              > all of the intelligent people in the story routinely poke fun at his oversimplified, inaccurate and misanthropic take on the world.

              Has anyone ever told him that he's an idiot and explained why?  My recollection is that everyone nods along, one of the infinitely wiser female characters will make some remark or indication that they don't fully agree, and then the story moves along.  I can't recall an instance of one of Seiji's inane recollections of stuff he read online getting thrown back in his face.

              >In fact, the most recent arcs of the story make it clear that Seiji's short-sighted focus on theatrical oratory is leading to negative consequences.

              The story is already half again as long as the entirety of the Lord of the Rings.  That the story is only just now beginning to hint that one of his major flaws is a problem, then it's not really a problem.  And let's be real, the fanbase (and clearly the author) love those scenes; they aren't going away.

              >Seiji is not a protagonist designed to act as a reader surrogate.

              I disagree.  The intended audience doesn't think they're paragons of virtue either.  I think Seiji being so hateable is part of the draw; it lets all the other characters reassure him (and the audience) that they aren't really terrible people despite their flaws.  

              &#x200B;

              As far as tropes that OVDT is supposed to be reconstructing: Seiji doesn't have a harem (and the story calls Yoshi's party a harem, but I don't recall it showing them as vying for his affections), I don't recall any monster girls, most isekai don't touch on economics at all.  It does explain dungeon loot mechanics well.  Monster races are pretty frequently portrayed as normal people all the time, I don't recall the guard captain being "hypercompetent" nor do I think that's really that big of an isekai trope.  Paladins are played straight less often than they're subverted (when isekai even has dedicated paladin types and/or a non-villainous church).  

              >Citizens have a hard time telling the 'Dark Lords' apart from the 'Heroes'.

              I don't think that's a trope, but the citizenry is pretty clear on which were the dark lords and heroes in the past.  

              >There's no romantic/hormonal attraction to the 'harem' members, etc.

              Then it's not a harem.
              ```

                >Sure, he's verbally resistant, but he's the same as most other isekai protagonists with regards to not having any ties to the world he left (he has no career, no real plans, no friends, no family- sure he claims to in the first couple chapters, but he never really reminisces about them or showcases how their absence affects him). His reluctance seems to stem more from his generally abrasive personality than it does from a reasoned evaluation of his current lot in life.

                Actually he has quite a few plans and attachments that he occasionally reminisces/rants about during the story.

                There are passages where he thinks about his unpleasant relationship with his father, memories of his grandmother (who he admires), and talk of working at the store owned by a family friend. He also occasionally reminisces about past girlfriends. He had plans to save up enough money to move to America where the other half of his family is.

                Seiji worked a day job that he hates, but his real passion is being a musician, which he was actually quite talented and professional at, even if he mostly just did random gigs at bars. One reason he planned to move to America was to expand his career as a musician there.

                Suffice to say, Seiji had real attachments, a real life that he enjoys, and real plans for his future. He is not the lifeless, generic shut-in protagonist you claim.

                >He fails upwards pretty consistently, with poor plans that succeed largely on his own overwhelming magical might (until they start relying on all of his enemies being generally incompetent).

                To be clear, he 'fails upward' because of literal in-universe deus ex machina (the bored goddesses put their fingers on the scales to keep things entertaining for themselves). But even then, his successes are frequently pyhric, with his mistakes leading to huge casualties amongst the civilians whom he wanted to help.

                For example, >!Seiji's provoking of Lady Grey led to the casualties in Cat Alley, which then led to the city guard's brutal crackdown on the whole of the gutters, which led to Lady Grey picking off gutter rats to make a point. Seiji's victory over the cat tribe came at the cost of impending starvation for most of the poorest populations on Dount (slaves, beast tribes, etc.). Seiji's poor handling of the Goblin King situation lit the fire of a civil war which seemingly decimated their society.!<

                >Has anyone ever told him that he's an idiot and explained why? My recollection is that everyone nods along, one of the infinitely wiser female characters will make some remark or indication that they don't fully agree, and then the story moves along. I can't recall an instance of one of Seiji's inane recollections of stuff he read online getting thrown back in his face.

                Yes, there have been multiple cases where someone sat him down and explained to him exactly how big of a dumbass he was being, then told him that he needs to do better. Aster is the only one who is snarky with him early on in the story, but as he gets more followers, and they become more comfortable with him, they begin pointing out his faults more candidly. (Examples: >!Minifrit and Gannit on several occasions once they get settled in at North Watch. Zui, Gizmit and Sneppit at various points. Rhydion in the most recent chapters.!<) It sounds like you just haven't read that far in the story yet.

                >The story is already half again as long as the entirety of the Lord of the Rings. That the story is only just now beginning to hint that one of his major flaws is a problem, then it's not really a problem. And let's be real, the fanbase (and clearly the author) love those scenes; they aren't going away.

                Some people enjoy good, slow paced character development that pays off in the long run.

                Regarding Seiji's "show time" antics, yes, they are frequently cathartic for the readers. That said, even as early as the Cat Alley arc, the author shows how Seiji's focus on rabble-rousing is having unintended consequences, and even Seiji himself is uncomfortable with the violence that he eggs on. He worries that he is growing numb to it, which turns out to be a well founded concern.

                If you think that the author merely writes those scenes to pander to the audience, then you are ignoring all the intentional details which point out why Seiji's action's *aren't* a good thing. The audience is meant to be uncomfortable with it too, and examples in the most recent chapters make that even clearer.

                >The intended audience doesn't think they're paragons of virtue either. I think Seiji being so hateable is part of the draw; it lets all the other characters reassure him (and the audience) that they aren't really terrible people despite their flaws. 

                Let me get this straight, your premise is that the fans are all assholes, and therefore they identify with Seiji and think his assholery isn't bad either?

                There's so much in the story that disproves your premise, and I've pointed out quite a few examples higher up in this comment, so I won't bother reiterating them here.

                >Seiji doesn't have a harem (and the story calls Yoshi's party a harem, but I don't recall it showing them as vying for his affections)

                You haven't read far enough.

                >I don't recall any monster girls

                You haven't read far enough.

                >most isekai don't touch on economics at all

                That's what makes it a reconstruction. Many fantasy isekai stories (particularly ones with 'dungeons') have nonsensical economies that make no sense on closer inspection. Example trope: [Dungeon-Based Economy](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonBasedEconomy). This story actually has worldbuilding to explain things like the society-wide effects of metal scarcity and how loot found in dungeons ties into that.

                >Monster races are pretty frequently portrayed as normal people all the time

                Goblins in many generic fantasy stories are portrayed as subhuman. The isekaid characters in this story assume that they are until told otherwise. Related trope: [Our Goblins Are Different](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGoblinsAreDifferent) 

                >I don't recall the guard captain being "hypercompetent" nor do I think that's really that big of an isekai trope.

                You haven't read far enough. It's not specifically an isekai trope, but corrupt and lazy guards are a common trope in many fantasy settings.

                >I don't think that's a trope, but the citizenry is pretty clear on which were the dark lords and heroes in the past. 

                The trope is that 'Heroes' and 'Dark Lords' are very distinct in the way they act and look. Example tropes: [Good Colors, Evil Colors](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodColorsEvilColors), [Obviously Evil](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil) You haven't read far enough to see the confusion where people assume that Seiji is the hero, or the backstory of the world where some Heroes were horrible people and some Dark Lords were noble in comparison.

                >Then it's not a harem.

                I said it's a subversion. Of course it's not going to function like [the trope](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaremGenre).

        Have you considered using FanFicFare (most conveniently used as a Calibre extension)? It has extremely extensive customization options, and if you know a bit of HTML/CSS you can very precisely control how everything is handled after scraping. I don't know exactly how your TTS handles different voices, but I'm reasonably confident you could consistently add whichever marker it requires to the text corresponding to different colors. It would likely require you to manually set up the marker for each color, but after that initial effort all subsequent chapters should have it applied automatically, as well as future novels with multicolored text.

  The microsoft edge voices are very good and natural, I tried calibre but the voices suck imho. And after a few hours of searching I found nothing reasonable that could be used for free or pirated. 

  &#x200B;

  Until I found the Edge tts thing on a help thread from microsoft on how to add custom voices to windows (I was trying to take the voices from an extension, add them to windows and use them on calibre). So far it's the best option I've found. 

  &#x200B;

  Anyone knows of a better option ? I looked into the paid stuff but the ones I found were all subscrition based. And the edge seemed better than them while being free, other than not having the option of snoop dog read for me edge seemed better at everything.

  &#x200B;

  I guess I'm reccing microsoft edge read aloud, but I'm also open to a better alternative if you guys know any and I'm sure some of you do with how much some of you read.

      Just tried it, it seems it can't download the ivona voices anymore because the service was discontinued by amazon. It tries to download them but the server doesn't exist anymore.

      &#x200B;

      So it's basically a worst version of calibre, it only has the voices you have installed on pc available. Since you already have the voices available you could probably just use calibre if you'd prefer it.

I've encountered too many sad cases of fiction in which the supposedly-smart protagonist/antagonist makes myriads of uncharacteristically-stupid decisions for the sake of plot or has glaring and obvious flaws in their plans that an actual person of their super-intelligence wouldn't overlook, e.g. [Code Geass](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WhatAnIdiot/CodeGeass).
