  Wow... Well that escalated quickly.

  It's like these days you can't even be a guest/prisoner of the biggest bad guy known to the ninja world without getting into mortal danger.

  You glorious son of a bitch. You Quirrell'd Orochimaru. I don't know if I can emotionally handle another endearing sociopath. 

  Now I WANT them to defect. Ugh, I'm so easily manipulated.

    The only problem I have with that part of 'Methods' is that [MoR Final Arc](#s "David Monroe, the broken hero, was *so* much more compelling as a character than just flat-out evil sociopath Tom Riddle.")  

    I'm not quite as convinced with Orochimaru as I was with Quirrel, since I have never read him not being a despicable human being.

      If it helps, part of the conception I used for his character was "what if this one thing were different...how would Orochimaru be different?"  The more I looked at it the more the answer became "in basically every way."

  Well. Didn't expect Naruto to experience Chakra Exhaustion chasing after Hinata - his lack of mastery of the Tree Walking must've used a chunk more than was healthy as he pursued her. Kinda impressed with how Orochimaru reacted to learning about Naruto's injuries, and the little chat he had with Shino was interesting.

  That Sound village is sounding more and more like a better alternative to the other ninja village all the time.

    Naruto's regeneration was keeping up with his movement and treewalking on the roofs just fine -- he burned zero net chakra during the entire chase.  The problem was treewalking.

    Treewalking is normally done on something you're touching.  It requires exponentially more chakra the farther you are from the surface you're "walking" on.  Most jonin can't 'walk on anything more than an inch away from them, and even that far they generally can't do for more than a few seconds without exhausting themselves.

    When Naruto saw Hinata about to die and he couldn't move fast enough to save her, he treewalked on a man's head from *three feet away*.  He burned every scrap of chakra he had in a fraction of a second and would have died if he hadn't been able to get a very substantial chakra transfusion.

    [EDIT:  I should also have mentioned:  ordinarily you can't 'walk on things that have notable amounts of chakra.  Trees have chakra, but not a lot and it doesn't move around much.  People have a lot of chakra (comparatively), and it flows quickly, so it will tend to brush off any attempt from foreign chakra to grab on.  That's why ninja don't use treewalking in combination with taijutsu in order to rip holes in their opponents every time they land a strike.  Naruto has so much chakra he was able to overcome that limitation, although it was a big part of what drained him so far.]

    And no, none of what I just said is Naruto canon as far as I know.   It's just the only way that I can make sense of ninja not weaponizing the treewalking ability.

      There's a lot of things in Naruto canon which have weapon applications, but which aren't used as such. Most likely because the author just never thought of using it in such a way - few people munchkin everything they encounter, after all.
      ```

        Is it terrifying that I consider the mark of a good rational Naruto fanfiction to be when it's innovative about killing people?
        ```

        - u/ATRDCI:
          ```
          Considering Naruto is a universe where child soldiers are looked at without batting an eye, inter-fighting is so common that military contracts are plentiful enough to support the economy of multiple nations, and a well trained teen can cause natural disasters without too terrible an effort, not really.
          ```

- u/AugSphere:
  ```
  Yup. That's why you don't give any power to children. One tantrum and three people are dead. Laplace damn, I'm disappointed in everyone but Orochimaru at this point. Well, at least we now know that everyone has plenty of room for character growth.

  Hope to see more of the Orochimaru. From what I've seen so far we finally have an awesome rational sociopath.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    I've never heard "Laplace damn" before. :>  Dawkins, FSM, IPU, even Asimov. Never Laplace, though. Kinda cool.
    ```
