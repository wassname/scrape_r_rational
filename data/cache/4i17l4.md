  The odds of rolling twelve sixes *once* is (1/6)^12 which is:

  > 1/2,176,782,336

  The odds of doing it ten times in a row is (1/2,176,782,336)^10 which is:

  > 1/2,388,636,399,360,109,977,557,402,041,718,133,080,829,429,159,844,757,507,642,063,199,359,529,632,522,467,783,435,119,230,976

  Which you might notice is a large number (~2 trigintillion).

  If you want to use "virtually certain if done a quadrillion times" then something closer to "six sixes three times in a row", since the odds of rolling six sixes three times in a row is:

  > 1/101,559,956,668,416

  Or approximately one in a hundred trillion.

  Since we have a sample of one (i.e. one tree of life with a single common point of origin), it's hard to say how low of a chance is consistent with reality. If the chance is extremely low, that helps explain the Fermi paradox.

  My first advice would be to not do whatever you are doing. You are invoking tribalism for what appears to be no good reason - though of course it may make more sense in context.

  If you must defend Our Side's (evolutionists? Do we call ourselves that?) righteous and true process of abiogenesis against Their Side's silly and misguided foolishness... still don't, because abiogenesis is a chemical process. Just like any other chemical process, the statistical effects only dominate way far out on the tails of the graph - functionally never, because there are many Avagadro's numbers of trials to make the graph really sharp. If you put the same ingredients in the same environment you'll get the same result. I would only feel comfortable talking about chance when talking about multiple planets, and their probability of starting in the right place.

  If you must talk about chance, then you are misleading your audience into thinking that your numbers mean anything, when you actually pulled them out of thin air, annoying both of the tribes you are invoking.

  If you *must* have your numbers, I recommend not using any numbers that break your calculator if you don't have to. You don't need to go to such extremes to demonstrate your point, and phrasing it as x number of y number of die rolls is unnecessarily dense. The chance of winning the lottery is, let's say, 1/10,000,000. Earth has 160,000,000 random tickets. Now Earth's chance of *not* winning the lottery is 1/10,000,000. You'd need to look through, on average, ten million Earths to find one without life.

  With the relationship between probability and number of trials plainly revealed, a creationist will now object. They will say that you are misrepresenting the numbers, and Earth does not have that many tickets relative to the odds. They will say that it's more like rolling 120 sixes in a mere quadrillion tries. You will have no defense against that claim, because their made-up numbers are not necessarily worse than your made-up numbers, and you will make Our Side look foolish. Only proceed if that is your intention.

  The chance of getting 12 sixes from 12 dice is `(1/6)^12 = 1/(6^12) ~= 4.6e-10`, i.e. 0.000000046%.

  The chance of doing so 10 times in a row is `(1/6^12)^10 = 1/(6^120) ~= 4.2e-94`, which is an absolutely minuscule number.

  The odds of achieving this from 1 quadrillion independent sequences of 10 rolls of 12 dice (because the maths is easier for independent trials) is `1 - (1 - 1/(6^120))^1e15 ~= 4.2e-79`, which is also incredibly unlikely.

  For reference, if every atom on the planet (~1.33e50) attempted that once a millisecond since the universe began (~4.3e20) there would still only be a ~0.0000024% chance that it would ever have occured.

  The big problem is that you're effectively looking for a sequence of 120 rolls with 1/6 probability each, and there are:

      2388636399360109977557402041718133080829429159844757507642063199359529632522467783435119230976

  possible outcomes, of which only one is correct.

  To make the numbers work out, you'd need a total of around 18 dice rolls required for success (e.g. 2 rolls of 9 dice, 6 rolls of 3 dice, 1 roll of 18 dice) from 1 quadrillion trials. That gives a 99.995% chance of observing at least one success.

  +1 to Anakiri's comment

  What you really want to look at are the maths and physics behind things like temperature and pressure, as well as (as Anakiri points out) chemical reactions. These are cases where a massive series of stacked probabilities becomes certain enough to have simple equations predicting them.

  To use your word, you will virtually always experience atmospheric pressure, because the likelihood of the brownian motion lining up in *just the right way* to remove that pressure just isn't going to happen.

  Also, to reiterate Anakiri, avoid telling people on the internet they're wrong. It generally doesn't work. People are generally "smart" - as in, they have a process by which they go from information about the situation to conclusions - and I think it might actually be harder to convince them that the process they use to do that is wrong (or yielded incorrect results). What you want to do (I think) is add information to the situation they're thinking about, and then they can do their process and (maybe) achieve different results. Belief-in-belief still applies.

  Hmm, so debating with creationists is not a super good use of time, in terms of "convince this person that they're wrong and you're right" since most of these discussions are not held in good faith. In general, though, as long as it's reasonably possible that somewhere in the universe there is intelligent life, you can talk about the [anthropic principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle) (introduced briefly by SMBC [here](http://smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=1932)) to explain why it's not super unreasonable that there's life, even if it is unlikely.

  The basic thing you could say is, yeah, there are tons of planets with no life. By definition, though, there aren't people on a planet without life philosophizing about life. 

  In a universe in which life is incredibly unlikely and only a small number of stars have it, every living intelligent creature will be in a situation that say the following: "Wow, the planet I'm on is surprisingly, unusually good for intelligent life! this is an awfully suspicious coincidence!" So, it is technically true that life is fairly unlikely to take root on any particular planet, but it happened to take root on the planet on which we live. However, the fact that this is true doesn't imply something strange is going on. This is just what things look like if you assume life happens very rarely, but does still happen. This is just how the world appears. 

  As a, like, more meta-level piece of advice, though: don't spend time arguing with creationists or evolutionists if at all possible. Why? Most people don't have these discussions in order to learn new things. They're doing this to try to win, and it becomes abrasive. People on both sides may also find this sort of discussion upsetting. Usually a good way to go about it, if possible, is to say something like "I respect your beliefs, even if we don't agree on everything" and your friends should (probably) extend you the same courtesy. If you have religious family and you are not religious, don't share this fact with them until you are financially independent.
