  Hm.

  The rules strongly incentivize finding a way to perfectly hide bodies, as it guarantees victory. The rules also do not state that a player cannot sludge, murder, and dismember another player, then dump pieces of him or her somewhere completely inaccessible for non-dismembered humans.

  Speculation: this is why the game will get lethal.

    While I can see someone murdering for this amount of money, they're still on national television. Or at least they believe so, and they are definitely being recorded. Committing murder on a television show is a nice way to get arrested for a long time. Until something crazy happens, I don't see murder and dismembering happening anytime soon.

  I really like this so far (extremely Danganropa though it might be) but I can't help but note that we're not on three-chapter-per-day mode yet.
