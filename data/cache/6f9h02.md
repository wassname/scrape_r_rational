  Enjoyed the end of the arc quite a lot, looking forward to the next piece of the story!

  And thus concludes the second part of the climax! And with it, incidentally, the last of my beta-reader's notes, since this was where he dropped off. It's amazing he spent as much time on the story as he did, really, considering he was never into Naruto to begin with. Let's hope the chapter doesn't have any more flaws as a result!

   I'm really looking forward to hearing what you guys thought of the climax!

    Well, I was really looking forward to the Kyuubi's unleashed power, as it so often happens in Naruto fics, but I guess it didn't happen here. 

    Doubt it could be called a flaw, but it's always fun to see that overwhelming power to get a feel of a fic
    ```

      ```
      The fundamental premise of the fix is that problems in this world can't be solved with raw power alone - heck, it's in the story's description. Unleashing epic power is fun, true, but it wouldn't work as a solution to a rationalist story I feel.
      ```

      - u/JulianWyvern:
        ```
        I can understand that, it makes perfect sense. 

        But you know, sometimes you want a problem to simply be removed from your sight rather than fixed.

  Just thought I'd pop in and comment saying that I've been loving the read thus far and keep up the good work! Authors don't often get positive comments due most only feeling the need to speak up when the dislike something... but I thought I'd just return some of the positivity that I gained from reading the last three chapters. Secondary, more selfish reasons, include that many fanfictions get abandoned because Authors get too discouraged to finish them.

  If you don't mind answering (you can spoiler it, if need be), what were the four levels Kakashi was playing on during his escapade? So far I've got this:

   * Kakashi is currently weakened enough to not defeat Zabuza easily. (core / first level)
   * Kakashi is actually strong enough to defeat Zabuza, but wants to flush the real him out. (second level)
   * Kakashi is weakened and desperate and wishes for a simple resolution. (third level)
   * Kakashi is strong enough to fight him, chase him off and survive... but not enough to kill him or find the real him. (fourth level)
  ```

  I'm late but I only found out about this two days ago and I've been steadily reading it. 

  SÃ¬ it's obvious that it's inspired by hpmor, maybe too obvious at the beginning but I saw the quality improving as time went and the latest chapters have been amazing. 

  It'd definitely a story I can't wait to read each week or however much it takes for chapters to come out
