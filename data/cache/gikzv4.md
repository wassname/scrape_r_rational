  I really enjoy your work! One note, I think there might be a mistake, Oak says that Red doesn't speak a single word, but Brock hears Red give Mawile an order.

    Typo thread?  Typo thread!

    Brock calls for a 2 hour intermission but Oak decides at the end the battle is about to start after 1 hour has passed.

  Another great chapter! Is there a release schedule for this?

    No. Chapters can take varying amounts of time to write. For example, the end of Act 1 took over two months. It's not really plausible to do that. Also, that makes it feel too much like a job if you know what I mean. Still, we do try to get out a couple of chapters every month, across all of our fiction.
