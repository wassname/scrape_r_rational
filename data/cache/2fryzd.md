  I've also fired up an account at FictionPress, FanFiction.net's big brother for original fiction, at https://www.fictionpress.com/u/983729/DataPacRat ; and have posted the first book of S.I. there, to see what sort of traffic it gets there.

    Fictionpress has practically no readership. The only places you aren't posting it that would possibly increase views is a wordpress account alongside plugging on the few web serial fiction topsites.

    Is it fanfiction, or original?  If it's non-copyright-violating, I'd be glad to post it on GreenDogPress.blogspot.com (where I'm selling my own novella, "One Hot Night" </shameless_plug>) so that you can earn at least a little coin from it.
