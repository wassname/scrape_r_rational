## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Recommendation:

  Shade Touched: an (essentially) nearly typical small D&D monster predator gets blessed with nearly-superhuman intelligence and goes around behaving like a curious cat-like child. Very fun and emotionally powerful read

    Where "nearly-superhuman intelligence" means "upper range of human learning ability" and not that the creature starts out with complicated thoughts!  I almost didn't read this because I thought it was going to be another author-screwed-up-"superintelligence" story, but it's not.
    ```

  - u/Prince_Silk:
    ```
    To go along with that, [ The Dungeon Child](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32924/the-dungeon-child) is the story of a sentient dungeon who after being killed is reborn as a human on Earth. It's cute, weird and interesting reverse isekai story that's worth checking out.

    Thanks for the recommendation. Just got caught up, and this is a really great story. 

    And even better: it updates Mondays and Fridays! And each chapter, even if they may be short, is a gem.

    Hey, thanks for the shoutout! Never really thought of my story as particularly rational but I guess it fits. I try to keep stuff making sense. Although, after reading the sidebar it seems to fall under Aspiring rationalism pretty well, at least for the first while.

  Bit of a longshot, but here goes:

  Is anyone else a fan of David Brin's Uplift saga?  I'm interested in hard science fiction where humans uplift animals, not as slaves, but as companions and fellow citizens.   Where humans do their best to try to pay homage to the essence of the animal that's brought to intelligence, preserving something of the unique point of view of that animal, while bringing them into the fullest flowering of what it means to be sentient.

  Bonus points, of course, if at least one character is a good rationalist role model.

    The Orions Arm Project features magnificient pages on pages of a galactic encyclopedia's uplift projects.  Also some stories, but hard to find.  For example, uplifted elephants:

    You might like Eclipse Phase. It's a TTRPG, but there are a number of official novellas in the setting and you can find a few fanworks if you look around a bit.

    The general idea behind the setting is that it's some unspecified but not *too* 
    distant point in the future (best guess around 2100-2200), 10 years after a cataclysmic event known as The Fall where some AIs >!got exposed to a hostile memetic (amongst other vectors) alien virus left as a trap,!< went through a hard-takeoff singularity, murdered most of transhumanity and then mysteriously fucked off before finishing the job, leaving Earth an uninhabitable ruin and only a few percent of the population as survivors (and most of those as as digitally stored egos, who had to abandon their physical bodies to escape Earth). 

    Before the Fall a number of species had been uplifted, and how they should be treated going forward is one of the points of contention between the various different factions.

    ```
    I really liked the setting, but didn't care much for any of the individual stories. It's been a while since I read them, so maybe I'd change my mind on second read, but looking back the books just don't stand out for me.
    ```

    - u/InfinitysDice:
      ```
      Fair enough; tastes differ.  I enjoyed the hell out of 'em, but I was coming out of a multi-year science fiction dry spell when I ran into them; so that might contribute to my bias.  :)

    Adrian Tchaikovsky's Children of Time and Children of Ruin follow the histories of lost colonies of uplifted *Portia* jumping spiders and Pacific octopuses respectively. I didn't enjoy the parts about humans, which were too doom-and-gloom for me, but I loved the invertebrates.

    I'd say [The Fall of Doc Future](https://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents) may be close to what you want.

  - u/TitansTrail:

    You may want to look into [Genius: The Transgression](https://sites.google.com/site/moochava/genius).

    Came here to mention *The Fall of Doc Future* and *A Miracle of Science*, but both had already been mentioned.  *Miracle of Science* is heartwarming fun.  *Fall of Doc Future* is to mad science what Worm is to comic books - unlikely to be surpassed in its rationalization any time soon.  However - I can't be arsed to think of a polite way to say this - *Fall of Doc Future* presumes the reader has a minimum IQ of 140.  Not a technical education per se, just a minimum IQ of 140.

  Seeing [The Fall of Doc Future](https://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents) mentioned reminds me of a long-running question that I have no simple way to ask, because the concept doesn't exist in our baseline culture and has a lot of distracting wrong neighbors, but I'm going to ask it anyways:  What fiction have you read that is written for the *cognitively intelligent* reader?

  This is distinct from many distracting-wrong-neighbor concepts like "Author mentions technical stuff you're supposed to have prior knowledge about" or "The characters in the story are told to play excellent chess" or "The story contains stuff that is difficult to understand because it is ambiguous bullshit".  So far as I can tell, indeed, our baseline culture has no standard word that means "cognitive intelligence" in the sense that I defined it for "intelligent characters", which is why no such branch of literature exists; it has prior concepts only for status-markers vaguely associated in some way with cognitive horsepower, like big science words, playing chess, being educated, saying stuff that sounds hard to understand but like you are supposed to understand it, having high status in a scientific field, i.e., what a normal person would call "smart", which in standard-culture literature does not especially connote a character who correctly solves the many implicit cognitive challenges of a story.

  What fiction have you read (besides Fall of Doc Future) that assumes the reader is cognitively intelligent, without that being a matter of demanding the reader have prior technical knowledge?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    That's an interesting question, and one I'm pretty sure that if you hadn't spelled it out I would have answered wrong. Certainly, there are books where you can get more out of them if you're smart; ones with hidden twists and easter eggs, where it's satisfying to work out what's going to happen before the story makes it clear. And there are books that are hard to read, and require dedication and intelligence to understand, but most of the examples of this are  mostly like this because they're badly written and hard to understand; ie, ambiguous bullshit. And there are stories with mechanics designed to demand the readers have high intelligence, either as a whole or individually, but these are mostly in the form of quest or games linked with the story, where the intelligence is required to succeed at the game, not the story; if you're just reading a playthrough, or following a story only thread, no special intelligence is required on the part of the reader.

    There's genuinely not a lot of fiction like this, because the incentive isn't really there. You're not going to see many TV shows like this, because the ultimate goal of a TV show is to get as many people to watch it (and, for the applicable shows, to buy as much merch) as it can, and restricting your demographic to "cognitively intelligent readers looking for cognitively intelligent targeted works" is small.

    I think simply by virtue of the defining characteristics of what you're looking for, you're not going to find much in popular culture, especially the monetized bits of it. The closest things I can really think of along those lines are Umineko and Serial Experiments Lain, and neither one is exactly what you're asking for.
    ```

      Bloodborne, and to an extent the rest of the FromSoftware games require a lot of inquiry from the player to understand the story bit by bit. Bloodborne especially, which has a complicated story that is told in non-sequential bits all over the place. There's even a 30+ page essay in the subreddit that tries to explain the story in full. Imo it hits most of the requirements for a story that requires intelligence to understand, it's not something you can just absorb.
      ```

  - u/Audere_of_the_Grey:
    ```
    I think technically there might be some dialogues in GEB that qualify.
    ```

  - u/Chaigidel:
    ```
    Wasn't the reason nobody read Greg Egan's *Incandescence* that it was basically about deriving a system of mathematical physics on the go? Also I wonder if there's stuff in pre-WWII literary fiction that qualifies. Thinking of stuff by people like Nabokov, Dostoevsky, Borges and Proust who have some pretty complex stuff going with the plots and assume that the reader can keep up.
    ```

  - u/TaoGaming:
    ```
    I just read *Fall of Doc Future* (thanks for the rec) but I didn't feel like it was particularly challenging, so I'm wondering if I missed something.

    I am trying to stumble towards what you meant, and so I want to give an example to see if I'm on the right track. I suspect that a story that requires a more cognitively intelligent reader occurs when less is directly stated (via dialogue, infodump, etc) but is shown/implied and left up to the reader. The standard for this that I always remember is from To Kill A Mockingbird

    >... Jem gave a reasonable description of Boo: Boo was about six-and-a-half feet tall, judging from his tracks...

    The point that Harper Lee is trying to make is that Jem has never seen Boo, but she doesn't tell the reader that. You have to notice it. (I didn't notice this when I first read it).  Is that in the right ballpark?

    I suspect that Jane Austen is like that for social and class-related commentary but I don't know. I can't get it. From what I've read, its Iain M. Banks and the Culture stuff. A lot of things are only hinted at, and the transcripts between the ships are dense. But on re-reading it, everything is there. There is certainly some tech concepts, but nothing particularly weird by SF standards. (The later books are more straightforward).
    ```

    - u/Amonwilde:
      ```
      Can confirm that Austen is this. But you need to have some knowledge of the conventions she's working with.
      ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    I've always felt like Larry Niven writes that way. A lot of implied stuff, where I as a reader of average intelligence needs to think about it for a second or two. Not everything is shown or explained. 

    I've also argued with people about that being just bad writing in general though.
    ```

    - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
      ```
      Yeah, I didn't realize for years why the inertia-reduction drive also sped up time!  Though admittedly I was just a kid on the first read.
      ```

      - u/SkyTroupe:
        ```
        Can you explain that? I never picked up on that when I read it. Although I did read it before I ever took a physics class
        ```

        - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
          ```
          Just suppose that momentum remains conserved!
          ```

          - u/AnythingMachine:
            ```
            That’s how 40k Imperial Navy macrocannons work, I always assumed -  they aren’t gravitic (speciality of the Eldar) and they also aren’t railguns (Tau only), and behave a lot like normal chemical-projectile cannons except that they fling solid thousand ton shells at many thousands of kilometres per second, far beyond the detonation velocity of any chemical explosive.

            Explanation:

            There is an inertial compensator in the cannon barrel, designed for incredibly high power output over a short time, the shell is manually loaded and fires its powder charge and imparts a certain momentum to the round, then the pulsed inertial compensation triggers while the round is leaving the barrel, mass goes down by a factor of 1000 and velocity goes from 1 to 1000 km/s. Extra kinetic energy (because v^2) comes from the power cells in the barrel. Fusion of giant guns and the highest of high technology is very 40k, apart from anything else - railguns are a far simpler technology, but *they* are tech-heresy and there's no STC template for them, but inertial suppression is required for all ships in the Navy and must be used anyway.
            ```

      - u/AnythingMachine:
        ```
        Inertia Reduction has other interesting effects, like making your blood pressure go up, assuming that you don’t adjust anything else to compensate for particles having a lower inertial mass. Ever read Redemption Ark by Alastair Reynolds?

    - u/BavarianBarbarian_:
      ```
      Yea, I tried to read that and while I'm a native German speaker and know a thing or two about rocketry, I had to give up on that book. Felt like my brain was melting whenever I tried to puzzle out what was going on, and if I didn't, the book would abandon the scene and move elsewhere without explanation of what just happened. If that book is the mark of a cognitively intelligent reader, then I can confidently say I'm not one.

    ```
    I'll mention [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House\_of\_Leaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Leaves) although it's anti-rational in some ways and assumes a modern arts education.  You need to read the hardcopy for best effect.

    I think you might enjoy Jacek Dukaj's works, especially those that deal with posthuman or AI characters. Sure, they ALSO contain some wrong-neighbour markers you mentioned, but at their core, the stories are of level of intellectual complexity that in my view, would attract and please a cognitively intelligent reader.

    Or put it another way: me, as a guy with 2 Master's Degrees and about 120IQ, give or take, could barely keep up with the story and its ideas, and it was obvious to me that is not that the book is badly written, but my mind is badly written and thus unable to decipher it. I could feel that a cool plot and fascinating ideas on identity, philosophy and science are there, its just that I did not have enough RAM to launch these ideas in my head.

          ```

  - u/andor3333:
    ```
    I'm not sure if you mean a book that is only understandable by an intelligent reader, or one with characters that truly act intelligently instead of signaling intelligence or having the complicated parts of their plans succeed through plot armor, implausible talents, or handwaving the details offscreen.

    If you are loking for books where the characters demonstrate actual intelligence, I think the Baroque Cycle by Neal Stephenson has a lot of characters that accomplish their goals by intelligent methods and show their work.  I've recommended this one here before, it is set in the 16th century and is written from the viewpoints of multiple characters. Lots of plotting and planning by everyone that involves alchemy, inventions, currency and stock manipulation, the royal society, bankrupting countries, cryptography, faking deaths, the English succession, round the world trading voyages, prison breaks, etc..

  - u/thecommexokid:

    I think *Primer* would be a useful landmark in trying to frame this concept. Btw, I think Carruth’s other film *Upstream Color* has elements of this too but I’ve only seen it once 5 or 6 years ago so my recollection is hazy.

But I digress...) uplift fiction, preferably with a strong (character-wise, but OP is fine too) charasmatic MC who has the advantage of being the first or only one with access to the mechanism for the uplift. Examples that come to mind are John Ringo's Live Free or Die, or I guess [Micro Gates](https://storiesonline.net/s/17944/micro-gates), but hopefully better written. Bonus points for featuring IRL people. (Selling the phlebotinum to Elon Musk or Bill Gates, for example)

    Tentative counter-recommend for A Cloudy Path. The early bits are rather formulaic and nothing really happens for a while. I still read through it all but it was super depressing for it to end unfinished.

    He gets more creative later on, bringing in new villains but it just feels like a missed opportunity. All in all, I think I would've been better off reading a different 1.6+ million words. On the other hand, it did get me into Supreme Commander Forged Alliance, which still has a flourishing playerbase on FAF, so it wasn't a total waste of time.

      I sincerely recommend SupCom: FAF as the only *strategic* RTS I've ever played. Micro (how fast you can click and how well you can micromanage your units) is still important, but not to the degree that it is in every other RTS I've ever found.

      Sadly, the sequel apparently lost that spark.

      I think like a lot of crossovers, it hits harder if you're invested in the other story.

I kinda knew what was coming, both on the tech side and the story side.

  Putting in a request for stories that have kingdom building/societal restructuring as a primary conflict.

  The list of stories I'm familiar with include:

  * [Significant Digits](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11174940/1/Significant-Digits)(HPMOR, finished): Rat!Harry and co tries to reshape society after the end of HPMOR. I find the complexity of the plots to strain plausibility a little.
  * [Purple Days](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/#post-27571185)(ASOIF, ongoing): Timelooped Joffrey that tries to gather Westeros to battle the night army. Does a good job at instilling a sense of awe and comraderie but it's a little difficult to get into MC's head.
  * [Gospel of the New Gods](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/gospel-of-the-lost-gods-asoiaf-worm.760033/#post-58501312)(ASOIF/Worm, ongoing): Isekai Taylor and a hero team to the world of ASOIF in which they call themselves gods and try to create a community for themselves. Interesting and believable politics and intergroup conflicts that are phrased so I end up caring about them. The author have a billion ongoing stories and I feel somewhat doubtful that it'll finish.
  * Worth the Candle(Isekai/metanarrative rpg, ongoing) has super interesting elements of kingdom building but they are not the focus and there are so many (exciting) things happening that the kingdom building parts takes a background role.

It has an ongoing plotline that is continually brought up with involve building a community in an apocalypse zombie-infested world. The murderhobo mentality and the self-righteous attitude feels like a strawman for the argument of killing villains, and frankly it's grating, but I've been able to roll with it so far.

Fair ammount of uplift. I enjoyed the kingdom building aspects and how insights in how the company tries to make money on it. Stopped updating just as it felt the ball were starting to really get rolling.

Aside from solving a bunch of problems and fighting end bringers with zerg-inspired monstrocities, there are some(if not enough) focus the politics of multiple dimensions and building a kingdom in one of them.
  * [A hero's War](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War)(Isekai, dunno): I'm being told it's about uplift and while the MC does do some kingdom building I felt the kingdom building efforts dragged on without payoff and found it difficult to connect with the characters, so I stopped around chapter 50.
  * [Enlightened Empire](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20920/enlightened-empire/chapter/300519/prologue)(Isekai, dunno): MC is isekaid into an exiled prince and after king dies he gets a piece of the kingdom and tries to build an uplifted kingdom. I threw it away around chapter 200 because the the incompetence of the antagonists(which a lot of the plot were centered around) became unbearable.

    Dunno, if you've read that author's other stories his main characters are all like that (to varying degrees), I think this is just how he rolls.

    As for your request, I can recommend [The King in the Long Night](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-king-in-the-long-night-asoiaf-got-stellaris-uplift-project.578392/), where the xenophobic Human faction from Stellaris finds Westeros and decides to pull an uplift to recruit from the powerful local psykers. Great read, it doesn't only have the uplift conflict, but also conflict between local agents and their quasi-fascist government, as they get invested in the locals' lives more and more.

      I binged through it this afternoon and it is absolutely fantastic. The author does a great job of going back and forth from kingdom building and adventure questing. Interesting POV and the author's experience as a carpenter guides how they've approached the uplift aspect of the story.

    [Compass of thy soul](https://fanfiction.net/s/13338339/1/Compass-of-thy-Soul) and it's sequel are a Naruto pre-canon reincarnation isekai bildungsroman that attempts to achieve realistic depictions of day to day society in a pre-industrial martial world with magic supersoldiers. It's very Japanophilic but has a typical secular scorn for supernatural/religious worldviews which the characters ought to possess and significant pro-hereditary monarchy themes.    
    Then the last two thirds of the story sees every plot thread gradually warp themselves around the conflict between the aristocratic protagonists who are never wrong and the individualistic antagonist.

    It totally failed on realism, is what I'm saying, but it's a really engrossing read. 5/5 schlocky genre fic.

      The story is super duper authoritarian. The only people who are ever right or good are the ones who bow down to, effectively, the Divine Right of Kings as symbolized by the Uchiha doujutsu. 

      Also, the second half of the fic ([Direct thee to peace](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13388642/1/Direct-thee-to-Peace)) ends in >!what's basically a deathbed conversion!< that's otherwise largely out of place except for a couple of hints here and there, so you have that to look forward to.

      If you want something in a similar vein that's less likely to leave you feeling queasy, I'd recommend [Sanitize](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12431866/1/Sanitize) - similar setup but with significantly less authoritarianism.

  I have never seen this being recommended here but I recently stumbled upon [he who fight with monster](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26294/he-who-fights-with-monsters) on royalroad. I was surprised that I have only just found this now.

  The genre and premises are a bit like your typical litrpg isekai but the writing is really good. The world-building is also superb and rational like. The protagonist is a clever smart ass that likes to nitpicking small stuff and make a reference to culture from his original world. As an outworlder, his power is uncommon and can be a bit OP but far from unheard of.

  Another aspect of the novel that I like is the author willingness to explore stuffs which only briefly touched or just straight ignored in other isekai literature. This includes things like the identity and psychological aspect of someone who just moved world. In one chapter, the protagonist was described >!as vulnerable and exposed since his decisions in this world can be a matter of life and death. His principles are being put to the test, and he was forced to confront what it means when they bend or even break. Furthermore, the only thing he brought to the new world is his value from his own world, which often clashes with the local values!<. For me, this kind of exposition really enhances the story telling.

  I was surprised this novel is on the first page of Best Rated novel on royalroad. So, if you haven't read it, I recommend giving this one a go.

    - u/NTaya:
      ```
      >Non human how?

      I'd say there should be two main elements. 

      1. The character has thought patterns and values distinct from human. E.g., Mud is a maximizer AGI dead set on trying to achieve a certain goal, and Shade Touched's MC is your typical LitRPG monster that was born with self-awareness and insatiable curiosity. Both of them have thought patterns that no human would have, and their goals are also quite different from what you would normally read in a fantasy.

      2. The character being different as described above prevents them from fully integrating with human/other sapient society. Or, at least, prevents them from dealing with the same problem a human adventurer might have. (This is why I *didn't* put Super Minion on the list; he tries his best to pass as a human, so I can easily see his late game being the same as for any other MC in a superhero setting.)

    Surprisingly enough, Blue Core is pretty rational. There are explicit scenes that require a bit of suspension of disbelief, but none of them are really integral to the story, and they are labeled, so you can skip them. The MC actually discusses his build and options to his companions, and tries to optimize it. The powerful enemies are also smart and resourceful, and generally don't hold the idiot ball.

    I'd also recommend Ar'Kendrythist. It's not *that* rational, but the worldbuilding and magic system are robust, and the characters always seem three dimensional. It's definitely on the level of something like Delve in terms of rationality, and personally I like it more. The magic is more mystical though, and the mc is middle aged and at first fairly set in his ways. It takes time for him to really come to terms with the new world.
