## Looking for Toy Story Fic

### Post:

Looking for a Toy Story fic to read my wife to bed tonight and I can't google discover it for the life of me.

Essentially, Sid from Toy Story discards all his toys with the exception of a doll that he gaslights by saying "I love you" every night. Ultimately this leads to him taking over the world.

Any idea what I'm looking for?
