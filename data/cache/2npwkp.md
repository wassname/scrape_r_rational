  Hey all, welcome back! Relatively later chapter than the last few as a result of the holidays and the new Pokemon game eating up my free time, but I hope you like it.  Not sure if I hit the mark or not, so all feedback welcome, as usual!

    Good chapter. I quite liked the cliffhanger ending and the new pokemon Red now has. Putting up a trap for it is quite a good plan, really.
    I noted it wasn't a native to FRLG Kanto 'mon, though - are you going to have mons of any region living somewhere depending on whether the environment could support them, or just have this instance happen due to Kanto and Johto being next to one another?

      Thanks, glad you liked it :) I'm using the most diverse/modern incarnation of Kanto to tell the story in, which is HeartGold/SoulSilver's, where there's some overlap between Kanto/Johto pokemon and a rare few from Hoenn and Sinnoh show up, probably due to cross-region travel.

      So on [Bulbapedia's page on Viridian Forest](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Viridian_Forest), the chart titled Generation IV has the list I'm basing things off of.

  Curse you and your cliffhanger endings!  CURRRRRRSE YOUUUU!

  Having said that, I look forwards to seeing what comes next.  And I, for one, am quite interested in all the world details that are sprinkled in.

  Red's looking very eleven here. Entitled, self-centered, a bit unempathetic, that's a kid alright. Reminds me of why I hate children, which is arguably a good thing. He should be careful about thinking things like "I'd never do something like that." He's tempting the universe to dump him into a situation that forces the issue. It's easy for the utilitarian calculation to be one-sided...

  I like that the Dark thing is throwing Red for a loop. The universe is not giving up its secrets as easily as I initially feared, and Red will likely see all sorts of edge cases that just don't make sense. Have fun with that, professor. Now, how large a pot do you need to cook a three foot lobster built like a tree stump?

  With no mention of thunder, it seems the lightning is at least four kilometers away. Far enough away that our heroes are not in immediate danger, but close enough that they could be dealing with some minor threat one minute, and be at the heart of it all the next. Zapdos garners much respect, and I'm excited to see what it actually *does*.

    "Come on Crawdaunt, let's go to the bath and get you nice and clean!"

    Probably a bit unwieldy, but their size is probably why chopping them up is easier.

  I finished writing up my hypothesis regarding Normal type Pokemon and thought I'd share it. It is strongly dependent on some assumptions made regarding Ki and the intricacies of mental traits in general.

  >**What is "Normal"? - Strengths and Weaknesses**
  >
  >The so called Normal-type Pokemon, barring a few exceptions, seem to have baseline animal-like bodies with little inherent ability to convert energy into various specialized forms and channel it. In case they do have such abilities of channeling, it is generally not a direct part of their biology or body structure when not in use, thus not giving the related resistances and weaknesses.
  >
  >However, there are a few traits inherent to this "Normal" body structure. Namely, a weakness to "Fighting" type attacks and a complete immunity to "Ghost" type mental/empathic assaults.
  >
  >Depending on which theoretical explanation of the so called Fighting type one ascribes to, its strength towards Normal types can be explained in two ways:
  >
  >If it is just a question of instinct and skill in hand to hand combat then one could stipulate that the Normal's bio-typical body shows the expected weak points susceptible to such well placed strikes and maneuvers to a far greater extent than Pokemon with more "exotic" body structures.
  >
  >If one is to lend credibility to the Ki-theory it could be an inherent weakness to Ki-charged attacks, due to as of yet unexplored reasons. Something like an extensive but uncontrolled Ki-network that is missing or differently focused in body structures that evolved to control and convert all kinds of various energy forms maybe.
  >
  >Exploring the immunity to Ghost attacks is more tricky, due to the little knowledge we currently have regarding them and the differences between non-physical, also known as "mental", traits in general. Both traditional notions and expert testimonies consider Ghost attacks to target emotions as opposed to mental function. While the difference is not scientifically explainable as of yet I hypothesize that they both access the brain through different means and thus cause different effects on the targets perception.
  >
  >Let us hypothesize that the weakness of Normal Pokemon is purely Ki related and subsequently try to combine the two traits into one explanation. If Ki is a different form of non-physical attack delivered by physical touch (akin to Shadow Claw) then the Normal type weakness to it and immunity to Ghost attacks can be considered a mental trait. This would lead us to believe that maybe "Normal" is another purely "mental" type similar to Psychic and Dark and that, if not for the related mental traits, Normal type Pokemon could just as well be considered Untyped.

  Edit: Grammar and minor stuff.

  ***Footnote:*** The above purely concerns itself with Normal type *Pokemon* and with Fighting and Ghost type *attacks*. Damaging Normal attacks can be considered almost exclusively as being in the physical realm with "special" attacks of the type being either sound related or essentially untyped energy attacks. Similar but conversely the Ghost type defensively has a large physical component even though Ghost attacks are non-physical. But Ghost Pokemon and their highly paradoxical relation to physical attacks are a subject for a different time.

    I was going through this line by line and basically saying "bingo" and "spot on," so I decided to just scrap that and respond to the overall thing.

    This is a pretty solid explanation of what I've worked out.  In addition, there's some data to indicate that fighting pokemon can "see" life energy or "ki," which explains why they are especially effective against Rock and Steel pokemon that would presumably have defense to their strikes: they can detect the pokemon's weak points, and the force of their strikes at just the right place cause internal damage from the resonance, compounded more than it is with most other body types because of how hard the skin their organs are bouncing around in is.

    The relationship between Ki and ghosts is also pretty important, as Ghosts are utterly immune to it. It's hypothesized to be a level beyond the simple physical/mental divide, and of course many consider it "spiritual," but there does seem to be a straightforward physical connection at times.
