Are there any rational Voltron fanfics?

  I'd be surprised; at least on a setting level, Combining Mecha as a sci-fi element is *really difficult* to harden.

  As a counterexample, I've seen TTGL sometimes get a pass around here since, in-universe, Rule of Cool is literally a physical law expressed as a function of Determination. It's already rational, from a certain point of view.

  Without something similar to justify the cool stuff (sentient energy field that likes cats for some reason? Does the resistance value the PR and merchandising benefits of a brightly-colored hero-bot more than the costs of sub-optimal battleship design?) Voltron's premise runs into a *lot* of problems in the form of "why don't they just ____?" and to my knowledge no one's yet had the *actual* Determination to backfill that worldbuilding to even superficial Methods standards, let alone those of Pok√©mon: Origin of Species or R!Animorphs.

    this is one of those setting where an earlier age having a singularity, or at least a lot of lost tech, is a given. the lions are OLD, rediscovered technology. so rationally, they are using a weapon they dont fully understand and are unable to replicate. specifics depend on which version of the show we are talking about. 

    so you have a war with another planet, who can make giant monsters. and you have an old combining mecha in the basement that you can use... and oh hey, the princess is a replacement pilot for the 'dead' guy. 

    no, the least rational part is the mice. having their own episode. 

    from what i recall- the 5 lions get a force-field efect that makes it impossible to interrupt the combination sequence, but the activation of specific lions can be prevented (drain a lake). by comparison the 20+ vehicles version of voltron can have some parts prevented from combining, but the rest combined and the robot was missing that leg. the other version was 3 robots that make 1 robot... so yeah, version of voltron matters a lot.
