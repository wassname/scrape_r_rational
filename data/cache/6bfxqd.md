  In the opposite direction there's Tattletale from Worm, who's basically Sherlock Holmes if Doyle admitted that it's impossible. She has a superpower that lets her deduce things from insufficient evidence, and even evidence that she could gather but hasn't.

      That's kind of how all of Worm goes. 3 block radius arthropod control is *nuts*, but Taylor is a compelling character.
      ```

      - u/Kishoto:
        ```
        I disagree with that statement. I don't think her ability is all that nuts, in context of a fight. I think Taylor's just exceptionally gifted. I think she'd do much the same with any power that had any sort of battle application. Although I suppose we could then debate how much of that processing power she gets from her bugs contributes to said intelligence.

    No, no. The opposite is Dirk Gently.

  Perhaps *[The Einstein Paradox](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76261.The_Einstein_Paradox)* and *[Conned Again, Watson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1130873.Conned_Again_Watson)* would fit? You can find a comprehensive summary of the latter [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5w27a3/eduffrst_conned_again_watson_in_which_sherlock/).

  **Edit:** Greg Egan's ***Quarantine*** **([goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156775.Quarantine) | [TV Tropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Quarantine))** has a detective protagonist in a hard sci-fi setting; the plot focuses on his investigation [mild plot spoiler](#s " for the first part of the story, anyway").

  Among other things posted here, some *[Mongolian Wizard](http://www.tor.com/series/mongolian-wizard-stories-michael-swanwick/)* stories have detective elements.

    Aren't those two non-fiction? I have Conned Again on my to-read list already.

    Mongolian Wizard looks really cool and I'll definitely check out Greg Egan's quarantine.
    ```

    - u/Noumero:
      ```
      No? I don't think they are, according to u/ToaKraka's summary.

      Additionally, *[Tattletale Investigates](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/tattletale-investigates-worm-au.303094/)* is a well-written but discontinued *Worm* fanfiction in which Lisa avoids Coil and subsequently starts a detective agency instead of acting as a supervillain. Not, strictly speaking, what you asked for, but you may like it.

        I was under the impression that Conned Again tries to use Sherlock Holmes as a framing device to discuss logical inference but I could be mistaken, I haven't read it.

    Mongolian Wizard is excellent, thanks for mentioning it.  I eagerly await more of it, but it's been so long at this point that I suspect he's writing the rest for release all at once in some published collection.  Which is fair; he is a professional writer.

  There's a past thread on this about a series of children's stories, use the search function.

    ```
    I have used the search function and have come to the conclusion that this question hasn't been asked yet and even if it had been there could have been new stories out there.

      I wasn't saying that you were wrong to ask the question, just that this was one answer.

        Sorry, I think I interpreted the comment incorrectly.

          I was a bit terse, it was a fair interpretation.

            Can I just say that one thing I love about this sub is how this sort of text based miscommunication tends to end more amicably than pretty much anywhere else on reddit/the internet? :D

              Thanks for pointing that out. It is pretty awesome.

    Is that from "a practical guide to evil"? I haven't read it yet, is it any good?
    ```

    - u/MoralRelativity:
      ```
      Whoops... I can't believe I posted that to the wrong thread. Sorry about that...

      But, to answer your questions, yes it's from A Practical Guide to Evil and yes, I think it's pretty good. As usual I recommend reading the first 5 - 10 chapters and checking it out for yourself but here's some further thoughts & opinions to help you decide whether you want to give it a go:

      * It is definitely NOT rationalist Sherlock Holmes. No detective work. No deductions.
      * It is definitely NOT rationalist.
      * It's reasonably, but by no means completely, rational. The main characters are all intelligent in the way they gain and deploy resources to meet their objectives.
      * It does a good job of over-turning the classic good vs. evil cliche.
      * It's aimed at a young adult market so it's not overly complex. Reading it is more relaxing than taxing.
      * We're into Book 3 of (if I recall correctly) 5 or 6 books. The author has been very reliable in providing weekly updates.
      ```

  So after this thread has run it's course it looks like there isn't really anything out there, I am tempted to learn how to write stories purely to write one myself.
