## Looking for a rational-ish story I read once and then forgot the name of

### Post:

Sup.

A year or two ago I read this very strange story that was hosted on its own fancy-looking website, but I can't for the life of me find it anymore. I'm not sure I'd class it *exactly* as rational fiction, but it had a lot of hallmarks of the genre and the style of thinking was spot on. I don't remember anything with any precision so bear with me.

&#x200B;

So, what I remember of the story. First, it was pretty sexually explicit and heavily fetish-y, skirting the edge of smut, and in fact sex was a major theme. 

It began with a boy living in the suburbs, when he got transported somehow to some kind of shifted conceptual dimension where ideas and thoughts took some kind of form. So, with his religious family and the general repression of suburban culture around him, they manifested as some kind of unspeakable thought-monsters that tried to eat him. Of course, his fated succubus girlfriend (?) teleported in somehow to save him in the nick of time, and they had to get out of the suburbs due to the abundance of conceptual-repression-monsters. Or something like that. I'm leaving out a lot, of course. There's a lengthy chase scene as they escape the suburbs and things get weirder from there.

Much, much weirder. I think I started checking out when the succubus got transformed into a fleshlight and stored into his soul while being constantly penetrated by his soul-dick, or something. Then they go into the demon-world which is a post-scarcity (more accurately, never-scarcity?) utopia of pleasure, have a marriage ceremony, and I think I stopped reading around there.

 But I kinda wanna go back to it and take a look, it was so, so weird and depraved that it was interesting. The reason I say it's not quite exactly rational fiction is that I felt that the context and rules changed so fast and were so fluid that it didn't seem like rationalizing and reasoning things out was doing the main character much good, but still they went through the motions. It *felt* a lot like rational fiction, which is why I'm posting this here and not elsewhere.

Does anyone know what the HELL I'm talking about?

      It was not a joke? I was sure it was a joke.

        Insider knowledge: It wasn't a joke, and is [sort of] in keeping with western magical tradition for summoning spirits and so forth. There's as many magick-nerd details in there as there are techno-nerd details. It does sound pretty funny, I'll give you that.

  Yep, that is, as posted already, The Care and Feeding of Magical Creatures, by Siren Tycho (and pet), you can find it at sadehall dot tumblr dot com.

  More insider stuff: Yeah, it started as a slow burn rational-fic, but got banned from /r/rational for having too much sex and not enough plot. The author went on to explore a whole bunch of their own personal stuff while still staying geeky about it.

  There are rules, but it was pretty hard to figure out if you weren't following the thread on questionablequesting.
