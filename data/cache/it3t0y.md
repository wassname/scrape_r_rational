## Learning Languages

  Everything I've seen so far suggests that structured classroom learning (textbooks, explicit grammar study, tests, etc.) is absolutely useless for anything other than crystallizing what you already know. [Epistemic status: personal anecdotes], though.

  I've learned English *purely* via immersion, and without ever being in an English-speaking country or speaking to a native—only by consuming English media (TV, games, YouTube, internet) until I magically started to understand. The compulsory English lessons at school? Completely ignored, I spent the vast majority of the lessons sketching in my notebook or playing with my smartphone, never did any homework, and did everything on tests (including grammar) by intuition and what *felt* right. Still got one of the best grades in my class. And the classmates that were just as good, or better, than me? They learned the same way. The *only* classmate I remember that learned English the 'proper' classroom way, *without* immersing on the side, never amounted to anything despite being very dedicated and studious, and was pretty much one of the worst in class (only a bit better than those that neither studied nor immersed).

  I see this sentiment all over the place whenever the topic of ESL comes up on the internet—a *lot* of people learned English by watching shitty native YouTube videos all day purely for entertainment in their mid-late teens (so often beyond the famed super young age at which supposedly learning languages is far easier). I started probably somewhere around 14, and it took me like ~4-5 years of immersion to basically understand literally everything thrown my way. I never cared about speaking, so to this day I have a shitty accent and can't really talk without stuttering and grasping for words... but I'm literally more comfortable with *writing* in English than in my native language, and my inner monologue is pretty much all in English. And if I ever wanted to learn more, it wouldn't really be *language* learning anymore—I'd just practice speaking the same way a native would.

  After I became comfortable enough with English to pretty much consider it 'learned' (and yes, you do eventually reach that point—I hate the meme that you "never stop learning a language" and "will always find something you don't understand". It's technically true, but usually used as a weird defeatist-apologist statement for people who tried to learn something but failed), I just started applying the same principles to Japanese. No surprises here, considering the demographic of this sub and reddit in general, right? Anyway, I used Anki to memorize some vocabulary and half-heartedly breezed through a grammar guide to get some context (took like ~4 months), yes, but after that I just read shitty Japanese Light Novels one hour daily for a year and watched a ton of native YouTube and stuff like that. I'm still not fluent, obviously. I'd wager it will take me the same amount of time English took, so 4 or 5 years. But I can already pretty much read Light Novels with a dictionary on the side *for entertainment* and lose myself in the plot and character the same way when I read in English, so I don't really care. At this point, no matter what I do, so long as I keep consuming raw weeb stuff, I'll become fluent, so no worries about the efficiency or whatever. 

  All this stuff is widely known in the Japanese learning community in the form of AJATT and MIA (and Antimoon for English), but I still believe they overthink it *way* too much, what with their focus on being as optimal as possible, when it really doesn't matter that much. Like the /djt/ says, just read more. It really *does* work.

    I'm interested in what your level was when you started reading light novels. I'm currently learning Chinese and have a basic understanding of the grammar and know maybe 50 words. This seems clearly not enough to start reading something (I tried briefly but it really wasn't fun as I had to look up basically every word). So I'm wondering how many words I need to know.

    (Btw, concerning English pronunciation, this channel really helped me: https://www.youtube.com/c/rachelsenglish . In particular her series on the sounds of English. It *massively* improved my pronunciation. One of my goals was to be able to use speech recognition reliably and I can do that now.)

  I can't offer any learning resources, as really the only way to do it is dedicated study (and *really* the only way is immersion). I disagree with /u/CoffeeCakeGlaze that structured classroom learning is totally useless--I got pretty good at French by taking classes all through high school and college, though the HS classes really only provided bare fundaments and I didn't become truly fluent until I lived in France. Then again, my college French classes (even before studying abroad) essentially were immersion, as they were taught entirely in French and involved a good bit of discussion with classmates.  

  I guess I might suggest finding a tutor and/or discussion group, as I don't believe any piece of software will do the job.

  I do have some book recs though, both academic and fictional. These are more on the subject of linguistics and language in general rather than specific languages.

  * *The Stuff of Thought* by Steven Pinker explores two predominant theories about the neurological origin of language, and presents the author's hybrid model. Pinker is an excellent writer (and is taking some flak right now for what I think is a reasonable warning about "intellectual purity" gates in contemporary left-wing discourse).

  * *Women, Fire and Dangerous Things* by George Lakoff explores how different languages utilize categories, and how that usage shapes their worldview and brain structure. Discusses among other things color words and directional schema (i.e. absolute like our compass model vs. relative like a mountain-dwelling society's "upslope/downslope").

  * *The Flame Alphabet* by Ben Marcus is a novel about a man trying to figure out why children's speech has become toxic to adults. Not at all scientific, but rational in its own right--Marcus is an author who consistently writes books operating on bizarre, nightmarish rulesets that are only ever described partially or implicitly.

  * Bonus: [this excellent Radiolab episode](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/episodes/translation) about translation.

  > (This might be too off-topic given the only tangential mention of rational works, sorry if that is the case, but the general topic seems like something that the folks in this subreddit would be knowledgeable about if nothing else. I don't know the balance mods strive for between something meshing with the subreddit's theme and something meshing with the subreddit's community in determining what goes for its own thread or if it goes under one of the weekly megathreads)

  Monday Rationality or Friday Off-Topic.
