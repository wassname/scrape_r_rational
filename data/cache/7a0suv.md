  I really like this idea and will definitely check this book out, but I’m not setting my expectations too high since I rarely found his blog posts more insightful than articles written by economists. Not that I think economic analysis is an exact science, I’ve just studied it enough myself that I trust it as one of the lenses to view social structures through.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I liked his early LW Stuff more than I would like a blog post by most other people. (With possible exception of Scott Alexander). 

    That said I really hope he commissions an external editor and/or feedback from outside "the community." A lot of his stuff that could have been really great has been hampered by not being accessible to a broad audience

  Does anyone know a good German translation of "adequacy"? I'm tempted to go with "competence" as a stand-in, not least because "Inkompetenzanalyse" is snappy and directly understood.

  Edit: Zulänglichkeit?

  - u/RoggBiv:
    ```
    What about Adäquatheit? That's basically the literal translation.

    Source: am German, but there might be a better word for it still
    ```

    - u/FeepingCreature:
      ```
      Hab ich auf den ersten Blick erstmal als "Aquadiät" gelesen. :) Würde schon gehen, aber ich glaub Zulänglichkeit fließt besser.

      Ich hab meine Übersetzung auch erstmal liegen gelassen, in der Hoffnung dass Eliezer erstmal einen guten Redakteur findet.

  It sound to me that he's going to start advocating for agorism or something like it but more general; lots of game theory suggesting the existing system can't improve and he's not the type to just say "can't fix it" and his example is clearly working outside the system, a system that well respected to the general population.
  ```

  - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
    ```
    Nope.
    ```

    - u/monkyyy0:
      ```
      Hmmmm, where are you headed in this then?

      It is non-fiction spoilers are ok

        Dang it.

        ```
        > lots of game theory suggesting the existing system ~~can't improve~~ *isn't optimizing what you want it to optimize*

        The impression I get is that this is about better identifying which sorts of optimizations are incentivized or impeded by large scale systems.  This allows you to form better priors about the value of reasoning from first principles in a particular domain, and whether this is likely to yield an improvement in your optimization criteria over whatever group consensus is currently systemically supported.
        ```

        - u/monkyyy0:
          ```
          ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

          I may be projecting a little. I don't see "hope the people in charge are sane" as a solution, and hope that's not where he's going with this. Isn't this sort of thing already apparent to people inside the system? If knowledge of a problem was enough I would think even blind attempts to fix a poorly defined problem would eventually help.
          ```

          - u/LupoCani:
            ```
            > ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

            You have to write `¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯` for it to show as ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯. The first backslash escapes the second backslash, making it visible, and the third backslash escapes the underscores, which would otherwise just create italics around the face part:

            Input | Output
            :--:|:--:
            `¯\_(ツ)_/¯  ` | ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
            `¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ ` | ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
            `¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯` | ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
            ```

            - u/monkyyy0:
              ```
              ¯\_(ツ)_/¯\\
              ```

            - u/NNOTM:
              ```
              actually, you should write `¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯`. Otherwise, look what happens when you have italic text after the kaomoji:

              ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ is _shrugging_.

              Now with the extra backslash:

              ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ is _shrugging_.
              ```

              - u/LupoCani:
                ```
                Alright, that is one devious special case. Good to know.
                ```

              - u/ciphergoth:
                ```
                And to write ¯\\\\\\\_(ツ)\\\_/¯ you have to write ¯\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_(ツ)\\\\\\\_/¯. And to write _that_ I had to write... never mind.
                ```

                - u/LupoCani:
                  ```
                  `That's why you use *code tags* to get away with however many \backslashes\ you desire.`
                  ```

      ```
      Thanks for writing this book. I really like the questions being framed in the first two chapters, which is one of the biggest incentives for me in reading your work. BTW, do you benefit more if I pre-order from MIRI instead of Amazon for the same price? Sorry if this has been asked before.
      ```

      - u/EliezerYudkowsky:

        I actually have no idea, in this case.  My guess is we'd mainly want you to read the book in whatever format is most convenient to you.
        ```

        - u/VanPeer:
          ```
          Ok, just pre-ordered the MIRI download to incentivize you a bit more  to finish the book (if it isn't already).

      Quick question: the website says printed copies are available to pre-order off Amazon, but it looks like only the Kindle version is available at the moment. Are printed editions not actually planned/is the site in error?

          I believe the number of poeple eating enough is still increasing, while quality of life in the west is somewhat stagent that's a far cry away from radical unrecoverable decline.

          Crime rates are dropping golbally and while the supply chains for tech are of questionable stablity(percentage of electronics that touch Shenzhen are a little worrying) it's not like we couldn't restart.

          Things look bad compared to what we want not to what they were.

          - u/wren42:
            ```
            There are three major factors I'm considering when predicting future collapse (unless major changes to our civilization occur)

            1) Climate Change

            This is a big problem.  Pretty much all scientists agree major problems are in store, yet governments and industry are not responding quickly enough.  There will be disruption to our food supply and environmental stability unless drastic changes occur, which appears unlikely. 

            2) Resource consumption

            The world is already over consuming both renewable and non-renewable natural resources.  As india and china continue to industrialize, this is expected to increase.  

            http://www.overshootday.org/

            https://www.ecowatch.com/humans-consumption-of-earths-natural-resources-tripled-in-40-years-1943126747.html

            Global consumption behaviors will have to change dramatically to reach equalibrium.  With population continuing to rise, this means restricted access to goods overall.  

            3) Economic inequality and the AI revolution 

            It doesn't matter if we are wealthy if most people don't have access to that wealth. Inequality in wealth distribution is growing dramatically.  The most likely outcome of the coming AI revolution is a dramatic shift in power away from the labor class and toward the capital class.  When automation reaches the remaining blue and white collar jobs and human labor is devalued, the current economic system of producer-consumer breaks down.  The capital class will for the first time not need the masses at all.  Without policy intervention, the outcome of this is widespread unemployment and poverty.   Surviving this for most people, unless some sort of UBI system is established, will come down to building small self-sustained agro communities, as I suggested above.
            ```

              Climate change is going to cause migration and starvation.

              Some things are going to be more expensive.

              > Inequality in wealth distribution is growing dramatically.

              [Currently false.](https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality/)

              I agree the things you talk about are problems or potential problems, but we're not going to reach a stage where most of the remaining humans live in small self-sustained agro communities unless there are some major pandemics or nuclear wars.

              > 1) Climage Change

              > This is a big problem

              Unlikely. Changes are likely to be slow enough for the economies to adapt to in real time. My priors suggest that models saying otherwise are bogus.

              > 2) Resource consumption

              You do realize we're currently trying to bootstrap a sustainable economy by exploiting the existing non-resources, right? This is something that always needed to happen. As non-renewable resources are exhausted, the economy will naturally shift to using the now-cheaper renewable options.

              > 3) Economic inequality and the AI revolution

              > the outcome of this is widespread unemployment and poverty

              Unlikely. Much has been written on this topic. What happened to all the weavers and bakers and blacksmiths? The fact that blue-collar workers in first-world countries use technology on a continual basis kinda means what it means to be part of the "masses" has changed dramatically. Expect more of the same in the future.

              As you say, and I agree, the most likely outcome will be a guaranteed minimum income. Since we already have various welfare and social security programs, replacing these programs with a UBI will be pretty straightforward. This is already being discussed at all levels. I think it's still a bit early, but we'll see. This will probably be paired with various forms of population control.

              The real trick will be to modernize those parts of the world that are resistant to modernization.

              ```
              Climate change will not kill the first world because the first world currently spends so laughably low a percentage of its productive output on food production that shifting to a basis of "Storm-proofed greenhouses, so many armored-up greenhouses" would do bugger-all to the overall economic sustainability. That scene from bladerunner 2047? Like that.

                  ```
                  Its not fine. But the specific scenario I see a lot "And then everyone starves to death", basically cannot happen, because it presumes no response to a deteriorating situation at all, and learned helplessness is not *that* powerful. You would need a "and then, global thermo-nuclear war" in there somewhere.

                Also matters very much to a lot of sea organisms, many of which are carefully calibrated to the pH of the ocean, which gets lower as the water gets warmer. Both those sea creatures and frogs are part of delicate and complex ecologies, the collapse of which would mean starvation for at least many developing nations.
                ```
