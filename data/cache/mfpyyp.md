## A Hero's War by jseah CHP 123

### Post:

I can't believe it's not pudding. But I also can't believe this updated, I refreshed the page on near daily basis, as well as some other fics (cough Saga cough of Soul) but here it is, finally after all this time, at last, at the dawn of our battle, at the height of my power, etc etc.
Anyway Imma go read it first then see if it's any good
 
EDIT: 

Apparently I also forgot to put the link in, lol

  I have completed the reading of the chapter and have come to tell you all the results.

  It's ok I guess. One major complaint is that sometimes it is hard to tell from whose viewpoint the story is being told, at the beginning mostly switches between previously established Mimnay people from where our main protag is coming from, and the new Northerner Lands commander.

  A minor refresher as to what is happening in story with all the plot threads and all the characters would be neat too.

  I personally felt that this failed to be rational in at least one major way as the tech uplifting the mc does is through ideas that should have occurred already.
  I only read til a little after the major battle at the fort though.
