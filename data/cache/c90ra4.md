## Villain or Amoral Protagonist

### Post:

Most rational stories — and especially rationalist — stories feature protagonists that would generally be considered heroes. I'm bored of that, and want something a little different. After all, rationality isn't inherently a force for good. It's a competence multiplier, and can serve any motivations. I'd prefer protagonists who would be considered evil/immoral (but psychologically realistic villains and not psychopath caricatures) or are amoral as both offer differing motivations that I think would make for an interesting story.

Rational stories preferred, bonus points if it's rationalist, but if no rational(ist) stories fit the bill, I'll take other stories as well as long as the MC is psychologically realistic.

I've read and loved [The Metropolitan Man](https://fictionhub.io/story/the-metropolitan-man/). It fits the bill (anyone looking for something like this should check it out).

  [Bird's of a Feather](https://archiveofourown.org/works/15996890/chapters/37322936), Tom Riddle hasn't done anything too heinous yet, but he would if the opportunity and incentives presented themselves. Beware, this is a very slow burn.

  [Weaver Nine](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/weaver-nine-worm-fanfic-au.289395/) : Jack Slash and Taylor occupy each other's canon positions in the story, Jack is still a psychopath. I think it should be noted that despite the synopsis of this story, its primary focus is  >!a big Endbringer Fight!<.

    Note that *Weaver Nine* is abandoned (didn't the author die or vanish or something?). It ends with the first arc wrapped up, but it was clearly a first arc.

    Haven't read worm, didn't read Harry Potter (read HPMOR but generally don't read other HP fanfiction). How much canon knowledge is needed?
    ```

    - u/RedSheepCole:
      ```
      Worm itself at least partially fits the OP's request; Taylor isn't amoral per se, but often makes terrible, terrible decisions due to her limitations, and these in turn force her down a very dark road.  Also, it's frickin' incredible.  I read all million and a half words in something like two weeks.  It pretty well consumed my life.

      Been awhile since I read weaver nine so I'm not sure. I don't think you need canon knowledge at all for Bird's of a Feather, it covers everything.

      If you haven't read worm then hit that. Then you can read all the fanfics you want!

  Not sure I'd call the Lex Luthor in Metropolitan Man amoral. >!He's trying to save the world from Superman, after all!<

    I meant as a villain.

      He's technically a villain but I don't think he's evil.
      ```

      - u/DragonGod2718:
        ```
        I don't really believe in evil, but I think many psychologically realistic villains wouldn't be considered evil for what it's worth.

      Yes, he's technically the villain of that story.

  Haven't read them myself, but from what I've heard, I think the Thrawn books (Star Wars Universe) should fit.

  To scratch The Metropolitan Man itch: [Lex Luthor Triumphant](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8700173/1/Lex-Luthor-Triumphant) by GuapoMendez. 

  For more DC universe: [A Better Class of Criminal](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-better-class-of-criminal-dc-si.394632/) is more funny than rational. Follows a self-inserted, slightly insane villain in post-apocalyptic Gotham. He runs for mayor obviously. If that wasn't enough, he has Moriarty in his head.

  [The Iron Teeth](http://www.ironteethserial.com) a rationalist story by /u/dsraider. Follows a morally oblivious goblin who can't understand why any action against his own or his master's interest might be wrong.

  [Harry's Madness](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1534683/1/Harry-s-Madness) by SilverLocke980. What if Harry snapped and become darkness that rivals Voldemort himself.

  [The Luck of Barry Lyndon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Luck_of_Barry_Lyndon) by William Makepeace Thackeray (love this name). If you are not a fan of 1800s writing, then at least watch [Kubrick's amazing adaption](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072684/). While the roguish narrator remains unreliable, he made him more sympathetic.

  [Lolita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolita) by Vladimir Nabokov. A well-liked and charming man marries a woman doesn't sound villainous at all. You've been duped, he was a pedo all along. There is a reason we don't meet young Adolfs or young Lolitas on the street anymore. This book is the reason for the latter. It was also [adapted by Kubrick](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056193/).

  [The Prague Cemetery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prague_Cemetery) is Umberto Eco's attempt to write the most despicable character he can. Follows a racist, misogynistic spy and a forger who deals with his political opponents and participates in nineteenth-century Europe events.

  This short story may not fit perfectly, but I'll include it nonetheless: A Study in Emerald by Neil Gaiman. No link here. Better to go blind. Trust me.

  [The Lies of Locke Lamora](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29588376-the-lies-of-locke-lamora) and the Gentleman Bastard Series by Scott Lynch. Ocean's 11 in medieval times. While probably rationalist, I read them for the banter.

  I've been reading [Awaken Online](https://www.amazon.com/Awaken-Online-Catharsis-Travis-Bagwell-ebook/dp/B01J0E8Z8A), a story about a full dive vr mmo - I've been listening to the audiobook and would definitely recommend it. MC is literally a necromancer king in his own kingdom by the end of the first book. He might not necessarily be evil - but the rest of the world treats him like a villain, he regularly commits virtual mass murder, ritualistic murder and psychological warfare. Later in the story >!he's even put on unofficial trial in the real world for it.!< Lot's of political intrigue and diving into the mechanics of the magic and the world, not very deeply but definitely enough to tickle that munchkinry trope, >!at one point the game nerfs him and his abilities specifically because he exploited it so bad.!<

  So far (past a thousand translated chapters now), I've wholly enjoyed Gu Zhenren(/'Master of Gu'/'Gu Daoist Master'/'Reverend Insanity').  Fang Yuan is basically this, live-forever-or-die-trying, and with no moral qualms about the rest of reality (while also not being malevolent-for-its-own-sake).

  (Note that Timeless Leaf has about 50 translated chapters of the manhua adaptation.)

  I'm guessing you're already aware of A Practical Guide to Evil?

  - u/DragonGod2718:
    ```
    Am aware, don't consider Cat a villain protagonist. An absolutely terrible anti hero? Plausibly, but not a villain.
    ```

    - u/LLJKCicero:
      ```
      I think it's sort of mixed: I don't think even an anti hero would generally, say, crucify a couple hundred people as punishment/as a warning to others. I think she strays into villainous territory like that occasionally, though you're right that she 'means well' in a more heroic kind of manner a lot of the time.

  The comic *Irredeemable* did, in my never humble opinion, a far better job than *Watchmen* in portraying what happens when a superhero gets disillusioned in the world and starts pursuing his own agenda.

    It's about as non-rational as a story can get though, fair warning. 

    Also meanders and drags (into a terrible ending). It feels like the author didn't have a clear story in mind, they just kept writing until someone made them stop.

        I'm afraid I won't be able to be very specific. It's been a while; I remember the overall impression it left on me more than the details.

        It wasn't made clear what various powers could actually do, or what powerful entities or factions existed in the setting. So there was a regular stream of deus ex machina, and you'd never know in advance whether a plan was likely to work.
        ```

        - u/DaystarEld:
          ```
          Gotcha. What stuck with me was people seeming to have realistic reactions to things, and that they explained Not-Superman's actual powers, and then a great justification for why the resident genius hero never figured it out.
          ```

            ```
            It's possible the negative feelings I had about the ending tainted my memories of the rest of the work. On reading the Wikipedia plot summary, it doesn't seem too bad.
            ```

            - u/DaystarEld:
              ```
              Yeah, I can see that happening :) I didn't hate the ending, I thought it was cute in a way, but yeah it was clearly nonsensical. Didn't impact my enjoyment mostly because it didn't feel like it mattered to the story at all. Like you could tear out the last couple pages or whatever of every copy and no one would notice, they'd just assume it ended more ambiguously.
