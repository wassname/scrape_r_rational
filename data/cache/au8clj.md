  ```
  “The only thing known to go faster than ordinary light is monarchy, according to the philosopher Ly Tin Wheedle. He reasoned like this: you can't have more than one king, and tradition demands that there is no gap between kings, so when a king dies the succession must therefore pass to the heir instantaneously. Presumably, he said, there must be some elementary particles -- kingons, or possibly queons -- that do this job, but of course succession sometimes fails if, in mid-flight, they strike an anti-particle, or republicon. His ambitious plans to use his discovery to send messages, involving the careful torturing of a small king in order to modulate the signal, were never fully expanded because, at that point, the bar closed.” -- Terry Pratchett, _Mort_.

    I especially like how what must be several hours of thought, work, and effort for one writer is but the off-hand commentary of another.

      We don't know how long Pterry spent on that in the pub. :)

- u/RynnisOne:
  ```
  If your 'Moral Transmitter' requires the deaths of millions of sapient creatures to send a *single* binary bit, you **may** want to re-think your entire morality system.
  ```

    ```
    But if it were ftl you could use it to send messages back in time so it could be worth it .  
    Also the lizard people might have different moral preferences and not especially care about other sapient species.
