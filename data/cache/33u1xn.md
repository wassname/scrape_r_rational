  This story continues to be amazing. Vidre is a fantastic / fantastically intimidating character, and that conversation about redemption arcs etc was fascinating. Very /r/rational, as can be expected. I look forward to seeing more of Clarissa Fiscella, and more of this fic in general!

  Oh neat, rational storytelling for more power, with cost benefit calculations and planing. That's greatastic. 

  Just noticed use of Italian words for some terms, I assume for sake of exotic writing, but why really? 

  Also pretty ship is pretty, if a bit cramped for space, no magic for that?

    There doesn't seem to be much "structural" magic. Everything we've seen so far has been more along the lines of command of a concept in the moment, rather than long-term alteration of that concept. Add the fact that you have to be famous to use magic, and the possibility of "backstage" magic is reduced to feats of illustrati with the time, inclination, domain, and reputation - magic Da Vinci, if you will. I'm not even sure what kind of domain would let you do structural magic - maybe simply a labour-saver such as metal or wood to make prototyping trivial.

    I assume all fictional cities are Venice if I have any kind of reason to at all. So it's only natural that they speak Italian.

  We know it's you Mr. Sanderson, stop pretending.

  >“Corta?” asked Vidre. They’d spent the last nine days in Gennaro, and while Corta had memorized a flurry of names, that hadn’t been one of the ones that stuck. “Who is that?”

  Should the second Corta not be Vidre?

  This is fantastic. The week between updates is going to be long!

  ```
  This is a *great* setting for a fantasy/superhero hybrid RPG, and "fame" could be an explicit in-world substitute for the out-world concept of XP. Looking forward to more!
