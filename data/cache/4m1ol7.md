## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  In building my own world, I give little nods when I know where ideas came from. Since coming up with names for everything is literally the most difficult thing in the universe, I often slap a borrowed name on such things as well, even when I end up with an idea that is very different from where the inspiration came from. And getting the reference is never anywhere near expected or necessary. But that said, I imagine (If I ever get shit finished) that readers will still go 'oh hey, event/name/location abc seems to be a reference to work xyz, hey maybe there's a twist coming related to abc similar to what happened in xyz'. And usually that's correct, even if the details are different. The seemingly throwaway royal guard who shares a name with the poor guard in The Three Musketeers does indeed go on to be manipulated into assassinating his lord for the woman he loves, and the ancient ruin full of lava that shares a name with a video game location does indeed turn out to have a hidden connection to a source of evil creatures.

  But, not everything is meant to be a reference, and there are only so many different names and terms I can think of. So reading *Berserk* for the first time, as much as I love the manga and will probably end up pilfering a few ideas from it, I learned yesterday that my most noble, loyal and well intentioned general who is also a close friend of the main character shares a title and rare hair colour with a Berserk character who is a noble, loyal and well intentioned general who is also a close friend of the main character. Right up until [Berserk spoiler](#s " he betrays everyone and becomes the main villain"), which doesn't happen in my world. The similarity is complete coincidence, but now I want to leave it in just to troll everyone who picks up on me giving similar meta clues in other cases.

  ...This is not really a 'problem that needs to be worked through'. I just thought the worldbuilding thread was a reasonable place to mention it. Does anyone else derive joy from the idea of trolling their readers?

    I love that. I also like it when the main characters end up killing themselves off with their dumb actions. [For Example: ](#s "Light in Death Note gets so full of himself he considers himself God, and ends up dying because of his pride/conceit. ") In fact, I wish it would happen a little more often. Characters a lot of the time are given the golden ticket to life when they should be dying for their idiocy, etc.

    It's always funny when you bump into coincidences like that. Not too long ago I was writing a rules post for my quest, and I picked a couple of random names for the people in the examples. I showed this to one of my co-GMs to get a go / no-go on whether it should become officially sanctioned.  That worthy read through it and said "Why are my parents fighting ninja?"  Apparently I picked zirs parents' names out of thin air.

  I have a ritual magic system that needs some inspecting (if not work). Spells consist of:

  * Ritual: The things you do.
  * Sacrifice: The thing you give up.
  * Intent: What you're trying to do.

  If you're missing any one of those elements, the spell silently fails. A typical spell can be rigidly described like this:

  * This spell cures gout. Place the patient within a circumscribed pentacle drawn on the ground, light a black candle nearby, then slit the throat of a chicken no older than 22 weeks. This spell must be done outdoors under a full moon on a cloudless night.

  Or:

   * This ritual creates a pocket of breathable air that surrounded the practitioner, which lasts for a single hour. Find a man with at least seven living trueborn sons. Mark his incisors with the medium of your choice. Suffocate or drown him. Remove a marked tooth and crush it beneath the heel of your left foot. Both incisors can be used in this way.

  Rituals tend to only care whether you've met the minimum. If you light two black candles instead of one, the ritual will still work fine. If the ritual calls for a drop of blood and you supply a gallon, that works fine too. Overdoing it doesn't make the ritual more powerful. Some rituals are dead simple, while some are quite complex. Only one spell per sacrifice, but you can reuse your ritual components. (Spells are arbitrated by spirits, but that's a whole different thing. Assume that cheesing definitions isn't low-hanging fruit and there's no way to ask the spirits what it is they want.)

  I *think* this segregates out into two different classes of wizardly activity. The first are wizards who just use known rituals, and the worldbuilding impact of those is dependent mostly on what the rituals are capable of doing (but there are a lot of rituals, too many to enumerate here).

  The second are wizards who are hunting new spells. They would naturally try to cast as wide a net as possible; if you know that rituals often involve lighting a candle, you would light one for trial and error, since there's never a penalty. Because candle color, scent, and wick all matter, you would light lots and lots of candles all at once. Because you know that inscribed and circumscribed shapes matter, you would probably put them all over the place. Because you don't know the threshold of the sacrifice, you would probably overdo it some, spilling lots of blood. They would try to intend as many things as possible while doing the spell.

  Once they found a spell that worked, they would dutifully write down all the circumstances, then either work at narrowing down the *actual* requirements, or just using it as it was done the first time.

    > This spell cures gout. Place the patient within a circumscribed pentacle drawn on the ground, light a black candle nearby, then slit the throat of a chicken no older than 22 weeks. This spell must be done outdoors under a full moon on a cloudless night.

    Let's consider the amount of effort that has to go into figuring out this one. For a start, it's completely impossible to do it by accident - the intent actually *has to* be there. (How someone figured out the *first* ritual is an open question)

    > Place the patient within a circumscribed pentacle

    How many alternatives are there?

    - Place the patient *outside/near to/under/over/(north/east/west/south) of* a *regular polygon with X sides/other well-defined shape/irregular shape*

    > drawn

    *carved/molded out of (claylike substance)/laid out in (stringlike substance)/imagined*

    > on the ground

    on *a table/a rock/dirt/tile/concrete/the wall/paper*

    > light a black candle nearby

    (Vast numbers of different colour object, non-candle objects, and locations could be placed here)

    > then

    (ah, so order is important? The candle has to some first?)

    > slit the throat

    (body parts other than the throat? Destruction by other means, e.g. fire?)

    >  of a chicken

    (other animals?)

    > no older than 22 weeks

    (older/younger is another bit of uncertainty, and the 22-week figure is probably a good six or seven more bits)

    >  outdoors  full moon  cloudless night

    Okay. So, then, considering those requirements: an early guess as to a useful spell will involve putting a suffering patient on the specially prepared Testing Floor (consisting of dozens of shapes, all over the place, in a variety of mediums, colours, and shapes) The testers will then carefully light all of close on a hundred candles, then carefully extinguish them all, then activate a great variety of other things (honking horns, juggling, blowing whistles, etc.) - a process which may take a few hours.

    Then the sacrifice. A small animal is destroyed in virtually every way; cut through every major organ, stabbed, beheaded, set alight and burned to ash.

    *Then*, just in case the secondary action needs to take place *after* the sacrifice, all the candles are re-lit (and re-extinguished), the horns are re-honked, whistles are re-blown, and so on. (And then all of this will still fail if it is done indoors, or if the Moon is wrong). In the ritual in question, there are a few elements; the age of the chicken, the inside/outside question, the cloudless sky, and the full moon - that are hard to try more than one of at once. (Apparently a chicken can, in theory, live up to about a dozen years, though it's rare. So, let's assume the median chicken, not slaughtered for meat, lives up to six years; and only for 22 weeks is it suitable, which would be about 7% of the chicken's life - let's say about four bits of uncertainty. Then the sky - let's assign two bits for different levels of cloudiness. The Moon - full, waning gibbous, half, waning crescent, new, waxing crescent, half, waxing gibbous - that's eight clear states, so another three bits. Indoors/outdoors is one bit. So, ten bits of uncertainty at least; even with the procedure described above, the odds of finding the spell are no better than one in a *thousand*. And that's before considering whether it *has* to be a chicken.)

    And you never, ever, find a ritual that doesn't do exactly what you intended it would do.

    --------------

    What I'm getting at is that, for the second class of wizard - the new-spell-hunters - finding a single new spell can be expected to be the culmination of *years* of trying anything and everything (and cost hundreds of chickens, puppies, kittens, and so forth along the way). Now, it might be that there are actually hundreds of spells that cure gout - and it's merely a matter of coincidence which one a researcher runs across first - but, be that as it may, the knowledge of a spell (especially one that's been properly pared down to its base components) is going to be an *incredibly* valuable piece of information. Most research wizards would have good reason to be wary of spell thieves (they'd probably keep their notes in code, at the very minimum) and a new spell - especially a new *useful* spell - could probably be sold for quite a bit (though a cunning wizard might rather opt to sell his spellcasting *services*, casting the spell for a fee, secure in the knowledge that no-one else will be able to figure it out for several years - perhaps even using sleight-of-hand to hide a few crucial parts of the spell if he suspects he's being observed. Imagine being the only person who knows how to cure gout...)
    ```

  - u/Rhamni:
    ```
    Is there any pattern as to what kind of effect you get based on the spell? If so, you could at least choose which general area of magic you wanted to research new spells in.

    Also, how exact does the Intent need to be? Can you just slap "For enemies" on there, or do you need to repeat spell research over and over again with slight variations in guesses as to which kind of zombie your dread ritual might raise?
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      I've been struggling with how intent actually works. You can't just have a generic "do stuff" that satisfies any result, but you don't need to be extremely specific. How about ... you don't need to specify magnitude, duration, direction, or range, if any apply. But you do need to get fairly close to the actual effect; if the spell cures the causes and symptoms of gout, then "cure gout" works, or "cure the ailment that's causing joint pain", but simply "cure any ailments" would be too broad.

      (If someone has a formalization for this, I would appreciate it, but there's an arbitrating authority in the form of spirits, so it's not entirely necessary.)

      The system also, *should* work such that you can chain multiple effects together, so long as one of them is the correct one. In other words "cure gout, cure chlamydia, cure bone cancer" would work even if the spell only cures gout. The practitioner is then limited by how many things they can intend to do at once.
      ```

  - u/Dwood15:
    ```
    Interesting. I like how you buffer failure with the 'ritual silently fails' - instead of having a more FMA-style "you lost your limbs, and your brother's body has been absorbed".

    Are there limits on how small the smallest spell can be? If I was a mage I would be interested in researching the effects of smaller and smaller rituals and seeing if I could get a combinations of small rituals into a large effect. Or could I sacrifice the results of one ritual to feed another?
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      The smallest spell I currently have in the book requires the user to draw a circle with a drop of blood, which gives a preternatural sense of where people are for a few minutes. Generally speaking, strength of the spell correlates to power, with the weakest possible sacrifice being something like a pinch of salt or a strand of hair.

      I think there's probably no way around going through and compiling a list of spells that appear in the book, but that doesn't seem terribly fun.
      ```

      - u/Dwood15:
        ```
        Are you using rules behind the spells or are you "hardcoding" them? ie mistborn vs DND?

        - u/alexanderwales:
          ```
          Hardcoded. I do love emergent systems, but part of the feel I'm going for is arcane inscrutability and lost or corrupted knowledge.
          ```

  - u/Chronophilia:
    ```
    Is there any way of discovering / creating new spells other than by guesswork? 
    I thought Unsong covered that pretty well, with its sweatshops of workers reading out candidate spells to find the one-in-a-billion that works.

    Is it possible to cast several spells at once - for example, if you have a spell whose sacrifice component is "spill a drop of blood", and you spill a thousand drops of blood, could you use that to cast the spell a thousand times over? If you manage to satisfy the requirements for two distinct spells at once (bearing in mind that each sacrifice can only fuel one spell), could you cast them simultaneously? Could there be a ritual that everyone thinks is a single spell but is actually casting three or four spells whose requirements overlap?
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      Yeah, Unsong basically sunk another project of mine, which had magical factories full of wizards saying different permutations of syllables as a major plot point. That's 55K words down the drain ... here the guesswork isn't very much part of the plot, since this type of magic is illegal and most individual practitioners don't have the resources to test permutations over and over, even if they can narrow their parameters down.

      But yes, it's very possible for practitioners to be confused about what their spell(s) are actually doing, and some spells can multicast in a way that makes it seem like it's a single spell that depends on quantity.

  If you haven't noticed I'm using this thread to continue my thoughts about my stories. I don't know if I'll ever put the pen to the paper, so if any of my posts inspire a short story or anything, please let me know.

  I've thought a lot about last week's weekly building thread, especially the 'wishing hour' thought, and I've decided utter chaos would erupt which may or may not cause the destruction of life as we know it in an [XK-class Reality-Ending scenario](http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-234197). 

  Now, I'm not a big fan of stuff like that, so I've thought about this. A period of time where items become enchantable with magic power. Any physical object during this 'wishing hour' can gain some magical property based on a persons wish. For example, a kid wearing a super man out fit wishes he could become super man. Well, because he wished that, any time he wears the super man costume his mom bought him at the store, he gains the power of superman. Same with practically any person who wishes that during wishing hour 

  This enchanting needs the following rules to be met in order for the enchanting to work:

  1) A moderately direct and specific wish. "I wish I was good looking" wouldn't work, non-specific. 

  2) On that note, there is a maximum number of words for a wish. No enchantment can take more than approximately 30 or so words, or 180 characters, whichever is least.

  3) Specific wishes can be spoken or unspoken. Less specific wishes must be spoken.

  4) The affected item doesn't have any concept of ownership. (Anyone grabbing the enchanted device can use it)

  5) The wish cannot affect free will directly. Perhaps a person could wish that everyone would understand the beauties inherent in Marxism, and a nearby paper becomes enchanted with memetic qualities, which transfer Marxism and the desire for everyone to understand it, but that doesn't make the person want Marxism or begin to advocate the people rising up and taking control of the means of production. At the least, if everyone were infected by that enchanted piece of paper, they would end up more knowledgeable.

   Thoughts about these rules? Too easy to break? Too rigid? Not clear?
  ```

  - u/scruiser:
    ```
    So I read your post from last world building Wednesday, and I really liked the response that mentioned you should start from clear cut limits instead of trying to cover all the loopholes of unlimited wishes.

    These rules are a good start, but I think I already see some loopholes and possible additional things to cover, if you want to avoid a CK class event in story that is.

    > 2) On that note, there is a maximum number of words for a wish. No enchantment can take more than approximately 30 or so words, or 180 characters, whichever is least.

    I don't think that will help much against the smartest people that figure out the process earliest in the hour.  A bunch of separate items with direct and specific, but general usage and flexible wishes would still be really OP.  Maybe to balance this, people are limited in how many wish items they can use at once? (Unless you are going for a CK class scenario).  Otherwise, someone wishes for a bunch of interacting intelligence enhancements, which would give them the thought power to get even more efficient intelligence enhancing wishes until they reach whatever limit their is/go insane/ thinker headaches like in worm.  They then use their intelligence to ask really effective wishes and basically dominate the setting afterwards.

    >  4) The affected item doesn't have any concept of ownership. (Anyone grabbing the enchanted device can use it)

    Whoever made wishes related to stealing/taking things and/or finding magic items becomes a God.  They use their initial item stealing enchanted objects to steal more wish items, which makes them more powerful/intelligent, which they can then in turn use to steal more.  This also ties into the need to limit how many items a person can use at once.  Maybe have the enchanted items be weaker for other people besides the wisher?  Or have the fate/luck/other phenomena tend to redirect them back to the original wisher unless freely given or something like that.  Otherwise you will have runaway power grabs going on.

    > The wish cannot affect free will directly.

    Does this include the wisher themselves?  Might be a way to nerf intelligence items and other mind boosting runaway sequences.  Their attempts to boost their intelligence are stopped because anything more than moderate intelligence boosts or very specific abilities would otherwise alter their personality.

    > Well, because he wished that, any time he wears the super man costume his mom bought him at the store, he gains the power of superman. 

    If wishes can grant up to that power level, they are going to be majorly OP.  People who wished for multi-function power sets would basically be gods...  To nerf... maybe the kid just gets generic flying brick powers that are much more limited?  (Unless XK/CK reality ending scenario is the intended plotline)

    Other limits you should consider:

    * How does the hour affect things globally?  If it is the same hour all at once across the world, people in some regions are going to be sleeping and this will upset the balance of power majorly (and you are trying to avoid world ending scenarios?).  How about for each person the hour starts whenever noon is for them... hmm but then later time zones would have the advantage of the earlier time zones experience, skewing things as well.  What if it is the same hour globally, and people mysteriously woke up at the start of the hour?  Might tip some people off...  Maybe magic stops the spread of information initially?  Or the items are weaker until the hours has finished.  Or the hours occur randomly different for each person within a 12 hour period, so not enough time for the information to spread.  Or let the chips fall where they may and write about the global consequences.

    * Can enchanted objects make more magic.  Like if someone wished for an item that can empower other items would that work?  Or if they wished for more generic magic power... lets say Harry Potter style wizard powers into a wand, could they use that wand to breed magical creatures and plants, then use the parts from those creatures and plants to make another wand.  I do have an idea for balance and a way for this to tie into an overarching scientific investigation plotline...  The magic is limited in conceptual priority by extent that is had been replicated from the original item.  So in my HP wand example its possible to make more wands, but they will always, no matter what, be weaker than the original wand.  If they are matched against an "original" enchanted item (i.e. not derived from another item, from the original wishing hour itself) the original item will always beat the derived item, unless conceptual/elemental rock paper scissors heavily favors the derived item.  For example, the superman cape kid can resist all of the knock-off wands, even if someone tried casting an AK on him, however a spell to transfigure kryptonite would weaken him, even if done with a knockoff wand.  Also, for further balance and/or to limit munchkin, deriving items weakens the original to some extent.

    * Overall, it could be an issue if magic is getting stronger and stronger from items interacting with each other and bootstrapping into stronger magical effects/items. i.e. imagine a Dresdenverse wizard interacting with derived items created with Harry-Potter magic, which in turn are utilized by someone who had Nasu-verse mage style powers.  Eventually you would get runaway reality warping that dominates the rest of reality.  Conversely, if there was no way to derive more magic, and the enchanted items didn't get any durability or such, then there would be the underlying worry that they would stop working or otherwise fail.  What happens when the last healing item breaks after hospitals and doctors and pharmaceutical companies have come to rely on them?  You could create a balance where attempting to break an item just causes its magic to spread out further and strengthen other items.  So the Harry Potter wand becomes able to do more spells as other items are broken and their enchantment passes on.  In between this and the derived item limit, this could create a long-term balance in the level of magical power in the world.  Older items that are protected and conserved slowly gain in power as other items are broken or used to derive more but weaker items, until those preserved items are eventually brought into use or broken themselves.

    * Figuring out all the limits of magic and the rules could be a long-term plot point, or a background detail exploited in clever ways, depending on if you set your story during or well after the wishing hour.

    * Going off the Harry Potter wand example and the superman example, for another possible nerf, wishing to be a wizard/witch/mage/super hero doesn't grant you their full power set, it just grants you the most prominent abilities/powers as you think of the wish.  So the wand could maybe do patronous, expliarmous and stupefy and a few transfigurations, but not use the more obscure abilites, like the enchanting used to create items/breed magical creatures that was done off-screen.  The superman cape gets flight and durability, but not  the freeze breath or the laser vision unless the kid was specifically thinking about them in association with superman also (and maybe the flight and durability are weaker as a result of splitting the wish into so many functions).  This would also limit runaway interaction of magic items.

    * I think enchanted items need some kind of limit on implied information processing, otherwise you get strong AI in an item, or just a few combination of items.  Even just someone wishing for an item that would give them answers about wishes would be really OP.  (Then you could ask the item for some reality-breaking combination of items to wish for.)  Maybe the implied free will limits prediction/precog items to large scale extrapolation of human behavior and strictly natural phenomena.  (Predict a hurricane precisely, but only get a general probability for a terrorist attack)

    Let me know what you think.  I can elaborate on any of these ideas if they sound good are useful to you.  Also, it might help if you have plot/characters, and you go back and solidify the rules after thinking about the direction for them.  Hmm... I've got a few snippets in mind about the first people trying to test/exploit their magic items, nothing too long though.

    - u/Dwood15:
      ```
      I won't avoid CK scenarios because that means there is still life on earth, merely that reality itself has changed to cause a restructuring of society. Another thing is that free will can never be infringed upon, even their own from their own wishes.  The person may wish for intelligence,  but it wouldn't work because of that.  Edit: I'm on mobile right now but expect another response soon.

      It's a generally literal spin on wishes with a tendency to slightly positive interpretation and the lesser deadly options if the wish is not so vague as to be invalid. Little extra is added in so perhaps it's closer to mirror of Erised? Im not familiar with any but the first really.
