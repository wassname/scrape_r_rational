## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

    Well, first you'd have to ask yourself why you'd want to do that, because I understand most people consider the Frodo and Sam bits to be the weakest part of the story. 

    That said, the basis for this trick in LotR is not necessarily the ring, but the fact that saurons forces are extremely centralised and depended on Sauron sticking around. 

    One way I could imagine that working without a load bearing boss is to have the commanders of the enemy army be spreading lies to their civilian government in order to keep the war going. Then all the actioney stuff can revolve around the good guys fighting a defensive war and limiting casualties to buy time for the main character to save the day with diplomacy.

  I've been writing a story in a fairly archetypical fantasy setting. In one of the chapters I'm planning soon, I plan to introduce slimes as an apex predator. They would be nigh-immune to physical damage and fairly vulnerable to magic. My question, is what would prevent them from being too abundant in areas with large ecosystems that are low in magic based creatures?

    They reproduce very very slowly in the absence of magic, and while near invulnerable to physical weapons they are not immune to lightning.

    Prey creatures could evolve chemical defenses even if physical defenses don't work.
    ```

  - u/GeneralExtension:
    ```
    The absence of magic a) kills them or b) makes them weaker to physical attacks, so most of them don't live in such places. If they're comfortable migrating, they might do that, but they don't stick around. 

    You could also introduce creatures or plants that eat slimes, esp. non-magic ones.
    ```

  - u/turtleswamp:
    ```
    If you mean that the setting contains both high and low magic areas and you're worried the low magic areas will become slime-lands, than if the slimes require a certain amount of magic to not starve there'd be fewer in areas with less magic, and in areas with more magic things would be better able to deal with them.

    &#x200B;

    If you mean that your setting as a whole has very few things that could threaten a slime due to limited availability of magic, than the slimes could be territorial, with a means of fighting and absorbing one another.

  I got a strange idea. An Isekai story, the whole 'guy ends up in another world' genre, except said guy is a transhumanist who decides to push the world into a post-singularity post-scarcity civilization by using magic to bypass the laws of nature.
