## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

- u/GaBeRockKing:
  ```
  I'm writing a short CYOA. Would anyone mind looking at it and giving feedback? It's a Meta CYOA where you choose one of many conflicts, and then go through another CYOA as normal, but with a minor boost to your abilities. The impetus behind it is that you have a ton of "here's a bunch of magic powers, have fun," CYOAs that tend to blend into each other. This CYOA intends to give them a raison d'etre. I'll PM google drive links to anyone who wants to see it.
