  I'm curious how unicorns are born since they're these solitary virgin-harem-seeking creatures. Conceived by nature, parthenogenesis? With a low reproductive rate, I have this notion that they'd be an endangered species (so Joon can't capitalize on farming them for quick skill-ups), what with the wealthy's penchant for seeking panaceas/highs (look at rhino horns, and that's considering they're practically snake oil). They're absurdly hard to fight in a frontal assault, but they have that obvious glaring weakness that the party exploited. I can imagine the rich kidnapping or hiring virgins to use in similar ploys. Virgin sacrifice would take on a whole new meaning.

  In other news, worldbuilding fans rejoice! I poked the author with a few questions and was undeservedly rewarded with some nuggets of details.

  ---

  * How could Larkspur afford Fireteam Blackheart when Anglecynn's black budget couldn't muster the authorization and funds for retrieving a billion obol (ideal expected investment value over a short 5+ years) item? By their own admission, they were a below-strength team, so they could have been a disposable insurance policy sent on a low-cost, high-risk, high-reward mission. But given their relative effectiveness, it was a pretty high value gamble.

  >Amaryllis was part of one faction of the Lost King's Court within Anglecynn, while Larkspur is part of a different one. It's not "Anglecynn's black budget" so much as "the budget that could be moved around by one faction without accountability checks or information leaking". I can't remember how much of the background is actually littered around the text thus far, but the Amaryllis-faction was at the point where they knew they were probably going to have to admit that they had lost the key and that they were setting up this secret research facility, and were hoping that they could wait it out so as to lessen the political impacts of this revelation. And then Amaryllis gets this kangaroo-court indictment, which she thinks she can/will be freed from, and things go to shit from there. Larkspur, meanwhile, is Foreign Security Director, so he's drawing on different budgets and working within different constraints. (The whole thing is basically a clusterfuck of overlapping plots, poor information timing, half-measures, and coverups being worse than the crime.)



  * "because the teleportation key we had was ridiculously valuable and if anyone saw us arrive they would either try to take it from us, or go tell someone who would then try to take it from us."

     Why is their group so cautious in this regard? How are they at any more risk than a regular group of 5 people traveling to a touchstone (and assuming hundreds of keys are used multiple times daily)? Touchstones suggest routine usage and an officially sanctioned terminal. Supposing you can't trust some (Barren Jewel), aren't most safe? Or does each local polity have their own version of the TSA to vet arrivals?

  > Private ownership of a teleportation key is basically unheard of, and unscheduled travel to a touchstone is also basically unheard of. Going to a touchstone would basically be like an unregistered 747 appearing over La Guardia airport and requesting to land; it would be cause for alarm. And yes, teleportation keys are one of the things covered under imperial law, so almost every polity does have a regulatory agency that deals with teleportation keys, if only because losing a teleportation key is a very big deal that gets lots of attention. (Teleportation into a private place like Weik Handrum would usually be handled by traveling from a touchstone and then sending the teleportation key back via bulk teleportation, with the inherent risk covered by an extensive and expensive insurance contract and significant collateral, often with an officially authorized 'rider' who is trusted and presumably lowers risk (and the involvement of a lot of major players in the event of theft or loss).) Oh, and then some of the keys are held under exemptions from imperial laws, almost exclusively by state actors, who typically use them outside the systems of touchstones for a variety of reasons. Normally they would have a ready-room prepared ahead of time and use personnel who had been there, or in rare circumstances they would pre-schedule arrival via touchstone (which leaks information about movements and capabilities, and if you're going to do that, better and less expensive to just use the public keys).

    >so Joon can't capitalize on farming them

    I wonder if its like in Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality where unicorn blood quickly loses its power and potency once its out of the unicorn, otherwise they just wasted an enormous amount of healing potential. She only drank a handful of it and it healed everything, a horse has roughly 50 litres of blood, thats a lot of unicorn blood tinctures. And even if the blood lost its power once out of the unicorn, you could still keep the unicorn alive while farming it. Keep it in some kind of immobility enclosure while you bled it whenever you needed it.

  Awesome chapter! Look forward to seeing Mary and Joon high on unicorn blood.

  I think the rapid leveling we saw as a result of the time hacking really points to just how aggressively Joon should be trying to learn Revision Magic.
  ```

  - u/PM_ME_OS_DESIGN:
    ```
    Revision mages undo stuff, you don't keep the memories. That's basically the opposite of merging timelines. How will it help Joon powerlevel?
    ```

    - u/renegadeduck:
      ```
      A couple of somewhat unlikely possibilities:

      In regard to a revision mage who is not Joon, it may not matter if he keeps the memories or not — the game might remember. I'm inclined to think not, though.

      In regard to Joon being a revision mage, he might keep the memories of each revision. I'm guessing that's not the case either.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        >In regard to Joon being a revision mage, he might keep the memories of each revision. I'm guessing that's not the case either.

        Why not? The fact that (in Ch. 33) the revision mage could change his actions after revising himself from dying so that he dodged Joon's attacks (which previously hit) suggests that he did retain his memories. Or at least that, if he doesn't, there are ways to get around that.
        ```

        - u/renegadeduck:
          ```
          That's an excellent point. I suppose the mage could just know that something went wrong, and then try something other than what they were going to.

          Retaining memories seems like the simpler explanation, though.
          ```

    - u/chicken_fried_steak:
      ```
      Oh! I missed that. Where was it confirmed that Revision mages lose memories of what they revise away?

    So do I :)

- u/narfanator:

  This remains absolutely amazing. The way Joon thinks through the situation, running live-combat experimentation, is pretty fantastic.

  [If the author reads this] - you should contemplate a scenario in which modeling the situation as a game gives the wrong answer, because that's how I'd fuck with my players if they started doing this too much.
  ```

- u/renegadeduck:
  ```
  He picked up music pretty easily. What other skills can he develop?

  * Woodworking: Grab a knife and get to whittling. Or, build a simple table.
  * Smithing: Pretty similar to woodworking. He can probably get started with a hammer and some scrap metal.
  * Livestock: Get a goat and take care of it.
  * Language: Get one of his party to teach him another language.
  * Spirit: Get some pom poms and start shaking. Or maybe give a rousing speach before they head off to battle? Hell, he might get it from something he does while high on unicorn juice.
  * Shotguns: Get a shotgun and start shooting things.
  * Wards: Grak might be willing to teach him something, but it sounds like it might take too much work to get started (building a wand is hard).
  * Essentialism: What is it?

  I suppose it's possible that he picked up some of this stuff off screen.

  ---

  **Edit:** /u/nytelios pointed out that that he can't actually read the greyed-out skills, so pursuing these things isn't all that obvious to Joon.
  ```

  - u/Noumero:
    ```
    > Essentialism: What is it?

    I think it's programming.

    In reality, essentialism is, [as Wikipedia is kind to note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essentialism), a philosophical concept which suggests that "every entity has a set of attributes that are necessary to its identity and function". Essentialism as a game skill would be, then, about manipulating fundamental properties of things. Since our primary hypothesis is that Aerb is a simulation, it stands to reason that fundamental properties of things are defined by programming code; this skill is used to manipulate it.

    Perhaps on higher levels it would allow Juniper to hack into the root account of the computer simulating Aerb.

    **Edit:** Or perhaps it would be read-only. I.e., it would allow Juniper to read the code, gathering objectively true and complete information about his surroundings, but not edit anything.

    (Of course, it could just be "metamagic", i.e. the practice of creating magics such as blood/bone/velocity/flower ones. Would be less SoD-breaking, and fit the theme of everything technically being latent magic. Would be much less exciting.)

    (Or maybe it's just to argue philosophy really good.)
    ```

    - u/nytelios:
      ```
      My guess is soul magic (unless Spirit is). It's the likeliest candidate based on what we know of essentialism, blueprint theory and the fact that the quest prompt confirmed that Joon has access to soul magic.
      ```

      - u/Noumero:
        ```
        I think Spirit is a much more likely candidate for soul magic than Essentialism. All else equal, Essentialism doesn't have any strong connections to manipulation of *human* essence in particular. Or do you think that Spirit is likely to be responsible for something else?
        ```

        - u/renegadeduck:
          ```
          It doesn't say “Spirit Magic,” unlike all the other magics. It doesn't say “Essentialist Magic” either, though.

          Given the other items under luck, I'm pretty sure Spirit is basically cheerleading. (Think high school spirit days.)
          ```

          - u/Noumero:
            ```
            Hm, you have a point. I can come up with some variants of soul magic that would naturally primarily rely on luck, but it's not very likely a priori.

            On the other hand, I'm not sure how Juniper still didn't unlock Spirit, if it's a skill for manipulating one's attitude or something. He already engaged in self-control on multiple occasions, and most other skills made themselves known basically at the drop of a hat.
            ```

  - u/nytelios:
    ```
    Joon can't see what we see. He'd have to grope around blindly testing random specializations out of the myriad in the D&Dverse, without any guarantee that he's using the proper approach  (recall gem magic).
    ```

    - u/renegadeduck:
      ```
      Oh, you're correct: “Thirty-six skills were still greyed out, their names just on the other side of readable no matter how hard I squinted at them.” (From [chapter 2](http://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25816869).)

      /u/cthulhuraejepsen I'm curious, what's your reasoning for making the skills visible to us? Or were they not supposed to be visible? (This is a pretty awesome story, BTW!)
      ```

      - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
        ```
        Mostly just an Easter egg. I've been considering removing them entirely as more trouble than they're worth.
        ```

        - u/renegadeduck:
          ```
          Cool. If you want to keep them but make them less legible you could add something like `text-shadow: 0 0 10px #e3e3e3;` to `#workskin b.grey`.
          ```

- u/CaptainMcSmash:
  ```
  This just made me think, does friendly fire reward xp? How 'real' does combat need to be? I'm sure there are revision mages out there that sadists or psychopaths hire, Joon could hire a revision mage to be his punching bag and power level all the combat skills quickly and easily.

      Sweet thanks for the clarification - just going by how you write it seemed like you wouldn't be the type to leave things like that hanging, and you seem to keep a good balance of exposition/world building and actual stuff, so can't fit much more in hah

    To be clear "In Which the Gang Seduces a Unicorn" is not the actual chapter title, but when the chapter was posted it didn't have one, because I forgot (which I do on occasion).

    I almost *did* take the title of this post as the actual chapter title, because I thought it was hilarious, but settled on "The Feminine Mystique", which is the title of the book largely responsible for sparking second-wave feminism.

      Yeah. I'd say a higher-level Joon should start farming Unicorns after stat-heavy level ups, but the way they took this one out seemed pretty unique and non-repeatable. But, now he knows what's up with them, and the next time they'll all be higher level...
