  I'm not familiar with this game, aside from knowing that it's a Zelda game...how is it related to rationality or rational fiction?

    ```
    In your fiction the character uses the poorly written rules of wish to make a holy water cannon that kills hundreds of liches.

    In this game the character uses the poorly written laws of physics to teleport through walls and go to places at incredibly quick speeds.

    It's definitely munchkiny enough for me :P

  I dug an old n64 out of the closet a while ago and am finally trying to beat this game (read: get past the first dungeon). Seeing something like this is kind of ridiculous when I'm struggling to to beat that stupid slingshot minigame.

  I think it's neat to have an example of rationality that is about study and dedicated practice rather than smarts and talking.

  It's pretty amazing how much this run has changed over time. If anyone else is interested [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M7IINwTFVw&list=UUAhuwIvlcSpjlrJALruursQ) a version of the same  run just a year and a half earlier that Cosmo ran at a charity event.

  This is amazing. 

  Also a ripe thing to base a PeggySue!Link off of. Link the first couple of time loops,trying to be a hero the traditional way with his adventures and all manner of super swords. 

  Link after hundreds and hundreds of time loops, pushing the physical boundaries of his universe in an attempt to find a way out of the endless, mind numbing loop. Link, who in his endless endeavor to escape his loop now understands his universe so well that he can defeat the villain in twenty minutes with a bottle, some worms, and a Deku stick.
