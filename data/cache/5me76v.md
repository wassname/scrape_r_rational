  Explanation:

  I'm a big HPMOR fan, and had a strong connection to the metaphors around the deathly hallows and using rationality to defeat death. 

  My friend got me a custom embossed leather journal with a symbol I designed and actually got a tattoo of: the Vitruvian Man combined with the symbol for the Deathly Hallows.  

  For me, this symbol represents the fusion of Humanism, science and rationality, with the hope for a fantastical future made possible by technology.

  The gift was really thoughtful, and I thought of a few of you might appreciate the symbolism!

    That tattoo sounds awesome, is there a picture of it anywhere?

    Also, here's hoping that journal will get filled with all kinds of cool stuff. Happy writing!

      thanks! I actually don't have a good picture yet.  The tattoo artist actually forgot the final line down the center.  it's only visible at the top of the triangle so it's easy to miss, and I didn't notice till I got home.  Hoping to get that finished off.  Overall I'm pretty happy with it though, the overall design really speaks to me, it's the only tattoo I've ever gotten.
