  Of course, since Hidden Sand helped develop this genjutsu game, their genin were made aware of it so they don't blow the surprise invasion.

  And poor Neji; all he wants to do is hate his cousin. Nobody gives him respect for that wish.
  ```

  Looks like Orochimaru will have to appeal to something more subtle and clever than Sasuke's thirst for revenge to get him on his side.

  Can't wait to see what that will be.
  ```

  - u/Drazelic:
    ```
    How do we know Sasuke's gonna go with Orochimaru? For all we know, Orochimaru will appeal to Naruto's desire for power with which to change the world instead, playing the Quirrell figure, and Naruto will go with Orochimaru.
    ```

    - u/sir_pirriplin:
      ```
      In canon, Orochimaru wanted a specimen with a sharingan.

      Naruto is only valuable because of his brain and the Kyubei. Orochimaru is not going to give himself a brain transplant, and the Kyubei risk/reward ratio is worse than the canon Kyubi.

  I like that the senior ninjas are also more rational, I'd expect a similar scenario to be SOP for all Chunin exams (and kept secret from the participants).

  Hey, I just wanted to say thanks for coming back and continuing this great story. I fell in love with it from the very first chapter and checked it's page every day for six months when you went on hiatus. I greatly look forward to reading these latest two chapters.

  You're an inspiration.

  Edit: Three chapters! It's my lucky day.

  I've never understood the thing with Kabuto. I haven't read the canon, so maybe it's explained there -- my understanding is that he's a spy for Orochimaru, but I don't get why he's walking around showing people cards. What's he trying to gain that is worth drawing attention to himself? 

  Can anyone more familiar with the canon lay it out for me?
  ```

  - u/Saffrin-chan:
    ```
    I kind of mentioned this in passing in another comment, but in canon Kabuto is one of those characters where the reader is *told* that they're some smart, cunning mastermind, but when you actually look at the character as a whole and the actions they've taken, they seem really, *really* stupid.

    I've seen people try to explain in other fics that Kabuto's info cards are a method he uses to get close and gain the trust of certain participants in the Chunin Exams, Team 7 and Sasuke by extension in particular. In the original, Kabuto *does* approach Team 7, not the other way around like here. But besides the fact that there's a million other ways to gain the trust of the impressionable 12 year olds Team 7 are in canon *without* looking like a suspicious security leak, it's clearly an example of authors taking somthing that didn't make much sense in the original and trying to come up with a rational reason for it in their story. I don't actually think there ever is a real explanation in canon for what the heck Kabuto was trying to accomplish with those cards except for the weak "he's a spy for Orochimaru," where we have to assume every weird, unexplained action he took was on some strange order that the reasoning behind will never be explained.

      >But besides the fact that there's a million other ways to gain the trust of the impressionable 12 year olds Team 7 are in canon without looking like a suspicious security leak...

      His "cunning" plan also serves as helpful exposition for the audience to understand some weird things about the exam, like why there are comparatively so few ninja participating from other countries (something Naruto in this fic did not notice or did not point out). He also foreshadowed interesting stuff about Lee's abilities (something Naruto in this fic already knows because he is not a moron).
      ```

- u/Saffrin-chan:
  ```
  So Kabuto knows some things about Naruto. More than just secrets like him being a jinchuriki, but things Naruto has been deliberately hiding from everyone else. He obviously got this information by spying, but I wonder who was he spying for at the time? It seems like Kabuto spends time as a spy for pretty much every "bad" faction at some point in canon, and I'm interested in seeing how him being a spy for Root/Orochimaru/Akatsuki/whoever he feels like that week will go down in this story.
  ```

  - u/Nevereatcars:
    ```
    Kabuto showing HiddenAbilities!Naruto that he has knowledge about Naruto that he can't possibly know with his supposed clearance and skills is so overplayed. It's such an obvious and avoidable mistake for this supposedly Anbu-level spy and it happens in dozens of fics.
    ```

    - u/sir_pirriplin:
      ```
      It's not above Kabuto's clearance to know about Naruto's chakra control. 

      Remember in the first chapter, Naruto says the Kyubei is famous for its intelligence and chakra control, so if Kabuto knows Naruto has the Kyubei inside him (and Naruto himself said it was a very poorly kept secret) then he knows about the chakra control.

      I think Naruto was worried more about Kabuto showing that card to ninjas from other villages and wouldn't have minded if Kabuto had kept that knowledge to himself.

      EDIT: Just noticed now that Kabuto knows Naruto is competent at ninjutsu. That should probably worry Naruto more.
      ```

    - u/Saffrin-chan:
      ```
      Yeah, which is one of the reasons why I'm so curious with the direction Kabuto is going to be taken in this story. Velorien hasn't made any *glaring* errors like this yet (and I'm not saying this story hasn't had smaller problems), where they keep something in the story just because it's always in the story (and Kabuto with his info cards are *always* in Chunin Exam fics). So I'm fairly confident that *something* is going on with Kabuto, and he'll end up being more than the "smart" but actually pretty stupid plotter he is in so many stories.
      ```

      - u/Traiden04:
        ```
        I felt it was to add more misdirection away from his boss. He is the bait that encourages them to look only deep enough and not find the actual threat. Naruto is doing the same thing on a different way, to get the group thinking that his team is not a priority.
        ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I talked with him in PM- apparently he does have a reason for this. I just hope it is an interesting reason.
      ```

      - u/Velorien:
        ```
        I hope so too.

        I should add that part of the problem with serialised fiction, and this came up repeatedly with HPMOR, is that some events only make sense a number of chapters or arcs later, and in the meantime the author is stuck with apparently legitimate criticism that they cannot yet defend against.
        ```

        - u/eaglejarl:
          ```
          I used to get that with The Two Year Emperor.  I would always simply say "Wait for it."
          ```

- u/iSuggestViolence:
  ```
  Really enjoying the series so far. Good work OP!
  ```

- u/MadScientist95387:
  ```
  So Kabuto is trying to recruit Naruto (for Sound? for Himself?)

  He's showing Naruto that his intelligence gathering is superior to Naruto's counter-intelligence, and the most likely reason I can think for him to do that is to advertise himself as a useful ally.
