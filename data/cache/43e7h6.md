    You'd probably want a team of people to be clued in onto the impending breach, armed with scripts and lists so that they can break into targets of high priority and mass-download information to be analyzed later. They'd move before anyone else got clued into the oncoming disaster.

    To be honest, if one of the "Trusted Five" was compromised by anarcholibertarian ideals, letting themselves get burned on a temporary disruption of the internet would be a waste. They would be better off as a sleeper agent, covertly hiring similar minded staff and filling the ranks of senior engineers with moles or incompetent yes-men so that they could eventually introduce backdoors with no oversight and allow themselves as much access to sensitive data as they wanted.

  I was going to post this because it's an interesting piece of worldbuilding and near-future scifi, but I realized to my surprise that it fits the definition on "Rational" on the sidebar.

  It's also rather interesting.
