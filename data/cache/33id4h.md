  Man, that is the cutest Hermione ever. I kind of want to do that just for that art, even though only one person voted for it :(

    Cute Batman is possible, though. Think of little Bruce Wane at a junior masquerade ball, dressed as a bat, the year before his parents died. It could be one of his last happy memories with his parents and influenced his decision to dress like a bat in adulthood.

  i can help with [inking](http://i.imgur.com/KIs9v3A.jpg), if that's something that needs doing (sorry for the shading, it was hard to look at otherwise). possibly also supplementary drawing, but only in a month or so.

    Lol! that's great! Right now I'm trying out different styles, both on paper and digital. I don't think I'll need an inker, but it would be helpful to have another artist in the future as I will probably be very busy in June.

  Somewhat OT: why is Batman talking about Luthor? Luthor is generally a Superman villain.

    From [the previous thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/33aa7n/bstwip_artists_roll_call_crowdsource_quest/):

    > *The Gothic Man*, where you play a rational Bruce Wayne in post-Metropolitan-Man Gotham; dealing with the post-Superman crimewave, suspicious breakthroughs from Lex Luthor, and some ... rumours.
