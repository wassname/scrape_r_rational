  Mind sharing what parts of this story you consider rational? Or just a description of the story in general?

  Just curious, that's all.

    It's been a while since I've been active in this sub tbh, so maybe norms about stories being rationalist got stricter, but it's more of just a good web novel I think this sub would like.

    It essentially follows super powered people in a fantasy world. There's a sizable amount of use of chemistry and physics in the super powers, doing things like summoning super cold iron iron in extremely hot temperatures to cause explosions. There's also a sizable amount of decently nuanced real politic in negotiation between politicians.

    No one's ever really holding the idiot ball or making really dumb decisions, there aren't any Mary Sue flawless characters.

      To add to that, the magic system is well made and the usage of powers is pretty dam intresting.

    I second OP's recommendation. The Zombie Knight has previously been posted on here and agreed to be rational. As for the rational content:

    * Characters munchkin their abilities in clever and creative ways. It's been a while, but off the top of my head, the main character uses his ability to >! create iron to create platforms for aerial mobility, form armor, weapons, and projectiles, form around enemies to bind their limbs, and form support struts to temporarily prevent a building from collapsing !< 
    * Characters do act in line with their motivations, without any plot contrivance.
    * The worldbuilding is detailed, well thought-out (in my opinion), and consistent. Nothing has broken my suspension of disbelief so far.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      The world building is a little inconsistent imo, but reasonable enough in the context that it's a serial that's on going for about eight years now.
      ```
