## [Q] Gven the many stories that have come through here, what pet peeves or unfulfilled promises have developed that a new story should rectify?

### Post:

Basically the title. I'm going to start posting *Collateral Damage* ([that thermonuclear magical girl story](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4ccyk1/bst_wip_lets_script_an_anime_together_opportunity/d1hn1oc?context=3)) after finals and I would like to know what people have *not* gotten out of ratfics yet. /r/rational, what's on your wishlist?

Also, if anyone knows any cool trivia or facts about nuclear weapons or related technology, let me know so I can work it into the story.

  Too many stories solve things with violence for my taste. I think it's overdone, and is usually either forced or in conflict with psychological realism. Since I recently rewatched *Log Horizon*, it stands out to me as a great example of the important stuff getting solved by a bunch of people sitting around talking, and sometimes spending lots of money, even in a context where by convention the audience expects all conflicts to lead to violence.

  There's almost no romance in rational fiction. While this is refreshing because there's already plenty of romance fiction out there, I think it would be nice to see a rational approach to romance because it would avoid a lot of the pitfalls, cliches, unrealistic characterizations, etc of typical romance stories.

    The biggest problem I had with /u/eaglejarl's Team Anko was that Anko was in a poly-amorous relationship that was brought up in a very shoehorned way. I felt that he was delivering an HPMoR-style lecture rather than developing her character.

    /u/velorien, on the other hand, has done a great job with Naruto and Hinata in Lighting Up the Dark, especially Hinata's reasonable approach to romantic problems and misunderstandings.

    That would be definitely nice. All relationships in our current media are disney-esque, completely unrealistic.

    The problem is that humans are not wired for rational analysis of relationships dynamics, as the insane amount of backlash /r/TheRedPill receives clearly demonstrates.

    Pity, because it would be definitely an interesting read.
    ```

    - u/DaWaffledude:
      ```
      Saying people object to /r/TheRedPill because they aren't wired for rational analysis of relationship dynamics is like saying that people object to HPMOR!Voldemort because they aren't wired for rational analysis of magic.

      /r/TheRedPill is indeed rational as generally defined by this sub: The users there use a generally effective model of human interaction to achieve their desired goals. The problem is that their goals very often conflict with the goals of others, hence the controversy. They want power and dominance over their romantic partners without having to reciprocate anything in return. They treat relationships like a Prisoner's Dillemma, and advise defecting. Many people (myself included), find this morally objectionable.

      There are rational ways of dealing with relationships that involve both parties co-operating, which, as anyone familiar with the Prisoner's Dillemma can tell you, is the ideal outcome.

      Just took a long look at it. They make some pretty good points, but I'm not sure how much of it is actually representative of how people think and act in real life. Some of the discussion about power dynamics in relationships I've seen on it so far often seem kind of weird and even paranoid, despite some aspects of them sounding almost right.

      I noticed that there is a RedPill for straight men and one for gay men. Why doesn't there seem to be a RedPill for straight women and lesbian women? The intro article explained that men need more help finding partners than women do. But as far as I am aware, even if it's often not to the same extent as men, women do have relationship problems and difficulties finding partners just like men do, and would benefit from rational analysis of relationship dynamics just like men do.

      Or wait, is there a RedPill equivalent for women? Because I didn't see it linked in the RedPill subreddit's sidebar.

        I warmly recommend focusing on the sidebar, specifically the essay "[The Misandry Bubble](http://puerarchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/TheFuturist_TheMisandryBubble.pdf)" and the "[The Rational Male](https://therationalmale.com/the-book/)" books instead of the subreddit itself, since it's full of people who are still in the anger phase.

        There is no TRP for the benefit of women, as far as I know, and it makes perfect sense since women are socialized and taught from young age what men want and how they can achieve their own relationship goals by using that knowledge.


        >Or wait, is there a RedPill equivalent for women? Because I didn't see it linked in the RedPill subreddit's sidebar.

        What there is is a TRP subreddit for women, but still from the point of view of the male benefit: /r/RedPillWomen/. So it's utility is quite debatable for women not interested in the kind of relationship TRP Men look for.

          In the sense that many of us are taught from a young age that men are unreliable pigs who care only about sex and would abandon their family at the slightest provocation, and who don't care about the emotional side of things. I remember my friends in college being hugely surprised how heartbroken men can get after a breakup.

          You should understand why this is wrong and biased, because while this applies to *some* men, it doesn't apply to all of them.

  - u/Cariyaga:

    A strong one paragraph hook on the first page or so (I read a little further before judging) will usually get me to read at least 10% of a long story before I decide either way.

    ```
    Oh yeah. It has a massively outsized effect on my reading habits, even though I'm aware of the effect. If the first paragraph - or sometimes chapter if I'm feeling generous - doesn't grab me, it just makes me go *ugh*. Ugh, this guy hasn't put in the work to learn the most basic points of writing to an audience. Ugh, if this is as boring as the rest of the story is going to be I don't think I'll bother. 

    Ways to do this include introducing a character who is not your main character, and have them fight a dramatic conclusion to their story, fail and possibly die horribly. Otherwise there's the option of showing something climactic or interesting from the future of your character, then cutting back to the actual start of the story. There's other ways as well, of course.

  Rationalist techniques and mindset. While a rational and consistent world is great thing, I prefer more of the original hpmor thing with different modes of though, problem solving, deductions and rule manipulation and discovery by logic. 

  So more of that please. And it would be great if the protag was someone who actively goes out to do something, rather than getting into problems by circumstances, destiny, luck or for plot reasons. That is to say an actor rather than a reactor type of guy (girl/gorrila/gramma/godzira or whatever your protag is)

  EDIT: Also speed is important too, its okay to have protag be very powerful and solving/munchkin problems very fast even in beginning, so long as the opposing force is of equal or greater strength

  - u/captainNematode:

    I think I may be the opposite, at least insofar as I understand the distinction between *rational* and *rationalist* fiction. I usually read or skim stories from this sub and others for quick, mindless entertainment, and find myself annoyed more often than not when the plot or worldbuilding take a backseat to goofy edutaitional lecturing, which I almost always end up skipping. It's ok if it's done with a light touch, a subtle reference or fun fact here and there, but not when the narrative flow is broken by a paragraph or two lifted from wikipedia or some pop-sci book or wherever. 

    Agreed about proactive v.s. reactive protagonists, though.

    > its okay to have protag be very powerful and solving/munchkin problems very fast even in beginning, so long as the opposing force is of equal or greater strength

    Having believable, edge-of-your-seat conflicts is good, but I do like my badass power fantasy stomps (e.g. certain parts of One Punch Man).

        Nah you're good. Nukes are giant, power showing explosions, which is the staple of magical girl stories aka Ultimate Super Friendship Magical Attack (patent pending). Just make sure protag calls out her attacks like any sane super-powered being would.

    - u/rationalidurr:

      Yes, which is why you must increase opposing force to equal or greater strength to compensate. Sort of like high speed chess but not just with chess pieces.

  Focus on increasing one's Wisdom over one's Intelligence Score. A lot of rational fiction often involve the protagonist trying to improve their intelligence or taking the time to learn skills relevant to the plot. I want to see a character who is deliberately striving to become more mature and to grow as a person rather going all mad-scientist.

  I get that to be rational often involves learning how to decide and achieve one's goals, but many protagonists of rational fiction tend to be very 'narrow minded' where they focus overly much on their goals without too much focus on other ways to improve themselves even if it won't help overly much for their goals.

  Sorry if it's a bit ramblely. It's a subtle thing I've been noticing a lack of in rational fiction and I'm not quite sure of the best way to explain it. It's just that I often see 'rational' characters coming up with intelligent solutions of clever munckins, but I rarely see long-term planning and most protagonists are *reactive* towards some outside problem rather than being proactive in self-development and making use of more mundane solutions in tandem with the fantastic.

    I would explain this as "protagonists of rational!fic often appear unjustifiably confident of their goals or that they know their goals", and agree it's a common failing.

    Remedies it would be nice to see:

    - characters who are confident of an *eventual* goal (transhumanism FTW!), but not sure how to get there (eg political orientation)

    - characters deciding that they have insufficient information to meddle in the affairs of $whatever (with positive marginal expected utility), so their time is better spent on a *less important problem* which has a relative attention-deficit

    - a character arc which is *just* personal development; eg $minor\_char decides that they need life experience they don't have and can't get yet before making $major\_decision

    - a general theme that wisdom must not be a dump stat.  INT might be how you achieve your goals, but wisdom is how you decide what your goals *are*.  Probably needs some serious anvil dropping on the fallibility of humans, who usually literally don't know what we want.

    - someone acting prematurely, and realizing actually-too-late that they ruined things by doing so.  Failure-through-inaction is the normal aesop, but I think rational fic as a whole goes too far the other way.

      His usage of 'intelligence **score**' is probably a deliberate invocation of the dichotomy used by D&D and  in common language. In both cases, intelligence refers to the usage of problem-solving for goals provided wholesale by the subconscious or other people, while wisdom refers to the usage of the ability to analyse those goals.

  As much magically-weaponised high-energy physics as possible. *Saga of Soul* and the *Doc Future* trilogy are great examples (thanks, commenters), and I'd like to see more.

  /u/eaturbrainz and I demand that the spell to squeeze-and-release fusion magnetic bottles (great way to ruin a nuclear power's day) by known as *Callahan's Unfriendly Instigation*.  Bonus points if characters or concepts from /r/errantry appear in cameos.

  A really strong first installment - paragraph, chapter, episode, whatever - is crucial.  Most of the really good fics I've read do this by opening with the climax of *someone else's* story, which fits in a lot of action and demonstrates technical skill without getting anachronistic.  Eg HP opens with the last stand of his parents...

  There's plenty of interesting material on nuclear weapons you can find online; no specific reccomendations.  I do suggest pulling in magical references though, such as the Dresden Accords (Stross / *A Colder War*) or the Unseelie Accords (*Dresden Files*) - confusing names, eh...

  Also look into civilian application of nuclear explosions, such as [Project Orion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion\)), Operation Plowshare, and other [Peaceful Nuclear Explosions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaceful_nuclear_explosion).  This would be a nice goal for the protagonist anyway, to affirm that being a one-girl nuclear superpower (heh) doesn't have to make you a monster.  Bonus points for minor angst over UN sanctions.

  Well, this probably doesn't really apply to a "thermonuclear magical girl story," but what I've realized I've been missing from my rational fiction lately is enough focus on the protagonist's rage against the injustice of death and the constant wiping out of so much knowledge and human potential, a viewpoint which might lead a protag to take morally questionable or even arguably evil actions in the interests of putting an end to this far greater evil.

  So many rational stories just kinda skip right past the "ending death" bit, until it seems like it sort of happens in the background or as a adjunct to the character's primary goals. I want to read a character who feels a cold hand of ice gripping his/her heart whenever they realize (which should be *all the time*) that anyone they love or even someone they only talked to once might well be gone tomorrow, all of that person's knowledge and experience wiped away as though it never existed, just nada, nothing. I want a character who feels hot rage when he notices that everyone around him is going through life accepting this horrible fact, pretending that it doesn't exist or believing in fairytales of religion in order to try to ignore it, or even, god help them, twisting their psyche into such ugly shapes that they can call it right and good that everyone dies, and call it wrong to want to live forever, and say that it is the fact that life is fleeting that makes it worth living.

  It is this, this mindset, this character, that drew me to things related to rational fiction and transhumanism. Zoltan's protagonist in *The Transhumanist Wager* might read like some kind of neo-nazi half the time, wandering around and demolishing various straw man arguments conveniently served up to him by cardboard cutout antagonists, but I can forgive that because the major point of the character's motivations is rage against the dying of the light, rage and horror that anyone would devote their time and resources to something other than holding on to life tooth and claw, to turning every resource humanity has towards combating this greatest of all injustices.

  And yet, in rational fiction really only HPMOR had much of this in it, and even there it's just one of several goals. This is what I want to see more of, this is what makes my heart pound in excitement more even that that period of unbounded possibility that comes just after the protagonist has acquired superpowers or the equivalent, more than seeing someone munchkin something seemingly useless into great power.

  I notice that pretty much all the stories I really like have this element in them, even though sometimes it doesn't come through in its full form as rage against death. Vernor Vinge's stuff has this in it in great measure, sometimes only hinted at but always present in some form, mixed with deft portrayals of enhanced intelligence as something that you can't look directly at and comprehend, but instead only see through its effects and implications. *Worm* is about someone who just won't give up, no matter how horrible things get, and while the parallel is never quite explicit, by the end the protagonist might as well be facing the anthropomorphic personification of senseless and unstoppable death, and doing everything possible to bring it to an end and to compel everyone else to also devote all their energies to this end, whether by ethical means or not. And similar parallels can be made for almost all fiction I consider moving.

  An issue I've had with a lot of rational fics is that they have a kind of on/off relationship with narrative satisfaction. The stories often like to subvert your expectations, but it sometimes results in the story failing to deliver on what I want it to. HPMOR is on of my favorite books ever, but I can't disagree with [the review](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/3096lk/spoilers_all_a_critical_review_of_hpmor/) u/alexanderwales wrote explaining why the ending is disappointing. Not that he's innocent, I freaking hate The Metropolitan Man because it was the exact opposite of what I wanted from a Superman story. Just because you can deconstruct a cultural icon doesn't mean it's enjoyable to read, especially when compared to reconstructions like All-Star Superman or Superman vs. The Elite that respect the character and what he represents while modernizing him.

  Because of this trend I'm nervous about finishing Worm or checking out Wildbow's other work. It had an amazing start and really interesting characters, but I stopped reading after I finished Prey because the story had become unpleasant to read. Character development seems to have been put on hold while everyone's busy surviving constant attacks by horrific monsters that the heroes are powerless to stop. The author said he actually rolled dice to see who'd survive Leviathan's attack on the city, [which I think is completely contrary to a compelling narrative and characters.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim)
  ```

    > The author said he actually rolled dice to see who'd survive Leviathan's attack on the city, which I think is completely contrary to a compelling narrative and characters.

    Personally I think the author was exaggerating or lying about that to at least some extent. Maybe he did it for some of the secondary characters, but the primaries? I've read Worm twice, and the story doesn't exhibit that kind of randomized structure. The main characters have strong plot armor until it makes sense that it should fade, and Wildbow even provides an in universe explanation for the plot armor.

    I *strongly* recommend finishing Worm. IMO the climax and ending is by far the best part. Yes, there are a few missteps like the time skip and the strong conservation of danger/mook effect that eventually afflicts the S9, and also the part with Echidna which is too long and drags, but aside from those Worm gets better and better as it goes along and the ending is (again IMO) sublime. And as a comparison baseline I also hated the ending of The Metropolitan Man with a fiery passion. Worm's ending delivers on all its promises and then some.

    As for the rest of Wildbow's work, I didn't really like Pact. Many elements seem like the worst parts of Worm. Wildbow said he had personal problems while writing it that interfered, and it does read like that. Also, the terrific epic scale ending of Worm set up certain expectations in me for Pact's ending, expectations that were not fulfilled.

    I'm waiting on Twig to be completed before reading it.
