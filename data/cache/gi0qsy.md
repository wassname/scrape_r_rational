## Seeking Recommendations - Long Fic

### Post:

I love rational fiction, and especially curling up with a really long, thorough fic, like 50,000 words and up. I’ve read a lot of the long fic available, but I’m always looking for more!

Some of the fic I’ve read includes:
- Mother of Learning
- A Thing of Vikings 
- SI by Daniel Boese
- All Friendship is Optimal works on FiMfiction
- With This Ring
- Set in Stone
- Deeprise
- Ra 
- The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect
- Worth the Candle

  Oh, honey...

    I mean, if you’ve got something 600,000 words, that’s even better!

  I don't have handy links, sorry

  * Unsong
  * Worm; rational-adjacent at least.
  * Pyrebound; maybe not as long as you want but still in progress
  * Fine Structure (same author as Ra)
  ```

    For the record, PB is about 200K words right now, so it qualifies.  It's not going to be as long as Worm or WTC though.  Also, [pyrebound.wordpress.com](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com) for the link.

  I wrote The Fifth Defiance, and it def qualifies in terms of being more than 50k words.  So, if you don't mind a self rec...

    Just started reading this, and it's very well written! Did your story ever get much traction on this sub reddit?
    ```

  - u/Yodra_B:

    Thank you! And self-recs are welcome!

  You could try The Wandering Inn https://wanderinginn.com/

  It's pretty well written, and the author updates with extreme productivity: ~20k words twice a week typically; it's nuts. The most accurate description of the quality is that at its best, it's good. When it's not, it kind of drags. It's super long, though, so it will keep you busy if you like it.
  ```

    Seconding this recommendation.  Its very much an investment in the story.  The first book (about a 1000 pages) is often considered pretty weak compared to the rest of the story (seeing as the author has yet to edit out some errors).  But its 20000+ pages have some interesting world building and good charter development.
    ```

  ```
  I think I can assume you've read HPMoR already even though it wasn't listed. ;)

  [A Song For Two Voices](https://archiveofourown.org/series/936480) - Rationalist take on Mercedes Lackey's *The Last Herald-Mage* trilogy. No knowledge of canon required. I consider it well-written. Protagonist suffers from imperfectly controlled depression and has to cope with and sometimes work around it and its effects on his judgment. Long, updates regularly.
  ```

  - u/aponty:
    ```
    Seconded, and I must note that while I enjoyed the first book in the series, it really doesn't start pulling out the "rationalist" tropes until the second book onward (but it does so in a very satisfying and organic way)
    ```

  [*Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived*](https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm) (660K words, complete) starts out looking like a familiar story... but instead of magic, this world has *James Bond*-level spy shenanigans (from gadets to supervillains).

  May be my favorite portrayal of Hermione; *easily* my favorite Dumbledore - I'm recommending it for equal parts worldbuilding and characterisation.  [This review](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/682neu/) and comments are decent:

  > It's a super-spy story where all the Bond-background has been mashed up and subsumed in an ingenious mutation of the Potterverse... Fifth year is admittedly self indulgent, but I couldn't stop laughing. Imagine canon Umbridge trying to control a school of disgruntled teenagers trained in espionage.

  Technically fourth in a series, but entirely standalone - this is the backstory for Hermione in a later crossover.

    Unfortunately it's written in a kind of UKAmerica, a quaint vaguely British sort of place, yet where solicitors conduct business by extorting money from the civil service via the courts, and dentists insist on being called Dr, even though they would be rapped over the knuckles by the GMC were they to try to make such claims. So not very British at all.

    But quite funny.
    ```

    - u/swagrabbit:
      ```
      Ultimately, given the semi-universal lack of care by internet writers for localization of culture and terms, that's just something we have to get over (even though I still grit my teeth at every obnoxious extra 'u' and britishism in worm fics).
      ```

      - u/RMcD94:
        ```
        Are there so many British authors? Surprising to see it the other way around
        ```

      - u/Luminous_Lead:
        ```
        Those "extra 'u'" are actually fairly common in Canadian English (Wildbow happens to be Canadian). The USA are actually the odd one out, on the spelling spectrum.
        ```

        - u/swagrabbit:
          ```
          I'm aware that spelling and usage differs in different regions, it's just a localization thing. I notice it in HP fics when they don't include the 'u.' A frequent offender in HP fics is using "mom" instead of "mum." Maybe I'm too irritable about it, given how little it matters in the grand scheme.

    It is fantastic.  I've been listening to an audiobook of Niccolo Machiavelli's "The Prince" this week and it reminded me so much of APGtE's mentor figures and the lessons imparted.
    ```

- u/PeridexisErrant:
  ```
  [*To the Stars*](https://archiveofourown.org/works/777002) is fantastic reasonably-futuristic SF plus slice-of-life plus *Puella Magi*.  Not rationalist, but IMO the worldbuilding and characters take it well into rational territory, not to mention some of the themes (because they'd spoil things).  ~750K words, not yet finished.
  ```

- u/notsureiflying:
  ```
  I believe Unsong by Scott Alexander is a bit over 200k words. It's wacky and super fun
  ```

  What is this "SI by Daniel Boese"? Google refuses to give anything other than academic chemistry papers and German poetry.

  There's the author of Deeprise's current projects(BTW do you have a backup of Deeprise? The author doesn't and I never finished it).  Hope and Silence in the Hive(not precicely rational but not not rational) and Terror and Peace Among the Stars are good. Terror and Peace especially, it even adds a lot to Hope and silence. Quite philosophical, even though the main character is strictly a kardashev 2 civilization on her own pretty much no meaningful conflict is possible to solve with simple force and even notes how crude what she makes is compared with what a proper stellar engineer would make, can be a bit hard to follow at times but definitely worth it. Touches on a lot of philosophical points found around here but rarely discussed to such a degree like transhumanism, death and free will. Another is Onwards to Providence by the same author.

  Since I see FiO on your list which means you're not allergic to ponies, I'd recommend The Maretian. The Martian / MLP crossover. Very fun, and looong. I don't see The Martian on your list either but I assume you've heard of it/read it/seen the film: if not get to it straight away because it's excellent. 

  I don't see Animorphs the Reckoning on the recommendations; do you only want complete stuff? 

  Metamorphisis of prime intellect: localroger has some other fiction, most notably his passages in the void series. Doubt it meets your length requirements, but still. 

  Crystal Society, Crystal Mentality and Crystal Eternity are a great trilogy. I personally love all three but many people reckon the first one is the only one that's any good. 

  Luminosity and Radiance are two stories written as rational versions of twilight. Stop your cringing at the thought of sparkly vampires and creepy stalker bois and mormon undertones; it's  a story about transhumanism and munchkinry of cool super powers. People reckon the second book isn't as good, but IMO there's just a different viewpoint character who you don't like as much as Bella in the first book.

    Not quite as rational, but I'd also recommend Fallout Equestria if you're actively a fan of ponies. It's quite excellent,  and better than it has any right to be.

  To the Stars

  [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7406866/1/To-the-Stars](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7406866/1/To-the-Stars)

  The stuff is really good.

  Hmm, you've gone through most of the strictly rational ones (Without Worm on the list) so I'll give you a few long semi-rational ones. 

  [With this Ring](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-fourteen.8938/) - Young Justice Fanfic, how to utilize a ring powered by avarice to save the world. A little meandering at points, and the side stories are a little odd for my taste but rational for a self-insert. NO Harem. 

  [The Arithmancer](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer) - Harry Potter, Hermione MC. Not strictly rational, but at least logical in regards to mathematical theory in regards to spellcrafting. A balanced approach, wherein raw arcane power and precise application of limited power are both valid approaches to magic. Very Long, but no instances of an idiot ball as I recall. There are errors on Hermione's part, but understandable ones. 

  [Strong Female Protagonist](https://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-1/page-0/) - An original Webcomic, what happens when a child raised to be a 'super-hero' grows up and faces the reality that beating up bad guys in the streets won't fix the world. Be prepared to be left hanging as the Hiatus has been going on for years. 

  That's about all I can do off the top of my head for at least semi-rational that I don't see recommended here too often. I've got a collection of at least logical stories as well if you'd like those.
  ```

    > NO Harem. 

    Honestly it feels a bit like an anime harem guy, but rational.  He has no idea that any of the girls are flirting with him.  Then reality hits and they get annoyed at his obliviousness and stop being interested.
    ```
