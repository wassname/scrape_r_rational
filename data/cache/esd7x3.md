## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  1. You are a Muggle in your mid 20's. 

  2. The year is 2015. You live in London. 

  3. A message received from your 16 year old self has information stating you were brain wiped of a younger sibling who was a wizard at some point. 

  4. You do not remember a younger sibling, nor do you have any evidence beyond family pictures that look a little off center. As if a person is missing. Several years of VHS tapes and old cheap DVD's are too badly aged to repair. 

  5. The message contains encrypted scans of year 1-2 textbooks from Hogwarts as well as notes from your 16 year old self detailing what you figured out traveling with your sibling to Diagon alley to purchase school supplies for years 1 and 2.  

  6. You have 20,000 pounds in savings. You are working a steady job to continue earning 1,600 pounds a month. (Not factoring in expenses.)

  7. Your younger self insists that the higher echelons of government around the world are in on the secret, and are actively working to cover up the Wizards existence. 

  8. Muggles are seen as nothing better than Cattle, treat them nicely but no one really gets too upset if something bad happens to them. 

  Your goal is to bring down the statute of secrecy, while keeping your memory, and not dying. Ensuring that a war does not erupt is a secondary concern after the preservation of magical knowledge and casters. 
  Wizards are hoarding knowledge that can benefit all of mankind, they can violate the known rules of physics, which is only more data for the Grand Unified Theory. They could prevent disasters, but don't. They took your sibling out of your life. 

  Rules: 

  * You are not immune to magic. 

  * Muggle repelling spells cover only the entrances to magical locations. 

  * You do not recover memories from a properly cast obliviate. 

  * Stealing magic is impossible. Investigating the genetics of it and the possibility of gene manipulation for it are far beyond your means until the statute falls. 

  * You can utilize potions, magical items, and creatures.

  * Magic operates like heavily ionizing radiation in regards to electronics (but not living creatures). Dead simple mechanical and electrical devices will operate near magic, complex unhardened transistors / vacuum tubes will not. 

  * Magical shields block bullets, hand grenades and moderate kinetic impacts. A speeding sedan will be stopped by a shield, a bus will not.

  * Muggles cannot learn legilimency or occlumency. Memories of a muggle can be extracted and / or stored in a pensive. 

  * Prophecy is real, but only in hindsight. 

  * 'Souls' are brain states. Magic of the soul is manipulation of the electrical patterns that represent the mind.

  * Muggles can use the Flu / Side along Apperate / Portkey without anything beyond usual side effects. 

  * Ritual magic exists, but requires a magical individual to execute. (No sticking a wizard in the circle unconscious and activating either. Coercion is viable.)

  Munchkin / what are the most efficient methods of achieving this goal? Assume the individual executing this are of slightly above average intelligence, but not strictly a rationalist to the point of sitting down to plan every possible outcome or examine their reasoning and biases at ever decision. Basic ethical concerns apply as well. The individual is not going to at first murder a wizard to gain access to his library and scan it into a computer. Small slides and forays into ethical grey areas could lead to this. There is no time scale of execution of this plan.

  What are some methods of achieving the goal/ loopholes in the current rules?

    Parents of muggleborns are the key. You can find them at King's Cross. "Hi, did you just drop off you kid to Hogwarts? Being a muggle who knows about wizards is such a weird situation, I'd like to have someone similar to talk to, could I get your number?" Should allow you to figure out if they are willing to help you without exposing you are working against the statute. They can provide magical items that you can use to prove the situation to people privately and go from there. As the operation grows in scope, make sure no single person knows enough that memory reading them will allow the whole thing to be stopped.

    I really love this (abandoned) fanfiction, it's an isekai of a D&D wizard entering the Harry Potter universe at the beginning of the first book.

    Some of the chapters are about a muggle police officer investigating magic.

    >!She first gets on the trail because she's on the team that was to raid the house Harry stays in to hide from the death eaters, then finds out her memory is wiped after noticing paperwork flaws and goes back to the voice recording she took before.  
    Later, she gets bird watching groups to monitor for owl-deliveries of wizarding newspapers, and then eventually discovers who is getting them, and steals one, then gets into diagon alley by tricking a squib.!<

    Step one: Email a backup of everything I have to Wikileaks. Anonymously, or as anonymously as I can.

    Step two: Set up a system that will automatically email me a copy of the documents - along with all the other notes I upload in the future - to me if I ever fail to send it a weekly email by Monday morning. Send the email every Sunday evening that I remember to send it. Regularly upload my notes to the server, with the intention that if I am memory-wiped, I can reconstruct why I got memory-wiped.

    Step 3: Hide several other reminders of the Wizarding World where I would come across them in the course of my daily life, should I ever be memory-wiped.

    These three steps will give me a resilience to memory-wiping that will surprise most wizards.

    Step 4: Attempt to enter Diagon Alley armed with a camera phone. (Yes, the phone won't work, but I won't know that until I'm there...)

    --------------

    Step 4: Recover objectives from email. Recognise that attempting to slip into Diagon Alley with a camera phone leads to memory wipe.

    Step 5: Attempt to find evidence of missing younger sibling. Search through city records, church baptisimal records, anything. Google his/her name.

    Step 6: If younger sibling is alive, attempt to make contact. If not, then send (anonymous email) evidence of probable death to police station.

    Step 7: Attempt to recruit like-minded wizardly allies

    ...after this point, it *really* depends on what happens...

      Your making me think of it now, but a year 1-2 text will have the imperious. 

      Any tech setup to remind yourself of the wizards would have to be immune from your own knowledgeable attempts to disable it. 

      AWS server connected to a prepaid card setup to store and send it all.. once created lose the AWS keys and prepaid card.

      Finding muggle-borns down in the dumps would be helpful, depending on how much you could trust them. Presumably by 2015 few death eater types are around, but muggles are still very much look down on. Getting caught to often might just have a wizard toss you in a muggle prison and magic some charges to keep you there.

        One thing that would *really* help your efforts: a friendly wizard who will Obliviate your memories of the measures you've taken. That way Imperius and Legilimency can't be used to dismantle them.

        Worse, getting caught too often might have wizards decide to just make everyone forget you ever existed and turn you into a frog. Or a House Elf...

  - u/Charlie___:
    ```
    I was actually thinking of this earlier this morning, but from the opposite perspective - the statute of secrecy is so *obviously* doomed to fail that there must be serious protections keeping it up that we never see. So I was thinking from the perspective of a muggleborn wizard - how do you figure out what's keeping the secret and bypass it?

    Your goal, if you want to make information resilient, is just to spread it around without arousing notice. Your problem is that you don't know what arouses notice - if you just tell a friend in private, how do you know that magical alarms aren't going off somewhere?

    In the given setting (assuming the Harry Potter novels don't exist), I probably don't think of magical protections until too late. So in-setting me would probably start by telling trusted people as much as I think they'll accept, backing up the information in various locations, trying to feel out people who might be interested in being nodes in an information-spreading network, etc. I'll probably realize that the NSA could have red flags on obvious wizard jargon and not use it in electronic conversations, and certainly not put anything on the public web at first.

    At this point, if the protection is magical alarms against secret-breaking, they're probably thoroughly going off and I get nabbed and lose the game. But maybe the magical protections are more subtle and, dare I say, magical. In which case I probably accidentally trip and fall while having decided that carrying all my evidence next to a river was a good idea, then hit my head and die of a brain hemorrhage.

    Basically, my chances as a muggle don't seem great.
    ```

    - u/Weerdo5255:
      ```
      More subtle methods of detection of the statute would be I think counter to the wizarding culture introduced in the books. 

      In the 'fanon' the Unspeakables who would be executing things like this are given a heck of lot more power. In canon, they're only researchers at the behest of the government. 

      I think the largest difference between the muggles and wizards beyond the magic is the type of society and group dynamic they seem to operate on.  

      For as much as the Wizards say they have a government, it's small town politics and machinations. Lots of nepotism, conservative leads, not much political action beyond attempts at a violent takeover. 

      I'm not saying that muggle governments aren't like this, but globalization and the mindset is fundamentally different. Not to mention that even with the NSA example, they're going to be just as likely as an independent muggle to wrangle anything they can from wizards / those in the know. 

      I'd prefer to make the mistake and be picked up by the NSA spooks than have my memory wiped. The Government overall might be helping the wizards, but factions inside of it are not all in lock step like the wizarding world. (It's frankly impossible in my opinion for the statue to have been kept for any length of time in the modern world. People cannot keep secrets for months, let along centuries.) 

      So yes, perhaps the wizards have some arcane information detecting magic. In which case any attempt to disseminate information will fail, assuming it's operating on the information itself as an infohazard and not the method of information transmission. 

      The wizards might have detection in place for speaking, writing, signing and the like. I doubt very much they have magic for detecting encrypted digital data. You might suffer a few memory wipes to reach this conclusion with reminders in place though... Which is bad. You've got to assume repeat offenders of getting close to breaking the statute are just turned in to vegetables. 

      Wizards don't see the muggles as people.

  Okay, this is really random, but you know all that stuff about creating a warning system for nuclear waste storage facilities? They basically have to stop people drilling there for 10,000 years.

  I recently was reading through a bunch of documents from c. 1990 about this, and one included some science fiction scenarios of how the storage facilities would be interacted with on different time-scales under different conditions. I kind of love this. 

  You can find the document here: https://www.wipp.energy.gov/library/cca/CCA_1996_References/Chapter%207/CREL3329.PDF - I think it's about p180 on the pdf, but I've uploaded a screenshot of the first scenario here: https://imgur.com/a/Daj1jpb

  Here's my summary of the scenarios:

  "in 100 years" scenarios: 

  * "What if the world becomes feminist in 100 years and people ignore our warnings because we are old white men?" (full text above)
  * "cult thinks the meaning of life is buried there so they drill" - their cult beliefs involve thinking that we are simultaneously in many alternate realities so they think all the stuff about radiation is from an alternate universe that does not apply here
  * New Mexico secedes from the USA and joins Mexico and everyone forgets about the waste buried because beaurocracy... By 2091
  * "what if it's so successful that it's expanded and lots more stuff is dumped, even non-radioactive stuff?" (answer: it's probably ok)

  the 1,000 year scenarios

  * in 2991 there are underground skyscrapers in all major cities and they are building a tunnel through the site, which they don't find because they are coming from below. This is actually reasonable if unlikely
  * slaves are mining the area. Computers working through speech interfaces mean that nobody can read anymore. They ignore the written warnings and dig anyway 

  11991.....

  * Virus on the androids that build underground cities makes them dig randomly. There's a very detailed description of society and its 3 tiers in this future. (There are the high class humans who run everything, the low class humans who get UBI and make art and or do drugs, and then the robots)
  * spaceship crashes into the site (there's also a space war, I think)
  * nuclear warning systems are basically Disney and the storage sites Disneyland. "Nicky Nuke" is the equivalent of Mickey Mouse.

  And then they have The Industrial Scenario. 2000-11991 
  (this is like three times as long as any of the other reports)

  * the area is used as solar farms 
  * so industry (esp magnesium mining) sets up around the solar farms to take advantage of the cheap electricity
  * "For the much more distant future, the whole notion of industrial production may be replaced by concepts not yet available to us." => for example, they haven't anticipated 3D printing, which, if/when it reaches a certain level of sophistication, will do away with the need of a lot of factories as it's much better to download the design for a widget and print it at home than order it
  * the magnesium extraction caused some of the magnesium to get contaminated with radioactive waste and be incorporated in metals in 2500, resulting in more stringent controls being reapplied
  * in 2900, people start going to mine trans-uranic elements there, because they are no longer produced as a byproduct of nuclear weapons, taking about 10% of the trans-uranic elements before they became too expensive to be worth recovering
  * this process repeats several times before the year 4,000, using different resources

  It's a kind of wacky and random collection of scenarios, none of which seem remotely plausible.
  ```

  - u/D0TheMath:
    ```
    Were these like joke scenarios? If not, I'm very concerned that everyone in 1990s WIPP may have been incredibly high.
    ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      They were not jokes. I am describing them a bit.... shallowly, but you can read the screenshot I took of the "feminism destroys science" scenario.
      ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        You can make the feminism scenario more likely by making it a tankie/Maoist scenario. Both ideologies would discredit all which came before as capitalist lies, and both ideologies play fast and loose with knowledge and education.
        ```

        - u/MagicWeasel:
          ```
          yeah this is what my partner said:

          > If they had called it "society rejects science" or "a postmodernist world" or something like that, and left out the gendered stuff, I think this would actually be a reasonable scenario to consider within that timeframe
          ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    Some of these scenarios seem a lot more plausible if you just change the timelines slightly. Example: Everyone forgetting about the waste because bureaucracy seems unlikely in 100 years... but far more likely in (say) 500 years.
    ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      Also, I copied and pasted scenarios from other reports (...the link is a whole bunch of reports). Some of them are pretty good: https://pastebin.com/bRgM49fu

      This one's my favourite. WIPP is the name of the radioactive material storage facility:

      WIPP (hw;p), n. [prob. <Eng. whip in reference to ancient religious flagellation rites] Ancient 18th century A. D. (approx.) underground religious shrine in honor of the salt goddess. Care with which the facility was aligned vertically within the salt stratum, precise geometric layout, and inclusion of valuable transuranics show the esteem accorded the salt goddess. (Note: Some authorities believe the shrine layout is a stylized image of a mythic sea monster in reference to the salt in the oceans.)

  My character wants to be a serial killer vigilante (like Dexter) and kill criminals with her power. 

  She has a brother who is a police detective. How would she realistically find and scope out criminals to kill, without hanging around an alley waiting for a crime to happen?

  EDIT: There is also an existing serial killer (evil) who's operating in the city who she wants to hunt down. This killer skins his victims alive, and the police have been trying to catch him
  ```

    ```
    What's the nature of her power?  That could be a major factor.

  - u/Weerdo5255:
    ```
    Bounty hunting / wanted lists are viable to start with. Otherwise bugging a police station in some Podunk. Police do not routinely sweep ch for bugs / taps. 

    Is the focus on street crime or corporate / organized / government corruption?
    ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    Does her brother know about her power?

    Is he willing to help with her serial killer spree?

    The answers to these two questions can dramatically change her options.
    ```

    - u/Owent10:
      ```
      No, nobody knows about her power except a talking snake demon creature that emerges from her hair. 

      The brother would definitely not be willing to assist in anything criminal, and would arrest her
      ```

      - u/CCC_037:
        ```
        Then people turning unexpectedly to stone won't immediately get her brother on her trail.

        How fast can she turn someone to stone? Is it all-or-nothing? Are there other Magical People in the world? Can she turn her power off?
        ```

        - u/Owent10:
          ```
          Well after a string of criminals get stoned it'll probably be suspicious

          They get turned almost immediately, and she can't control her power yet so she wears an eyepatch at all times (it's only in one eye). 

          The serial killer she wants to hunt down has a leprosy-like skin disease but also the ability to regenerate his body, so he kills others and takes their skin to stay alive.
          ```

          - u/CCC_037:
            ```
            Oh, it'll be suspicious as anything. But it won't immediately link the matter to *her*.

            She is going to want to beware mirrors, and make sure not to use it when there's an innocent crow behind her target... is there a range to her power?
            ```

            - u/Owent10:
              ```
              The range would be as far as she could make out another person's eyes without it being blurry. 

              If the victim's vision is short-sighted for example and she is up close, the power would only be half as effective, and the victim would either be extremely paralysed or more likely the outer skin would be turned to stone, but the brain and internals would turn into a magma-like mess.

              EDIT: Here's some more information on the power

              > * To turn people to stone both subjects must have direct eye-contact with eachother. Transparent material like windows or glass also works as long as both subjects can see eachothers eyeballs. An army of 100 could be stoned as long as they're all looking at the eyeballs.
              * If the subject or user covers one eye closed, the subject is still stoned
              * The power works by just transforming the subjects atoms into "stone atoms"
              * Sunglasses don't work against it. The range of the power depends on the distance the subject and user can see eachother's eyeballs - if both have 20/20 vision it'll be further than if both are myopic.
              * Blind subjects aren't affected. Subjects with extremely blurred vision aren't affected until up close. Although some subjects with blurred vision, who can still see the eyeball - will turn half to stone and their skin will become hard and rock-like. The results are varied, gruesome and unpredictable
              * Camera and screen footage of the eyes will not stone the subject
              * No strenuous staring is needed
              * The power affects humans, animals and all creatures with eyes and sentience, so not bacteria.
              * The speed of the power is instant, maybe a millisecond, although it might take a second for the stone form to replace the skin.
              * Mirrors are deadly, and so the eyes must be protected with some opaque material. Although, the power can be controlled with training, and then is able to be switched on or off at will. Because of the shifting molecules - water reflections will not usually stone the user, but I wouldn't risk it.
              * Clothes are stoned too with the subject, and carried items that are smaller than the subject's size - swords, handbags are stoned. But not if the subject is just touching an object. If the subject is carrying another live being like a dog or baby, they are not stoned unless they are looking at the eyeballs too.
              * Once you're stoned you can't be un-stoned. The stone material is always the same standard rock.
              * When the power is activated, the eye may glimmer a little but is not very noticable
              * Often when the subject is stoned, they collapse to the ground as their balance isn't controlled. All of their internals are also turned to stone.
              * If the eyeballs are camoflagued/hidden or painted into a background, the subject must still recognise the individual eyeball itself to be stoned.
              * If the subject is pregnant, the baby will also be turned to stone
              * Once the eye is blinded - (by laser, looking at the sun) the power is deactivated. A successful operation to regain sight will restore the power
              * Eye operations like laser eye surgery present no affect on the power
              * Theoretically the eyeball could be experimented on to reproduce its effects, though little is known about this
              * The eyeballs must be connected to the user to work. It is possible for the eyeball to be transplanted to another user, but modern surgery is not there yet.
              ```

              - u/CCC_037:
                ```
                Her brother has contacts in the police force. One way for her to find out about crimes is by taking on some minor (possibly secretarial?) role in the station and just keeping her (unstoning) eye and ears open.

                Better yet, she can take on a minor role in the court system, and (mostly) limit herself to criminals who slip away from a Guilty verdict on a technicality.

                You're going to have to define exactly what is meant by 'standard rock'. Something igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic? Granite, gneiss, quartz, marble? Chalk, salt?

                ...diamond?

                It's more or less a case of "pick one". But bear in mind that almost all rocks are way heavier than the original people were - there may be recently-stoned people dropping through (weak) floors or out of trees or similar. (And if it was a TV show there would inevitably be one guy, at some point, who got stoned just *as* he was walking past a window so that he could dramatically fall out the building in front of everyone and *suddenly* the police are *super* interested in the question of who was in that building at ten minutes past four on Tuesday afternoon).

  ```
  So I am not sure if this really counts as world building or munchkinry, but I am posting it here because it's more world building for where it is in my process.

  Let's say that you - a rationalist - find yourself in 1990 with the following advantages:

  * You have worked out the rough trajectory of the future through intelligence (and a bit of luck).
     * What the internet will become.
     * Cell phone computers and 3d printing.
     * A guess about things like CRISPR and Deep Neural Networks.
     * Whatever else you can reasonably expect someone to have predicted about things that exist today (perhaps in prototype form) if they were very lucky.
  * In 1995 you will have approximately 5 billion dollars in assets. And a liquid income from your primary venture (some sort of technology company) in at-least the billion dollar range every year following.
  * Given your ability to project out what the future will be like, you have the ability to reach it sooner for cheaper.
  * No moral or ethical boundaries.
  * A small group of deeply loyal people who will do anything you ask.

  Now here is the problem:

  * You believe super-scaling AI will destroy humanity. You believe that this must be stopped.
  * You believe super-scaling AI will first be achievable by 2020, this is your hard cut off for any plans, you have 30 years, 25 years with money.
     * You believe publicly releasing any projected technological advances you have made early would be detrimental to this number, so you will not do it unless necessary and only in a strictly controlled fashion.
  * You believe that any attempt at social, political, cultural, or other soft power solution will not be enough to prevent super scaling AI from being created.
     * They may be useful tools, but in general any solution relying on them you believe will eventually fail.
  * The solution must survive your lifetime. Any self sustaining human structure would be inadequate (re: the previous), it must either prevent super-scaling AI or push the problem back by a significant amount.
     * Some sort of semi-permanent progress toward preventing super scaling AI must have been made.
  * Humanity must exist in some self-sustaining form.
     * Preferably space faring.
     * Your own, or anyone's, survival is not particularly important.

  What do you do?

  (I have my own thoughts and solutions, I am curious what others would do/think).
  ```

  - u/Weerdo5255:
    ```
    Well, the most definite solution without ethics is a nuclear world war. Kill all progress and advanced technology. 

    Utilize your assets to create an enclave, possibly several, and institute a philosophy / religious doctrine to avoid AI development. 

    Without this drastic an action, I see two possibilities. 

    Push Human uploading as much as possible, as an alternate to any problem you might want to solve with an AGI. Digital Humans will still be bound by familiar thought patterns. 

    You need to create an alternate AI you have to trust with the sole goal to kill any competitors. 

    Any other action will delay development. By 2040 computation will be developed enough for an independent actor without aide to develop an AGI.
