## Did you have to read animorphs to enjoy animorphs the reckoning?

### Post:

Never read the original material, but I see it recommend.

  The source material varies wildly between great for YA fiction and sheer "what the fuck" (blame the ghost writers), it's worth reading on its own merits if you have the time. You can get them free [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animorphs/comments/3litxl/reformatted_ebook_editions_download_links/); the author has [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/gzhau/iam_ka_applegate_author_of_animorphs_and_many/c1rfte1/?context=3) this is ok for any mods giving me the side-eye right now.

  I enjoyed the fanfic without having any knowledge whatsoever about the source material. If you're asking whether it is good to someone who hasn't read the books but likes ratfic, then the answer is a definite yes. (Though you should know that it is not yet complete and only has a few more chapters to go, so you may want to wait before reading.)

  BTW, after catching up to the latest chapter, I decided to have a quick look at the original books to see just how different the author made it and was surprised to find that several things that I had assumed were only in the fanfic actually had correlates in the canon books. The source material apparently had a lot more depth than you might first assume from looking at the book cover illustrations.

    The original Animorphs was great for what it was. Sure it suffered from having a monster of the week formula and also incompetent villain characters, but it also didn't hold back from exploring the human condition, the horrors of war, unique alien concepts, moral dillemas, and so on

      It had one incompetent main villain (who was the Peter Principle meets “you have failed me, so die”), and one competent main villain, who is hamstrung by the first villain getting to take over her magnus opus, and by bureaucracy, which leads to >!the incompetent villain having her executed!< setting off the final arc of the series.

      A big overarching theme was actually the way that bureaucratic incompetence and prejudice that the Yeerks inherent from >!the Andalites!< who >!uplifted then from semi-symbiotic hunter-gatherers!< leads to their downfall. The original series is quite good if you like rationalist fiction.

  If you want to know what happens in the original series but don’t actually want to read the books here’s an entertaining audio lecture summarizing the plot: https://youtu.be/6zrE6m3xOoE

  Current consensus is "You can enjoy it even if you don't know Animorphs".

  Also, it's funny, we're getting a lot of The Reckoning threads these days.

      We all pray for the rain which is decent rational fiction.

  No you don't need to know anything about the original. Yes it is that good.

  Imo it's way better than the originals. This fanfic has sort of supplanted the canon material in my head and I don't remember much of the originals now.
