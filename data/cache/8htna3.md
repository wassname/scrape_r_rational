## Finding some old articles

### Post:

I remember reading on here a while back about a series of articles, and I can't find them anymore. They were about analyzing D&D/generic fantasy tropes, about the economic choices of the town near a dungeon, or the unsustainability of murderhobos. I remember it seemed to have a dedicated site, and they may have been accompanied by title-bar illustrations?

If anyone knew where to find them, I would appreciate it.

  It's part of the website [Critical Hits](http://www.critical-hits.com/features/dungeonomics-bibliography/) where the author loves to imagine how the economics of a DnD setting would work.

  There's also the book, [Orconomics](https://smile.amazon.com/Orconomics-Satire-Dark-Profit-Saga-ebook/dp/B00O2NDJ2M/), which is about a similar topic.

  Here's the [review](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/56r15v/dcrtbook_orconomics/) of the book that was posted to this subreddit.

    I think it was the Critical Hits? I'll let you know in a while. 

    Edit: Yes it was, thanks.
