## An SMBC that's quite relevant to rational fantasy stories in particular, and rational stories in general

  Well if we are doing SMBC now:

    I think the main part missing here is where they pay him an obscene amount of cash (even a tiny fraction of what he's producing would go a long way) so when he gets replaced he can retire in luxury and doesn't need a new job.
    ```

    - u/Evan_Th:
      ```
      Maybe they did and he still felt lost without a purpose to his life?  I mean, canonically, he went so far as to get a day job with a newspaper rather than lounge about.
      ```

      - u/CeruleanTresses:
        ```
        Why would he even need to lounge about? He could just do even more superheroing instead.
        ```

        - u/Evan_Th:
          ```
          Where?  The comic shows him trying - but there wasn't any opportunity.
          ```

          - u/CeruleanTresses:
            ```
            Wait, are we talking about the SMBC strip or the Superman canon? Since you said canonically, I thought you were talking about the Superman canon, where he has a day job at a newspaper when he could be spending that time helping people.
            ```

            - u/Evan_Th:
              ```
              Oops, I misunderstood what you were talking about!  You're right; as far as I know (which isn't very far...), the comics never really address that issue.
              ```

                Its definitely a case where it depends on the writer, but the standard explanation is that Superman is still very human-like in how his brain operates.  In some cases he can perform feats of mental fortitude that surpass humans, but he still has limits.  Essentially, he doesn't just, "Do more superheroing instead," for the same reason most of us can't sit down and do our jobs for sixteen hours a day, seven days a week.  It has bad side effects for your mental health.  This fact that he can't just be everywhere at once and do everything he wishes he could even though he is capable of doing much more than a normal person tends to be at the core of most well written Superman stories (although the example of why he spends time at the Daily Planet is rarely addressed directly).

    On the other hand, SMBC has Thouroughly established that Supes is Evil ^^[[1]](http://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2005-11-10)[[2]](http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=3588)[[3]](http://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2015-02-10)[[4]](http://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2009-07-25)[[5]](http://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2008-05-13)[[6]](http://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2010-08-21) , soooo...

  there is a story somewhere that had a word with a periodic problem with an adapting evil force and resorted to summon a hero every time. 

  turns out that world was the result of anthropic bias and 9 out of 10 heroes actually failed and that world ended.

    [The Hero With A Thousand Chances by Eliezer Yudkowsky](http://lesswrong.com/lw/14h/the_hero_with_a_thousand_chances/), I assume? I really liked that the first time I read it, but it doesn't have the same rereading power as something like *Three Worlds Collide*.
    ```

    - u/puesyomero:
      ```
      that's the one. I did not even see who the author was till the end when the vocabulary started to get wordy and it all made sense.  :)

      - u/Krossfireo:

        Yeah, EY writes some great stuff, but sometimes he needs a solid editor to get some of the cruft out
        ```

    - u/dalr3th1n:
      ```
      He also wrote "A girl corrupted by the Internet is the summoned hero?" which is another interesting rational take on the same trope.
      ```

  - u/LupoCani:
    ```
    Um,  I just stumbled upon this while browsing /r/rational top-of-all-time. Could you perhaps spoiler-tag that last part?
    ```

- u/Dwood15:
  ```
  I mean, they have a point...
  ```

- u/Aegeus:
  ```
  Yeah, but when a hero *doesn't* answer the call to adventure, it usually results in his village getting burned down, so he probably made the right choice.

  He had me at panel 3.
