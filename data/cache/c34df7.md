## Modern day to near future uplift fiction?

### Post:

Looking for books/web novels that focus on how a roughly current day society transitions to some sort of futuristic sci-fi or magical based world. Mostly focused on books that focus on the specific technology or magic involved, rather than more general character dramas.

Examples roughly in this category include the Bobiverse, Live Free or Die, With This Ring, The Gam3, Legend of Randidly Ghosthound, etc.

My most recent find was called [Micro Gates](https://storiesonline.net/s/17944/micro-gates) (Warning hosted on NSFW erotic fiction website. Though the story itself has no sexual content)

Basically any book where current society moves drastically in a new and fantastical direction.

I've read several traditional uplift stores like Release that Witch and A Hero's war, but right now I'm more interested in current day rather than medieval-type societies.

Book does not need to be published or originally written in english, or finished (as long as it has a fair chunk of content).

Any recommendations?

  [Ra](http://qntm.org/ra) is about a world where magic is an advanced branch of mathematics/computer science, discovered in the late '70s. Mages are by necessity the smartest people in the world.

  [Accelerando by Charles Stross](https://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando-intro.html).  Follows several generations from from the near future as humanity masters upload and space technology.  Some character drama, but it's more about hinting at the sort of things people have drama over in the future.  To give one minor, spoilery example, dude and his girlfriend (both uploaded) swap genders to have sex, just to try it, and there's maybe 2 sentences of the dude feeling uncomfortable about it.

  [Fall; or, Dodge in Hell](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35429993-fall-or-dodge-in-hell) by Neal Stephenson is upload fiction. I'm half way through and enjoying it so far. It has a definite mythological feel to it, with the new digital souls forging a new world and, due to fractured memories, not really understanding what they are doing. As a result, they tend to act like primordial creator gods.

  I just finished reading this. Kinda not the point of the thread, but thanks for the recommendation.

    The other book by the author was pretty decent too, but not nearly as science focused

      I wanted to enjoy micro gates, but the writing was just not very good. It was a very good example of "Show, dont tell." It was really painful to read.

  The earliest example that I can think of is Poul Anderson's [Brain Wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_Wave), which starts with everyone living on Earth suddenly becoming superintelligent.

  The linked Wikipedia article says that it was "one of many science fiction works written at this time on the theme of heightened intelligence", which is true enough, but I can't think of any other contemporary novel-length book which explored the consequences of planet-wide superintelligence.

  Note, however, that it doesn't "focus on the specific technology or magic involved".

    Reading the character list, I have to wonder how well its social views have aged.
