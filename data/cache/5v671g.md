  Thanks for compiling them together, this is fantastic! They really do look professional. Reading in an ebook format is so much better.

  If anyone's interested I also took the liberty of making an [epub format](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxFRUeX-WeaheElUY05yU2U0d28) of Scott Alexander's fiction based [on this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/3u39yg/a_collection_of_scott_alexanders_literary_works/). Format might be a little wonky here and there, but it's all there.

  Also, check out [Library of Scott Alexandria](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/s41f86peq43i5kj/AADBfdshyF61mXj28xL5o84ca?dl=0) while you guys are at it.
