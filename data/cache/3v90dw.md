## Metropolitan Man ruined my hype for Batman Vs. Superman [D]

### Post:

/u/alexanderwales wrote the defining piece about how I approach any DC universe work, and now I can't approach it at all.

In the new trailer, it seems Batman clearly articulates Wales's Lex Luthor's primary concern: Superman is an existential threat to humanity, and must be destroyed. This motivating factor is explicitly stated in the newest movie trailer, and is explicitly stated in Metropolitan Man. 

Yet, it is obvious that is where the two diverge. While Lex daftly maneuvers around the Kryptonian in the fan fiction, it is obvious that Lex Zuckerberg and Batman only know how to use force. They will not find out Superman's weaknesses by probing at the edge of his powers. They will attempt to destroy him by (1) building a better batsuit and when that fails (2) making an even more powerful existential threat. Batman will switch to Superman's side to defeat this Big Bad along with the help of Wonder Woman. 

That is, the power balance will be changed and *the side that can punch harder will win*. 

God. It could be a good movie, too. It could have a good script and good action and not be as dark-and-edgy as its going for... but Metropolitan Man will always be in the back of my mind saying "this is dumb. hey. this is dumb."

  The truly shameful thing is that they had two sensible paths they could have chosen.  Either take the Metropolitan Man route, and write something that *isn't* dumb, or knowingly, openly write something dumb, something where your brain can tune out while some neat nonsense action scenes play.   And instead they chose to do the latter dressed up as the former, and, as is often the case, the refusal to specialize causes efficiency to hit rock bottom.
  ```

  - u/KharakIsBurning:
    ```
    I think one thing may be just the nature of film: it's an extremely emotional medium. Batman can't be driven by cold calculation. Lex can't be driven by calculation. Batman must be motivated by visible anger- something you can see on the actor's face. Lex has to be motivated by greed.  In fact, I'd put money on him literally being told to his face in the movie that he is greedy.
    ```

    - u/duffmancd:
      ```
      Just because film is an emotional medium doesn't mean that the characters have to be driven by simple emotions. We could have seen this from Batman's point of view, the destruction wrought by Superman even as he battled Zod. The casual, offhand, collateral damage. We see and understand his fear. Then he has  to be pleasant to the existential threat, whilst planning his defeat.

      Of course this would mean that you'd have to completely change the genre from comic book beat'em up to character driven thriller. You might have one big fight at the end for the movie's sake with batman going through a mad scramble of more and more desperate gambles. But you don't want to fail to take out the planet-killer.

      (Thinking out loud) Though I guess you could have Superman untouched and merciful at the end if the fight (now in the middle of the movie). If you wanted to try and get as close to canon situations at the end, Bruce and Lex may have originally been working together (with separate cell structures in case one is compromised) but when their last ditch efforts prove fruitless, Bruce realises that it's better to have the Superman on your side, while Lex doubles down and can't handle the risk he poses. Bruce gets proved right as the world needs Supes to protect against some huge alien attack, just as Lex attacks again (unfortunate timing) and Batman has to take care of one problem while Supes deals with the other. The movie is not so much about Superman as it is about how Bruce and Lex react to him, Supes is the force-of-nature from Greek play. This way we get to focus on the human emotions rather than whatever Superman feels.

      Mh. Ozymandias in watchmen very readily portrayed the "cold calculating" thing; but also had hugely less screentime than eg. batman in a batman movie.

          Its a very close replication of the comic actually. The only other superhero movie that comes close (I think even surpasses it!) in terms of cinematographic prowess is the original "dark knight". 

          Also has some some very nice game theoretic lessons shoved in the audiences face :D

            Well, except for the part where they completely changed Ozymandias's plan, and the new version wasn't well set up in-story. But yes, the rest of it was very faithful, and really well done.

              Movie Ozy plan is actually kinda better than the original comic book plan IMO. Less convoluted, comick-y, 70-year-ish tentacle monster invasion-y... That the presented enemy is (fundamentally) human reinforces the other message of the movie about the trouble humans have with coordination among themselfes. 

              Though as to your argument of "not well set up" - well its been a bit but the tentacle monsters arent set up at all either IIRC, and there is some foreshadowing in the movie.
              ```

              - u/eaglejarl:
                ```
                >  "not well set up" 

                The problem is that Ozy's new plan depends on "this energy has Doctor M's signature" but (AFAIR) there is never any discussion of Doctor M *having* a signature, nor is there any clear evidence why he should.
                ```

              - u/Uncaffeinated:
                ```
                The tentacle monsters are technically foreshadowed in the comics, but they understandably had to cut all that for time in the movie.

                [Watchmen](#s "Specially, the whole pirate comic subplot, followed by the mention that the comic artists mysteriously disappeared. There's also the mention of Comedian going to an island in Cuba and seeing something strange."). It's not particularly great foreshadowing, but it's there.

  So.  /u/KharakIsBurning, you have begun to suspect the terrible secret of rational fiction,  that most people never even realize that competence is possible.  Now you have a choice to make.  Take the blue mnestic, and [\[REDACTED\]](#s "████████████████████").  You'll be happy, we hope.

  Or take the red nootropic, and [\[REDACTED\]](#s "No shortcuts, you have to work it out for yourself.").

  (Yes, rational fiction is a memetic hazard, in some circumstances.  So is every interesting idea though.)

  >Metropolitan Man ruined my hype for Batman Vs. Superman

  I think the formula can be expanded to 

  [the best from what much larger online communities have to offer] ruins [work of a much smaller group of professional writers]

  * Tvtropes makes it hard to ignore how repetitive and poorly written general flicks are;
  * SCP makes most of horror films look boring;
  * the best of fanfics make the canon scripts look underwhelming.

  The effect worsens when the producers are being lazy or afraid to create something new. Both Batman’s and Superman’s frenchises are 80 years old by now, they should be sent to a [retirement home for fictional characters,](http://imgur.com/lc0EJUm) not get new blockbusters every several years.

      There’s a saying that translates into English like “to make candy out of crap”, meaning to make something good from bad-quality source material.

      Nolan has been working miracles with the initially bad source material that’s the Batman franchise. But I think the series that he’s essentially been working with for half of his career would’ve been [much greater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_%28film%29) if the filming industry had better working patterns for discovering successful, yet original long-lasting ideas instead of repeatedly falling back to older ones (e.g. Spider-Man and X-Men are only 20 years younger).

  Branches on the Tree of Time completely ruined any future Terminator movies (as if the new ones weren't already terrible), and just made Genisys seem like even more of an incoherent mess of nonsense and wasted opportunities.

  But then, part of the reason I write and read rational fiction in the first place is that most normal fiction tends to leave me with a sore forehead.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    I want to rewrite Genisys at some point. It had a number of ideas that I really liked (Sarah Connor being raised by a terminator, Kyle going back in time to save a woman that ends up being more badass than him, Skynet trying to assimilate humanity into its design in order to cover its weaknesses). It just failed at a lot of the things it was trying to do.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      If you haven't already seriously considered trying to get Branches into the hands of whoever looks at Terminator scripts, I would devote at least an hour a week for maybe a couple months figuring out how to make that happen. Have you ever written a screenplay before? They're surprisingly fun (in my experience), and stranger things have happened (the movie being made about the modern army being dropped into Roman times from that Reddit post comes to mind).

        Angular momentum is not conserved. The astronauts navigating the ship head-first reach out to the walls and push towards their legs, which would add energy to their rotation in a "leaning-back" direction. The weightless center transitioning to the centrifugal spokes was very cool, though I bet if they actually showed the transition, they would ignore Coriolis forces.

        The ridiculous-definition video chat has no interface and Cisco is branded in the upper right corner of the screen.

        Pictures from Sojourner are constructed on the screen as jumbled overlapping views into the actual image that are then reassembled. This was particularly pointless; the next one actually had some use in pacing of the scene.

        The hex editor Johansen uses to examine the non-image sent to the ship does not include an ASCII view, when an ASCII pane is a virtual standard, in every hex editor since Adam. She is able to identify it as "not an image file" simply looking at the hex. Then, when the plaintext file is opened (how can she open it without knowing what it is?), it types itself out on screen with formatting.

        The spacewalk to put the bomb on the lock door would at least involve a tether and carabiner, instead of the 6DOF thriller-level intensity that was displayed (a dive straight into the spinning spokes of the grav ring?). I don't think a spacewalk would have been necessary at all.

        The Iron Man scene was created for the movie wholesale (it was mentioned as a *joke*), and would be fatally dangerous as Watney admits in the book. Angular momentum is not conserved during this stunt either; he punches a hole in the glove of his suit and holds it out to his side, and does not turn into a whirling dervish as would actually happen. Torque has been beaten bloody and bruised in this movie.

        Lewis, the *Commander,* would not risk herself personally to retrieve Watney when she needs to be coordinating the operation over radio. Beck was the one who tethered out to Watney in the book.

        When Watney and Lewis are getting wrapped in the tether, pulling each other closer as though they were trying to kiss through their helmets (I ship it), AM is similarly not conserved, as their rotation should speed up when their distance decreases.

        And finally...

        THERE IS NO SOUND IN SPACE! Silent space in exterior shots and the limited ambient sound inside your helmet in POV shots is such a nice effect, but no.

I just don't think it would've lasted, especially once the cost of retrieving Mark Watney started escalating into the tens of millions.

  > That is, the power balance will be changed and *the side that can punch harder will win.*

  This is one of the reasons that I've always hated kryptonite. If the weakest Superman stories are something like, "Look how hard Superman can punch! Can he punch hard enough to destroy that thing? Between Superman and the villain, who is the harder puncher?" then kryptonite is just "Look at this drama that happens when Superman can't punch so hard anymore!" Basically, a failure mode for Superman stories is that they're about Superman being strong, and the solution to that is to take away his strength, which you do with kryptonite. So kryptonite usually indicates a weak story, because it's about punching things instead of better questions (like a vigilante's place in a system of law and order, or how to be good, or the need to balance altruistic sacrifice against personal fulfillment).

  It's worth noting that Nolan's Batman _isn't_ "the World's Greatest Detective".  He's very smart, and good at seeing multiple uses for technology.  It's not _that_ out of character for BatGrimm to see Supes as an opportunity to play Iron Man.

  ```
  Obviously, I haven't seen the movie yet, but it seems likely that this could be explained as point-in-time difference. In MM, Luthor's endgame was still force -- make a Kryptonite bullet, shoot Superman in the face after weakening him. In BvS, the endgame is kill him with armor. The difference is that MM focuses on the investigation, whereas BvS (presumably) starts after the investigation is over. Which is reasonable, since the very first thing that Batman always does when a new hero shows up is figure out how to put them down if it becomes necessary. 

  The story is based on an actual comic. In it, an old Batman uses various distractions to get Superman so distracted that Green Arrow can shoot him with a Kryptonite arrow. The missile, the tank, the armor -- they aren't meant to beat him, they're meant to get him in position and distracted enough not to hear Ollie getting set up and/or dodge the shot. I'm sure Batman took some satisfaction in kicking Superman around, but it was still fundamentally a distraction. 

  The trailer I saw had Doomsday showing up, but didn't say that Luthor built him. Is that confirmed elsewhere?

    It is heavily implied in the 3 min trailer. Biggest evidence, to me, is when Luthor says, "If man won't kill God, the devil will do it" overlaid with footage of General Zod's corpse being revealed and a bunch of standard electric, sciencey shit.

    Edit: also, MM Luthor's force ending was force along the line of doing surgery with a scalpel vs. a mallet. In the end, it was Luthor's many contingencies that gave him the window with which to apply said force. As opposed to the open combat type setting chosen by batman and luthor in the new VS movie

  I never had hope for this movie. I was going to go watch it anyways, expecting a depressing slide into mind-numbing boredom as I watched poorly written action and character development. 

  I never thought to compare it to Metropolitian Man. Now I'll have such a comparison in my head. Forever. So thank you. For freeing me.

  [The Fall of Doc Future](http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents) did this for the Flash TV show for me. I can still enjoy it, but it's hard to praise it.

  Zack Snyder ruined my hype for Batman Vs. Superman.
