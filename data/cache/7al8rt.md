## [RT] Ascent Short Stories

### Post:

By request, I have now reposted all of the Ascent universe stories on [my site](https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/) in chronological order. You can find them here or on the sidebar;


[The Facilitator](https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/the-facilitator-2099/): At the tail end of the 21st century, even AI designers are struggling to find work. Renée Souvicou is out of luck, out of money and running out of time. Her half-finished creation, the Facilitator, is her last chance to avoid a life of mediocrity. But she's about to discover success can be far more terrifying than failure.


[The Utilitaria](https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/the-utilitaria-2112/): A hundred years from now, the fuse has been lit. Superintelligent AI has finally arrived and the possibilities it presents are boundless. As the Earth waits far below, René Souvicou and the crew of Pantheon station have one chance to shape the future of everything.


[Starwhisp](https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/starwhisp-2310/): Humanity's first interstellar mission may also be its last, as the crew of the Starwhisp discover something truly unexpected.


[The Director](https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/the-director-2409/): Director Meyer discovers his position is far less secure than he imagined.

[Ascent](https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/2017/09/28/chapter-1-necessity/): On a ruined Earth, the lives of two very different men collide. A revolution is brewing - it might free humanity from its prison or finally bring about the long overdue apocalypse. 

[Bows and Arrows against the Lightning](https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/bows-and-arrows-against-the-lightning-2904/): In the far future, humanity makes its first stand against the unstoppable Apathy.


Opinions and feedback would be welcome!

  Very neat. I’m confused on who the Apathy is-have they been mentioned anywhere else? But other than that, I found them quite enjoyable. 

  Edit: Oh, there’s a whole series! Now I feel silly.

    There is an awful lot of history between Ascent and 2904, when that story is set. The Apathy's origin is something I'll explore eventually.
