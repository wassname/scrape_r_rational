## [Q][D] Does scifi with non-human protagonists and antagonists exist?

### Post:

I'm looking for any story/book/film where the lead characters:

- are not human
- have never been human (Looking at you, *Avatar*)
- are preferably not humanoid

This applies to the protagonists, antagonists, deuteragonists, and really every character you normally see. Humans can be a part of the setting, but their role in the plot is at most minor. POV Aliens responding to a human invasion doesn't count, because the humans are an antagonist. Humans coming to save the day doesn't count. (Bonus paradox points if you find something in /r/hfy that satisfies these criteria.)

I'm asking here because I think /r/rational readers will probably have read a wider selection of stories, or will at least be able to point me to the correct forum.

  Greg Egan does this. I don't believe that any character in his novel Incandescence would count as a human but it's been a while since I read that one. I haven't read his Orthogonal trilogy yet but I don't think there are any humans in it either. Depending on whether or not conscious beings who are software and have always been software count, many other stories would qualify.

    Orthogonal definitely qualifies.  There's nothing resembling humans.  It's not even in a universe remotely like ours.

    Incandescence sort of qualifies.  The Amalgam civilization (expanded on in a couple of short stories) is at least partially descended from humans, and I recall one of the main characters having some human ancestry.  But the chapters from the "aliens'" point of view definitely qualifies.

  *The Gods Themselves*, by Isaac Asimov, is made of three related storylines whose respective characters don't cross over. The second storyline is from the perspective of the aliens, who only interact with the humans one or two times, via remote signals.

  And here's another one, Ted Chiang's short story Exhalation.

  They're made it of meat (http://www.terrybisson.com/page6/page6.html) is a classic one

  The novel version of Nightfall, by Isaac Asimov and I think Robert Silverberg, opens with a note that "actually everyone involved looks like a tentacle monster, but we'll narrate as if they're humans for the same reason we translated their speech into English."

  And then their body type goes on to be completely irrelevant as promised, but their *mind* types are *suspiciously* humanlike.

  Watership Down. No, seriously.

  Oh I just realized in case you did not notice your asking for this in particular.
  [TVTROPES:Xenofiction](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Xenofiction)

  Most Pixar movies satisfy this... although whether the characters are fish, robots, toys, or monsters, they unfortunately act 100% human.

  [Deep Rise](http://mspaforums.com/showthread.php?46308-Deep-Rise-An-Illustrated-Xenofiction-Adventure) is a forum adventure by /u/Nighzmarquls that I think does a good job at being alien. Warning though, it goes to deep, dark, weird places.
  ```

  - u/Nighzmarquls:
    ```
    Oh hey thanks ! and yeah I actually made the species I wrote deeprise about specifically as a 'open species' for anyone else to use for their own fiction in case some one needed an alien species.
    ```

  ```
  Greg Egan's _Orthogonal_ trilogy takes place in a universe with different physics where humans are literally impossible.

  Greg Egan's sci-fi is almost as hard as Arthur C. Clarke's.
