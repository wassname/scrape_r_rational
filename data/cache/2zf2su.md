## [MK][D] Munchkin yourself into omnipotence in the cannon HP-verse

### Post:

Seeing how Methods has ended, we might as well do another HP munchkin thread. This time there's a specific goal: become a god. Assume that you are already the undisputed god-emperor of humanity and wizards (not that one) via fidelius, felix felix, grey goo imperius, or any other the many other options available to you.

EDIT: your goal is to achieve omnipotence or the closest possible approximation. The world is not enough.

  The problem with this kind of thing is that canon HP mechanics were more or less pulled out of Rowling's ass as she needed them. They're not really complete, explained, or consistent.

  In order to really, properly cease being 'mortal' you need to step outside the confines of canon magic lore and start making things up.

  ```
  Work out how to apply Room of Requirement enchantments tailored to me all over the planet. Alternately use the spatial manipulation it exhibits to create a personal sub dimension of arbitrary size and controlled by my will where I am god.
  ```

    ```
    Alright, this one wins.
    ```

    ```
    ...Or just think, "I need a room that contains a device that will bring me to omnipotence..."
    ```

- u/upsilonmeta:
  ```
  Considering that Felix Felicis is essentially a PtV:

  1. Drink Felix Felicis

  2. Path to omnipotence or the closest approximation thereof?

  I'm already god, then.

  Step 1. Gray goo imperius to gain control of the entire human race and, most notably, the folks at MIRI.

  Step 2. Feed them a few gallons of Liquid Luck so they successfully create a Friendly AI that is fanatically loyal to me personally.

  Step 3. Become god.

  Step 4. ???

  Step 5. Profit!  (Also, use my omnipotence to undo whatever harmful effects (up to and including death) are caused by using such large amounts of Liquid Luck.)
  ```

  - u/notentirelyrandom:
    ```
    I am pretty sure that MIRI + liquid luck would be more likely to result in a *Friendly* AI than a fanatically-loyal-to-you AI.
    ```

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      I did specify both.
      ```

- u/MugaSofer:
  ```
  Create a bunch of portraits of myself in this situation, creating a bunch of portraits. Then paint in something that gives them godlike powers within the world of the portraits. (Probably wouldn't work.)

  I could probably set up a time-turner-based arbitrary answer machine using some sort of minions that couldn't be scared out of it. But ... precommitting to an action that would almost certainly cause a paradox seems like a Bad Idea if the universe timelessly prevents paradoxes from happening.

  Can't hurt to look into whether you can pull off an intelligence explosion with wit-sharpening potions or *felix felicis* or whatever, but I doubt you can - the mechanics of them are unclear, but it hasn't happened *yet*, so ...

  Use magic to fork my consciousness - could use a Horcrux, if I have to, too lazy to figure out an easier way here - and use the various mind-affecting magics to turn one of them into a much better person. (Actually, assuming I'm not a psychopath, might be a good idea to do that to myself anyway to be a better God-Emperor to my subjects?) Chuck good!me through the Veil to whatever afterlife awaits.

  Re-authorize long-term timetravel research (banned according to Pottermore because they're afraid of changing the past after There Was An Incident, but I just want to *see* the past, pretty much) and find the Source of Magic, or whatever it is that created magical creatures. Copy that.

  Check if Boggarts can create super-powerful magic if that's what you're afraid of - boggart!Dementors have fear auras, so maybe? But Lupin implied a boggart!Dementor was less powerful, so probably not.

  The rules for magic-item creation are unclear, but they seem to be capable of pretty much the same things as regular magic (Room of Requirement can't create food, Fred and George made shield-charm hats.) So ... "only" teleportation, matter transmutation, and time travel. Oh, and mind control and creating servitors immortality and telekinesis and all sorts of magical sensors and... enough Moody-style cyborging up, with magitech created by mind-controlled Fred-and-George equivelents, and you're basically a god.
  ```

  ```
  Define god.
  ```

- u/Jarnagua:
  ```
  Transfigure my skeleton into computronium and have some BS way of interfacing with & powering it.
  ```
