## [BST][TH][SF] I'm working on a fiction book about defeating aging. What issues do you think are important to address in such a book?

### Post:

There's a website for it, if you want to get updated on the progress. :)

  It's good to see it confront some of the big problems people cite- older individuals taking positions of power in the economy, lack of innovation, people who are too old for easy treatment with anti aging serums, and seeing those challenges being overcome. 

  It'll be good to see the before and after. People mourning after losing parents to degenerative diseases and aging related sicknesses, and how they feel after it's ended.

  Deal with how people handle those who died of aging before the treatments.

  It'll be good to see some of the hypocrisy of people- the super rich who are morally against it seeking secret anti aging treatments.

  It'll be good to see the old be restored to good health, enjoying physically and mentally intense adventures again.

    That's actually the story I'm writing right now! About a man deal with his father being the last person on earth to die of old age.

      I assume this is in a third-world country with no access to current medications?  The story of the last smallpox death provides an excellent example.

  Overpopulation, food, rejuvenation disparity via wealth, possibly even as a means to curtail the first two.

  An implantation of Methuselah-level economic and political leaders, not only due to dividends, interest, and accumulation greater than dispersal, but due to an appalling dearth of redistribution that began with the death of inheritance and inheritance taxes.

  EDIT: I'm going to assume I've been downvoted for implying redistribution is a good thing, as I have yet to receive a reply.

    Not sure why you're being downvoted, it's a good topic to cover. Thanks. :)

  1. You would need to address overpopulation immediately. I'd almost say you should address it before you release such a cure. I think somewhere around 15-ish people die every 10 seconds, and like 20 are born (super rough numbers, obviously) Not all of that is due to aging, but I'm sure a good portion of it is due to aging and diseases that would be cured by an aging cure. We'd run into scarcity problems after a few decades. Addressing it, in and of itself though, is tricky, as having babies is one of those things that people feel they should be in total control of, so any obvious attempts to curb that will be protested heavily.

  2. How easy is this to produce? How expensive is it? Who's controlling such a cure? Something like this in the hands of someone who isn't very altruistic could have terrible consequences. I'm vaguely reminded of the rich people in *In Time*, that Justin Timberlake movie where time is currency, and everyone just stops physically aging at 25. They just live for centuries and keep a forced monopoly on stored time, enforcing the aristocracy.

    Overpopulation solves itself.

    Plus as long as human output over a lifetime is more than their input then overpopulation is a non-existence problem at large enough scale, until you reach the energy cap of the universe being consumed obviously.

    If you do have a cure for aging, do not wait to "solve" overpopulation so millions and billions can die while you wait for a solution.
    ```

    - u/Kishoto:
      ```
      Please explain to me how overpopulation solves itself. I heavily disagree, but am capable of being convinced if your argument is valid.


      The earth is finite. We're heavily reliant on fossil fuels, despite all of the research that proves this may not be the best idea.  We don't currently have the technology to create sustainable habitats for humans on other astrological bodies, and we're decades away from such technology (unless something sparks a technological revolution of some sort)

        If the population is unsustainable people die until it is sustainable.

        >The earth is finite. 

        We're not locked on the Earth, none the less we are not a Type I civilization, plus even if we stay on Earth you've got that classic quote that the sun delivers more energy to Earth in an hour than we use in a year.

        > We're heavily reliant on fossil fuels, despite all of the research that proves this may not be the best idea. We don't currently have the technology to create sustainable habitats for humans on other astrological bodies, and we're decades away from such technology (unless something sparks a technological revolution of some sort)

        1) There is almost zero economical or personal incentive to do those things. The immediate immortality of all people changes that.

        2) We can create inefficient sustainable habitats, enough solar panels can fuel anything. We already know all the theory behind mining such that there's even a few companies already out there. Just because we haven't built such a thing yet doesn't mean we couldn't.

        3) Immortality would spark a technological revolution, there's not a larger incentive to develop sustainability or a quicker method of leaving than the surety that you have to suffer the downsides (rather than great great grandchildren). Plus however much output is invested in afterlife based religions which would I presume fall apart in immortality (people are unwilling to kill/delibrately endanger themselves with lifespan to get into afterlife) and other things like the death and health industry which are fueled by aging and aging related problems.

          Doesn't that kind of defy the point of stopping aging in the first place?

            Presuming it isn't immune to death in which case overpopulation isn't an issue since people  don't need food or water or anything to live.

            Creatures don't die from aging in overpopulation they die from starvation.

              ```
              No, okay. Let me try. The point of curing aging is stopping people from dying. The long-term goal is for no one to die anymore, because death is bad. Ergo, any 'solution' to overpopulation that involves people dying, while technically valid, is still counterproductive and not the kind of solution we want to settle with or work towards.

              Again, the real, long-term goal is total immortality for everyone who wants it. Not just young people who still die.

    Same thought. But someone seems to be downvoting people who point the potential disparity out, without actually saying anything.

  If you haven't yet, immediately read Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars Trilogy. The aging problems start in *Red Mars* and only get worse in *Green Mars* and *Blue Mars*. This is a world where people there's an effective anti-aging treatment, but it's not perfect, and can't solve all problems.

  Some issues addressed in the book:

  - Mourning people who die young, though accidents or disease
  - Children who watch adults die 'early', when they had been told that people could live forever.
  - People whose bodies longer than their brains can continue functioning, and people who are living through this process, realizing that it is happening to them.
  - People who refuse to get the anti-aging treatment.
  - Socioeconomic and political effects of having an ever-increasing population, many of whom might not be able to find jobs because the experienced workers aren't retiring.
  - People coming out of retirement to work.
  - People deciding not to have kids.
  - Resource production and distribution, especially as regards food and shelter.
  - Class warfare, if the thing that defeats aging is not widely available.
  ```

- u/xamueljones:
  ```
  Don't forget to include how the major religions would try to adapt to mortals gaining immortality as well as people handling the revelation of a cure for ageing on a personal level especially among the poor who have very low QALYs and wouldn't necessarily have a life they want to keep living.

  This would be a great place to finally talk about Eliezer's [Fun Theory](http://lesswrong.com/lw/xy/the_fun_theory_sequence/) sequence.

  One thing you may or may not want to consider - your url, viewed out of context, may read as "defeat ingger as" which is not necessarily the best first impression. (I verified with another friend who initially had the same reaction)

  Possibly hyphenated if you didn't want to change the name.
