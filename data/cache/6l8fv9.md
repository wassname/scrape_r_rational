Well, *that* took a while.  Seven months of frittering and distractions, but no hard AI takeoff yet...you're letting me down, Singularity.

  Unexpected to see Pauline of all people channeling HJPEV a bit there. I suppose it makes sense for a healer to have a weaker version of that ideal.

    That's kinda what I thought.  And given the canon symbolism of Dementors as clinical depression, frankly, a "happy memory" just shouldn't always cut it - firm conviction seems like a legitimate substitute, if not indeed a superior one.

    Most of my depression has been exogenous, but even when you can't *see* a path out of darkness, sometimes just stubbornly putting one foot in front of the other anyway can get you there.

  More generally, I thoroughly enjoyed the chapter. I wonder if Hermione will mention to Dumbledore that Nott is blackmailing her. That might short-circuit that subplot as well.

  On characterization, there was this passage from Dumbledore's point of view:

  > ... moved to trap him in the castle with the eleven-year-old boy who was apparently the sole being with any hope of destroying him. Even while knowing that the Prophecy constrained Time but did not choose which of them would fall to the other.

  I don't know how much you care about canonicity, but canon Dumbledore (as he amply explains in OotP and HBP) believed that prophecies only came true if their subjects believed them and acted on them. So, he would do his best to avoid the mindset that Harry was the only hope against Voldemort, because that would make the prophecy binding on himself. (It would be partly self-fulfilling: focusing on Harry to the exclusion of other avenues of attack could cause him to miss opportunities to defeat Voldemort sooner and more easily.)
  ```

    Nott is a different case, that's noted in the next chapter. :)

    For the rest - you always have a way of bringing up involved topics.  :)  I think I've mentioned before that I'm not portraying Dumbledore as a sinister puppet-master who is a jerkface for no good reason.  But similarly, saying he's *never* manipulative is just silly.  Despite what canon Dumbledore *says*, the way he *acts* rather suggests he does actually put great weight in what the Prophecy says - that Harry is key, that things explicitly stated *will* come to pass.  The fact that the Prophecy was self-fulfilling (and mutable where not otherwise specified - in that it *could* have been Neville, and that Voldemort might have won the final duel) doesn't make the rest of it meaningless in a strategic sense.

    Take a quote from Albus: “If Voldemort had never heard of the prophecy, would it have been fulfilled? Would it have meant anything? Of course not! Do you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been ful­filled?”  Read that, while thinking about *precision of speech*.  What does he actually *say*?  The first can be read as suggesting it was possible for Voldemort to not have heard of the Prophecy, but it can also simply be read as a counterfactual assertion - if not X then not Y.  It's logically valid, but irrelevant (since X is pre-defined as True).   The question at the end is highly leading, but does not explicitly *assert* anything.  It's irrelevant what Harry thinks, if the true answer is, yes, every prophecy (whose Time horizon has passed) *has* been fulfilled.  Obviously there are also plenty that haven't, but only because their horizons are still in the relative future.

    Anyway, why would being deceptive in that quote make sense?  Dumbledore at that point is suffering from considerable guilt over what he's had to do to Harry to give him the best chance of living long enough to beat Voldemort, and Harry is despairing because he feels the Prophecy has trapped him.  So emphasizing the wiggle room in prophecy while skirting around the sticky parts  helps convince him that he is still the author of his own destiny (even while, weirdly, arguing that he's just as trapped by genetics and upbringing instead).  In turn, that both relieves some of Albus' guilt (since Harry is less despairing) *and* makes Harry (slightly) more emotionally stable, which is bound to help him in the impending conflict, the outcome of which *is* still uncertain.

    Take Sybill's second prophecy, too, about Pettigrew - it doesn't appear to have been self-fulfilling (because Harry presumably would've met up with Ron and Hermione after his exam regardless, and he doesn't do anything else in reaction to it)...but it still went down exactly as stated.

    I'm comfortable with the interpretation of canon here that once a Prophecy is uttered, those things it fixes are considered pivot points in Time - from the point of the prophecy forward - but only to the extent that the language supports.  A Prophecy is a translation of a brief measurement of the evolution of a chaotic multi-dimensional quantum system into, usually, English, so it's not surprising that they frequently involve symbolism and metaphor and are almost always fuzzy at the edges.  But that measurement happened, and whatever previously-potential states needed to collapse to make it self-consistent *did* collapse.  Albus knows all that, and is doing his best to work with the advantages and disadvantages alike.

    I'm glad, thank you so much for saying so! <3

  ```
  I reread all of this today.

  What a ride.
  ```

  - u/RobinDrew:
    ```
    Assuming a ride is a positive thing for you, thanks! <3  I'm glad it holds up for you even on re-reading!

    Not a typo, but a style break perhaps? That bit with Tracey was weird, it seemed to suddenly switch from the usual 3rd person limited into the omniscient and almost spoke to the reader breaking the fourth wall?

    Another possible correction:
    > Though I believe I had good reasons to act as I did, at this point I am regrettably not at liberty to explain them fully to you without ostensibly putting a great many people in even worse jeopardy.

    Dumbledore seems to be misusing "ostensibly" here. "Ostensibly" means apparently or purportedly (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ostensibly). I'd just delete it, but "likely" would probably work as well.

  Ah! I forgot how much I enjoyed this, and I am *thoroughly* pleased to see this continued! You're a wonderful writer, and your characterization is *fantastic*!
  ```

  - u/RobinDrew:
    ```
    Thank you for the compliments! <3  When I have a lucky bout of inspiration, it's like I'm peeking into some weird alternate universe where HP was made into a tv series - I can just write down what I see.  When I'm even luckier, it vaguely makes sense.  :D
