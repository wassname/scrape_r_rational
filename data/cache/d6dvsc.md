## I know someone who is writing a book about a girl born with an allergy to the water molecule. Does it make sense that a sip of water sends her into anaphylactic shock but all the water present in her body is harmless?

  It makes no sense, unless magic is real in this universe. Then there could a meaningful distinction between ‘pure water’ and everything else. 

  As is, it makes no sense because there’s no way to distinguish where water molecules come from.

  The woman in the article claims to have aquagenic urticaria, which seems like it’s a real itchy skin condition caused by external contact with water, but *not* a true allergy: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquagenic_urticaria

  So it’s a very rare disease that exists, but it only affects the skin, and you just get hives, you don’t go into anaphylactic shock. Obviously the stuff about drinking water and almost dying is nonsense, the article on that junky click bait site is garbled or exaggerated too (“technically she’s allergic to HERSELF”, the claim she needs to eat dry food).

  To be honest, it’s so easy to check what the condition actually is that I don’t believe your story about knowing this woman, or how she’s writing a fictional book, or that she’s roleplaying in the interview.

  It seems like there really is a woman with this name and alleged condition: https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.independent.co.uk/news/thieves-shatter-allergy-girls-life-1317690.html

  Maybe she actually has aquagenic urticaria and is exaggerating the symptoms for attention. Maybe she doesn’t have it at all, and it’s a Munchausens type situation. Or maybe the newer articles are made up based on older reports about her, and you’re involved in it and are posting here to try to make some point about critical thinking or something.

  EDIT:

  Another slightly less junky article, but still in the local press so probably little fact checking: https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/water-allergy-girl-reaches-21st-58672.amp

  Repeats the bogus “anaphylactic shock” claim.

  Here’s a very dodgy seeming AMA she supposedly did: https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/8wzxnm/i_am_heidi_falconer_a_woman_with_a_severe_allergy/

  I remember you spamming this everywhere before. You posted in r/rational, r/writing I think, and a few others. In some posts you claimed to be that girl, in some you claimed to be writing a book, in some you just asked if it was “realistic” and if people would believe it’s true when presented with a news article

  You used a different username but it was the same posting pattern. What’s your obsession with water allergies?

    I knew there was something off about this! How bizarre.
