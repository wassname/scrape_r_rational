  JUROR seems perfectly suited to fix the tumors. Tumors are things that keep going even though they should stop, and he is a person whose whole thing

    That doesn't seem to have helped his parents, who are both dying of cancer after prematurely ending their treatment regimens.

      Well, that's their fault, kinda. His philosophy became their lives, and they traded their autonomy for happiness. Ironically they couldn't stop stopping, and they serve as

        Even more ironically, if they hadn't finished the tour of the nuclear reactor in keeping with the tenets of Truncatism, they wouldn't have

      He did mention something about them doing it wrong. Maybe they ended their treatment when they were supposed to end the cell reproduction in those tumors.

  Gazemaize continues to astound. If I commented about everything I enjoyed in this chapter, I'd just be recapping it. I'm delighted at the continued worldbuilding and characterization. I'm delighted at the continued dark (chocolate) humor. And I still can't wait for the Oompa Loompas to show up and sing about vaping.

  Its impressive how so many extreme personalities can all still be enjoyable to read.

  Also, what the hell do you reinforce peanut brittle with? licorice?

  EDIT: Are we not doing SDOBSWWFAPATS anymore? Satirical Deconstruction Of Beloved Surrealist Work Written For And Partially About This Subreddit? I loved that tag!

    Maybe with 'peanut ductile'?

    It's been done.

      Tags must be changed and updated! Modernization is a must!

  ```
  Is Willy Wonka in the room with them? Some parts mention Mr. Wonka speaking or doing something. Or are those only typos?
  ```

  - u/natron88:
    ```
    I thought it was a typo the first time it happened.  


    Now I think it's intentional, though what intention, I cannot say.
    ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    I'm guessing that's either accidental foreshadowing or deliberate foreshadowing.

  This is still great. JUROR ending line = best line.

    I'll one up you. JUROR = best child

      I’ll one up *you*. JUROR

        *I'll* one up

      I'll do you one better. JUROR = best

  >!This is not the original Charlie Bucket, but rather a candy-based clone, created by the Factory as a replacement. The original Charlie Bucket *may* have been the one who committed suicide the moment he left the Factory (presumably because the Factory would have prevented suiciding within said Factory), or that may have been another candy clone.!<

  >!With the Oompa Loompas out of the picture, the Factory is now in complete control of itself. It needs a replacement for Mr. Bucket, however (since the last one became suicidal); hence the tour!<

  Calling it now.

    So, >!the factory itself is a rogue fudge-maximizing AI!< ?
    ```

    - u/CCC_037:
      ```
      >!Rogue AI yes, but I don't know so much about fudge-maximising. It might be maximising something else.!<
      ```

- u/vimefer:
  ```
  This chapter is especially enjoyable. And I also like that the candy-powered transhumanism gets expanded.
  ```

- u/CreationBlues:
  ```
  Sounds like bucket is marginally less successful than wonka at working miracles. Also, no confirmation on whether those plinths cause tumors
  ```

  - u/CeruleanTresses:
    ```
    Shit, good point. We know they aren't "failures," but apparently causing tumors doesn't count as a failure unless Bucket was specifically trying to make non-tumor-causing pedestals, so...
    ```

- u/MaxDougwell:
  ```
  I like this story *almost* as much as I chocolate, and I love these absurd, delightful children. I sure hope Mr. Bonka isn't planning to eliminate them one-by-one. 
  …But when he does I look forward to him trying to subtly introduce Mahuika's "test" without the kids immediately seeing through him.

  Needs at least three times more punctuation.
