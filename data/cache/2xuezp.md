## [RT][DC][D] Life is Strange: methods of convincing someone you can reverse time

### Post:

If you were Max, what are all the creative ways you could demonstrate your abilities? Here's what I've got.

---
The classic psychic test, has many variations:

1. Tell them to think of a number.
2. Get them to tell you what it is.
3. Rewind to before they told you.
4. Tell them what it is.

-
The weird one, based on position persisting through rewinds. Also has many variations:

1. Get them to look at you.
2. Walk across the room.
3. Rewind.
4. From their perspective, you just teleported.

-
The thorough one, based on inventory persisting through rewinds:

1. Go somewhere where you can both see, but neither of you can tamper with, a clock that shows seconds (e.g. the big ol' analog clock on the wall in a classroom).
2. Sit down side-by-side on a bench or something.
3. Get them to take out their cell phone (or lend them yours) and establish the difference between its clock and the one on the wall.
4. Get them to take a selfie-video of both of you where they recite the date and the exact time shown by the clock on the wall.
5. Take the phone, rewind to before the video was taken, and immediately give the phone back. (If it's their phone, shout down their cries of, "Hey, how'd you get my phone?!")
6. Get them to note the exact time on both the clock on the wall and the phone.
7. Get them to play the video.

-
Simpler version of the above:

1. Go to the place with the clock.
2. Get them to stand beside the clock.
3. Start recording video of them and the clock in the frame at the same time.
4. Get them to recite a poem or something for the video.
5. *While still recording*, rewind to when they're halfway through the poem and interrupt, stopping them.
6. Stop recording. Play them the video.

-
The game-breaker:

1. Get them to lend you a unique object (signed photo, original artwork, etc.)
2. Rewind. Now there's two of them.
3. Profit. Literally, if you repeat the procedure with money.

-
The bigger game-breaker:

1. Figure out how to have them be considered part of your inventory. (Holding hands? Fireman's Carry?)
2. Take them with you when you rewind. PS: don't rewind to before you "acquired" them, or there'll be two of *them*!

### Comments:

- u/None:
  ```
  1. Receive seeds from step 5.
  2. Plant seeds.
  3. Wait (or hop forward), giving the seeds time to grow into profoundly exotic plants, totally unlike anything else on earth.
  4. Harvest seeds from plants.
  5. Send some of the seeds back to step 1.
  6. Sell exotic plants.
  7. Profit.
  ```

    ```
    Trying to grow originless plants, and interacting with originless life in general always seemed like a dangerous idea to me. It feels like a dangerous assumption, assuming that you are actually in control of what you end up summoning.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      True. A safer idea would be a variant of Harry's prime-factoring experiment, where you copy down whatever message you receive, so as to invite Time to talk to you.
      ```

- u/alexanderwales:
  ```
  I have no additional solutions, I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed the game so far, despite the fact that the main character is really weak-willed (I assume to give her room to grow in the next four chapters) and the science fiction aspect of it is almost completely unexplored. It's just really novel for a point-and-click game to give you the ability to rewind time, and they do a few of the clever things that the game Braid did with the mechanic.

  I do, however, want to see what the story would look like with an actually competent protagonist instead of one that just wanders around the high school campus and uses this godly, broken power for conversational gambits. (If only the movie *Next* were better, I would rewatch it to scratch my itch.)
  ```

  - u/Sparkwitch:
    ```
    [Edge of Tomorrow](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1631867/)?

    I'll admit that particular version has a major disadvantage, but the former possessor of the power figured out a pretty straightforward workaround for it.

  Don't do this with cash, do it with something valuable for its own sake.  Making more money doesn't actually help the world, it just redistributes the existing wealth a bit more in your favor.

  Instead, start a store where you have one of everything in the back room.  You could trade away anything from bags of diamonds (that started out as one diamond, before you doubled it a few times) to graphics cards and CPUs, to rare earth metals.  

  You have the potential to replace a lot of mining and manufacturing at trivially low costs.  It would be a shame to waste that.
  ```

    ```
    This could solve, and cause, a lot of problems.

    Got a medicine/tool/foodstuff/etc. that's hard to mass produce?

    Rewind it back, now you have two. Put both down, then pick them up again. Rewind to when you put them down, now you have four. Repeat until your inventory is so large that it causes the universe to lag.

    Hey, come to think of it, that solves entropy! No more heat death for Max!
    ```

    ```
    Oh, I know. I was just thinking small-time.
    ```
