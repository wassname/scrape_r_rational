  Come to think of it, are we sure this story is taking place on future Earth? Is it possible that these kids are the descendants of humans who were taken to an alien planet? It would probably take an extremely long time to change Earth's biosphere this much, especially given the size of the trees.

    Maybe not most animals, but that would explain a lot about the demon's behavior.

  Less hope the book doesnt become a case of http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatBigBookOfEverything
  That always solves everything

    ```
    So long as it's reasonably specific threats and problems that can be expected from the alien flora and fauna, it should be fine.
