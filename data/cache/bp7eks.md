  Man, I was so hyped for Cecilia being the endgame villain. We would slowly build up to making something out of the city, Haley would level up but only just a little bit, Cecilia would go deeper and deeper into madness, and then BAM, the arc finale!

  It was all squeezed into one chapter though. Not that I mind the pacing, it just felt super different from what ruffwriter does, for example, or even erratic.

  Loving the twists so far. Keep 'em up! MOAH!

    She was a pretty blunt instrument though. The twist that caught me was that she was in her 60s; I'd been thinking of her as a young girl since she thought of herself that way, and that little twist in catching the unreliability of her as narrator was a delight.

  Well. I guess Haley isn't the only one with the power to break the world.

  Hey all, quick question as we wrap up the first (extremely short) arc of this story. The artist I was hoping to tap for a RoyalRoad cover hasn't been in touch- has anyone got an interest in doing some cover art, or a lead on someone who might? I'm willing to pay, of course.

    I tentatively volunteer. For proof of skill I made the Animorphs: the Reckoning cover art,  a Pichu fanart piece for POoS, and a few other drawings posted to reddit that you can find via my post history. I am in the process of graduating and moving though, so I’m not sure how soon I can get a drawing done. 

    Anyway, I’m really enjoying the story! It’s interesting, well written, and posts very frequently! If you turn out to be another alt of Alexander Wales, I’m going to be so upset! (I really want more Glimwarden!)

      Thank you! I am absolutely not an AW alt.

        That does sound like something an AW alt would say...
        ```

  - u/Chelse-harn:
    ```
    Really loving your story! 
    I’d be willing to work on the cover as well if copper zirconium ends up not having time for it.

  The wonderland thing working like that implies serious stuff for the rest of the world.
  There are much worse settings people can imagine into being. 
  So let's hope it's mostly contained in this city and even if the effects are global there's only a few more people warping reality(and none of them is a warhammer40k fan for example) . 
  Otherwise the world is going to become an apocaliptic  kitchen sink very fast.

    As if a W40K delusion would be anything but great. It's japan that would have me worried. That place probably looks like an anime convention right now.
    ```

  ```
  I laughed out loud at "It was I! I stole the tarts." If I'm ever in an apocalypse where we have to quickly improvise to new rules of reality, Sean is someone I want on my team.
