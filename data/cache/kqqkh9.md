  > One of us would come out of this intact, and the rest would be cast aside, to be scorned or banished, doomed to live out the rest of their lives in resentful mediocrity.  A brutal competition for a name, a body, a family, a pardon.  Citizenship in this country.

  Reading things like this as they fight tooth and nail to save Paragon will never not be frustrating.

  Commonplace killing parliament *feels* like a mistake, but I can't precisely say why. It certainly weakens their reveal that parliament was hijacked, but Paragon was going to suppress and discredit that anyway. It gives Paragon an easy opportunity to go mask off and be even *more* oppressive and authoritarian, but again, they were going to do that anyway. It feeds the narrative that Commonplace are just violent thugs that want to burn the country to the ground, but a failed revolution already does that. I don't know, it still feels like the wrong move somehow, but I can't really justify that feeling with anything concrete.

  Not entirely sure why Wes decided to let Kahlin live (it's not like he's never killed people before), and frankly the whole Kahlin thing is falling a bit flat for me anyway. I just don't really care about him as an antagonist at this point, there's bigger fish to fry. It doesn't really feel like he matters when Tunnel Vision is burning down Paragon and Pictogram is running off with Jun while Kahlin is just sort of... there. Plus, all the tension of the whole "Wes getting his life back" thing has shifted from "can he catch Kahlin and prove himself worthy?" to "will he take the deal even if it screws over Ana?" so he's not even really relevant to Wes' personal arc or plot. His presence feels weirdly vestigial at this point, which makes it odd when he's the focus of so much of the chapter.

  Sucks to see Jun go, but getting Hira back at the same time eases the sting of it a little bit.

  Overall a decent chapter, but it suffers from following on the heels of some really great, climactic stuff. The previous chapters focusing on Max and TV were fantastic, so when the chapter immediately afterwards is "just okay," it stands out even worse than it otherwise would.

    I don't think Commonplace killed Parliament, though they are probably going to take the blame for it, at least for the time being. It's more likely whoever hijacked them put a self-destruct trigger in them in case they were ever found out.

    Did they kill them? I assumed they died mostly in the crossfire or as a sideeffects of the seizures that revealed they were hijacked? Maxine never made a "call" to kill them as far as I can tell. Doesn't change the political calclulus but I think it changes the emotional/moral calculus.

    > Ronaveda recoiled.  “He’s been hijacked.  Badly.”

    > No surprises there.  The hardline loyalists would be kept under a tight leash.

    > “Next,” said Max.  She took Ronaveda to Esau Westlake, a political moderate who sympathized with Commonplace, but voted with the loyalists most of the time.
    > 
    > He rolled over and had a seizure too.  Another victim of Paragon’s hijacking.

    > Max clenched her teeth.  “Next.”  The building shook, and she led Ronaveda to Joyce Fulmer, a strong pro-Commonplace MP.  She voted against Paragon’s interests almost every time.

    > Fulmer twitched, shaking and babbling nonsense.  No.  “Scholars,” breathed Max.  No, that’s not possible.  She had expected a large conspiracy, yes, but this?
    > 
    > Ronaveda tested another one.  And another one.  And another one.  And another ten.  Loyalists and Commonplace sympathizers and everything in between.
    > 
    > All of them had the same reaction to the truth aura.  All of them seized up, shivered, lost their ability to speak.

    If anything I would guess its an inadvertent reaction to being forced to tell the truth, their minds/bodies can't handle the contradiction between the pith driven (Ronaveda + whoever hijacked them) orders so they die.  I wonder if they have to plan around it when/if parliament members go on her show, or if they just never go.

      I assumed someone on Commonplace's side released the poison gas, which is what I thought killed parliament. I could very well be wrong. The chaotic nature of the situation, coupled with the fact that we don't actually see them *die*, we just see them *dead*, makes it difficult to tell what exactly happened.

  I'm with everyone else who finds our POV characters increasingly frustrating.

  Seeing Wes and Ana fight over who gets to be a martyr for an institution they've both acknowledged will keep treating them like garbage feels kind of pointless.

  (Especially since it's pretty obvious Ana was always going to win at that game, both because she's sneakier and because she's martyrier)

  So, next week is Ana vs Grace. At this point I'm rooting more for Grace.
