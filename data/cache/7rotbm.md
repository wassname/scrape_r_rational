## Unsung Story of the Inconspicuous (Naruto)

### Post:

[This fic is good](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5514187/1/Unsung-Story-of-the-Inconspicuous), and I think meets the criteria for being a rational fic, if in a sort of Meta way. 

Raiku Gairano is part of a small and unimportant ninja clan in Konoha; unimportant by choice, as they are both able to see, and are naturally immune to, narrative convention.

As I said, pretty meta, but it does nicely highlight one of the key tenants of rational writhing: nothing happens 'just because', but only as the rules direct. In this case, the world is built in with rules that direct the Plot, thus giving our aware MC a very interesting perspective as she tries to do her family proud... by not interfering with the Grand Story of the Universe and living as unmemorably as possible.

  Does the tone change much? I remember trying this one a couple years ago and being put-off by the character's lack of empathy when messed up stuff happens to others.

    In the author's defense, a certain apathy is necessary to be able to actively ignore events you know are going to happen, especially when it concerns lives to be saved.

    Sorry for replying to an old comment, but it does. Raiku’s lack of empathy is a plot point of sorts. I can’t defend anyone else though if it seems unrealistic at times for humor.

  Ive only read the first chapter but the comedy comes out well. My favorite part so far is the drama levels. 

  >Uchiha Sasuke – level five risk of drama. Impressive, since there were only three levels.

  Quickly followed by:

  >Uzumaki Naruto – drama level ten, human whirlwind.

  I got in trouble for laughing out loud at work.

  Is it finished, or still being written?

    Ongoing. 300k words in and last updated 2 weeks ago.

      This may be an obvious pun, but her name means lightning, and so story grounds itself out around her.

  Checked it, loved it. Thanks for the recommendation!
