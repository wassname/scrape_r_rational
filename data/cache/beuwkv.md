  The four Black Saints of Calernia: Cat, Triumphant, Treacherous and Irritant. Any chapter featuring one - or their mention - in the intro is excellent. I really hope the Tyrant's new charger is somehow filled with goblinfire munitions despite being alive.

    In reality it is a shapeshifted Mighty, lying in wait for most devious betrayal!

      Wasn't there a beat where Masego forced fae shapeshifting as a part of some experiments a while back? Is the goat Larat?

    30 That Robber did it.

    50 That Abigail accidentally gets the credit for it.

    100 that Cat didn't know about it but she is gonna get blamed either way.

    All in that the Tyrant laughs his ass off while being thrown off by the explosion.
    ```

- u/Mountebank:
  ```
  As expected, the second part of the plan is to bait the Tyrant into attacking because a quick battle doesn't suit his goals, whatever they are. Cat thinks he needs leverage in order to negotiate something out of Cordelia, and a total victory for the Grand Alliance won't give him that.

  But this isn't the end of the plan. Catherine, and presumably the rest of the Wild Hunt, aren't present in either location, so she's off doing something else. Are we still sure that this battle is the Prince's Graveyard? If so, then some more princes need to die, either at Kairos's hand or as a side effect of whatever Cat is doing, but I doubt she'll attack the, directly because, like Pilgrim said, a false surrender would backfire tremendously for a villain. However, maybe she can cause a civil war amongst the Grand Alliance between Levant and Procer--maybe the Procer troops won't follow Pilgrim's acceptance of surrender, or maybe there will be a difference in opinion on what to do with the POWs.

    but surely he gets stomped now that Cats forces have surrendered and the two alliance armies are in the same spot. whats his play?
    ```

    - u/notagiantdolphin:
      ```
      Probably fresh army v exhausted ones, the risk of the newly rescued villainous army starting to fight again with a broken pattern of 3. Since she seems to have actually meant it (surrender), if anyone attacks the Tyrant she could come to his rescue to slip out of the 'false surrender' narrative. Nobody is fighting, the threat is implicit, and the peace conference to add terms to that unconditional surrender to take some weight off whatever Kairos has planned for later.
      ```

- u/Trezzie:
  ```
  Confirmation that he knows of the well and what's inside it, huzzah!

  Now to see how the surrender plays out, and how long it takes for the paint to dry.
  ```

  - u/Banarok:
    ```
    well now she have surrendered, and she could be persuaded to help fight tyrant off if her forces may walk of afterwards.

    or something to that effect.
    ```

- u/HPMOR_fan:
  ```
  How can Peregrine be so sure Cat is destined to become like the Dead King unless he stops her, "Catherine Foundling had given the slip to every story that could bind her to an ending, and so left herself only one path: reign eternal, consumed and consuming, a herald of long prices and hard measures having made mantle of the woes of Creation."

  Yet the Wandering Bard writes her off like she's on a suicide trajectory? I wonder if what WB has said to other characters about Cat is not true. Maybe she's guiding Cat along while making up excuses for why she doesn't finish Cat off.
  ```

  - u/Allian42:
    ```
    The Pilgrim knows the first part of her trajectory in broad strokes. She went from an unknown to the Squire, to the commander of a legion of terror, to the queen of an evil aligned country. Then, he meets her in the battlefield and he sees a broken girl, filled with the full might of the fae's winter and, like the Dead king said, on the brink of ascending. Then, she goes off the grid just to return with a army's worth of horrors from the everdark and literal goddesses of Evil on her shoulders. 

    If it was me, I wouldn't be optimistic either.
    ```

  - u/LordSwedish:
    ```
    If he was sure he would be scheming to kill her, what he's trying to do here is making a weapon that he could use to kill her later. He's pretty explicit about the fact that, if he lets this opportunity slip, he's not going to be able to handle her if she goes all "hidden horror". 

    He's Above's main fixer and there's an evil queen who he failed to redeem and is growing out of his ability to handle, the possibility of her turning into a monster is there and if he doesn't set up the possibility to bring her down now then he's leaving the fate of the world up to chance.
    ```

    - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
      ```
      > evil queen who he failed to redeem 

      Not only failed to redeem but whos existence is built on Good abondoning Callow for petty reasons. She is Goods hubris being thrown in its face.
      ```

- u/HPMOR_fan:
  ```
  What does the surrender mean for Saint vs Rumena? If it's a draw does that mean they are in a pattern of three?
  ```

  - u/Allian42:
    ```
    We don't know if they are in a pattern right now, but if they are the surrender either means a draw as both have to stop fighting or a loss for Rumena since his side gets taken as prisoners.

    If it counts as a draw, then I fear this might get sticky.
    ```

    - u/Menolith:
      ```
      Both walk out of a duel to the death alive. It certainly looks like a draw, especially so for the Saint who just wants to cut bitches up.
      ```

  - u/Halinn:
    ```
    I don't think their initial encounter had enough narrative weight for a pattern to begin
    ```
