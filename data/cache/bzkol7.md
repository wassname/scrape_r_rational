## [RT][DC] Legacy of the Goddess: A Rational Zelda Quest - Prologue (1/2)

### Post:

[Prologue (1/2)](https://chaossnek.com/Story) ~9k words.


This is the first of two prologue chapters for an upcoming quest to be hosted on Sufficient Velocity. A bit of a preview more than anything; this is intended to provide a some backstory, setting/worldbuilding exposition, and character introductions to inform the first player choice following Chapter 1 (i.e. - choosing a character). Due to the nature of the work and the setting, we (myself and co-QM Radvic) thought this necessary to avoid dumping players into a wholly unfamiliar world with little information other than "it's loosely based on LoZ," while also respecting player agency.


Many thanks to eaglejarl and Velorien; their work on Marked for Death is what inspired me to start this project almost two years ago. I highly recommend MfD if you haven't read it.

Hope you enjoy. Any feedback is appreciated! :)

  I'm very excited to participate in this!  = )

  Will there be worldbuilding lore we the players will likely never ever find out?
  ```

  - u/-Vecht-:
    ```
    Probably. That said, there's a hell of a lot of lore and history, and 100% of it will be open to ya'll, so long as you can figure out how to get at it.

      Am I right in assuming you're using the magic system you [previously offered bounties for](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8v6ckz/d_offering_bounties_for_breaking_my_magic_system/)?

      In any case, I'm looking forward to seeing where this goes.

        ```
        Thanks. :) And yeah, basically that but with a fair amount of changes. I'll release more info soon.
