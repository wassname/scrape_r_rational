  Which is interesting because I'm halfway through the next chapter.

  I'll take the opportunity to ask for some reactions and comments on the story so far. I have my own complaints with some problems related to pacing, structure and flow, mostly caused by a lack of planning and forethought on my part, but does anyone else have anything to say about what aspects and parts of the story work for them and what don't?

  I'll try to put some more thought into the next arc as well as come up with a more consistent and slower update schedule. Twilight still has a lot to learn.

    I don't really have the time ATM to make a thorough review beyond the usual "Awesome, thanks for the past and future of this fic".

    One thing I'd like to say is that you should seriously consider making the latest chapter the official last one of the fic, with the next part either the epilogue or the first chapter of the sequel, rather than extending on into a second arc of the first fic. There's quite a few readers who prefer reading completed fics, mainly due to the prevelance of dead fics.

    Other than that, there's plenty of room to see side-stories featuring a pair of the post-test ponies, put into a situation where their respective tests are at odds with each other, especially considering that's the next major step in becoming more rational, learning to balance the different lessons rather than treating one of them as more important than the rest.

      And by side-stories, you mean the slice of life episodes from Season 1, which were all *exactly like that*.

        Yup.

        You saw through my cunning plan to get more fics which taste like the early seasons.

          Since those are the ones in which the main characters got continuously driven out of their minds and into the realms of screaming madness, I'm pretty cool with this.

    As someone without a background in economics, I would appreciate annotations going into more detail about how the tests relate to principles of economics. That or just a list of relevant keywords readers could search for. I had a general idea of what you were going for with each chapter, but I was curious to get a deeper understanding.

    I do like the snark about how Twilight's kinda evil for being an economist.  It speaks to the part of me who has received Pavlovian training from Tyler Cowen and Robin Hanson that when someone calls himself an economist I should shoot to kill.

    [Seriously, Tyler Cowen is *evil*.](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/14/upshot/the-lack-of-major-wars-may-be-hurting-economic-growth.html?_r=0)
