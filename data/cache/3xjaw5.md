  ```
  Happy Holidays, everyone! For those of you who are taking time off from work, or get time off because the government requires it, I hope you enjoy the break!
  ```

- u/Transfuturist:
  ```
  Is there any material online to let those who couldn't make a pilgrimage join in?
  ```

    ```
    [Hymnal link](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2000477/Solstice%20Downloads/Solstice_2013_hymnal_facingPages.pdf) (not sure how much of that everyone actually uses) and [album of music](https://humanistculture.bandcamp.com/album/brighter-than-today-a-secular-solstice) (WARNING: CHEESE).
    ```

      ```
      Alas, it is too late, for my secularity has been healed by the gentle light of Madokami.
      ```
