  Well, it's pretty much confirmed that the Mamas (and Papas?) are selected from top-scoring kids. 

  I'm going to make another guess and say that they're also chosen based on sociopathic factors, or anything that makes them value their own lives over their kids. 

  Cause really, raising kids over years, acting as a parental figure to them, and sending them off the be killed and eaten, all while staying constantly on guard and vigilant? You really can't do that unless you view the kids as less than human.

    That makes sense. If this is a typical shounen then Ray is going to be selected to be a papa or something like that, and he'll accept because "it's the rational choice". In the end he was only just pretending, and then he'll sacrifice himself for the group to escape. Hopefully this one breaks the mold though.

      Yeah, Norman called Ray out on this a chapter ago, I think. He basically asked Ray why doesn't he try to escape on his own and correctly deduces that Ray cares too much about Emma and Norman to do that.

      He might abandon the other kids though.

  Mama could tell them that humanity is under an iron grip, and they, the top scorers, will be the next farm workers; and so their only hope is to breed for smarter humans until someone can figure out how to win back Earth.

    It would be very wonderful if it turned out that, through selective breeding, the demons were sowing the seeds of their defeat.

  Cool, but really really short. Mangas are like that, yes, but it's frustrating to have so little to read and the story to advance so slow.

  I don't really like the writing of the characters. It might be due to the translation, but I suspect it comes from the set of assumptions the author makes, and how they show in the dialogues.

  They feel more like people around a table roleplaying little kids in a Truman Show, than actual little kids in a Truman Show. "Now that I think about it we don't even know a thing about where in the world we are right now!" struck me as really weird and unrealistic.

    ```
    Yeah, that's basically due to translation. Most scanlated light novels read like that.
