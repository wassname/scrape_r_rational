  This reads a little oddly without any dashes to mark the stuttering.

  > “That’s j-just st-st-stupid, Allen.” Molly stuttered,

  I don't know which would be a better choice.

  Keeping the backstory separate as an appendix works as a section for interested readers who wanted to know more about the story. Putting it in the prologue forces readers to learn about the background when I enjoyed starting the story with a blank slate and enjoyed teasing out clues about the setting. Also I think there's some information loss when we're reading it from a 7-year-old's perspective. I don't see the backstory as a necessity which all readers have to read before jumping into the story.

  On the other hand, a lot more information was easily remembered and was more palatable than a direct info dump. In addition, there was a lot more focus on the family dynamics which I felt the story could have used more of before Allen left to go to war. Also you nicely show how much stress Allen's history has caused him, when in the story itself his history of violence is only noticed when dealing with Rikard and others in the army.

  I'm very on the fence about it, but my preferred choice would be to have both back stories included with the 'info dump' one as an appendix (maybe written as an excerpt from a university history class textbook). I mean it'd be a waste to not have the one where you lovingly detail out all of the problems and difficulty in getting to and living on Nirvana.

    > many animals like docs, cats, and rats

    That's the only one I saw though, just wanted to point it out!

  I understand what you're trying to do, but this is still really infodumpy, and because you're trying to hand it to us in the form of a story inside a story it's taking even longer to get through. If this had been by first time I would have stopped reading halfway through. :<

  As the title suggests, I took that ugly info-dumpy backstory, and turned it into a prologue that I hope will be both interesting and a little funny.

  I'd appreciate your input, either here or in the blog!

  I liked it. It made me realize how differently they view violence, and I would probably read the entire story in a different light if I read it again.
