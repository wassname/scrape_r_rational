  I can recommend this story to anyone who isnâ€™t weirded out by bioengineers with different morals for whom humans are just another kind of animal. The story really grows in depth as it does in length and has many themes that fit this subreddit.

  The worldbuilding is of excellent quality, really capturing the atmosphere of an alien culture and society.

  I'm 32 pages into the thread, and it's kept me interested so far. Wish I was around to influence it when it was being written, but maybe the other one is still continuing? I'll have to finish this one first.

    It is indeed barely starting.

    After finally finishing this story, I have to say I really really enjoyed it. Thank you for making it, and excellent job finding appropriate musical cues, it really added to the story.

    Also, poor Dartu... :(

      I kind of feel like I accidentally discovered some amazing characters by accident on that whole endeavor. There are dozens of great stories happening all in the background I probably could write about.
