  This requires a reasonably high tech level, but:

  Make a clone, cryogenically freeze them, then switch as necessary.

  Or alternatively, clone himself the regular way, wait for the clone to grow, create a (power) clone, and then swap the heads between them.

  Just some life extension stuff, basically. Not anything optimal, but it should help.

  Okay first thought is to get unlimited energy generation. To that end:

  - Get 7 large transparent coil tubes and place them in a line while vertical.
  - Get 6kg worth of the strongest magnets I can find (or just 6kg of coil).
  - Jump down one of the coil tubes and create 6 clones at the top of the other tubes.
  - When at the bottom of the coil tube and while still in freefall create another clone at the top of my current tube.
  - Transfer consciousness to the newly created clone and recreate other clones at the top of all the other coil tubes.

  You will be constantly accelerating at ~9.8m/s until you hit terminal velocity (around 56m/s). I cannot remember enough electromagnetism to work out how many joules you will be generating. 
  However this method has numerous mechanical problems in its implementation. Also, one wrong move and you're a red smudge on the ground.

  Second thought:

  - Get yourself a superconducting battery (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconducting_magnetic_energy_storage) with as much charge as feasible for a weight limit of 6kg.
  - Create clones and have them discharge their batteries into some system which feeds the power grid.
  - Rinse and repeat. 

  I believe this second idea is far more practical.
