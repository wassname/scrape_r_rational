## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  For some reason, your pre-committed "password" in case you meet yourself from the past/future/another timeline/other universe/etc. is not a phrase but rather a recollection of a specific story from your past with details that only you could possibly know.

  So, you meet this person who claims to be you from the future. Without you prompting them, they tell you a recollection of a specific story from your past with details that only you, and you alone, could possibly know. The problem is that it's *not* the story you've pre-committed to.

  How do you react to this? What do you do?

  I’m thinking about attempting to write a “”realistic”” Gamer story. Like The Erogamer without the ero (and meta). I’m trying to decide what the best place and time to have the story start is, relative to the protag gaining the power. Setting it before gives the reader time to get the know the protag as a bit of a baseline, even if it’s less than a chapter’s worth. Setting it directly as they gain the power is a little closer to the action, but given that I want the protagonist to behave somewhat like a real person, they’re almost certainly going to freak out and think they’re hallucinating. That might be more annoying than interesting to read. Lastly I could start it a few days afterwards when they’ve accepted that they might as well treat this as reality, having done some basic tests to ensure it’s probably not simple hallucinations or delusions. It’s my understanding that people with delusions can still understand people who tell them their delusions aren’t real, they just don’t believe them. So when people tell the protag “how did you just make that disappear” it’s somewhat encouraging. This feels like a bit of a copout and could miss out on important characterization, but also gets right to the action.

  A large part of the reason I’m asking is because I’m inexperienced as a writer, so I realize it might be a pretty trivial question.

  I was thinking of having it set in 2018-2019 so it’s still very close to the present but I’ll have a better idea of, say, the state of geopolitics or a global pandemic during the timeframe. Also tempted to make the mystery of where the system came from a non-issue, Erogamer and WTC explore that enough for my taste. I’d either make it known immediately or downplay the importance as it’s seen as completely unknowable.

  Edit: also, I’ll probably post a little about it for worldbuilding Wednesday, but the background reason why the protag got the power is that there’s an alternate timeline for each human that’s ever been alive, and an alternate timeline for a set number of powers they could have. This is recursive for people born in those alternate timelines, so timelines exist where everyone alive has a supernatural power. So if you want your favorite urban fantasy conceivably exists somewhere in this multiverse!

    Would you panic and run around in circles in their shoes?  If no, consider upgrading the characters' intelligence and maturity until they're less far below yourself.  If yes, why?  Gamer is testable, just like you say.  In real life I might initially suspect with high probability I was hallucinating, but if my mind otherwise felt absolutely normal, I'd go test that assumption first thing, because my understanding would be that fully realistic hallucinations usually don't go along with all introspective meters reporting inside the interiors of their remembered ranges.

      Freaking out is a bit strong word stronger than I meant, but I think it’s a reasonable response to be very concerned about your mental state if you’re experiencing something that should be impossible. It’s also relevant to consider the background of the protagonist - if they’re already not 100% mentally well, or even just prone to magical thinking and aware of it, thinking they might have “cracked” may be a real concern.

      Testing also doesn’t wrap the concerns up nicely, because after you’ve established that it’s something other people can see and acknowledge you’re still left with it being impossible. Some personality types might be mostly fine with this, I’d expect a subset to be faced with an existential crisis.

      My point is there’s all these complications introduced just from having something impossible happen that don’t make a fantasy good story, which is annoying. Most likely I’ll go with something that minimizes mental impact while still showing distress - they’ll immediately ask their friends for guidance and demonstrate their abilities  instead of goofing off/freaking out alone in their room.

    Have you considered the _Magical Girl Madoka_ approach?

    That is, before the POV gets The Power, they get invited on a ride-along with one or more other acquaintances who already have The Power. During the ride-along, the acquaintances are arguing about whether to recruit the POV or warn them off the dangerous life that comes with The Power, while the POV is trying to figure out The Secrets they aren't being told yet.

    In that way, we get to watch experienced people Do The Thing while getting ready for when the POV gets to Do The Thing for themselves.

    It's up to you what happens at the end of the ride-along: peaceful recruitment, sudden disaster, hostile press-gang, etc.

      I don’t think that fits well with what I had planned; the protag was going to be the one singular supernatural element in the world. That’s something I don’t really want to deviate from. I’ll consider it though, or at least see if making the protag not a loner is interesting, I feel like that’s somewhat common.

    I don't have any specific advice as I'm not an experienced writer, but heres a few points you might want to watch out for:

    * The kind of reader that's likely to start reading a Gamer story has probably read other Gamer stories. This means that whatever you end up doing on the object level, you should use the opening to establish as quickly and briefly as possible *what type of story this is* - and as soon as you've done that, move on to the interesting parts. There's nothing worse than a beginning thats 90% repeated infodumps because the writer couldn't figure out how to move things along.

    As an example, I think [the first chapter of Apocalypse: Generic System](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35669/apocalypse-generic-system/chapter/549831/chapter-1-may-cause-drowsiness) shows this done well. It quickly introduces the main character, simultaneously providing a reasonable justification for his situation, and then makes the type of story immediately clear.

    Then, we follow the character figuring out what to do. The thought process is kept brief, but clear, before moving on to describing concrete actions.

    >“Hey, can I change the difficulty? I was making those choices in an altered state.”

    >No answer.

    >*Worth a shot,* Jeb thought, gaze falling on the crates.

    >Bits of forest poked him through his socks as he made his way to the supplies.

    >The leftmost crates had weapons of every conceivable kind, with the sole exception of firearms, but if it killed things, and it was powered by muscle, it was on the list.

    >He even spotted an African throwing axe and an Atlatl complete with a dozen darts halfway between the size of a javelin and an arrow. Needless to say, there were plenty of spears, swords, bows, crossbows, axes and knives.

    >*Is this thing bigger on the inside?* Jeb wondered, putting his hand into the box and reachign toward the wall of the crate. His hand came into contact with the wall a good foot further out than the side of the crate should’ve been.

    >*Well, that’s fuckin’ weird an’ magical.*

    >Jeb moved to the next box. It had armor of every description, from police riot gear, to full medieval plate armor, to armored bikinis.

    >Upon finding an armored bikini in the box, Jeb raised an eyebrow. Finding this here meant a couple things: Whatever aliens had done this shit to him had been trawling through comics and art to figure out what ‘armor’ should look like. It also meant whatever superintelligence had been doing it either wasn’t paying attention to human physiology or didn’t care that fantasy tit-protectors didn’t actually stop arrows.

    >Or….

    >Given that he was currently in a fantasy world with fantasy rules, there was a slim chance that metal bikinis were actually as protective as full plate.

    >*God, I hope so.*

    >Although, that opened up an entirely different can of worms that begged the question of intent-based physics, or whether everything was an abstract simulation.

    >*Let’s not overthink it.* Jeb thought, tossing the bikini aside. Better safe than sorry on the armor front.

    The exception (to the brevity) is ability choices/attribute description - but here again it's a lot more concise than many other stories like this.

    This may be subjective but I really like this story because it makes one thing really clear: it spends its "creativity points" where it matters. Relatively little effort is given to the elements that are only there because they're genre conventions or necessary for the plot - for example, if you finish reading the chapter you'll find literal fairies who give exposition. Things like character names - this is the first sentence of a later chapter:

    >Tom, Dick and Harry sat around their meager campfire staring at the flames.

    Despite the names and relatively little time spent on these characters, the author manages to make them distinct in ways that matter.

    Even though the setting is "generic," the specific details are inventive and the ideas the protagonist uses are genuinely original. And since most of the framework of the story is fairly familiar, the author also manages to make it more coherent than usual (possibly not internally consistent or rational, but the explanations are better than technobabble and are actionable information that the reader can use to predict or theorise about how the characters could solve problems.)

    ***

    A few smaller points.

    > given that I want the protagonist to behave somewhat like a real person, they’re almost certainly going to freak out and think they’re hallucinating.

    * depends on who they are. Thinking you're hallucinating is about right, but unless there is something about the situation or physiology that causes them to freak out it's entirely reasonable to have a calm reaction. It's like any unexpected emergency situation, some people panic and lose all ability to act rationally while others can even get more calm and focused than usual.

    * A problem with real world settings for this kind of thing where the power is the only point of change is the potentially excessive (and draining to the reader) level of paranoia it would realistically take to remain free to act. Like, experimenting with your friends is possibly already enough to set events in motion that would lead to you either captured or a refugee. As soon as someone observes you "levelling up" (getting more powerful in some way), they'll immediately conclude that the best time to capture you was yesterday, and the second best is now, and come in and blindside you with overwhelming force that you couldn't have seen coming.

        The typical powerset does give you some tools to at least not get blindsided, but it doesn't end up helping much since any significant change in behaviour is going to get noticed and get the same result. Do you really want to write, or readers want to read, a story where the protagonist uses externally unobservable powers almost exclusively? Not saying you can't get around these issues, but it at least bears thinking about.

    Lastly, if you do end up writing this I'm definitely down to read and give my thoughts :) If you can't tell I've thought about a similar type of story, but concluded it was probably too difficult for a first project.

      Re: your first point, I’m hesitant to assume the reader has read Gamer stories before (you have to start somewhere!) but yeah, I’ll try to avoid describing all the minutia of the system immediately. I think I’d rather spread it out, I’m picturing it as a slower paced story than some others.

      Paranoia is a good point. Keeping it to like two friends and having the protagonist already know some op-sec concepts from the beginning is a good idea. Basic stuff like “turn off your phones and leave them at home, throw out your Alexa”. I think that could be an interesting minor plot element and a fun thing for me to research.

      Most likely this won’t end up being shared, it’ll be about the third thing I’ve seriously attempted to write. I appreciate the support though!

    Honestly, I find it way more annoying than there's no hesitation from the main character at all in the story. Aside from some extremely rare circumstances, it makes the story feel less real.
    ```

    - u/plutonicHumanoid:
      ```
      Zero hesitation breaks my suspension of disbelief for a story that’s trying to take itself seriously. What circumstances make it feel more real to you?

      Besides freaking out, making them at least not assume that the system is real and making some token effort towards investigating would also fulfill that requirement. Thinking about it more, this is kinda what WTC did, just lowkey and as a side element to the action going on, which might be a good cue to follow. Maybe they get the ability in a high-stakes situation so they don’t have time to freak out.
      ```

      - u/NTaya:
        ```
        > What circumstances make it feel more real to you?

        I mean, *Erogamer*'s MC reaction was believable. She is *that* bad when it comes to body issues. Overall, characters obsessed with achieving a certain goal might, realistically, act irrationally when presented with an opportunity to reliably achieve said goal.

        Again, this might work in one case out of a dozen at best, and probably should be used even more sparingly than that.

  There should be a simplified version of git for authors. 

  It would be great for web fics and amateur writers who don't want to pay for editors. Proof readers could make commits to catch errors.

    Maybe just SVN instead of git? It's been about a decade, but back in college we got all the artists on game projects to use Tortoise SVN, without too much headache.

    With any traditional version control software, you're going to have a headache if you're just editing one giant manuscript with multiple people patching it. Splitting into chapters or whatever would help.

    Google Docs is already a GUI and handles people editing the same large manuscript decently enough.

    ErraticErrata needs something like this. PGtE is an amazing story, but literally every single chapter has a ton of errors, and usually at least one that actually makes interpreting a sentence difficult. And so many of them are so obvious that pretty much anyone going over the chapter quickly would catch the vast majority of them. I am perennially confused why they have not asked someone from the community to perform this task for them. Forget an actual editor, just a fresh set of eyes will catch most things. 

    It has by far the strangest ratio of quality story to bad grammer/spelling errors that I have ever seen.

  I'm not certain what the name of this trope is, I'm pretty sure it's a variation on, "[The Main Character(s) Do Everything](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMainCharactersDoEverything) but more in terms of a story's scale and stakes than just jacks-of-all-trades. Maybe even the narrative scale version of power creep.

  One good example, and the example that brought this to mind was Worm. 

  Without getting too spoiler-y the story starts off at a pretty small scale but as the arcs progress the scale of things becomes increasingly global and the stakes continually rise. 

  That's not to say that the earlier arcs were boring at all. I personally expected and would've been satisfied if Brockton Bay was the theater for characters and their interactions. I wasn't disappointed by what Wildbow chose to do instead, and I can understand why other people would find it stale if more of the universe wasn't explored. 

  Worm is usually considered rational-adjacent, if not a good example of rational fiction. Yet TMCDE is usually a form of artistic license, the scale escalating is born out of a need to keep audiences engaged rather than because it's a realistic consequence of rational behavior in a rational setting. 

  What are your thoughts on it?
  ```

  - u/callmesalticidae:
    ```
    My understanding is that Wildbow doesn't consider *Worm* to be rat!fic, and I agree. Worm cares more about drama (consider how the Protectorate acts more freely when Taylor is a villain but is more hamstrung when she's a hero, because the *actual* rule that the Protectorate runs on is "What will make things more difficult for Taylor?").
    ```

  - u/jtolmar:
    ```
    I always thought of it as a sort of selection bias. Who's going to end up at the table when we discuss how to save the world? Pick one of them, how did they get there? We end up with a skewed sample because we're not picking a random workaday do-gooder, we're picking specifically the ones that end up going places to tell stories about.

    That's still unrealistic in a different way, since the people with enough power to shape these world-altering events are, well, powerful. And power does not actually come from a lifelong history of being the plucky underdog against increasingly harsh opposition. Power mostly comes from using whatever power you have to pursue the accumulation of yet more power. You should expect that a randomly chosen person at the world-saving coalition is primarily motivated by increasing their own personal power, and got there from luck or inheritance followed by ruthless exploitation of their own advantages. That's pretty damn bleak though, so it's only natural that we insert someone we actually like into the conversation, and tell their story instead.
    ```

  - u/DXStarr:
    ```
    In real life, _Worm_'s Taylor wouldn't be anybody's idea of sensible time management or life choices. But in the story, we actually watch Taylor _trying to figure things out_, even if that's just "how to beat up these enemies and get away." That makes her rational-crack in a way that Tolkien and Marvel can't be.

    Tolkien's heroes endure; Marvel's heroes have emotional epiphanies. Taylor Hebert deduces battle tactics.

    The other big r-adjacent element in _Worm_ is that the world is treated as a broken thing that the POV wants to see fixed, not a permanent backdrop to be ignored.

    _Worm_ elevates "figure things out" and "power _should_ be for making things better, even if it isn't" in a way most stories don't.

    TMCDE? It's kind of a Doylist side effect of those two. If the heroine isn't a failure, and is trying to make things better, then to keep tension we have to keep upping the stakes.
    ```

  So I recently got into a discussion with someone about what kinds of things qualify as "aggression". They made the claim that failing to act in a situation where you could prevent harm because you don't like the person who is in danger qualifies as aggression. I argued that it wasn't since a pretty core part of the definition of aggression is action, it can't be passive. Failing to act might be morally wrong, but wouldn't be aggressive. 

  Now, I don't care too much that they had a different definition than I do, I am just about the furthest thing from a lingual prescriptivist there is, but what bothered me is that they claimed that their definition was so obviously correct that I must be trolling them and purposefully misinterpreting. Now, _I_ know that I wasn't doing that, but I also feel like that was a ridiculous thing to claim. I know that, given the internet, I should just assume the person was being kind of a dick, but it left me wondering if I really am just that disconnected from the common usage of the word. 

  So I figured to I'd ask here. Not whether or not the definition is correct, but whether or not it's so widespread that a claim that it isn't true must be disingenuous. I'd literally never heard someone try and claim that _not_ doing something, no matter the circumstances, could be considered aggression, so I was confused. Maybe I was just wrong!
  ```

  - u/RetardedWabbit:
    ```
    I agree with your definition, but I understand where the other person is coming from. I think they were making aggression overly vague. 

    We do have cultural norms and expectations for when we think the default response should be helping. Having the "obvious" ability to help (medical training, situation etc), severe accidents, and children/elderly come to mind. I still wouldn't call it aggression, but in those scenarios standing by would make people upset, especially if they think you could've helped.

    The other person is likely imagining a scenario where you can definitely help, walk up to the accident, but then just sit and watch it happen without helping.

    ```
    As one data point, it's [generally not illegal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_to_rescue#Common_law_system) to fail to act when you could to save another.

    Now, we're not talking only about legality, but to draw an analogy - many aggressive acts are illegal; the quintessential being assault. In this analogy, failing to act to prevent harm would be closer to negligence, which isn't really "aggressive" by default.

    However, the nuance of the situation matters. If someone is a true "innocent bystander" then IMO you can't call it aggressive if they fail to intervene to prevent harm. However, if the person has some reasonable knowledge or responsibility over the situation such that they are knowingly allowing the person to come to harm, then it could be understood as aggressive. This could be analogised to the situations where there *is* commonly a (legal) duty to rescue (see above link).

    As always when there is nuance to understanding something, it's easy to talk past each other since you're using the same words to talk about different things, and coming from a different frame of reference.

    Identify: causes, triggers/setting, and the "payoffs". Then make changes to reduce or remove those. The payoff is usually self stimulation/distraction.

Focus on occupying your hands, using off-putting tasting lotion, frequent scheduled nail cutting etc. Don't beat yourself up if you backslide, behavior change is stochastic not linear. Also try to make changes that you would be content to keep forever as opposed to only until your nail biting is "fixed".
