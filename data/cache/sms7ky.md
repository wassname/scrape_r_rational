## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Meta question: how do you personally look for good rational fiction, besides this subreddit?

  RR stories are a dime a dozen, but so many of them (even highly rated and popular ones) are just mediocre slogs, plagued with issues like poor prose quality, pacing issues or just lack of updates.
  ```

  - u/DangerouslyUnstable:

    This is a more generalized issue. 99% of _everything_ is crap. The internet and democratization of content creation has just made this more obvious. In the past, having creative work shared with a wider audience required going through gatekeepers. This likely resulted in lots of good content failing to get made/distributed but it also prevented _lots_ of crap from seeing the light of day.

    The democratization is an objectively good thing, but no one yet has come up with a good way of reliably filtering the crap. 

    For free services like Royal Road, this isn't _too_ big a deal, but it's the reason why I quit my paid Kindle Unlimited subscription. The difficulty of finding good stuff amid the dross did not justify the cost, especially when free options like Royal Road are nearly as good.

    None of this answers your question unfortunately, but that's because I don't think there _is_ a good solution yet. Easy access to the creative works of so many people is too new, and we haven't yet figured out the social infrastructure around it yet.

    >how do you personally look for good rational fiction, besides this subreddit?

    Also something I'd like to know the answer to. However, I can help you find good general fiction. Archive of Our Own's sorting system is alright, especially if you can navigate by the tags, but what I find gets me the highest quality stuff is finding an author I like and going into their bookmarks. You can then go into the bookmarks of someone you find there, and then repeat, and so on and so forth. One problem is that bookmark navigation is poorly designed, and I haven't been motivated enough to look up an add-on to fix it.

    That’s something I’ve definitely been wondering too. In my early days of browsing webfiction, I’d read all sorts of web novels, even your average asian ones that I’d discover on novelupdates...usually of very poor quality, with few standouts like Spider, LotM, and Forty Milleniums. As I started to develop higher standards and a thirst for more quality fictions, I found myself driven more and more to RoyalRoad, and now virtually everything I read is from RR. When I look for a new fiction, I browse RR some more, and this only ever changes if say there’s a new Cradle volume. Published novels is a whole nother veritable ocean that I’m clueless and too poor to explore willy nilly.

    Most of the other English webfiction sites just don’t do it for me, as I could never get into things like spacebattles or AO3, and would I really want to hop back into asian webfiction again? I don’t even know if there’s anything recent worth reading except Embers. Other non-RR good fictions posted on places like their own separate sites such as PGTE and Worm are rare.

    Desperately looking for other large sources of quality fictions like RoyalRoad, hell this sub is basically my only source of recs given my reliance on RoyalRoad, since the only alternatives I found are like...r/noveltranslations.

    Oh yes! I mostly read physical books and ebooks and I have to work hard to find good new ones. Gnooks helps some, and the "if-you-liked-X-then-you'll-like-Y" algorithm on goodreads. But people give better recommendations. I see who gave four stars to a book I liked, then see what else they rated highly. Lists also sometimes throw up a discovery. It was through the rational fiction list on goodreads that I found R. Scott Bakker's books.

  I'd like to recommend a series I've posted here before; or, at least, I've posted the sequel. [Hope and Silence in the Hive](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/hope-and-silence-in-the-hive-warhammer-40k-complete.583942/) is a fluffy deconstruction of Warhammer, and it's very explicitly not rational. The main character *cannot* be rational, because that mindset belongs to Tzeentch. The Inquisitors are more rational, but that's not what the story is about. This is a very character-drive, emotional story, and it shows. I recommend it solely on its merits as a piece of writing, but the reason I mention it on this subreddit is because while this isn't rational—

  [Terror & Peace Among the Stars](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/terror-peace-among-the-stars-sequel-warhammer-40k-complete.672535/) very much *is*. Its main character is a Necron who is staunchly anti-death, and I'll just repost my last comment about it here:

  This story is a sequel to [Hope and Silence in the Hive](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/hope-and-silence-in-the-hive-warhammer-40k-complete.583942/), a story of >!the ascendance of!< the personification of hope, and her journey of becoming a >!god!<, which provides important context to elements which may be unexpected if you're unfamiliar with this universe, as I was. I can attest that no prior knowledge of Warhammer 40k is required to understand either work.

  Terror and Peace is from the perspective of a formerly-biological alien who has become a machine. She starts with the scraps of the tools of a civilization who tear apart planets and stars for matter and power and bootstraps up. It contains uplift, character growth, gods, and antimemetics:

  >!“Nulei, there were things, terrible things, you fought things, your people fought things, they left behind weapons, terrible weapons, you will not ever fully realize this, you cannot realize this, even we cannot realize this, the weapons are triggered by ideas, there are ideas that cannot be known. Nothing can be known about these ideas, if they are known the weapons are triggered, those that have known these unknowns have never been. Will never have been, never will be. Your people found a way to not know this, you can never know the unknowns, you will never know them. This is right and good. There were might have been more of us before we began, You and most of we can never remember how many. But they are all gone. We have had to write and work to make this something you can know for a long time, this is as much as we can make known to you. Do not seek to know.”!<

  One thing you should know before reading this series is that the author writes and releases stories with no or very minimal editing. These stories are solid, but the beginnings flounder a bit—I actually completely skipped the first chapter of Hope and Silence without missing anything important.

  I'd also like to ask for alien perspectives. By the same author, we have [Onward To Providence](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34353/onward-to-providence), an alien space trader squid with a very unique mentality. I've also seen [Eifre Quest](https://snugglyserials.wordpress.com/eifre-quest/) recommended here, and it's similarly good. Just, the writing is incredible, the author clearly knows their stuff, and the world feels huge and full of potential. Now, while this is a quest, and I don't tend to like quests, it doesn't have the vagueness, incredible shortness, and inconsistencies that plague most quests you'll find. It's good xenofiction, pure and simple.

  [Marriage And Monsters - An Eschatological Romance](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/24751/marriage-and-monsters-an-eschatological-romance) isn't quite xenofiction, as the main perspectives are or at least started as human, but it gets close and it is on par with works such as Worth the Candle on quality. If you read anything I've put here, make it this one.
  ```

    I personally didn't care for Hope and Silence based on its prose, which was simultaneously frantic and glacial. But I could appreciate what it was going for in terms of themes.

    My go-to for alien perspectives is *A Fire Upon the Deep*. It's not Wildbow-style xenofiction, but it is genuinely well explored.

    You will likely also enjoy the interactive fiction [Coloratura](https://iplayif.com/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifarchive.org%2Fif-archive%2Fgames%2Fcompetition2013%2Fglulx%2Fcoloratura%2FColoratura.gblorb).

  Slightly mean-spirited request, spoilers for Bobiverse book 1 and 2.

  Is there anything like the Bobiverse (We are Legion, We are Bob) series, but good? I like the premise - modern day man is uploaded to a Von Neumann replicator and begins expanding and exploring, with the threat of rival replicators lurking. The sci-fi parts are basically good, but the humor and general dialogue just don’t work at all for me. Additionally, alien life is discovered basically right away (something like the 4th star system he went to) which stretched my suspension of disbelief a lot. 

  I’ve started the Culture series, and I’m expecting the high-tech stuff and AIs in that series to scratch a similar itch.

    I personally found the humor fun, and I don't know if there are any examples that don't have the aliens in publishing.

    *Similar but more military and more magic woo tech (not hard Scifi) is Forerunner By Isaac Hooke.

    *There are the [passages in the void series](http://localroger.com/revelation-passage/borden1.html) which doesn't have aliens

    *Similar but in the opposite direction (a-life protagonist) are the Murderbot diaries, where you have a slacker security unit that is a cybernetic chimera who just wants to watch soap operas after hacking it's negative feedback control system, but does what it needs to keep it's cover as a normal security bot, at least at first, but unfortunately it does care and ocasionally have to do stuff.

    *The culture is a lot of fun, but it's very soft sci-fi
    ```

    - u/plutonicHumanoid:
      ```
      I’m okay with aliens. My specific issue was that Bob found a planet with the equivalent of early humans within something like 30 lightyears of Earth, and this is never really mentioned as being particularly remarkable. By that standard the universe should be full of life. I can’t actually remember if I finished book 2, and I haven’t read book 3, so maybe this is explained at some point. He does find evidence of interstellar civilization at some point, but it had very little gravitas.

        Spoilers for the rest of the series: >!In-universe, it sort of _is_ full of life. By the end of book 4, they have encountered four sapient alien species (two that already had space-faring capability of some level or another) and at least 3 (I think, could be more) additional other planets with non-sapient life, and they haven't gotten to very much of the overall galaxy!<

    Roger Williams "Mortal Passage" gives me a lot of the same vibes as the Bobiverse, but is much more serious.

    Greg Egan's "Diaspora" is about the spread of uploaded and artificial people through space 

    ...

    I can't think of any that scratch the Bobiverse's specific itch for me, which is expanding your base while fighting with rivals for resources and trying to be a good person at the same time. I suppose Will Wight's Cradle is like that?

    > I’ve started the Culture series, and I’m expecting the high-tech stuff and AIs in that series to scratch a similar itch.

    ...It very much depends on the book. The Culture, as a book series and as a, well, culture, isn't particularly concerned with the ins and outs of the tech at play (Aside from the Minds, and really, they're characters, not 'tech'). It's more interested in the moral and cultural questions, and the interactions between characters and between peoples, when you have that kind of vast, terrifying degree of technological control over every aspect of your world. What are the problems that pop up when you already *have* utopia, or as close as it's possible to get, particularly when others *don't*? The Culture, after all, is basically one step below a more scientific version of reaching enlightenment and ascending to a higher plane (there's a couple of books dealing with those who *did* do that). 

    So, while you won't really get any chapters where a Mind designs and tests a drone or whatever, there is a lot to enjoy if you liked the bits in the Bobiverse that featured cultural and technological disparity, and the obligations or responsibilities of the Bobs to those other cultures, and how the Bobs organized themselves when there isn't really an obligation to do it any particular way.

    I don't know where you've started but I'd recommend going right to Excession as soon as you're done whatever you're on (reading order isn't super strict with The Culture series)^1. Without spoiling anything, it kinda intersects directly with the type of stuff at play in the Bobiverse books.

    ------

    ^1 The exception is the Iridian War focused novels (Consider Phlebas, Use of Weapons, etc.), which will be more difficult to situate yourself in if you don't know what's happened before on the large scale. As well, if you do decide to read them chronologically, you're better able to track the long-reaching consequences of that war on The Culture.

    [Wearing Robert's Crown](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11861559/1/Wearing-Robert-s-Crown) is a pretty neat take. It's somewhere between a fix fic and an uplift fic. A functional human being of an SI replaces Robert Baratheon and completely derails the plot. I don't remember how much time it spends on uplift, though.

    I've seen recs for The Logistics of Good Living, but never read it myself. The author seems to have gotten banned (or flounced?) from most of the mainstream fiction sites for what that's worth.

    [Silmaril](https://glowfic.com/boards/18) (glowfic) has some of this? The first subcontinuity (Elentári) has the most serious technological outcome, but it's not the focus. [into this breathing world](https://www.glowfic.com/board_sections/50) has more uplift focus but doesn't get quite as far as Elentári in terms of actual wow of the output.

    I think that all of Silmaril is not necessarily described as technological uplift, but it has a lot of introducing novel concepts and fields to remarkably competent but *young* civilisations, which hits some of the same vibes.

    You might like The Menocht Loop. Book 2 released yesterday on Amazon and more is on Royal Road. I wrote the series because when Mother of Learning was ending, I found myself wanting to read the after story. After all, why think of the time loop as the end, when it is really the beginning? The end result is quite different from MoL, but I think scratches some of the same itches.

    I think you may enjoy [Ar'kendrithyst](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26727/arkendrithyst). It's about a father and daughter duo that are transported to a magical world, though this premise has many twists, including the fact that this world is essentially a life raft of another, more magical universe (think D&D with planes, demiplanes, etc. instea of planets) that was destroyed and the survivors ended up in our universe with different laws of physics. The gods created the Script, a kind of Litrpg system, to hold the mana on the planet and modify the local laws pf physics so magic (and thus magic species) could still work in this new universe.

    It gets increasingly better as the story goes along. I would advise you to power through the first 20 chapters or so, as that's when Erick (the MC) really starts doing Archmage shit and the story takes off from there.

    Much later on (this has >2M words and it's still ongoing) this story also has one of the best written Intelligence increases I have read in novels of this genre, and it's actually shocking the character growth Erick has had since the beginning compared to the last published chapter.
    ```

    - u/thunder_crane:
      ```
      I've come across this before and I have some reservations. Two biggest being multiple references to him being a pacifist, which I find insufferable, and the fact that there's presumably some sort of relationship dynamic with his child (and I personally hate children, so I'm kind of hoping this comes across as something a bit more akin to a friendship..?)
      ```

      - u/Zysek:
        ```
        A great deal of the character growth comes from his pacifist beliefs coming into conflict with the fact that he now lives in a Death World and that he has enough power that not acting has consequences way beyond just him.

        A *lot* of characters give him shit for his pacifiscm, and he markedly improves on this aspect while still retaining his core morals. Still, it does take a while to get there so perhaps you won't get to that point.

        On the daughter issue, she's an adult (in her 20s) so the dynamic is nothing like it would be if she was a child. If you don't like children but are okay with familiar relationships if they aren't involved, I don't think you'll have many problems with this.
        ```

      - u/foveros:
        ```
        3 chapters in and I find him insufferable too but for different reasons; he seems to have no survival instinct whatsoever, not even looking at what spells he can get, and this is even mentioned as a character trait, that he doesn't take survival situations seriously. That sounds like being proudly and purposefully anti rational, not just dumb. Hope that changes.
        ```

        - u/CaramilkThief:
          ```
          Just power through it for a bit, because it's a delayed gratification type of story. Erick is not Joon or Zorian, he has to work through 40+ years of entrenched behavioral patterns that never really got challenged in 21st century Earth, or at least not the way you'd think. He will keep making suboptimal choices later, and they will come to bite him in the ass, and then he will grow.
          ```

          - u/foveros:
            ```
            I'm 21 chapters in now, and it's getting really hard to suspend my desbelief that such a person could exist. Look, I get it. I'm something of a 21st century human myself. I am not expecting him to go all chinese-written protagonist and start killing people for power. But this guy, faced with a world of real magic decided to become a cleaner. When he realises he is facing life or death situations, it takes about 3 near deaths before he considers getting an offensive spell. 

            I get character development, but there is a difference between a character with flaws and a character that is simply made out of flaws. Not only that, but deciding on both stupidity and a complete lack of drive as said flaws seems a terrible idea. It appears to me that the author purposely set the bar as low as it gets so that any achievement would be development.
            ```

            - u/CaramilkThief:
              ```
              If you're not enjoying it then I'd say to just drop it, because things will get worse before they get better. By delayed gratification I mean like *super* delayed, by r/rational standards. The big character changing events happen around the ends of the first few books, so like chapter 38 (book 1), 59 (book 2), 80, 120, etc. I enjoyed the beginning for its slice of life and magic exploration, rather than the dumb and naive mc making suboptimal choices and shunning magic in a magic world. 

              That being said, people who are as stupid as Erick absolutely do exist in real life. People with the same level aversion towards violence of any kind, also exist. I know a few myself. What doesn't exist though is people who are as morally good as Erick, and that gets revealed more and more as Erick starts facing stronger opponents.

      Hated the MC and the meta surrounding the world, sorry.

    I just read up one this. Love it. Anything else like this?

    Maybe try the World of Prime novels.

  Lately I’ve been overcome by a thirst for interesting and novel fictions. I was reminded of an honestly really bad Chinese webnovel I read long ago, The Ultimate Evolution, where people would explore movie worlds to fight enemies and gain powerful special items and abilities. It was bad, but it was interesting. 

  I’m also very drawn to things like monster isekais or monster MCs and dungeon building. I’ve also recently been thinking about wanting to read about a tamer MC and progressing their tamed pet, but realized why such a premise wouldn’t work.

  I also read New Game Minus, which was recommended here last week, as the concept of a native lich suddenly getting access to boxes and leveling was really interesting, and it was right up my alley, if a bit too brief for my tastes.

  Does anybody know of any novel and interesting fictions like these? I’ll even take something that’s battle royale-esque. Novelty might be the thing that I desire the most, after quality and competence. Anything wild, intriguing, interesting, unique. Things like a world with a power system based off mysticism, an actually competent monster isekai, exploring movie worlds for power, cultivation mixed with sci fi, taming and strengthening monsters, a power system based off medieval fantasy story tropes, dungeon building that’s actually about building and using the damn thing, a story that takes place entirely deep in the oceans or on the seas, or even something that’s just rarely done like a black mage MC from The Calamitous Bob. It’s like why everybody was so interested in Delve at the beginning when it wasn’t abysmal.

  Sorry for a vague and obtuse request, but I’ve really been thirsting for something new and interesting recently, and was thinking back to unique and bad novels I read years back.

    Slightly off-base, but you might like to try an anime that's airing right now called Sabikui Bisco. It's a fascinating balance between utterly bonkers what-the-actual-crap craziness and surprisingly solid worldbuilding, coupled with good characters and incredible energy.

    Practical Guide To Evil maybe? Fancy relatively unique magic system. Somewhat distinct world/plot/characterization wise although the main thing is the narrative magic.

    Luck And Chronomancy has a unique-ish magic system with a variety of roles in an 8 person party, but calling it a *crunchy* litrpg is an understatement. I'm not sure you could call it *good* because the goal of the story is to focus heavily on the rpg aspect. Sort of like TUTBAD if instead of taking a dungeon adventurer to slice of life you went the opposite way and added an equivalent amount of rpg mechanics as a focus. Reverse-TUTBAD I guess.

    The author of New Game Minus has a couple of other fictions, each with interesting magic systems - 

    * Street Cultivation: magic as capital
    * Soulhome: magic as DIY home improvement (build a little birdhouse in your soul, but, like, literally)
    ```

    - u/TheTruthVeritas:
      ```
      Haha, so is Soulhome like Rain playing at Minecraft in his soul in Delve?
      ```

      - u/IICVX:
        ```
        Kinda, yeah, except there's actual consequences and plot progression.

    How about "Genetically modified kids acting as a counter-terrorist blackops force for an evil British empire that has taken over the world via zombie armies" aka [Twig](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/)? Less of a power fantasy than most stuff you've listed here, but unusual enough I felt it worth bringing up.

    Anyone by Charles Soule. The conceit is that around the modern day tech is invented that lets you transfer your mind into other people’s bodies. It becomes massively popular for work and recreation - people will rent out their bodies for people to take vacations in their home country, or do wage-sharing agreements where their physically strong body does the work while they’re unconscious and someone else in their body. The concept is explored very well, and it’s a fairly dark book. The genre is sci-fi thriller, and it’s pretty fast paced - it’s 400 pages but I read it in a day because I was so interested.

  I've been reading vampire flower language recently and really enjoyed it. Does anyone else have recommendations for rational romance/soft erotica, or whatever the genre is called?

  I read 'A girl corrupted by the internet is the summoned hero?!' once and \*think\* that also might fit but I don't remember it well. The Erogamer also fits.

- u/None:
  ```
  Are there any stories like Friendship is Optimal? (not necessarily about ponies). Something about a fast takeoff AI that makes the world into a paradise or uploads people into one.

    "The World As It Appears To Be" ([Ao3](https://archiveofourown.org/works/9402014/chapters/21285149)) is rather criminally under recommended imo. Probably in part due to needing some familiarity with Overwatch lore (skimming through their [shorts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAYFVhxsaqDuOh4Ic5mRu5CiZVKCMVv66) is sufficient, and they're good enough quality animation in their own right to not be a chore), but is in theme with fast takeoff AI, though it takes a bit of a roundabout trip to get there.

    Can't say more without spoilers, but there are definitely elements within it that you would find interesting (Author's note: "There's a hell of a lot of technobabble and magic and fancy futuristic stuff going on in Overwatch. I want to really get into the weeds and try to make sense of it all, bump it up a place or two on the scale of sci-fi hardness. It's gonna involve science people doing science things, futurology, strong AI being a problem... I don't want to bill it as "rationalfic", but that's just sort of my natural wheelhouse, so apply the duck test if you want"); let me know what you think if you read it!

    It's also by the same author that did "CORDYCEPS" ([Ao3](https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868)), also a good story ("Honestly, who *hasn't* woken up in a hospital bed with no memory of how they got there? Like, that's a universal human experience, right? It's not weird? I'm asking because I actually don't know.")

      Seconding both TWAIATB and Cordyceps. Great stories both.

      Of course the former was written before some of the latest Overwatch champs were released, but at the time it seemed canon-compatible.
      ```

  - u/D0TheMath:
    ```
    Depending on your morality, the Crystal Trilogy would count. Though I only really enjoyed the first two books, and after that the third didn't make much sense (though I have some theories about what was going on there).
