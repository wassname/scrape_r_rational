  People need to start  posting the summary/intro paragraphs for these online novels if they want more readers. So many of these just link to the newest chapter and i have no idea what these stories are about in the first place.

    That and recaps in case of low postings. 

    Eagle if you're seeing this, you might want to add short reminder of what happened in las chapter. This goes doubly for you since you are also writing that Naruto quest thing, so even more time passes between updates.

      Good suggestion. I will do that in future, thanks.

    I'll give a summary a shot.

    The world runs on mana and elementals. Tinkers have constructed mechs capable of performing everyday tasks like hauling as well as more advanced ones like racing and fighting.

    One tinker, Peter Tinkersmith, creates a mech capable of rearranging the runes that compose its brain in order to emulate a huge variety of different specialised mech functions, essentially granting it sapience.

    Peter is killed by an explosion in his lab while his daughter (Jess) and the mech (Rob, possibly a joke about "Rob-ot") are out. The elaborate system of elementals and mana containment systems was circumvented; it was murder, probably by somebody who wants to harvest the mana from his aborted potential or perhaps cares about the impact of a universal problem-solver on the mech market.

    Now a teenage girl and her mech "brother" are trying to survive and perhaps retaliate against an unknown foe in a world where murderbots are not only a thing, they're something people could build as a hobby.

    If Rob ever runs out of mana, his processing core (brain, esssentially) resets; functionally, Rob dies and a new sapient mech with no experience is born. Unfortunately, Rob's processor core uses a staggering amount of mana, costing tens of thousands of marks; something which is hard to pay for when you have no formal training or history of work.

    The quickest way to make that money is betting on a mech fight or race, preferably one you're in yourself. There's only so long you can do that before you die or become so successful that dangerous people start to take notice.

    [Spoilers for the previous chapter:](#s " Jess had to out Rob's secret to two people in order to save his life after a fight he won by the skin of his teeth (and he has neither, so that was even harder than usual). She's still determined to find out who killed her father, but the money problem hasn't gone away just because they won one fight. What's the next course of action?")
    ```

      That was a great summary, thank you. 

      As to Rob: the first SF book I ever read was I,Robot, a collection of Asimov's seminal short stories about robots. The first story in that collection is "Robbie", a story about one of the first sapient robots. Rob's name is a nod to the master.

  There are no links from chapter 5 to chapter 6. Only found chapter 6 after looking on reddit for stuff about it.
