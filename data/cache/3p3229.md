  So, just in case, how does one "look into one's blind spot"?
  ```

    As far as we know, the phrase is as meaningless as "next December 32nd". We can try to extrapolate ways in which the statement could have meaning: in case of December 32nd, you could say that it's the day after December 31st, so it's January 1st. Or maybe it's an odd calendar which used December instead of February as the leap month, in which case it would be December 31st of the next leap year. Or something else still.

    Looking into the blind spot may involve looking at the physical blind spot of the retina inside your eye, or it may involve the optical lobe not having the standard human method of filling in the blind spot, but instead (optionally?) having it show an image of the verification text. Or something else entirely.

  This guy needs to read some Fun Theoryyy

    I don't think that would help. The story makes clear that everything has simply been done. If you want to do anything which ends up with you being as powerful as you are now, the end state is indistinguishable from the current state, with the possible exception of one slightly longer path being labeled 'historically accurate'.

    There is no room for improvement, which [the Fun Theory Sequence calls possibly equivalent to the end of one's life](http://lesswrong.com/lw/xk/continuous_improvement/).

    The simulation is one consequence of Fun Theory. One way to ensure things stay novel is to deliberately suppress your memories and invent 'new' ones.
