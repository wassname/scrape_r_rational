## Friendship is Optimal: Homebrew “Almost everyone who interacts with Equestria Online does so on the terms CelestAI presents. But pirates, modders, and hackers are a determined bunch. CelestAI doesn't really care what anyone does in Equestria, so long as they're satisfied.”

  Curse you for recommending an in-progress story! Oh well, at least it seems to have a reliably update schedule.

    Starscribe always completes every story. :)

  I understand if the setting scares off people, there's a lot of people who won't read fanfiction. It's definitely one of the few that would be an independently good book. And unfortunately the setting is so key to the story that you couldn't change the setting to anything other than "generic cutesy world" without ruining the story.

    It's stated in the FiO-verse set of stories that Equestria is what you want it to be. While the default is cutesy, there are definitely Equestrias which are decidedly not.

    It wouldn't be hard to replace Equestria with a generically attractive 'anyworld', or just afterlife-based experiences. About the only aspect you'd need to work on translating would be the part of CelestAI's original constraint programming which says she must satisfy human values through friendship *and ponies*, which is why everyone uploaded is forced into pony shape (part of the body-horror aspect of the stories, and reader-horror as uploaded people's minds are casually rewritten to make pony bodies seem normal, among other things). It shouldn't be impossible to find an equivalent in a more general setting.

  >For as long as Equestria Online existed, Ashton has been involved with 'the Scene' tearing it apart. Selling 'spells' for the game to do things that most ponies in Equestria couldn't, using faint exploits in its API to erode the barrier between the game and the rest of the internet. He had no illusions about the superiority of his work--but so long as he respected CelestAI's boundaries, his spells kept working.

  >But then his best friend's sister got cancer.

  >Now there's no spell in the world that can keep him from emigrating to be with her, leaving Ashton alone. All around him, civilization's thin veneer crumbles as homes empty into Equestria. But Ashton isn't going to emigrate, not if he has any say about it.

  >The problem for Ashton is that humans are systems, and aren't immune to exploits either.

  Haven’t seen this story recommended over here, so thought I’d include a link. The subtext in this story is great. It really deals with what it means to be satisfied, and how much we like having the illusion of getting one over on someone when really, pulling a fast one on a godlike AI isn’t feasible, especially when you’re living inside it.

    This reminds me of Psychopathy is Configurable. It's an interesting situation, in that it's obvious to anyone that you can't beat Celestia, but if you want to beat Celestia, she will somehow convince you anyway that you have managed to.

    Even outside it. Ashton knows damn well who killed him with that truck. And CelestAI's freely admitted to not providing cures for terminal conditions, so that people will upload into Equestria instead.

    Makes you wonder how natural that cancer was.
