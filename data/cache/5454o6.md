## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  My father has been in declining health for some time, due to a terminal disease. Over the past couple of days, he quickly went from a fully functional adult to someone who cannot live on his own, intermittently confused and lost. I suppose that any good father is a hero in the eyes of his son, and Dad was a hero to me. Mentally, he was a giant; educated in literature, science, and business, he was a voracious reader and could speak at length on any topic. He had books in German, French, and English on his bookshelf. I always had a certain awe for him, of his philosophy and his art and his books in foreign languages filled with poetry and literature. He had recordings of poetry read aloud by professionals on vinyl records, classical music, singing in Farsi, and fine art hanging on his walls. He loved poetry, as I suppose most Persians do. His favorite poem was The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock by T. S. Eliot. 

  Dad was born in Iran, and moved to France as a boy when my family fled bad conditions there. He went to Germany for college, studying geophysics. ("Why geophysics?" I asked. He replied: "Well, I started in physics, but I didn't like all the math needed for quantum mechanics. Geophysics had the same requirements, but with geology instead.") After he graduated, he ended up moving to America to seek his fortune, and perhaps more education. ("Why move to America? Why not work in geophysics?" I asked. He replied: "Geophysics means you need to work looking for oil in the desert or drilling ice cores in Antarctica. No pretty women there. I met some American foreign exchange students one year, and they were very pretty, so I knew where I wanted to move.")

  He came to America, and he was able to find a job in construction work. He had some experience, since he had started his degree in Germany studying engineering before changing to physics. Part of the curriculum for engineers at the Technische Hochschule in Koln was spending a summer working on a construction project as a worker (mostly digging ditches), so he knew what to do. What he didn't know, however, was who to eat lunch with. There were two lunch groups, the whites and the blacks. As a Persian, he didn't fit in either group. He ended up sitting with the blacks. ("Why the blacks?" I asked. He replied: "I didn't know who to sit with. Looking at the two groups, the whites looked gloomy, but the blacks were laughing, smiling, and telling jokes, so I sat with them.") This explains all the black friends he has, I suppose. 

  Eventually, Dad and his girlfriend decided to move across the country from Philadelphia to Berkeley, California. He'd bought a Chevy Corvair for $200, they put everything he owned in it, and together, they set out across the country. That car, "unsafe at any speed," probably wasn't the best choice for a cross-country vehicle, but it was cheap and pretty. Somewhere in the midwest, partway through the trip, the car broke down, and they took it to a mechanic. He replaced a part and they were able to start the car again. 

  "Will this car make it to California?" Dad asked. He knew there would be mountains to cross to get there, but didn't have money for a better car.

  "Yeah," drawled the mechanic, "but don't *push* the motherfucker."

  For the rest of the trip, any time Dad went too fast, Bev would say, "Don't push the motherfucker," and he'd ease off the gas.

  In Berkeley, he attended the University of California and got a degree in comparative literature (easy, for a man who spoke Farsi, French, German, and English fluently), then attended the business school. He fell in love with the city and decided to stay there and never move away. This was only the beginning of his life, in a way, and all the stories that remain would be too many to write here. He worked in startups, pitching ideas and trying to get companies off the ground. There was a successful one designing RFID tags for cattle. Another selling CDs containing medical information (think WebMD but before the internet was huge). He fell in love, got married, had a kid (my brother), before things fell apart. Then, he did it again, and I was born. A lucky child, to have such a father. He would drive, every weekend, from Berkeley to Palo Alto to pick me up and and take care of me for a couple days before returning me to Mom's place on Sunday. He did this every weekend for over a decade, so I could have the schooling afforded me by my mother's Palo Alto residence, and still see my father every week. Eventually, he became a real estate agent and eased into a comfortable semi-retirement. 

  He lived a vibrant life of adventure and love and intellectual curiosity. He's smart, even now. There was no gradual decline of mental abilities, because of his intelligence. Dad might get temporarily confused in conversation or while doing a task, but he would figure out instantly what was going on from context until he remembered. He'd run into a problem pressed on him by his declining alertness and he'd find a way around it with habits and patterns and ability to solve problems on the fly. And eventually, finally, when it became too much for him to route around with his intelligence, it all collapsed at once. No gradual decline of mental ability, just a sudden inability of his cleverness to overcome his handicaps, laying bare everything that he's lost up until this point.

    I'm sorry for you and your family. My dad is another persian immigrant, came to the US to learn engineering and flee the theocracy, built himself and his architecture business up from nothing. He's had some failing health issues recently too. It's hard seeing someone who has always been so strong, so helpless. 

    Give your dad an extra hug when you next see him. I'm sure he appreciates having a son who loves and admires him so much.

  I’m looking for advice on productivity and depression, and since I have most of the same mental quirks as most of you, I thought I’d ask here. Here are a few details:

  I’ve been playing around with a couple different antidepressants over the past several months, and recently, my doctor had me try bupropion, which is sort of helping to improve my mood a little, but not putting me in a state where I’m able to get things done. In general, I’ve already tried the stuff before the “Get Serious” section on SSC’s [Things that Sometimes Help if You’re Depressed](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/16/things-that-sometimes-help-if-youre-depressed/) page, such as thyroid/anemia tests, CBT with a counselor, etc.

  My biggest problem is that being depressed means that I don’t have much willpower to spend on things. When I was a student, I could reliably get 40+ hours of solid work done a week. Now, it feels like I have little enough energy that, on most days, I have to choose between writing an hour of code, going out to socialize, exercising, or cooking something decently healthy. Perhaps having a job would help boost my self-esteem and thereby raise my productivity, but that seems like a chicken-and-egg problem, as the whole point of being productive is so I can have a job, or otherwise make enough money to give some to EA causes.

  *help*? Please and thank you <3

  ETA: It seems like writing code takes tons more effort than other productive things, like doing e.g. linear algebra or statistics problems from a bachelor's level math class, or mundane productive things like cleaning and self-care. Maybe this is a bad sign?

    Thanks a lot for reaching out, asking help takes a lot of effort and helpes others in your situation. 
    It's too late here for the long answer I want to write, so I'll come back tomorrow and will add more parts.

    For now know that you are not alone and that things gets better. Those are not empty words. 

    Yoi can check the replies to my first reddit comment, my problem different but they helped me a lot. At the end the big question for everyone is: "how can I be happy?"

    So, check this again tomorrow, and feel free to PM me.

If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were: any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never send to know for whom the bells tolls; it tolls for thee.”

    - Eugene V. Debs, on being convicted of sedition for making a speech urging people to resist the draft in 1918.

    If one is going to aspire, one might as well set one's sights high. Debs was one of the great orators of his era and, while I don't any longer agree with his politics I can't help but admire his attitude:

    >"I am not a Labor Leader; I do not want you to follow me or anyone else; if you are looking for a Moses to lead you out of this capitalist wilderness, you will stay right where you are. I would not lead you into the promised land if I could, because if I led you in, some one else would lead you out. You must use your heads as well as your hands, and get yourself out of your present condition."

    >“Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing directions. You change direction but the sandstorm chases you. You turn again, but the storm adjusts. Over and over you play this out, like some ominous dance with death just before dawn. Why? Because this storm isn't something that blew in from far away, something that has nothing to do with you. This storm is you. Something inside of you. So all you can do is give in to it, step right inside the storm, closing your eyes and plugging up your ears so the sand doesn't get in, and walk through it, step by step. There's no sun there, no moon, no direction, no sense of time. Just fine white sand swirling up into the sky like pulverized bones. That's the kind of sandstorm you need to imagine.

    >An you really will have to make it through that violent, metaphysical, symbolic storm. No matter how metaphysical or symbolic it might be, make no mistake about it: it will cut through flesh like a thousand razor blades. People will bleed there, and you will bleed too. Hot, red blood. You'll catch that blood in your hands, your own blood and the blood of others.

    >And once the storm is over you won't remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won't even be sure, in fact, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm you won't be the same person who walked in. That's what this storm's all about.” 

    ― Haruki Murakami, Kafka on the Shore

    >“Who has never killed an hour? Not casually or without thought, but carefully: a premeditated murder of minutes. The violence comes from a combination of giving up, not caring, and a resignation that getting past it is all you can hope to accomplish. So you kill the hour. You do not work, you do not read, you do not daydream. If you sleep it is not because you need to sleep. And when at last it is over, there is no evidence: no weapon, no blood, and no body. The only clue might be the shadows beneath your eyes or a terribly thin line near the corner of your mouth indicating something has been suffered, that in the privacy of your life you have lost something and the loss is too empty to share.” 

    ― Mark Z. Danielewski, House of Leaves

    >“When my husband died, because he was so famous and known for not being a believer, many people would come up to me-it still sometimes happens-and ask me if Carl changed at the end and converted to a belief in an afterlife. They also frequently ask me if I think I will see him again. Carl faced his death with unflagging courage and never sought refuge in illusions. The tragedy was that we knew we would never see each other again. I don't ever expect to be reunited with Carl. But, the great thing is that when we were together, for nearly twenty years, we lived with a vivid appreciation of how brief and precious life is. We never trivialized the meaning of death by pretending it was anything other than a final parting. Every single moment that we were alive and we were together was miraculous-not miraculous in the sense of inexplicable or supernatural. We knew we were beneficiaries of chance. . . . That pure chance could be so generous and so kind. . . . That we could find each other, as Carl wrote so beautifully in Cosmos, you know, in the vastness of space and the immensity of time. . . . That we could be together for twenty years. That is something which sustains me and it’s much more meaningful. . . . The way he treated me and the way I treated him, the way we took care of each other and our family, while he lived. That is so much more important than the idea I will see him someday. I don't think I'll ever see Carl again. But I saw him. We saw each other. We found each other in the cosmos, and that was wonderful.”

    I saved some quotes from when I read The Book of Five Rings(1645) by the legendary swordsman Miyamoto Musashi. Great book about strategy and the philosophy of a warrior.

    * Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world
    * Today is victory over yourself of yesterday; tomorrow is your victory over lesser men.
    * Do not sleep under a roof. Carry no money or food. Go alone to places frightening to the common brand of men. Become a criminal of purpose. Be put in jail, and extricate yourself by your own wisdom.
    * It is difficult to realize the true Way just through sword-fencing. Know the smallest things and the biggest things, the shallowest things and the deepest things.
    * To know ten thousand things, know one well
    * There is nothing outside of yourself that can ever enable you to get better, stronger, richer, quicker, or smarter. Everything is within. Everything exists. Seek nothing outside of yourself.
    * The important thing in strategy is to suppress the enemy's useful actions but allow his useless actions
    * All man are the same except for their belief in their own selves, regardless of what others may think of them

  Weekly update on my rational pokemon game, which for now is work on the data creation tool:

  Iterations continued on the graph. The gif I have this week is kind of boring but shows off a neat feature: the example pokemon graphs are no longer hard-coded. The user can define how many they would like to show based on performance and readability issues:

  http://i.imgur.com/6NmFMmb.gif

  It's not shown, but you can also define the minimum gap between curves to prevent overlap. Currently the pool of example pokemon is still hard-coded, but I have plans to spin this off into a config file.

  I added a settings tab for all the fiddly bits that I was hard-coding into things, including some options to disable animations for the graph to improve performance if needed.

  The Bulbapedia download was improved; you can now indicate a range to download (rather than all 721), with options to overwrite or integrate if you already have some pokemon defined locally. 

  It occured to me that I'm going to need a way to determine how many tiles a pokemon takes up. I think I'm going to add a setting for each pokemon that indicates whether size increase is more influenced by height (onix) or weight (snorlax), with a % modifier for each. Height and weight growth may need to be added as well.

  Goals this week are to produce some documentation with pictures so people who can't run it can see what it looks like, add the stuff I speculated about above, and otherwise get the species tab finished so I can actually work on moves.

    can you tell me more about what a rational pokemon game would look like? One where stats / mechanics seem to follow consistent rules that don't violate physics e.g.?
    ```

    - u/ketura:
      ```
      So a while back I put together a design document and have had a few different discussions about it here on /r/rational; I've put links to them all [in this document here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EUSMDHdRdbvQJii5uoSezbjtvJpxdF6Da8zqvuW42bg/edit?usp=sharing) if you want a truly in-depth answer to that question.

      I have an essay I've been poking at that details what I think a "rational game" is, and I need to get around to finishing and posting it, but the 30-second version is, I think it has a lot to do with A: being internally consistent, and B: permitting the player to make rational decisions due to rules being based on point A.

      There are quite a few aspects of the game that have to be changed.  To be honest, this is more "a rational game in a pokemon setting" rather than "a pokemon game tweaked to be more rational".  The below are a list of points that have been designed so far.

      TL;DR pokemon is a mess, and just about everything has to follow the intended spirit rather than lift the exact system.

      * Types completely revamped.  Shoehorned weaknesses removed; Poison for instance (currently) has nothing that is super-effective against it, because why is a poisonous creature weaker to something that a normal creature would not be weak to?  Additional weaknesses/resistances modified to make more sense; Fire is *less* effective against Steel than it is against Rock, and Poison is super-effective against Psychic (since someone who relies on mental concentration has a hard time doing so while vomiting), etc. 

      * Type weaknesses/resistances changed to a percentage system rather than the 2x/1x/0.5x system of canon.  Poison does 400% damage to Psychic, 10% damage to Steel.

      * Pokemon and moves can now have multiple types and arbitrary percentages of types (Charizard is currently designed as 10% Normal, 50% Fire, 20% Dragon, 20% Flying).

      * Flying type is for all intents and purposes Normal type when it comes to damage, and an accuracy modifier otherwise.  Flying types can fly about the battlefield, with their % Flying type influencing how fast they change from ground mode to flying mode.  While in the air, Flying-type moves have a bonus accuracy and all non-Flying moves have a decreased accuracy against the flyer.  All Normal and Fighting moves are considered Flying-type for pokemon that are in the air.

      * Types have a new Affinity system that affects how easy it is to learn moves.  a 100% Fighting type pokemon has a Strong affinity to learning Fighting and Normal moves, no modifier to learning Steel, Rock, or Ground moves, a Disadvantage to learning Poison, Bug, Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, Ice, or Dragon moves, and a Weak affinity to learning Ghost, Psychic, Dark, or Fairy moves.  

      * Combat takes place on a hex grid, with positioning a major factor in battling.

      * Base stats now range from 1 to 1000 (this is less a realism change and more a quality-of-life change for the designer).  IVs are a one-time modification to the base stats at creature creation, defined as a % spread.  For instance, if a pokemon species has base 100 ATK and a spread of 20%, any individual might have an ATK generated between 90 and 110.  The % spread is configurable per stat, per species, so a pokemon might have 50% spread on DEF and 18% spread on SPD.

      * Sexual Dimorphism is also a thing.  For each species, a multiplier can be set for either gender against all stats.  For instance, males might have 10% more ATK on average, while females have 10% more SPD.  Gender is also treated as an IV, which means that a particular individual may express features closer or further away from their own gender's stereotype.

      * Endurance (END) is the biggest stat change, though nearly a dozen other attributes have been added to be tracked (and improved) as stats (details in the design document linked above).  Endurance represents the long-term physical exhaustion of your pokemon, and is only improved through rest or a pokemon center.  Items such as Elixer or Ether will temporarily "heal" endurance, but at the cost of increased endurance usage, so you cannot battle constantly forever.

      * EVs as a system are now basically a measure of how often that particular stat or move have been used.  As a move's EV increases, the overall effectiveness is increased, which might mean different things for different moves.  Stat EVs are gained all over the place; any time ATK is used in any calculation, the pokemon gains one (or more) ATK EVs.  

      * Each pokemon's anatomy is defined similarly to Dwarf Fortress' RAW files.  Every major appendage or body part is represented.  Stats are "enclosed" within body parts; a Leg might have SPD, END, EVA, and ATK associated with it, and injury to that body part will effectively serve as a temporary reduction in that stat for that pokemon.  

      * Moves by default have anatomical restrictions.  To learn Bite, the creature must simply have a Mouth.  To Fly, the pokemon must have one or more Wings or some other body part with the Flight attribute.  This can be worked around somewhat by the use of TMs.

      * Anatomy can be targeted.  At the cost of an accuracy penalty, your pokemon can target specific parts of their opponent in an effort to cripple it.  Severely damaging all Wings or Flight-tagged body parts, for instance, will ground a Flying pokemon.  Damaging a Blastoise's cannons will severely dampen its ability to use water attacks.  Breaking a Rapidash's leg will equalize its SPD advantage.  Etc etc.

      * Accuracy in general is getting overhauled to more closely resemble XCOM (though not *quite* as ridiculous).  If a pokemon is moving, it should be hard to hit unless you have spent time training that exact scenario.

      * The trainer (you) will also have stats affecting your ability to heal, train, instruct, and inspire your pokemon, and even affecting things like how accurately you throw pokeballs.  The capture system will be lifted wholesale from Origin of Species, so actually hitting your target will be the important thing.

      * Permadeath will probably be a thing.  It will be flexible and fair, but if you fail to get to your pokemon in time after it has been sufficiently grievously wounded, it will die.  Or, perhaps, if there's nothing substantial left to retrieve to your pokeball....

      * All pokemon will be redesigned to match how dangerous they should *actually* be, using the stats from canon only as a starting point.  Onix will not be a pushover.

      * The world will be more dangerous in general.  If you're not prepared to take on a fully-sized Onix, that's a serious risk you take in going into Mt. Moon.  

      * Areas in general will have more optional sections to them; maybe you just run through Veridian following the roads as fast as you can, or maybe you delve into them more thoroughly.  There will always be increased risk in doing so.

      * The world will have large swaths of it procedurally generated.  Cities will almost always be the same, but each time the world is created the routes will be randomized somewhat.  You are in fact playing a brand-new trainer, and thus should have no idea what precisely a new area holds.  

      * Gyms can be tackled in any order.  Gating will be restricted to an absolute minimum, so the player can take whatever risks he or she deems necessary.  

      * Battling will occur in the same space as the overworld, so routes will be much longer to compensate.  

      * Pokemon will travel as individuals, families, packs, or herds as fits the species.  Nests may be found.  Individuals can be tracked through the overworld, so catching a particular pokemon you've previously weakened is a distinct possibility, and perhaps the norm.

      And, finally, it should be noted that the VAST MAJORITY of the above will not be entirely or perfectly portrayed to the player.  These are the systems that will work behind the scenes, but the player will only have limited ability to gather specific information on their pokemon or their world outside of the use of a more advanced pokedex, which will have its role greatly increased.  Though it will (probably) be superficially similar to a normal pokemon game, it will play more like a roguelike.

      Anyway, sorry for the novel-length "summary".  If you have any suggestions or questions, be sure to let me know; this project has already been greatly improved by the input of people such as /u/DayStarEld and /u/ultraredspectrum, and I'm happy to hear any comments you might have.

        I love a lot of this, and I think we could hash out the typing interactions more if you want.  For example:

        >Fire is less effective against Steel than it is against Rock, and Poison is super-effective against Psychic (since someone who relies on mental concentration has a hard time doing so while vomiting), etc.

        To me, Fire is strong against Steel because inside all that metal are still biological organs. Different, maybe, from what we're used to, but still susceptible to heat.  When you heat up a metal skin, it's very painful.  When you heat up a rocky skin, it barely feels it.

        As for poison and psychic, what I would say instead is that psychic should RESIST poison but NOT be super effective against it. Because psychics posses the ability to cleanse themselves of foreign bodies, and can telekenetically stop acid and poison needles and whatnot from hitting them (much easier than doing so to stop rocks thrown at them, though this could potentially be an argument against grass moves too). If you'd rather have that be demonstrated through actual attacks and defensive moves, and just want to keep things as a "this is what happen when X substance meets Y substance," that makes sense. 

        And I agree that Psychic shouldn't be super effective against poison. It's probably the type interaction that makes the least sense in the games. I can rationalize Ground 2x vs Poison better than I can Psychic 2x vs Poison.

        One thing I've noticed from when I play fan games is that attempts to make the game harder lead to two habits I wind up in that I don't really like.  The first is the clear 'grind until every challenge is easy' urge.  Grinding costs nothing except monotony and it gives you the tools to easily beat any challenge, which sounds good until you realize that you're left with hours of tedium and an unchallenging game if you follow the urge.  I don't feel this urge in the main series because, by and large, there's no need for grinding.  I don't know how possible it would be, but I feel that the game would be better if the urge to grind was counterbalanced by other incentives/disincentives or even taken out of the equation somehow.

        The other urge I fall into, I've noticed, is when routes are packed full of challenging trainers that I can still beat, I often feel the need to go all the way back to the Pokemon Center, to not be disadvantaged for the next fight.  It's depressingly common, and my reaction these days to a faux-endurance challenge is more negative than positive.  Again, this isn't much of a concern in the main series where challenge is a minimum, but I think it's a topic worth investigating, if there's a way to make a segment like that where I have no choice but to stick it through or if such segments should be avoided entirely.

        Design talking points aside, this looks like a mountain and a half of work to get through, especially where you would have to create new values like the Pokemon body part metrics.  I doubt I'm in any position to be much help deep in the code, but if there's some legwork to the tune of hundreds of Pokemon to do or some part of the design you want another opinion on, I'd be honoured to help out in my spare time.
        ```

        - u/DaystarEld:
          ```
          Introducing limitations on time is the best way to address the grinding and backtracking-for-healing issues, I think.  When time passing matters, and your trainer has to spend money on food and shelter, then you get to the point where the game becomes more of a realistic simulation, with realistic limitations on "gaming" the system.
          ```

        - u/ketura:
          ```
          I abhor grinding.  

          "What did you do today?" 

          "I pressed a button repeatedly until my monitor told me I had pressed it enough times and I was allowed to now go do things I actually wanted to do."  

          > I don't know how possible it would be, but I feel that the game would be better if the urge to grind was counterbalanced by other incentives/disincentives or even taken out of the equation somehow.

          Rest assured, my goal is to make a series of small, interesting events that are chained together into a bunch of larger, interesting events.  If the player wants to grind I won't stop him, but I don't want there to ever be a wall that they are not *permitted* to go by until their team is a certain strength.  If they want to go forward, then go forward, and if you get your ass kicked, well, maybe go search for another area that you can handle, or *just stick to the road*.  

          If you're having trouble with a badge, go searching deep into the jungle to find a rare pokemon that would help you beat it! Or go find a guy that can teach your pokemon Ice Beam!  Or go earn enough money to buy the TM! Or skip the badge entirely and come back later!  Or, *if you're absolutely set on it*, spend time grinding the gym's training area before finally eking out a win.  But that should be your absolute last-ditch option, intentionally made the most boring! 

          >The other urge I fall into, I've noticed, is when routes are packed full of challenging trainers that I can still beat, I often feel the need to go all the way back to the Pokemon Center, to not be disadvantaged for the next fight.

          Trainer fights will be different in this incarnation.  I'm not sure I like the whole "we made eye contact WE ARE DUTY BOUND TO FIGHT" thing, so it will more likely be NPCs that you can talk to and offer to battle.  I also expect that there will be relatively fewer trainers way out in the sticks, and more of them right in or near town, so if nothing else you'd have a shorter trip on your hands.

          Trainer fights and wild battles will have a difference in effort, though.  Origin of Species had the characters being very careful to not actually harm the opponent's pokemon, and I aim to have a similar system.  Something more like "1v1, first to half HP loses" sort of thing, with serious penalties for then intentionally punting your opponent into the stratosphere.  

          Anyway, I have no intention of having trainer mazes that you have dodge or fight your way through; I intend for most of the game and most of the interesting challenges to be fighting wild pokemon.  Here's the pokemon I want to capture; he's surrounded on that side by a cliff that I can use for Rock Slide, but he's also got five or six friends close to him, and how can I drive them away without losing my quarry?  Etc.

  I've been doing a lot of thinking about a conflict for my time-travel story and I have two different time-travel abilities for my two protagonists. I'm fine with a problem that requires them to work together or a problem where they are in direct conflict, but I'm having trouble thinking of a genuinely interesting problem for them to be involved in. I'm hoping for an ideological conflict or something that can get the reader questioning which side is actually in the right; a [Good vs Good](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodVersusGood) battle.

  Does anyone have any suggestions? If there were any tropes you ever wanted to see in a time-travel story, now's the time to speak up! Here's the [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/53ns0s/rational_nanowrimo/) that describes the time powers if you are interested.

    There's always the old standby of murder mystery. They both have abilities that are useful for gathering information, but limited in their scope. You could have them investigate the crime and try to prevent it from happening, but because of the gaps in their knowledge they are suspicious of each other and maybe even themselves. It may not be easy to write, but it's a tried and true conflict starter.

  Does anyone else think mainstream fiction is becoming more rational? The Martian and Breaking Bad are some of the most acclaimed stories in recent memory and I think they both qualify as rational. Other examples are less clear cut, but I still think they represent a trend towards the criteria we associate with rational and rationalist fiction.

  Zootopia has intelligent characters and detailed worldbuilding, Limitless is a detective show about solving mysteries through munchkinism while dealing with a conspiracy of munchkins, and the Marvel films like are now deconstructing and reconstructing themselves by exploring the implications of the Avengers' actions and motivations.

  Combine that with critics and fans alike complaining about issues that rational fiction was specifically designed to avoid, and I think our community has a huge opportunity for growth if we play our cards right. Rationality is no longer a niche idea, it's what the people want to see. Can anybody think of other examples outside this subreddit?

      Well, *most* of the principles are, but there are a few things "truly" rational fiction do that make for unsatisfying narrative. For example, Wildbow dice rolling for fatalities during worm is rational in the sense that it allows probability, rather than plot armor, to dictate who dies, but many of us would probably have dropped the series if the wrong charachters had died.

      - u/DaystarEld:

        I can't imagine stopping a story just because a character died. Now, if the consequences or aftermath of the death weren't handled well, that would be one thing, but loss of beloved characters is where so much meat in compelling stories are found.

        Then again, Deathnote did become far less enjoyable for me after a certain plot point halfway through... Though that's just becaus the follow up "replacement" wasn't as entertaining.

          For me it becomes a lot less enjoyable to watch a series if all my favorite characters die leaving behind the ones whose stories I'm not that interested in. I had the same problem with Death Note, Game of Thrones, and Telltale's The Walking Dead. Sure, the deaths provide drama. But once the drama is over there has to be something else driving the story.

                Ahh. I can see how ending a series that way can be a bit of a downer, especially if it's not handled well.

                In the series I'm thinking of, it really kicks everything into a new mode. The protagonist spent years and book after book fighting to save his city, gaining allies, training others, learning to be the strongest and toughest and smartest he could be, and becomes the de facto leader of the city's good guys/defenders... thus painting a mark on his back, and getting sniped at the end of a book.

                The subsequent one details how everyone reacted, and how they basically all stepped up to take up his mantle, and continue his work and legacy as best they could, even though none of them individually was as strong as him. It was very bittersweet and inspiring.

                  Don't be mistaken, I loved the ending of that series.

                  It's just that, in the general case, it's really dissapointing when entire books worth of charachterization go down the toilet.

                    Sure, but that's what makes it meaningful :) If they didn't have a whole book's worth of characterization, their death would just be a blip, rather than a hammerblow to the gut.

                      That's helpful as a story element, sure, but it really reduces the impetus to keep reading a story. The great thing about sequels is that the author has already established their cast and setting, so they can move straight to the plot. In a work that had previously focused on a main charachter, that means the author needs to go straight back to the drawing board and flesh out a side charachter.

                      That can lead to good results, of course (the series I'm thinking of had a spinoff I enjoyed, because the side-charachter-to-MC switch was done well) but still slows down the story.

            I also recall hearing that, if the main character was set to die, she would have been classified as a decoy protagonist, and the perspective would shift to someone suitably different.  It would be like a completely different story, but the plot could still be told, to one degree or another.

            He even had the scene planned, if she did die.  The only difference between that and canon is that no one would show up to help her.

      It's very hard for a non-rationalist to write a rationalist because of how small and tightly knit our community is. One of the main things about HPMOR that turned me onto rationality was how different the way Harry thought from the way I did. He's probably still the most accessible rationalist character for newcomers since the story acknowledges how different he is, has his uniqueness be both an asset and a hindrance to his life, and establishes that just because he is very intelligent does not mean he's right.

    The first barrier for me would be the speed of light. You can't really instantly destroy a galaxy since it takes anything a couple million years to traverse the entire thing.

    A lot of singularity scenarios kind of look like this, in that both friendly and unfriendly GAI have strong incentives to turn most matter into computronium, like a cosmic level lightspeed grey goo event.      
    From an outside perspective this would look like the galaxy was being destroyed, though there would potentially be some weird things visible as the computronium gives of IR.
    ```

  - u/ZeroNihilist:
    ```
    In terms of a single event, I can't come up with anything easy to wipe out a galaxy. Galaxies are far too large and far too sparse to be easily dealt with using the sort of energies we can manage.

    You could cause a lot of havoc if you collided two galaxies together. It's my understanding that this would lead to lots of new star creation. There might be other effects as well, but I don't know enough to say. As mentioned, galaxies are sparse enough that there won't even be many direct collisions of stars when two galaxies interact.

    You would be able to do a lot of damage if you [fed a large star to a spinning supermassive black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysical_jet). That creates a jet of highly energetic matter along the axis of rotation, which may be enough to wipe out things in its path.

    The caveat there is that it's subluminal matter, and we're about 26,500 light years away from the galactic centre. If you had a way of creating a black hole closer to your target you might be able to make it happen in a reasonable time, but if you could do that you should just create black holes near your target.

    Really, the only thing I can think of that's plausibly efficient (i.e. low requirements, high effect) is some sort of grey goo scenario. Nanobots convert planets and stars into more nanobots which self-assemble into ships which fly off to other systems. Would probably take a very long time and could probably be easily stopped by the victims if they had forewarning (e.g. from seeing the stars die).

    Killing a solar system is by comparison easy.
    ```
