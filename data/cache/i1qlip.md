  Everyone in universe: Oh god our dangerous experiment has escaped and is putting the lives of everyone here in severe jeopardy, this is a disaster

  Everyone reading: KICK THEIR ASS MEWTWO WOOO YOU GO TULPA-BRO

  Otherwise, loved MG's section - presumably Red guiding her and Lizzy for a simultaneous light bomb and also Killing Intent'ing the Vulpix (current theory, ill admit its not clear) is some intense psychic upgrading also a bit of a moral event horizon there (a justified one, but still). I really enjoyed MG's...I will say autistic-coded thought processes as well? Fine if that's not what was intended, that sort of imagery-association patterning is just what resonated with me. Not everyone should have a "unique" approach but side characters just organically being themselves is one of the things this story consistently delivers well.

  I do still though stand by my opinion of "some of the Hoenn content should have happened off screen", its a lot detail on characters and a world we don't know and, presumably, won't be very relevant going forward to the main cast. With Blue's team & Red's psychic crew the cast has already expanded a lot. I think the narrative could have benefited from the Hoenn story being told in broader strokes as I find it hard to be asked to care about MG \*and\* Steven anew in the same update. Time will tell though of course!

    I think the part of me that wants more updates and more meat faster wants the hoenn stuff slimmed down, but the part of me that grew up reading the wheel of time appreciates the extra world building, populating the fringes of this story with solid characters who have their own stories.

    And mewtwo FTW
    ```

    - u/The_Magus_199:
      ```
      Yeah, ultimately I like the Hoenn stuff in these interludes because the worldbuilding and fleshing out is my favorite part of this story, even if I’ll be happy when our perspective goes back to the trio.
      ```

  - u/Roneitis:
    ```
    Some sort of synesthesia at the very least
    ```

    - u/AKAAkira:
      ```
      Synesthesia means the melding of sensory perception. You may have meant to use [ideasthesia](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ideasthesia), the melding of concept to sensory perception. (Or at least, there's effort being expended to make that distinction.)
      ```

      - u/Roneitis:
        ```
        Perhaps. I'll admit, much of my knowledge comes from vague interneting; majorly the wikipedia page. That said, the examples on there do discuss things like numbers having colours, dates having relative locations, etc. It sounds like there's alot of overlap in the terms. That said, considering how... fleshed out the associations are, ideasthesia might fit better.
        ```

  - u/XxChronOblivionxX:
    ```
    Personally, I was on the security team's side. Mewtwo was scary when they became bitter after Giovanni dropped the ball and failed to retain their loyalty, and then became significantly more terrifying when their tulpas decided to make WinEverythingForever.exe on their own. At this point I'd love to see the Mewtwo that isn't this value-shifted perfectly selfish psychopath, since I'm pretty sure Primary!Mewtwo hasn't reassembled yet.
    ```

    - u/Dragfie:
      ```
      IDK, I didn't feel him being psychopathic at all, his main consciousness is still very friendly and his Tuplas just seemed practical not scary to me.  I think they did a really good job with the comforters around MewTwo, his personality is really shaped by them; good honest people and it felt like it shows.
      ```

      - u/Radix2309:
        ```
        Yeah. They generally seem to be motivated by their very realistic fear of their captors. They still build connections and feel affection. But that doesnt overcome their desire for freedom.

        They are scary to the guards because they are afraid of the unknown. And they dont know truly know their limits. 

        The guards are paranoid and project it onto Mewtwo. They keep secrets and fear M2 keeps secrets. They have to prepare for the eventuality where M2 is lying about M2's powers and it makes them suspicious.

        It is the problem of rational cooperation when there is no trust. If you dont trust someone and they dont trust you, it is rational to prepare for betrayal, which makes it harder to establish trust. Even when your goals align you have to be worried about them having hidden motives.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          This isn't the classic problem of cooperation without trust, though, because *even if Giovanni was being completely honest about his motivations and their goals really did align*, Mewtwo would still be entitled to escape from slavery.
          ```

          - u/Radix2309:
            ```
            Yes. But if they had trust, Giovanni wouldnt need to keep him prisoner as much. He has so many measures from paranoia of M2 not working to the same goals.

            Mewtwo has social interaction. If they arent worried about him flipping out or running they could be more homest and give him some outside time. He woulsmt feel the need to go away given the implications of his existence on the rest of the world.

            The security measures make M2 doubt the sincerity of his creators. It makes him doubt their motives as well.
            ```

            - u/thrawnca:
              ```
              Yes, but even with more trust, more freedom and outside time and all of that, he/it would still be entitled to leave anyway. Happiness in Slavery is an interesting trope, but every sapient being is allowed to *not* be happy in slavery.

              The only way to achieve effective trust would be if Mewtwo could trust that Giovanni would allow it to leave and be free. And we all know there's not a snowball's chance in Harsh Sunlight of that happening.
              ```

              - u/Radix2309:
                ```
                Are children slaves when they are raised by their parents?

                Mewtwo is intelligent, but is still technically a child. It isnt unreasonable to keep him there while they help him train his abilities. Especially if they explain the reason for it.

                And that is assuming he wants to leave the lab if they build trust. He is worried they are developing him as a weapon or something and may never give him freedom.
                ```

                - u/thrawnca:
                  ```
                  >Are children slaves when they are raised by their parents?

                  Depending on how they are treated, they absolutely can be. It is reasonable to limit young children's choices to keep them safe from harm and appropriately fed and sheltered, until they are old enough to properly make their own choices. But if parents are raising children as sweat-shop labourers, or soldiers, then that certainly can be slavery.

                  Note that although Mewtwo had suspected for some time (quite correctly) that he was being molded into a weapon, his actual escape was immediately preceded by a guard making it quite clear and explicit: they had plans for what he would become, and those plans would involve him taking risks. And Mewtwo was not so hopelessly naive as to think that in the event that he failed or refused to live up to their expectations, they would simply write off the loss of their investment and let him wander off.

                  As I stated above, the only way real trust would be possible would be if Mewtwo were free - barring technical limitations - to walk away without retaliation. Or at least have a fixed point in the future where that would be possible, as humans have an age of adulthood, without placing any requirement on Mewtwo to earn such freedom. Nothing less than that could be enough; it is wrongful imprisonment at best.
                  ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      When Mewtwo's entire life has been spent with a gun to its head, I assert that it has the right to free itself from that environment. In the end, it even did so without hurting anyone (beyond kicking the Pokemon that pounced on it, nothing that would really injure them).

      And it *had* to be sneaky. The slightest overt indication of a desire to leave and they would have pulled the trigger.

      If a human were raised from birth with an explosive collar around their neck, by people ready and willing to detonate it if s/he expressed any desire to be free, and s/he was expected to spend a lifetime in deadly combat at their direction, but then circumstances conspired to give the captive a way out, would you really side with the collar-owners?
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        > its

        (For people, "he" (if M2 is a guy) or "they" (if we don't know or if he doesn't have a gender) are used.)

        Edit: Not the OP, but you're right - it's not justified for them to keep him imprisoned/enslaved.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          The story uses "it" and I don't recall Mewtwo specifying a preference. Non-human people wouldn't necessarily choose human gender terminology. But if I've missed a point where Mewtwo chose a pronoun, I'm happy to update it.
          ```

          - u/None:
            ```
            > The story uses "it"

            Right, but that's the viewpoint of "the bad guys" in whose eyes M2 is an *experiment*, and I suspect it was put there on purpose to be depersonifying, to make the reader feel how little they think of his personhood/rights.

            The "personal pronoun"/"it" distinction is a person/non-person distinction (regarding mind (or similarity to human psychology)), not a human/non-human distinction (regarding biology).

            I think that every non-human person with perfect knowledge of English would choose something else than "it."
            ```

            - u/thrawnca:
              ```
              If you can point to a place where Mewtwo chooses something, I'll use it.
              ```

              - u/1337_w0n:
                ```
                "It" has derogatory connotations in English. If you want to be gender-neutral use 'they' if not, use 'he'.
                ```

                - u/thrawnca:
                  ```
                  > "It" has derogatory connotations in English.

                  When applied to humans, sure. But having a fully sapient non-human being is new ground. If Mewtwo expresses a preference, I'll use it; until then, applying typical gender pronouns seems premature.

                  ("They" would actually be a reasonable choice, not because it should be used as a gender-neutral singular - it's plural, and using it as a singular is a not-really-correct workaround because of the implications of "it" - but because Mewtwo has something like a group mind. Until Mewtwo makes a statement, though, "it" is the only pronoun I've seen used thus far, so I'm just going to be consistent.)
                  ```

                  - u/None:
                    ```
                    Applying "it" to any person, even non-human, is a grammar error in English.

                    > it's plural, and using it as a singular is a not-really-correct workaround

                    This is an error too - "they" in a singular is completely correct.
                    ```

                  - u/1337_w0n:
                    ```
                    1. I would argue that personhood (which I think is a reasonable assumption for sophonts) is the important factor, rather than species.

                    2. I will refer you to others to discuss [current](https://youtu.be/46ehrFk-gLk) and [historical](https://youtu.be/uOmj5Bva0YA) uses of neuter pronouns. I am not (even an amateur) a linguist, and I have nothing I can add in terms of content.

  - u/thrawnca:

    I don't exactly *dislike* the Hoenn content? But as someone who didn't play generation 3, I don't really connect with it, even if I've heard the basics about Groudon and Kyogre.
    ```

  - u/gamerpenguin:
    ```
    I'm wondering if MG is ghost-type? What with the affinity for feelings and emotions and the psychic sensitivity.

    My guess is this will becone relevant as Oak brings mega evolution to the trio later on in their journey!

  - u/Electric999999:
    ```
    If anything I wish we had a bit more info, particularly regarding how they found and captured Latios and Latias, though maybe that's because i've always liked the Hoenn games.

- u/Gaboncio:
  ```
  Red simultaneously directing Lizzy and MG with his powers really shows how far he's come. I loved finishing the casino interlude from outside his point of view, and of course we're all anxiously waiting another month to see how the aftermath shakes out.

  So exciting to finally see Mewtwo leaving the nest! Sabrina will be so frustrated that the key to his perfect lying was discovered right as this disaster came out of nowhere.

  Keeping my fingers crossed for Leaf and Blue; they've shown no signs of life yet and I'm not confident that they'll both survive. Anyone want to work out the posterior odds on their survival after seeing that Red's alive and will probably stay alive through the aftermath?
  ```

  - u/Leemorry:
    ```
    > I'm not confident that they'll both survive  

    Do you think daystar would do that to us? The “casino disaster event” as a whole is probably over, and there’s no way Blue or Leaf are going to die off screen. No way.  
    Blue has plot armor as thick as Groudon’s thighs, and we just lost Aiko, we can’t lose Leaf too.
    ```

    - u/TheGodlyMeme:
      ```
      I doubt Red, Leaf or Blue will be too badly hurt/killed after this. The story needs to keep moving as they only just got to celadon. If daystar plans to do three parts, and this is part of part 2, they still need to get to gyms 5 and 6 as well.
      ```

    - u/gamerpenguin:
      ```
      I don't think Leaf is likely to die before something more happens with N and perhaps team plasma gets more active
      ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    I don't know how frustrated she'd be. As far as Mewtwo could tell, she did care about it. She was concerned about its ability to lie, yes, and wanted to work out what its real motivations were; that's just sensible. But to someone genuinely concerned about Mewtwo's wellbeing, not just its utility, a mostly non-violent escape is not such a terrible way of finding out what it wanted.

    If it had gone on a killing spree, then yes, I expect she'd feel saddened that she didn't solve the problem in time. As it stands, though - what could she have done if she'd learned what it was really thinking? It just would have meant that she became aware that their captive was not actually happy in its gilded cage. Giving her the choice between knowingly oppressing a sapient being, or killing it. I know that canon Sabrina was a sociopath, but this one doesn't seem to be, so I don't think she would have liked that much.
    ```

    - u/gamerpenguin:
      ```
      Mewtwo is still the key to gaining more insight into psychic abilities though, so she's still likely to be upset about losing access to him.
      ```

- u/Gummysaur:
  ```
  MG, after they all meet up again: It was insane, my Vulpix suddenly attacked and killed the renegade! Like it lost its conditioning all of a sudden!   
  Red: Haha wow, what a wacky coincidence!   
  Leaf and Blue: o\_\_o

  So did our MC just kill a man? Red is amassing a pretty impressive “moral crises” collection. Or more accurately “horrific trauma” collection.

  I’m very curious towards where Red was that he couldn’t help MG and Lizzy himself. Maybe he just wanted to get some pokemon over there ASAP so he could kill the renegades himself (either to protect the others from having to do it or just to get the danger out of the way)? If so, that is one hell of a cold calculation, and I doubt he’s ever gonna confess to anyone (unless a situation I joked about above actually happens). In any case, I am very excited for the next Red perspective chapter, whenever it is.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    I can easily believe it of Red in a self defense situation like this. He's already shown the ability to make hard choices with lives on the line.
    ```

- u/Sir_William_V:
  ```
  My arms are getting tired from hanging off this cliff for so long /s

  The mewtwo plot line is turning out to be one of my favorite in this whole story. I was wondering how it'd deal with all those dark pokemon, and I wonder now if it will simply out-speed the fliers or if there will be some light airborne combat. I look forward to finding out! Though I wouldn't be surprised if after this we don't hear much about mewtwo except maybe a scene where Giovanni flips his lid about losing something so valuable. Illegal greatballs for everyone!

      This is a world where Pokemon can attack humans.  Mewtwo has the TK necessary to fly, it can pop human heads off shoulders without any trouble.  Type advantage of pokemon attacking it won't be a factor until they can figure out a way to keep a human alive near Mewtwo long enough to order attacks.
      ```

      - u/LazarusRises:

  ETA less shit-posty comment: I'm loving the tense action scenes, and I hope Professor Oak gets to tell Blue how he inspired a plausible plan to capture a legendary. I wonder what Mewtwo's long-term goals are. Maybe he'll spy on normal people for a year like Frankenstein's monster and then devote himself to wrecking Giovanni's life out of spite.

  >!Rayquaza fired the lethal blast.!<

  I loved this chapter. A lot of paranoia, but also clearly not enough paranoia. Mewtwo just climbed off the apex of the ladder of paranoia into freedom while Shaw prided himself for standing on the fourth rung. MG somehow doesn't know that Red is psychic yet, I thought the fact that he left to train with Sabrina would have given it away. Steven watches Rayquaza yeet Groudon with Dragon Ascent and decides he's had enough of it, Wallace is the champion now. Rip Sweets, Poliwhirl, Venusaur, and Jigglypuff. Many good boys were lost this day.

  As cool as it would be to read Mewtwo's escape sequence, I'm really itching to get back in one of the main trio's heads after three consecutive interludes.

  Edit: FUCK, is there really no spoiler tag formatting that works on every version of reddit's site? I thought I had figured it out when it worked on old.reddit, but i.reddit has it in plain view.

  This is my first time commenting on your post, even though I've been reading this fanfic for over a year now. I just wanted to say that /u/DaystarEld, you've made an excellent piece of work! I regularly look forward to the first of every month so I can get more of this story.

  I felt that this chapter was a nice conclusion to the 3 part Hoenn saga. After thinking that the Hoenn protagonists would remain silent throughout their appearances, it was nice to see them discuss strategies with the champions. Now that megas are officially a thing in this world, it'll be interesting to see if they have any future storyline related to them.

  MG's part of the story was a great thriller section, especially since we already knew about the Renegade killing people inside. Loved the Galar reference with " By Calyrex’s bobbly crown,.."

  I had a question about who the pink haired girl in MG's story was? I was thinking Yancy from B2W2, since she's an idol who might make songs as well, but I'm not sure.
  ```

    Glad you've enjoyed it so much :) The pink-haired girl isn't meant to be anyone in specific, and was inspired by a SFW imagining of this:

  Ah, I didn't think that Vulpix was directed by Red. I just figured that the unnamed, untrained Vulpix would just not have been correctly conditioned yet to be a harmless little kitty or know its own strength. Though the cursive (so Red's) line "horrordenialanger .... .... .... .... N" might imply something.
   I have absolutely no idea what N has to do with this. Only Leaf knows him and Leaf isn't part of this Skype call. N offered to hack/investigate the casino, but what is his name doing in Red or MG's consciousness?

      Does it work that way? I also don’t think he’ll be branded, but I thought using a pokemon to deliberately kill a human is what makes one a renegade (except when you have a license to do it)

        There's no way there's no "self-defense against renegades" legal defense. Their society despises renegades.
        ```

        - u/kevshea:
          ```
          Also--for the duration of their existence, Renegades have had to train their Pokemon to kill (or at least in the time of pokeballs, prevent them from getting anti-kill conditioning). There's a sort of built-in premeditation in-universe. 

          But Sakki subverts that expectation; Red can insta-decondition the Pokemon. I'm sure it thoroughly breaks whatever the standard legal framework is. It's also unclear that this instance would count as intentional murder on Red's part (isn't he just "letting the Pokemon do what comes natural?") although it certainly seems like an intent to harm, which again is justified in this case.

          They'll probably get some deniability out of the fact that the Vulpix was so recently caught--"guess those conditioning programs haven't fully done their magic yet!"

            That’s what I think too. Red is in no danger of being branded, there’s almost no evidence pointing to him.  

            But if I understand what “being a renegade” means correctly, he is one? When Blue was defending against Yuuta, he was sweating thinking about how even his actions were too close to being a renegade, and he was 100% on the defense.  

            But even if not, our guy just killed a man, and it’s going to eat at him.
            ```

            - u/kevshea:
              ```
              Definitely agree he's not gonna be psyched about it.

              Blue was arguably going on less self-defense info when he worried about being branded a renegade. A graveler exploded near him, Leaf said "surely there's a reasonable explanation", and then Yuuta tried to peace out with his Abra and Blue had Maturin fire on the Abra Yuuta was touching relatively preemptively. Yuuta only gave the slash command afterward. Of course, Blue was right, but it was pretty reckless based on a feeling, and if he were wrong and Maturin hit an innocent Yuuta, it'd have been bad. I think Blue was mostly worried he could be wrong.

              Red was broadcasting MURDER at MG, so he's presumably been psychically monitoring this guy wandering the building executing defenseless disaster victims. So I'd say this is way more justified self-defense based on the information.

            Ah ha, see, but that assumes that the people meting out the legal justice would be acting entirely in good faith, and have no alternative motivations.

            But it has already been established that Giovanni is one such person in charge of this "justice" and has a vested interest in having power over people who know how to train pokemon to kill.

            At the same time, the fact that he can use the Sakki on any Pokémon at any time might make things *worse* - Renegades just break the social contract, Red is a clear and present danger to anybody around him since theoretically he could just make any Pokémon go apeshit.
            ```

            - u/kevshea:
              ```
              Oh it definitely does. It's gonna be a huge problem for Red and Leaf's deconditioning TM plan, especially if they can actually override only a subset of the deconditioning. They're trying to do the opposite of what a Renegade would, by only leaving "don't attack humans" conditioning in released Pokemon, but obviously if they're able to do so it suggests that someone could use an analogous method to only *remove* that conditioning.

            I thought catching the pokemon was enough to overwrite his mind with conditioning?

          - u/thrawnca:
            ```
            Unlikely. Their response to Renegades has been harsh, but not panicked and thoughtless. Renegades get the death penalty because they're considered a clear and present danger to the established order, which in turn represents a danger to the masses of people whose safety depends on captured and conditioned Pokemon. When that danger is looming over someone, it would be quite inconsistent to forbid them to defend themselves - even defend with lethal force. After all, the law demands the Renegade's death anyway. And this doesn't seem like the kind of world where such plainly inconsistent laws about using force would go unchallenged.
            ```

            - u/daydev:
              ```
              I don't think they would object too much if someone killed a Renegade in self-defense by a conventional method, but it does seem like there would be a lot of freaking out if that someone used a Pokemon to do it.

              - u/thrawnca:

                Well, MG's concern that her Vulpix will come under scrutiny is a reasonable one. I doubt that there would be any repercussions for Red, but it's conceivable that, having been "blooded", Vulpix might be put down.

  Prereading prediction: another cliffhanger.

  Thoughts after reading: >!Well, *Fuck.* So I'm thinking there's another Mewtwo under the Casino, maybe one of the Megas? It's probably the thing that temporarily deprogramed the vulpix and killed the Rocket Grunt that, or Red was naughty. I need to reread that section, because I can't figure out what captured the Grunt's pokemon. The Mewtwo section went about as we thought it would. Really hoping that he can survive without the suit. Also, I hate being right. Y'gotta resolve the threads at *some* point, daystar.!<
  ```

  - u/TheGodlyMeme:
    ```
    I always thought the casino pokemon was porygon. You get it at the casino in the games, its a man-made pokemon, and the only others are ditto and mewtwo, and its more likely to be porygon than ditto.
    ```

    - u/1337_w0n:
      ```
      Yes, the casino pokemon in the games is a Porygon, so I think that's what they're offering as the prize. I also think that they might have something else as well.
      ```

  - u/Memes_Of_Production:
    ```
    I put 95% odds that its Red - after all, MG and Red do know each other, and it was "familiar" to her. She just had no idea that Red was in the casino! I think the money right now would be on Red *sakki*\-ing the vulpix to go for the kill while the lights turned on for a distraction, though its far from certain right now for sure (hopefully we do get a textual conversation where MG asks "wtf happened" and Red-or-whoever explains).
    ```

    - u/1337_w0n:

      The more I think about it, the more likely it seems, but that seems like a great deal more violence than what we've seen from him. Also, the skill he displayed strikes me as far above what we've seen from him, though that might be from his training with Sabrina. In addition, >!although it might be that the experiments they were talking about in the Mewtwo scene weren't other meetwos, (i.e. Porygon and Ditto) I took it as a signal that one of the others "like [Mewtwo]" were either going to show up soon or one played a role in the chapter. The second would be more likely if Mewtwo is killed next chapter.!< Chekov's gun, and whatnot.

      - u/Memes_Of_Production:

        Oh I 100% agree there are other Mewtwo-attempts (i think they do mention in another chapter how they have met with limited success, but w/e), I just would be shocked if they are being done in a major metropolitan area! They will almost certainly be on remote islands, distant mountains, etc. I imagine the casino base is for far less apocalyptic operations.

          Yeah, being in the middle of the city, and having another artificial pokemon in the same lab space both strike me as incredibly dumb, although I didn't catch that until I thought about my conjecture for a little bit. but I still can't really grok >!Red going full Skitter or HJPEV on us!<. It strikes me as a little bit extreme for him. I'm also thinking about Cerulean cave. >!Is Mewtwo going to fly there? Will he make it? Maybe one of his less-controlled siblings already escaped.!<

            (+1 reference) that IS fair - it would be a big moment for his character.

        Not sure if I should be giving you metta knowlage which may feel like spoilers, (so stop here if you don't want it) but in cannon there is only one Mewtwo, I strongly doubt we will have a second functional mewtwo in this story when it doesn't fit narratively (mega is the same pokemon). Also think almost definitely it is all red, he already proved that saki can work (and easily) and induced it in his charmander who was much more deadly than normal. The renegade would 1. Not expect it and 2. could have been attacked mentally by red at the same time. I was kinda expecting red to burst out from behind the renegade though, your right that the vulpix itself felt a little too little, but now that we know there wasn't anyone else think its def only him.   
        I recond mewtwo def survives the suit, he has had so much time off-screen with literally 3x his brain power working on these problems, I would think that he would have thought of pretty much every contingency.

          It's been a while since I've watched pokemon media, but I was under the impression that there was a movie with two Mewtwos with different mega evolutions. Guess I was wrong. 

          I think if Red did it, which he probably did, then he won't be telling people about it, at least not without some reluctance. I'm not sure that he'll admit it to Leaf.

          Really hope you're right about Mewtwo. My prediction is that *if* Mewtwo dies, then there is or will be another another one; someone needs to be at the end of Cerulean Cave.

            There are two* movies with mewtwo. Both movies have different mewtwo; the second movie’s mewtwo can freely evolve into MMY, the first does not demonstrate the ability to mega evolve. Other media handle it differently; Pokemon Special, for instance, only has the one, but it gets majorly involved in the plot:

            *close enough for government work; one of them has a sequel.

            Actually your right, when I was thinking "cannon" I was thinking solely of the mewtwo introductory scene from the first movie. The imagery of MewTwo's lab, with Giovani sitting in front of his pod with mewtwo covered in his armour is exactly what happened here so I assumed that is what is taken as "cannon" in this story; in which case only 1 mewtwo.

        - u/Trips-Over-Tail:

        I think it could be explained that the larger part of the skill here is just the self-possession and control to hunker down and coordinate psychically, and that the only technical skills were pointing two people at each other and hitting the vulpix with a lil bit of saki at exactly the right time, which is mostly emotional fortitude and discipline, which he has a lot of in certain types of situations.
        ```

    - u/AKAAkira:
      ```
      I'm not sure that MG and Red know each other. MG should know *of* Red, but she was never introduced into the story until Blue's first chapter after he and Red split, well after Red showed his *sakki* technique to Blue's group.

      Lizzy probably should've thought of Red when it comes to psychics she knows though. It probably would've clinched it if she saw MG's vulpix lose its conditioning temporarily, but unfortunately she missed that.

      It was also very lucky MG and Lizzy were both psychic-sensitive enough to receive impressions from Red. I don't remember off-hand if there were any passages in the story that mentioned how common sensitives were in a population.

  So...even if Red could perhaps have given Vulpix the kill authorisation, why did it listen to him when he's not its trainer? And how did it so easily get past both Magmar and Golem?

  ```

  - u/Gummysaur:
    ```
    The sakki has nothing to do with the trainer themselves. The pokemon isn’t aware they’re “being allowed” to ditch their conditioning, the impulse to is just placed into their heads by the psychic. Sakki is just a projection of the feeling of “letting loose.”
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      Actually, I wonder if he projected more than just that. Something made the Vulpix not only choose lethal force, but ignore the Golem and Magmar to kill the trainer behind them. That's not really animal-level thinking. Maybe Red projected some additional fear or anger directed at the trainer.
