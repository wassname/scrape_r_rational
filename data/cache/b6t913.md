  I wonder what Scribe is doing while all this is going down. The woman who runs the best spy operation in Calernia would probably be the best placed to find the Rogue Sorcerer. Not to mention it would be the antithesis of her her character to not try and rescue Black.

    She’s just salivating over the idea that she can get Black’s body away from that hussey Ranger

  I just realized, it's pretty ironic that the Elves fled into Arcadia to avoid Akua's weapon, and then the weapon followed them there.

    Well, if that isn't context to drag the Elves into the main plot...

      Maybe Cat can figure out a way to stickytape herself to an elven nature after she leaves Sve Noc and her powers by the wayside. She does keep moving between sources.

        Well thief had the spell blade of moonlight. . .

  One of the things this series does well, particularly with the Callow vs Procer interactions is showing situations where both sides are acting in their rational self interest, but can't find common ground. Neither side wants to fight but the alternatives break their coalitions

    > situations where both sides are acting in their rational self interest

    Only if you assume an inability to predict the outcomes of each others' actions.

        Augur works for, or is somehow compromised by, the Bard.

        &#x200B;

        Remember that Black's goal and Catherine's goal is a world that doesn't run on stories.

        For Bard, this is apocalyptic and she will do everything to stop them from succeeding (also why she hates ~~Heirophant.)~~  Edit: Heirarch

        &#x200B;

        She'd rather see Procer fall than for it make an amicable peace with a villain.

          What do you mean? Why does she hate Heirophant?
          ```

          - u/Schuano:

            Sorry, I meant the Heirarch

  Well that didn't fucking help, now did it?

  Eh, at least Saint got punched in the face.

    She got Black body for litterally free and knows who has his soul. It does "fucking help".

    She also got information as to why Procer is so adamant against letting them leave.

  > “Make your peace with it,” Princess Rozala said

  So she wants Cat to throw a fight on purpose, lose however many men, all the while hoping she **won't** get backstabbed by a guy who has repeatedly tried to kill her **and** has happily broken promises that were inconvenient to him in the past... after **just** having the other hero try and murder her during parley... and when called out on this, her response is basically 'Get over it'?

  What a pathetic pile of meat.  I begin to see why the Drow call everyone else 'cattle'.

  I guess it'd be too much to hope that *her* crown will be one of the Seven and One?  Because at this point, my sympathy meter for her just pegged zero.

  I personally think Cat would have gotten a lot more mileage out of the "every body made here is one less on the line against the Dead King and potentially one more on his side" tack, especially from Malanza, who was on that front until very recently. IIRC she did bring up a similar line to the princess earlier, but pushing here, especially after Andronike hit that pain point, might have worked in planning the "loss and retreat" farce a little more in Cat's favor. Probably she's right and Pilgrim wouldn't have stood for it, though, and would sic the Levantine more than half of the army on her during a retreat in good order, especially if it was a stalemate instead of an outright loss.

    > I personally think Cat would have gotten a lot more mileage out of the "every body made here is one less on the line against the Dead King and potentially one more on his side" tack

    I don't think she would have gotten anywhere with it. Malanza has to fight or, according to the Augor, Procer pretty much collapses from the inside. They can't fight against the Dead King if they can't function as a coherent organising body.

  >“There was greater need for me elsewhere,” the Grey Pilgrim replied. “Duties whose call was keener than what had been arranged.”

  Pilgrim if "the greater good" is more important than your word, what worth is there to it?
  ```

- u/notagiantdolphin:
  ```
  What was the 'adjustment' Andronike referred to with Rozalla? Something to do with what the first prince is getting up to, or just classic ptsd over the dead?
  ```

  - u/Academic_Jellyfish:
    ```
    PTSD, I believe.
    ```

- u/vimefer:
  ```
  > “That is rather reassuring to me,” the princess said. “Considering he’s one of the most decent men I’ve met.”

  NO HE IS NOT, he's an ugly sociopath with mandate from above.
