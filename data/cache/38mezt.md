## Topics for a panel on rationalist fanfiction?

### Post:

I lucked onto a panel discussing rationalist fanfiction,* in 2 days' time. While there's no guarantee that the audience will be larger than the panel, I would like to get additional input, to ensure we haven't missed anything enormous. 


Questions: 

1. To what extent is rationalist fanfiction a product of Less Wrong style (aspiring) rationalists? Obviously Eliezer Yudkowsky is a major figure, but are there other rationalist communities represented? 

2. The best known works are HPMOR, Metropolitan Man, Friendship is Optimal and Luminosity. What have I missed? 

3. What are the must-read pieces *about* rationalist fiction/fanfiction? (We know EY's article [Explaining Other Universes](http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/other-universes).)

4. What other question should I have asked here, and what is your answer to it? 


 *At [Continuum](http://continuum.org.au/c11/about-continuum/) in Melbourne.

  For sure quote the sidebar to this subreddit, which I think informs a lot of how the genre is defined (for better or worse).

  I'll give my own answers here, so that people can disagree with me.

  > 1\. To what extent is rationalist fanfiction a product of Less Wrong style (aspiring) rationalists? Obviously Eliezer Yudkowsky is a major figure, but are there other rationalist communities represented?

  I actually think that "rational" fanfic taps into a larger idea that's been slowly building over the years, which probably got its start around the time that people could freely discuss fiction in a larger, more connected way via the internet, and the rise of postmodernism. If you look at comic book authors like Alan Moore and Neil Gaiman, I think they're doing things that we might recognize as being adjacent to the rational genre (*Lost Girls* and *League of Extraordinary Gentlemen* are both fanfic in their own right). On the other side of it, I think the rise of authors like Brandon Sanderson (/u/mistborn) shows that there's some real interest in seeing fiction that clearly defines its rules and exploits them (which in turn is part of why places like forums.spacebattle.com, /r/DaystromInstitute, /r/AskScienceFiction , etc. all find purchase). To that extent, it's a marriage of existing thoughts and ideas in a more formalized way.

  > 2\. The best known works are HPMOR, Metropolitan Man, Friendship is Optimal and Luminosity. What have I missed?

  *The Last Ringbearer* is notable as a forerunner, but there's some debate about that one. (It is listed on [the TV Tropes page](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic?from=Main.RationalFiction), for what that's worth.) Sorting /r/rational/top, and limiting to fanfic, I don't think you're missing the "staples". There's some debate to be had about *why* those are staples; part of it is because the stories you've listed were first, and by virtue of being first were able to set some of the tone.

  > 3\. What are the must-read pieces about rationalist fiction/fanfiction?

  There's a relative lack of it. To my knowledge, much of that conversation has happened here, and it's spread out through dozens of discussion threads. There's a real need for someone to write up a handful of blog posts that make an effort to define the genre.

  > 4\. What other question should I have asked here, and what is your answer to it?

  *What's the future of the genre?* That depends mostly on what writers it can attract, and what those writers choose to do. There a definite sense of low-hanging fruit so far as rational fanfic goes; some IPs are easier to translate into the genre than others, by virtue of the hooks that they provide or the questions that they never answer. (The most interesting stuff to me, and what I feel like I don't see enough of, are rational takes on stuff that was never meant to survive cursory scrutiny in the first place; stuff like *Frozen* or Santa Claus.)

    Could you explain why you find that more interesting?

      Fanfic can be divided into two general categories; those that are trying to mimic a work, and those that are trying to enact a transformative process on the work.

      In the first category, the fanfic writer is mostly adding onto what's already there. They're writing an eighth-year continuation of Harry Potter, or they're writing a story that's basically the events of canon from another perspective, or something like that. They're taking a world that already exists, and playing in it. This is all well and good, but the central ethos is, "I like this thing, and I want more of it". I think the majority of fanfic follows this to some extent.

      In the second category, things are actually changing. The writer is trying to take canon and recontextualize it in order to make something new. This doesn't have to be as extreme as making a Disney movie into a singularity fiction; it can be as simple as a character study of Daphne from Scooby-Doo. The main point is that there's a lens being applied to the work that exposes new things about it, and displays previously unseen nooks and crannies (sometimes of the author's own invention, but when it's well done it seems like the things you're being shown were there all along).

      **tl;dr:** So to finally answer your question, the reason that I prefer rational fanfic that has the greatest distance between the original canon and rationality is that I think the work gets more out of it. The illuminating effect is greater, and more previously-unseen surfaces are exposed. If you take a work that's already reasonably rational, you're lessening the impact of that transformation.

        Just to put labels on everything, I think those are basically the definitions of "extended universe" and "altered universe."

      I personally like fanfic that jumps genre boundaries more than fanfic that tries to keep the tone of the original work. Rational takes on Father Christmas, dark sci-fi takes on My Little Pony, comedic takes on Worm... you get the idea.

      It makes smaller differences from the source material less noticeable, so I don't fixate on differences in writing style and inconsistent backstories. This in turn frees up the author to *use* different writing styles and backstories, and to twist the established canon for the sake of a better story. (For example, the Avengers movies change the origin stories of several characters to involve the Tesseract and/or the Infinity Stones, to give those stones impact as more than just McGuffins and make the world more unified.)

      It lets you shed light on oddities or inconsistencies of the source material, either by removing them and seeing the consequences, or by explaining and exploiting them. Recasting the hero as a villain to show the true impact of their actions, for example, or showing the impact a particular technology would have on society.

      It creates new literary territory to explore, particularly the weird halfway-house of elements from the source's genre and the new genre which there would be little reason to think of outside fanfic. It can question conventions, not just of the original story, but of the entire genre it belongs to.

  Any reason not to broaden it from "fanfiction" to "fiction"?  Other things fit under the umbrella that aren't fan work. 

  Aside from the ones you list, Waves Arisen is a good one, as are /u/alexanderwales [other works](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4976703/), touching on subjects such as AI invincibility/self-enhancement and implications of time travel.

    I guess there are lots of rational fiction, but not rational*ist*, which is what this post is about. I agree with Waves Arisen being a great example, but I think it's a pretty awful fic for someone to read first considering it pretty much has an entire chapter talking about the numbers of its magic system in painstaking detail. That might turn some people off the genre. 

    Honestly EY really should start editing HPMOR, especially the first part. It'd be the perfect example if it wasn't for the obvious problems.

      Well *duh*, because "rationalist" is a social clique.  It's "this set of people who hang out on loosely adjacent websites."  It's, [anyone who shows up on this map](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/05/mapmaker-mapmaker-make-me-a-map/), and probably a few more places by now.

      There's nothing *wrong* with being a social clique, but treating ourselves like we have some genre of material defined by whatever the fuck we do among ourselves and con-goers ought to recognize it... is expecting con-goers to recognize our social clique, so it's unlikely to result in more than "What?  Who?".

      At least, IMHO.
      ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I think you have to answer some much simpler questions for the average con-goer:

  * What is this?

  * Why is it fun/why do I care?

  Otherwise, it's basically the funny custom of a tiny social clique on the internet, and at cons, you're *saturated* in those.

  Oh, and for examples, you forgot *Following the Phoenix*.

  Pokemon, Origin of Species is a good example.  You might mention the original story Worm, although it's not rationalist in quite the same way HPMOR is.

  Rationalist or rational?

  Rationalist fiction as a genre dates back to the 50s and works like Van Voght's "Null A" series.

  Rational fiction to me seems to involve applying the rules of "ultra hard" science fiction to fantastic premises. I'd include Randall Garret's "Lord Darcy" series in that realm.

  UPDATE: The panel discussion was cancelled - was actually last night, and there was an audience of zero. (A mix-up meant that two of us on the panel weren't there either, but that doesn't explain the lack of an audience.)

  I hope this topic gets discussed at a future event - and at a better time than 10:30 pm.

  Thank you for all the comments - I found them really interesting, and hopefully they'll be of use to others.

    One of the organisers said "we can try again next year.
    i'll even make sure they don't program you for 10:30pm"

  OMG, can you record this and let us listen to it after?
  ```

  - u/Chriswaterguy:
    ```
    I'll see if that's allowed :).
    ```

- u/Chriswaterguy:
  ```
  CLARIFICATION: 

  The topic is rationalist fanfiction, but we'll certainly touch on original fiction, and talk about rational vs rationalist writing.

  Thanks for all the great comments!

  [Ra](http://qntm.org/ra) isn't fanfiction, but it is probably the best example to add to the collection. [The Fall of Doc Future](http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents) is another good example of rationalist fiction, probably the only story from the 'superpowers' genre I've read that could qualify.

  edit: [Signfiicant Digits](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11174940/1/Significant-Digits) is a HP:MoR continuation fic that has done a good job of retaining the rationality, but has significantly better *flow* (hpmor's weak point is its pacing).
