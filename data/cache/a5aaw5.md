  The early scene with the discussion of sandstorm (and how no one actually uses the move sand storm, instead preferring to use Tyranitar and Hippowdon for their sandstream ability), felt like a nod to a very specific kind of Pokemon player.  In a way, I felt like this was a nod to people like me: people who, at a minimum, try to min/max their way through the Pokemon world, and usually find the world of competitive battling to be the most interesting part of the Pokemon games.  So, if that was your intent (and it sounds like it was), I'd say you succeeded in making this feel like a party that I specifically was invited to.

  Small correction: if the remark about special defense is intended to communicate that a Steelix could use sandstorm to enhance its paltry special defense, I don't believe this bit is accurate according to current Pokemon mechanics; sandstorm increases defense for rock types, but Steelix, being a steel/ground hybrid, is not a rock type (despite evolving from a rock type).  Unless, of course, this is supposed to be our first indication that the battle mechanics present in your story are going to significantly warp what we're familiar with from the Pokemon games.

  That said, an opening that started with discussing game mechanics in this way (using terms like "special defense") made me question whether this was a scene with two boys on earth, discussing the Pokemon video games, or two boys in the Pokemon universe, having a conversation about the creatures that inhabit their world.  Would two people in Kanto really talk about Pokemon in terms of their "special defense" being an attribute that could be boosted by using sandstorm? We get pretty far into the story before we learn that the conversation is taking place in Kanto (specifically, Pallet Town).

  I appreciate that you avoided the thing that some stories do where the opening paragraphs are dedicated to telling us what the characters look like, how old they are, and listing other biographical details, and the way that you brought up Albert's Sevii Island heritage felt really natural.  That being said, we don't really get any indicators of what Albert looks like until pretty far into the chapter, it takes awhile until college is referenced (giving us a pretty good idea of his age) and it's not until 70% of the way through the chapter that Albert's Sevii island heritage is mentioned. I feel like moving this bit of description to the opening paragraphs would have helped to visually anchor Albert's character a bit more, and mentioning his ancestry would have also pretty quickly clarified the fact that this story takes place in the Pokemon universe.  (Putting visual description closer to the top also helps to avoid the issue where readers might form their own mental picture of what Albert looks like and then feel surprised when they discover toward the end of the first chapter that he looks different than they imagined him.)

  The line about Porygon causing seizures made me grin, and it's a subtle reference that doesn't exclude people who don't recognize it (as opposed to the conversation about sand stream near the top, which sort of felt like something very conspicuously written for a certain kind of reader).  I was also amused by the aside about the ghostly woman who terrified an Exeggcute so badly it couldn't evolve.

  Things that intrigued me most: the idea of trainer classes requiring a sort of occupational licensing with a regional association mandating that trainers to adhere to a specific "look" to qualify for membership, a main character who actually respects someone who cares more about aesthetic than competition (not always a given for the protagonist of a ratfic), and several references to smartphones and the internet existing.

  As you might imagine from this list of things I found "intriguing," the conversation with Barbara was a major highlight for me.  I enjoyed the dialog between Albert and Barbara much more than the conversation between Albert and Everette; I wasn't sure whether the Albert and Everette's dialog was supposed to be banter between two friends, or an argument between two rivals.  (There are several points where the word "friend" is used to describe their relationship, but their dialog seemed a little too antagonistic to be mere banter.)

  Technical/grammar issues:

  Viewpoint starts off unclear, as the second sentence is this:

  >He looked with disgust upon the cards I lay at the table before us.

  The pronouns "I" and "us" make it sound like it's going to be a first-person POV, but it quickly becomes a third-person story (and from that point seems to consistently be a third-person story).  Aside from this short departure from viewpoint, it seems to be consistently third-person limited, and I didn't find any other glaring viewpoint errors.  Still, I'd recommend fixing that second sentence, especially since this sentence makes such an early impression (fewer parts of your story will receive more harsh scrutiny from casually-interested readers than the opening paragraph).

  I noticed lots of problems with dialog tags and punctuation.  Like, almost every dialog tag in the story has some small problem with punctuation. e.g.:

  >* "Do you very best with this, young man." He said.

  >* "Steelix is trash" said Everette. 

  >* "You put way too much stock in the Soul Link, my dude." Everette stated as he leaned back into his chair, as if it were his own home.

  I'd recommend looking up a basic explainer on how to use quotation marks for dialog to prevent this kind of small preventable mistake, [here's one that I found with a quick google search](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/quotation-marks-and-dialogue/).  Most of these boil down to just using commas correctly.

  Typos:

  >* However, he couldn't the images of chansey using toxic

  >* tyrannitar

  >* It wasn't complete untrue that skipping Viridian was could him to have to backtrack later

  >* His white lab coat **bounce** as he climbed the steps

  >* A specimen—actually, let's not use **that** words

  >* But **what's** you find especially pertinent

  >* and **Its** exactly what I'm here for as well

  >* The man who first put Pallet Town **as** the map

  >* Albert strode **fourth** from his spot

    Thanks for the feedback. I'll try to hit your points one by one. 

    When I say Special Defense, I am referring to an attribute of the Pokemon. However, and I did a poor job of clarifying this, Specialized Defenses are an actual thing in the Pokemon world I have created. Steelix happens to have adapted far more Physical Defenses (Hard Iron body) and failed to adapt tolerances for various non-physical attacks, such as energy-based projectiles. A raging sandstorm could certainly help defend against energy attacks such as flamethrower or focus blast due to all the debris and rock shards surrounding the Pokemon, who is the epicenter of the Sandstorm. 

    I have envisioned Poke Energy as functioning somewhat similarly in Pokemon as it seems to in the Anime. Moves like Fire Punch involve the manipulation of Fire-Type Energy within one's body (a fist is a, non-specialized structure) and deal Physical Damage because it physically hits the target. Thunderbolt involves the manipulation of Electric-Type Energy within a specialized organ (such as Pikachu's Electric sacs) and deals Specialized Damage because its the Electric-Type Energy which deals the damage, not physical force. In this way, I can see physical and special categories being distinct enough for use. If you disagree, feel free to tell me why. 

    I worried about info-dumping the audience, so I didn't give as much detail as I possibly should have in the beginning.  

    I originally was going to make this story first-person, but apparent I missed the glaring mistake. Thanks for that.

    Apologies for the rampant typos. Perhaps I shouldn't have left my English major. 


    Thanks for the response. It is these kinds of interactions that will hopefully sharpen by writing skills and provide the best possible experience for you, the audience. 

    **EDIT** The Antagonism between Albert and Everette is intentional, as I would like to emulate the more dickish rivalry present in the earlier Pokemon games.

      Differentiating between "special attacks" and "physical attacks" (or "special defense" and "physical defense" is perfectly fine; I just noted the use of "special defense" as sounding particularly video game-y because it appeared at a point in the story where it wasn't quite clear to me whether we were in a world where Pokemon exist, or whether we were just observing two characters talking about a video game, so it kind of threw me.

      I don't think your exposition came across as info-dumpy.  For example, dropping the bit about Albert's skin tone as it contrasted with the other people in the room was a pretty natural way to mention his Sevii Island background.  I'd just try to put these things earlier.

  Here the general summary of what I'm doing with this:

  Pokemon Soul Link is a Pokemon fanfiction about a trainer aiming to be the very best, like no one ever was, but by using the very worst Pokemon the games have to offer. While there is already a Pokemon Fanfic on this site, I wanted to focus on the competitive aspect of the Pokemon world and the implementation of a new technology known as the "Soul Link."

  I almost tried making it into a Rational Nuzlocke LitRPG, but I think that would've been too ambitious. 

  Feel free to respond, give criticism, tell me whether my writing is more broken than a Mega Rayquaza or my pacing is slower than a Snorlax or that my worldbuilding is less rational than...I think you get the point.

    I enjoyed it. Can't really say anything on the writing, other than some typos, until a few chapters are out. 

    Out of curiosity, what is the other story you're talking of?
    ```

    - u/TheGreatEXE:
      ```
      The other story is Pokemon: The Origin of Species by DaystarEld. If you haven't read it, I highly recommend it.

  [Read this, particularly about where commas go with regards to quotation marks.](https://thewritepractice.com/dialogue-tags/)

  As to the actual story content - interesting. Hoping to see more. I don't have the highest opinion on Origin of Species. However, other than it and The Game Of Champions it seems Pokemon as a fandom generally takes a look at Sturgeon's Law (90% of everything is bad) and goes, "those are rookie numbers." So it's nice to see people writing something coherent in the space.

  ```
  Nice start, getting some characterisation in. Does needs another pass to catch some typos though, and feels a little stilted in places with overly formal word choices that don't quite *fit* properly.

  Red being a professor rather than a champion trainer/battler puts me in mind of Origin of Species; curious as to whether that's by conscious inspiration or just a fluke parallel.

  Really liked it, just a few typos I spotted;

  > However, he couldn't the images of chansey using toxic and stalling...

  Should probably have something to bridge it with the next clause in there?

  > His eyes glanced towards the Poke Mart near the entrance of the building and suddenly felt the urge to purchase another milkshake.

  Should be '...and **he** suddenly...'

  > ...what could've birthed those two geniuses, the young me who both set off...

  Should be 'young men'

  > As much as he intellectual understood that fact...

  Should be intellectually.

  > ...to stabilize his heart, feelings the air inflate and delate his lungs...

  Should be 'feeling' and 'deflate'.

  > ...covered in white sheet The smell of fresh tauros meat,

  Should be a full stop in there.

  > "Why're you here to early, ya nerd."

  Should be 'so early', and with a question mark at the end.

  > He kept his eyes towards the ground. a He had a bad habit of starring...

  Shouldn't have the 'a' before the 'He', and 'staring' rather than 'starring'.

  > He paused. The second reason, which I think...

  Needs opening speech marks.

  > "I know what you're all here for, and Its exactly what I'm here for as well,

  'Its' should be 'it's'.

  > "It's a Pokédexes, and the most recent model...

  Should be 'Pokédex'.

  > This device is the latest version of the National Pokédexes,

  Same issue.

  > ...because it feels my heart with too much pride."

  Should be 'fills'.

  > From the burst of light is summoned came a large rectangular table...

  This sentence needs reworking, but the method to do so can be flexible.

  > ...starter Pokemon by Last name in alphabetical order.

  'Last' should be uncapitalised.

  > ...until all your peers have received theirs as well."

  'theirs' should be 'their's'.

  > Albert strode fourth...

  'fourth' should be 'forth', as Albert is first. And striding forth. Words.

  > ...making a slight imitation of her friend's swagger,

  'her' should be 'his'.

  > "Do you very best with this, young man."

  'Do your very best'.

  > Alberto took words with him as he stepped off the platform.

  'Alberto' to 'Albert', 'words' to something else.

  > What you should search for in the one entitled Soul Link.

  'search for is'

  I really enjoyed what I read there, and can't wait to see future chapters!
