  I believe the norm with Wildbow's work is to post it to /r/rational once per arc?
  ```

  - u/ketura:
    ```
    Personally I don't see the reason to keep with that. Practical Guide gets two updates a week, and we're not so clogged with submissions for it to be a problem.
    ```

      Unofficially, if the work has its own, active subreddit where most of the discussion on the work takes place, I would rather that it didn't get posted more than once an arc, mostly because it seems pointless to divide up discussion unless there's an expectation that discussion will be different between subreddits. This is sort of a "who is this for" test that I think about for all posts, which is my own personal opinion for when/why people should post things.

      (The argument about submission volume sort of falls flat for me, because it could be the case that Worm 2 would take up a fair fraction of the front page of the subreddit. This is already the case for a few other serials, which I consider (non-mod hat) problematic.)

      Also, I should mention that we have a worm channel on the Discord if you do want to talk to other people about worm, though I know synchronous communication is not everyone's cup of tea.

        I don't have a problem with synchronous communication in principle, I have a problem with Discord and how difficult it is to make the damnable thing go away when you don't want it.
        ```

          They've actually got some pretty cutting-edge tech to help deal with this frequent issue.

          There's a little x in the upper corner.

          In all seriousness tho, if the app or the executable don't act the way you like, you can access it via the browser, in which case killing it is as simple as closing the tab.  There are however settings within it for fine-tuning what notifications etc you get, if that's what's got your goat.

            Super dumb question - what's discord?
            ```

            - u/ketura:
              ```
              It's a chat program/platform.  It's actually super slick, it's almost a halfway point between IRC and a forum; the chat history goes back as far as you can scroll, includes decent voice chat and recently video chat, and a bunch of subreddits have set up their own servers, [including us here at /r/rational](https://discord.gg/5sutD3W).  In particular the thing that attracts me the most to it is that your IP is not exposed to other parties, unlike Skype and some others, so there's a certain amount of privacy.  

               Try it out in the browser at that link, and if you like it, sign up and download the mobile app/executable of your choice.
              ```

          - u/Frommerman:
            ```
            Closing it wasn't helping when I had it on my computer, it was still giving notifications.
            ```

            - u/ketura:
              ```
              Ah yes.  On windows it *does* do that dumb thing where closing it minimizes to the tray instead of actually closing it.

              You can however turn off desktop notifications:

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      Officially, subreddit policy is that authors not post their own works more than once a week. (It's discouraged for people to repeatedly post works which are not their own in a short time frame, especially if those posts are not getting traction, but that's not actually a rule, because we haven't had to make it one.)
      ```

      - u/sephlington:
        ```
        I would also point out that both chapters have been posted by different users, which would then make any necessary rule even more complicated.
        ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I don't think that's necessarily equivalent---Practical Guide doesn't have its own sub, to the best of my knowledge, so this is the best place to discuss each chapter as it comes out. But if someone on here wants to discuss each chapter of Worm 2 as it comes out, chances are they're already doing so on r/parahumans.
      ```

      - u/ketura:
        ```
        These aren't subforums of the same forum, they're subreddits. It's perfectly fine for a link to be cross-posted to two separate communities if it's relevant to both groups, and in this case I'd say it is.
        ```
