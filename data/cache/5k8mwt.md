  He made a few significant mistakes without thinking enough about the ramifications, but he was a rationalist and also a flawed human, so I like that.

  I felt like the premise was fun, but it wrapped up entirely too quickly and with too few questions answered to feel truly satisfying.

    I think you nailed it. There are a lot of decisions he took where I thought he should have taken at least half an hour to consider, and the end felt way too early (like if The Metropolitain Man's climax had happened right after the Clockwork Bomber arc).

      Yes, and it's also more like if Superman just decided to leave at that point as the resolution because he figured Humanity wasn't worth it. Main character didn't succeed, outside forces just took away his agency.

  My favorite implication is that they left him with an immortal body only killable by total vaporization and no way to modify or end it.
