  It's not exactly what you're asking for, but we already have a list of multiple works in the [wiki of the sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index). That also gives links to the [Monthly Recommendation Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/monthlyrecommendation), which often have the best recommendations upvoted to top comments.

  But the problem is that the sticky would be tough to keep current or adjust with time. HPMOR might be a hugely popular story, but as it finished up years ago perhaps people would be less likely to upvote it compared to a WIP putting out constant updates like Mother of Learning, A Practical Guide to Evil, or Worth the Candle. Similarly, a comment might be made for a WIP early in its run, but later the story changes drastically; if we only allow one comment for each piece of content, what if the poster never comes back to update? 

  For what it's worth, I go looking for new content pretty much by following my own recommendations above; the monthly recommendation thread comes first, then scanning current topics in the sub for anything that looks new or interesting, then checking out the sites mentioned in the wiki (as well as topwebfiction.com, which isn't all rational but usually has stuff I still enjoy).

    I wish the monthly recommendation threads gets changed into weekly or bi-weekly basis. I really want recs for rational movies right now but I have to wait a month to ask. Mods are sticklers/nazis about rec threads not in the monthly thread and if I ask it will get removed instantly.
    ```

      I'd rather they just pin the thread and sort it by most recent. Going back to find recs would get far more annoying if it was weekly or bi-weekly.
      ```

    - u/xamueljones:

      The reason for the removals is because before the monthly threads were introduced, the subreddit was swamped with low-effort posts asking for recs or rational X.

      One way to bypass the restriction is to just ask in the weekly Monday or Friday Threads. The mods don't care too much about what's posted as a top-level comment and there's enough visitors/readers who will comment with recs there.

      [Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6dgpm0/what_movies_would_you_classify_as_rational_or/)
       some [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1t9cqx/are_there_any_movies_or_other_media_pieces_which/) people have made before on movie recs.

      In my experience, those are extremely hard to find.

  Here is a list of everything with more than ~25 upvotes from the last month in order of upvotes:

  Mother of Learning  
  Worth the Candle  
  A Practical Guide to Evil  
  Pokemon: The Origin of Species  
  Dragonize (only one chapter so far)  
  The Good Student  
  The Optimized Wish Project (only four chapters so far)  
  A Heroâ€™s War  

  Of course this list is missing completed works like Worm, Unsong, Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality and works with their own subreddit communities like HPMOR spin offs and more of WildBow's works and community fanfiction like Pact, Twig, and Ward(aka Worm 2).

  It's also missing stories that update sporadically like Friendship is Optimal.

    Dragonize has another chapter that wasn't posted to this sub.

    - u/Dismalward:
      ```
      I feel like anything under 10 chapters don't really count
      ```

    - u/Dhampire:
      ```
      Dragonize has a third chapter at the bottom of the second page.
      ```

  - u/Lightwavers:
    ```
    Dragonize has three chapters.

    The main Friendship is Optimal story finished years ago. There are a bunch of excellent canon compliant and non-compliant sidestories out too.

  Are you going to curate it?
