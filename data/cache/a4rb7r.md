  The way Nic is dealing with Simole and Dizzy is masterful and honestly, a little bit scary. His manipulations are reminiscent of the Ranvarian alliances with other nations. Roke alludes this is what the demons are doing too which doesn't really mesh with what we've seen from them so far. They could've destroyed humans from the very beginning so I think fusing in order to grow is still their primary goal.

  On the topic of Nic, I think he's doing a lot of projecting here. He believes Simole and Dizzy see him as a container for Winnum Roke or some key in a grand plan because that's the way he sees them. Not entirely, of course, but a large part of how he considers each of them is in terms of what they can do and what knowledge he can extract from them.

    I wouldnÂ´t say masterful. He is a very rational person but he does have feelings and how Simole and Dizzy are treating him hurts. He likes them and does want to be liked by them but due to circumstances everyone is going "you are disposable" to each other.

  The mention of that charade and his cheerful driving of suspicions in 'the wrong direction' makes me wonder if he somehow merged with Winnum Roke or something else. If Roke, it's just her fleeting shadow in his mind as she's slowly absorbed. If something else, he's in no danger. Assuming he isn't possessed by something already .

    I'm also not entirely clear on what that's supposed to imply. After all the Winnum Roke equivocation this chapter I'm not entirely sure what the situation is in regards to her.

    Although weirdly enough it was strange seeing a few of my issues addressed the 1-2 chapters later after I mentioned them. (His character development and his fascination with Dizzy) Addressed, not resolved, but whatever.
    ```

      I think that's the point - only that it implies something without the exposition. At some point there's a gotcha moment.

      And while we saw character growth last book it was necessarily stunted by circumstances. It's interesting seeing it stretch out now.
