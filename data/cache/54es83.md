## [Q] Where do you discover new fiction?

### Post:

Hi, guys! I'm assuming that people here are avid readers of online fiction, so I wanted to ask - where do you usually find new cool stories to read? (other than /r/rational, obviously). 

Are there any other good websites or subreddits where I can find cool stuff to read?

  In terms of published fiction, I like /r/printsf a lot. /r/fantasy is.... not exactly bad, but not as good or focused as /r/printsf in a lot of ways.

  For fanfiction and other purely online stuff, I quite like [Spacebattles Creative Writing forum](https://forums.spacebattles.com/forums/creative-writing.18/) and the [Sufficient Velocity user fiction forum](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/forums/user-fiction.2/). SB and SV tend to be taken over by fads periodically, right now we're in the middle of The Worm Fanfiction Fad which has been going on longer/stronger than most other fads ever have, so if you like Worm fanfics it's great but otherwise not so much. Previously they've had similar periods with e.g. things like Familiar of Zero. Spacebattles also has fairly good discussion forums for various types of fanfiction posted elsewhere in it's [index subforum](https://forums.spacebattles.com/forums/the-index.63/), which hosts among other things [a general recommendation thread](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/general-recommendation-thread-13.295360/). The general thread has a potpourri of recommendations, while major fandoms tend to have their own discussion threads.

  If I find a fanfiction.net or AO3 author who I like, I will check their favourites lists. This is a tentative thing because many authors who write things I like have completely different tastes than me, but it can be helpful sometimes.

    I've been checking out /r/printsf for the last couple days; they seem like they have good taste and I've already found some nice leads. 

    Thanks for the tip.

  For fanfiction I look at TV Tropes Fanfic Recs pages, and usually only check out the ones with more than one user recommending. For ebooks I subscribe to BookBub to let me know about sales and special offers for what I'm interested in, then look at the reviews on Amazon.

  For web serials, when I feel I've got room for following one more, I check what's high on [Top Web Fiction](http://topwebfiction.com/), read the fist few chapters and see if it's for me.

  Try going to r/noveltranslations and reading Chinese fiction it's great I recommend starting with I shall seal the heavens or desolate era both great novels

  /r/narutofanfiction, /r/wormfanfic and /r/hpfanfiction are all moderately active and have various recommendation threads, plus you can ask for specific styles of story. I use /r/narutofanfiction a lot, and there's also a rec list on the wiki there, likewise for Worm. I think the HP subreddit recently started their own wiki rec list too. /r/fanfiction isn't as good a source as you might think, because most of the discussion is either about writing rather than reading stories or about fanfiction for a small enough setting that you won't have heard of it (at least, that's been my experience).
